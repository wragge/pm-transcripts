RADIO INTERVIZEW GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR HAROLD HOLT,<br />
AT PAR LIAMENT HOU FF, CANBERRA. 6TH OCTOBER. 1966.<br />
MR HOLT: It gives me particular pleasure to be able to announce<br />
that President Johnson has found it possible to pay a visit to Australia<br />
en route to the Conference at Manila. As you will know, I have been<br />
pressing President Johnson ever since I saw him in Washington earlier<br />
in the year to make a visit to Australia, and when I found that he would be<br />
in thiis general neighbourhood for the Manila Conference, I pressed that<br />
invitation again, and it is very gratifying to find that he has been able<br />
to make the arrangements necessary to visit this country. I amn sure there<br />
will be value from the visit and in a sense it is quite an historic visit in th~ at<br />
it will be the first visit made by an American President dur.! ig his period -of<br />
office. Here, already, we have a good dividerdout of the Manila Conference.<br />
It was the fact of the Conference which has brought him to this area, and<br />
being in the area, he is making it possible for himself to see something of<br />
the countries in which he finds a growing American interest.<br />
Q. Sir, can you tell us the cities he may visit while he is here<br />
in the country?<br />
MR HOLT: I understand that in Australia he will hope to visit<br />
Melbourne where he spent so many happy hours in war-time during his<br />
service out in the Pacific. He would certainly be expected to pay a visit to<br />
Sydney, and of course we would plan for an official visit to Canberra where<br />
I hope an appropriate Parliamentary occasion would be staged.<br />
Q Can you tell. us the dates, please Prime Minister?<br />
MR HOLT: It is planned that he will arrive here on the 20th and<br />
leave on the evening of the 22nd. </p>
