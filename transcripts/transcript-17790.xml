The Gillard Government will be making a donation of $25,000 to Australia's Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) to commemorate the wedding of Royal couple Prince William and Catherine Middleton on behalf of the people of Australia.</p>
<p>The gift was decided following a request from the happy couple to donate to one of their nominated charities instead of a wedding gift.</p>
<p>The Royal Flying Doctor Service has had the longstanding support of the Royal Family for many decades and we are extremely pleased to be able to add to this support through this gift.</p>
<p>It is a very generous gesture for the happy couple to ask for donations that will go directly to helping out Australians when they need it most.</p>
<p>Prince William visited the Royal Flying Doctor base in Cairns during his most recent visit to Australia so he knows firsthand just how important their service is to our nation  -  particularly for those living in regional Australia.</p>
<p>We would encourage anyone who wants to contribute to the wedding to consider donating to the RFDS.</p>
<p>To donate, people can go to <a href="http://www.royalweddingcharityfund.org">www.royalweddingcharityfund.org</a> or visit <a href="http://www.flyingdoctor.org.au">www.flyingdoctor.org.au</a>. </p>
