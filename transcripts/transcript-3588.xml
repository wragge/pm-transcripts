Å“ y ,94f^^/^ fl<br />
M, t Good oing Mr. Prime Minister.<br />
P. M. i Good morning Mr. Mirkovio.<br />
M. s I am very happy that you have found time to say a few words for our<br />
television. I know you are very occupied with the problem of the cyclone<br />
which is disastrous.<br />
P Oh yes, this is the worst natural disaster that has happened to<br />
Australia. It is, in our terms, it is what happened to Skopje a few years<br />
ago. 14. The people, let us say scientists, have found how to go to the moon<br />
but still on earth many problems have to be solved.<br />
P. M. I The disastemto which mankinjwas subject before any sciontific<br />
discoveries were made are still there to beset mankind.<br />
M. I We have first to solve problems here on earth.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, 205 years ago James cook came to Australia with the<br />
Ship Endeavour' the Australian Prime Minister has not been to Europe for<br />
years. Aftor 15 years you are one of the first Australian Prime<br />
Ministers who have come to Europe. That means that you are somehow the<br />
Australian ship to travel to Europe.<br />
P. M. i You are suggesting that an Australian Prime Minister is now setting<br />
out to discover Europe. You put it in a very romantic, poetic way. It is<br />
true that no Australian Prime Minister has officially visited the Contient<br />
of Europe for about 15 years but in that time most Australian Prime<br />
Ministers visited England. The significance of my visit is that I am<br />
visiting a very great number of countries in Europe.<br />
M. i I saw in some English newspapers that the British were a little, how<br />
to say, not very satisfied that the Australian Prime Minister first went<br />
to Brussels and not to London, maybe because Brussels is now a very<br />
important economic centre of Europe. Is it so </p>
<p>-2-<br />
P I It is symbolic and significant that I made my first call in Europe<br />
in Brussels which is the capital of the European Economic Community. In<br />
frevious years this would have been unthinkable. Any Australian Prime<br />
Minister would have made his first visit to London and in fact probably<br />
would not have visited Brussels at all. It is significant now of course<br />
to us that Britain is part of the Community and accordingly you should<br />
visit the capital of the Community first and so that is what I did.<br />
M. i I see. Does it, for you as an Australian country whose econwny has<br />
been blooming for many years, and with today's political situation in<br />
Europe a little bit gloomy with inflation and unemployment and everything,<br />
seem to you pessimistic.<br />
P. M. a These two scourges of unemployment and inflation, which are afflicting<br />
Wpstern Europe now and of course Northern America are also afflicting the<br />
countries of that type of political or economic system in our region, for<br />
0 instance Japan and Australia and New Zealand are also afflicted by unemployment<br />
and inflation. In each case we are worse affected than for 40 years and that<br />
is the case of unemployment; and this is the case of all these mixed<br />
economies, those western style economies! Australia is being affected the<br />
same way as those other countries and it is very important that I should<br />
exchange views with the leaders of the Governments in those other countries<br />
about how they are tackling these two problems which are affeoting us at the<br />
one tivae and all of us together. -t<br />
M. I Somebody told me that Australia lived for many years in isolation. I<br />
do not know whether you like such a kind of# how do you say, of describing<br />
the problem, may I say so<br />
P. M. t It is a correct description, I suppose, in two ways. Until 25 years<br />
ago, or les than 30 years ago, every country near Australia was ruled from<br />
Europe. The United Statesruled the Philippines, France ruled Indo-China,<br />
the Dutch ruled Indonesia, the British ruled Bnrmaq Indiap Pakistan and Sri<br />
Lanka, and the French ruled several islands in the ' outh Pacific, and<br />
Portugal still has two small oolonies, and then all the ports of China were<br />
ruled by Japan or by European countries and the only countries in the whole<br />
of our region which ruled themselves were Japan, which ruled herself 0./ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
completely, she was already a great power, and Thailand, although thee<br />
were some limitations on the application of Thai laws to Europeans.<br />
So that meant that in Australia the only other Governments which people<br />
ever had to bear in mind wee Governoenta in Eurapel in the case of the<br />
Philippines in Washington, and then there was Japan. Japan was the only<br />
significant Asian country. All our neighbours we" ruled from Europe and<br />
if Australians travelled from Australia to England they would call at<br />
ports or airports which were ruled by Britain.<br />
M. The situation is completely changed which evidently<br />
P. M. s In less than 30 years the position has completely changed. Also<br />
until much more recently in foreign affairs Australia followed the lead<br />
given by Britain and iore recently by the United States.<br />
M. i So this is the reason why your Government is very much engaged in<br />
Asian affairs, may I say, to make this region more stable and to have<br />
friendly relations with these countries. One would think you should have<br />
donefor instance, recognized the People's Republic of China, withdrawn<br />
your troops from Vietnam which, if I may say sot represented the kind of<br />
important steps towards good friendship with Asian countries.<br />
P I There was a great deal of leeway to be made up. It was neoessary<br />
for Australia to have normal relations with all her neighbours and-my<br />
Governmont has now established diplomatic relations with every country<br />
in Asia, every country, and, at the same time, we have established<br />
diplomatic relations with all the countries in Europe, with which we did<br />
not have relations. There is only one country in Europe with which we do<br />
not have diplomatic relations, and we have diplomatic relations with every<br />
country in Asia. We are not categorizing nations as to those that are<br />
favourable or unfavourable, the goodies, the badies, we want to have normal<br />
diplomatic relations with every country with which we would have dealings.<br />
M. Now normally comes the question of non-alignment. On Aginn soil may<br />
I say, somehow, the roots of non-aligmaht are the deepest if you start from<br />
Bandung Conference, the Conference in the role of India$ Indonesia and<br />
other countries which are in that region. Your country and your Governent<br />
express the wish to collaborate, to approach non-aligment. What does it<br />
mean 7 What does it mean exactly What is your attitude towards non-.0/ 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
alignment as a political and eoonomio movement# may I say<br />
P. M. Australia is not a non-aligned country herself. There is an<br />
alliance, there has been since the last war, between Australia, New<br />
Zealand and the United States. The initials, the acronym ANZUS| but<br />
very clearly the matters which concern all our neighbours, the whole of<br />
our region are matters which are identified with the non-aligned movement.<br />
The question of developing economies, colonialism, racism, the confrontation<br />
between great powers in our region, all these are matters which are involved<br />
in a non-aligned movement and accordingly if Australia is to have a proper<br />
understanding of Australia, then Australia must be aware of the objectives,<br />
the preocoupationsp the aspirations of the non-aligned countrieos.<br />
S Accordingly, we would be very happy in Australia if we were to be accepted<br />
as guests or observers at non--aligned meetings.<br />
M. I If I understand you well does it specifically mean non-alignment<br />
0 in your case, particularly in Asia, somehow to say " Go out big powers from<br />
this region", somehow to leave the peoples of this region to arrange their<br />
affairs by themselves.<br />
P i We do not want any escalation of military installations or operations<br />
in the Indian Ocean.<br />
M. s This is @ at Aleast<br />
P. M. i We do not want a confrontation to be promoted between the Soviet<br />
Union and the United States in the Indian Ocean.<br />
M. i So, one of the very important points of the non-aligned countries is<br />
concerned with ran materials. This, may I say, redistribution of goods. Your<br />
country is one of the biggest world exporters of certain very important<br />
raw materials. Do you intend to join this movement for redistribution, may<br />
I say so, or more equalitarian, may I say, prices on the world market with<br />
non-aligned countries.<br />
P. M. i We, of course, do export a very great variety of mineral and primary<br />
products and we therefore sympathize with the situation of so many<br />
developing countries which export some of those products but not the same </p>
<p>variety as we exportl and we are very much aware that they want to have<br />
a stable market for their eporte and of course we want to have a stable<br />
market fo our exports as well. It is completely unsatisfactory where<br />
conditions can be changed without our being involved. The best thing of<br />
course ip to have some arrangements between the producers and the consumers<br />
and in the past the advantaes have bean too much with the consumers. Th4v<br />
have been able to pick off the producers one by one and the consumers very<br />
often have been themselves exporters of manufactured goods or the providers<br />
of services and as rantfaoturers or as entrepreneurs they have had no<br />
compunction to put up the price of their products or their services and<br />
they have been very much more reluctant to adjust thhrices of the goods<br />
upon which they depend on other countries I the primary products, the<br />
mineral products. So our objective would be to get the producers and the<br />
consumers making a prbper marketing agreement, trade agreement between them<br />
for the space of some years. We have Joined, for instance, the International<br />
Bauxite Agreement where ) hgoslavia and Australia each have considerable<br />
izuterests. We have consulted concerning the formation of APEF, the<br />
organization for exporters of iron ore but no agreement, no association<br />
has yet been formed there.<br />
M. i Concerning the Australian-Yugoslav relations, you were two years ago<br />
in Yugoslavia, a few years ago<br />
P. M. 3 3 years<br />
M. v and you know Yugoslavia. Wen you mention Yugoslavia to an ordinary<br />
Australian, you ] mow, the voter, what kind of country does it ( Yugoslavia)<br />
represent<br />
P. M. i The main thin the Australian think about when the word Yugoslavia<br />
is mentioned is the considerable number of migrants, very sturdy migrants,<br />
who have come from Yugoslavia, I think I would be correct in saying that<br />
physically the mot powerful migrants who have come to Australia have come<br />
from the Coast and the mountains of Yugoslavia. There are other people,<br />
older people, who would remember that during the First World War and the<br />
Second World War the heroism of the people of Yugoslavia, and at one time<br />
of course Yugoslavia was the only country in the whole of Europe which was<br />
fighting Hitler and Mussolini and Yugoslavia was the only ally that / 6 </p>
<p>Australia had in the whole of Europe. Now that is over 30 years agog now, but<br />
there would be people iho would remember and value this association and of<br />
6ourse earlier still in 1914p Australians remember how staunch the Serbs<br />
were.<br />
M. m During the Second World War you were enlisted in the Air Force, you<br />
were of this generation<br />
P. M. i Yea, Flight Lieutenant Captain.<br />
M. i Oh yes, important<br />
P. M. 1 ( jokingly) Very important, so important to<br />
M. a Concerning the politiCal and economical relations, what more could be<br />
done for the development of Yugoslav Australian relations. What more could<br />
be done<br />
P. M. s Well this is the sort of thing that I want to be discussing when<br />
I am in Yugoslavia. I am accompanied by the Head of the Australian Department<br />
of Overseas Trade and by the Head of the Australian Department for minerals<br />
and energy, and there are also of course very senior officials from our<br />
Foreign Office, and 3o ong so these are matters which I will be very pleased<br />
to disciss because your Prime Minister was in Australia 21 months ago so<br />
we will pursue these matters.<br />
M. a You think we could increase our trade in exporting more to Australia<br />
because<br />
P. M. i Well, I think this is quite likely but I do not know enough about<br />
what you could supply or what we could supply. Now it is one of the advantages<br />
of visiting a country, it is a visit by a Head of Government to another<br />
country, everybody's mind are concentrated on the community of interests<br />
between those two countries.<br />
M. t To say on the very spot how the things could be done.<br />
P. M. Yes, that is right. 0 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
M. i Mr. Prime Minister, maybe I should ask you much a question. I know<br />
you have won twice on elections but the Opposition is very strong still in<br />
States, in the Senate too. They are somehow accusing you of driving too<br />
leftp is it true that you are driving Australia apart<br />
P. M. i Oh, we have made a very great rnumber of changes in Australia, that<br />
is true. These changes would have caused no surprise in most countries.<br />
Australia had the one Government for 23 years, an extraordinary long period.<br />
We have the seame system of Government that one has, say, in West Germany,<br />
or in Britain, or in the United States, and it is quite exceptional to<br />
have a Prime Minister, or a President, or a Bundee Chancellor belonging<br />
to the one party for 23 years. So, naturally, the changes had to be made and<br />
they would surprise many people, But we have quite a good majority in the<br />
House of Representatives, in the Senate; because of our particular method<br />
of electing the Senate, it is evenly divided and this means that very often<br />
bills do not get through the Senate because they can only be carried if there<br />
is a majority. And, if there is a vote, an even vote, a tied vote, they are<br />
not carried, so that is where the difficulty lies and there are also<br />
You mentioned the States too, we have a federal system and federal systems<br />
are very difficult to operate, as you know in Yugoslavia, ca people know<br />
in the United btates or Canada or WVest Gernany. In Australia in particular<br />
the States' Parliaments are not elected on a democratic system.<br />
M. 1 As this interview is going to be on the air the day before your visit,<br />
the Yugoslav TV audience, the man watching your interview, I am going to<br />
S make a fault,-might say, here is an EnJsiohnan from the South, an Englishman<br />
S from the outhern Hemisphere.<br />
P. M. Oh well, Australia was founded by Englishmen, that is true, but<br />
there... most Australians were born in Australia. Three quarters of the<br />
people there were born int Australia, the other quarter would have migrated<br />
to Australia since the last war from Britain and from most countries of<br />
LEurope.<br />
M. From Yugoslavia.<br />
P. M. t Yes. In recent years moat of the migrants to Australia have come from<br />
Italy and Malta and Yugoslavia and Greece increasingly. So anybody from / 8 </p>
<p>8<br />
Yugoslavia would be able to find a great number of people with a common<br />
baokground on common interests in Australia. But they would tell you<br />
. that it is very easy to fit in in Australia; there is no segregation.<br />
M. i About Australia, what is an Australian<br />
P. M. t Ah well, we were founded from Britain but that is last century and<br />
nowadays I would think that people from Yugoslavia or from Europe would<br />
regard Australians more like Canadians or Americans, or at least as much<br />
like Canadians and Americans as like British people and there is a very<br />
great number of people from Europe now living in Australia, and the climate<br />
is much warmer, it make. for a muah more informal style of life*<br />
Mo So it makes somehow, how to say, a warmer hearted people.<br />
P. M. t Yes, we are informal, friendly, relaxed people.<br />
M. i I know that you have a lot of things to do. Thank you very much<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, really you were very kind.<br />
P. M. s I have enjoyed talking to you and I am looking forward to doing so<br />
in your own country.<br />
M. s Thank you very much. </p>
