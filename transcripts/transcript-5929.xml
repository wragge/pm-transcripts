FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 6 OCTOBER 1982<br />
ANNOUNCEMENT OF VISIT BY THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS OF WALES<br />
The Prince and Princess of Wales will visit Austral. ia in<br />
March and April next year.<br />
All further dates and details will be announced later.<br />
Wie shall give the Prince and Princess of Wales a warm and<br />
affectionate welcome when they come next year.<br />
This will be the f irst visit since the Royal Wedding and<br />
all Austalians will be glad to see them and show them<br />
together more of Australia than they have so far been able<br />
to see.<br />
I am pleased that the announcement is being made while<br />
Her Majesty herself is with us.<br />
While we cannot stage a Commonwealth Games for every Royal.<br />
visitor, we can certainly provide a program for the Prince<br />
and Princess that will be full of interest.<br />
The Government will be in touch with B~ uckingham Palace and<br />
an announcement will be made in due course.<br />
I hope it will be possible for the Prince and Princess to<br />
travel widely while they are here. </p>
