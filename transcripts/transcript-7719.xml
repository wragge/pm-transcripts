TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, ABC STUDIO, MELBOURNE 21 AUGUST<br />
1989 3 OS0 PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: the Opposition leader got through the<br />
dress rehearsal for an election. Are we seeing the same<br />
sort of thin? from you now, I mean with your interviews<br />
today, television<br />
PM: Remember there was a Budget last week? we made<br />
arrangements that we would be out selling the Budget: the<br />
week after. That's what I'm doing. I must say the Budget<br />
has gone over so well and been so broadly accepted that John<br />
didn't to want to ask any questions about that. but<br />
that's really what this is about. we made the decision that<br />
we'd spend the week afterwards selling the Budget. That's<br />
what ths in about.<br />
JOURNALIST: Senator Ray has said overnizht that it could be<br />
as early as November because the Opposition has nothing<br />
going for it at this time. You seemed to reinforce that<br />
view about the opposition's policies in there.<br />
Pu: I didn't say anything about dates. Senator Ray is not<br />
saying anything that I haven't been sa ing ver vigorously<br />
for come time. about the condition of t 9e Oiosytion. Just<br />
look objectively at it. We've had a si tua on where just<br />
relatively a few weeks-ago both of the Opposition parties<br />
threw out their leader., Mr Howard and Mr Sinclair. They've<br />
thrown them out. Why? in the case of Mr Peacock because<br />
they thought he had substantial new policies? No. Because<br />
they thought he might be able to sel the opposition a bit<br />
better. In the case of Mr Sinclair, well why? I mean they<br />
just got rid of him, Now what's happening is you've got Mr<br />
Sinclair aying what? That the opposition is not fit to<br />
govern. well, this is just proving what I've been saying<br />
for a long time. All they are about is power. They've got<br />
no policies. Mr Blunt is saying they won't really produce<br />
their policies until I announce the election. Great stuff.<br />
No policies,' no principles, no leadership. That's nothing<br />
new but it's not going to send me racing into an election.<br />
JOURNALIST: You haven't had to do much selling in terms of<br />
the Budget. so have you been testing the waters in terms of<br />
an election, testing opinion? </p>
<p>PM: No. why don't you listen to the answer I've given. I<br />
said before the Budget was brought down we'd made<br />
arrangements to go out and have this period selling it.<br />
That was an arrangement that was made. it's sensible and it<br />
just ha ppens to be the case that it is such a good Budget<br />
and so broadly received that when I come on these proqrams<br />
it seems to be taken for granted that it's a great Budget<br />
and they'd rather talk about other things. That suits me.<br />
JOURNALIST: mr Hawke, the legal action against pilots. How<br />
soon would you expect that to happen after the 4 o'clock<br />
deadline? PM: Well I think that wouldhappen quite quickly. But let<br />
me say, I repeat Heather that we want them to stay in the<br />
system. I don't want any interpretation of my indication of<br />
the tough action that's there if they don't stay in to say<br />
that'. what I want to happen. I want them to stay in and to<br />
be part of the system and stop going on with this idea that<br />
because they', re up there flying aeroplanes that somehow<br />
they're not only above the earth but they're above everyone<br />
else. They are not. They are people who have a skill which<br />
is nothing which uniquely puts them apart from anyone<br />
in terms of their training. If you look at tradespersons,<br />
tradespersons have in a sense longer, tougher training than<br />
learning to fly an aeroplane. The are already ver" r well<br />
rewarded for working at the stickea ss than ten hour. a<br />
week. Now it's about time they sort of in terms of<br />
themselves came down to earth and realised that they are not<br />
going to glorify themselves above the rest of the wage and<br />
salary earner. of this country.<br />
ends </p>
