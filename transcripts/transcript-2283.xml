" THIS DAY TONIGHrT"<br />
TELEVI SION INTERVIEW GIVEN BY THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER ON ABC TELEVISION NETWORK<br />
Interviewer Philip Koch 113 SEPTEMBER 1970<br />
Q. Prime Minister, your decision. last night has been roundly applauded<br />
but there is criticism that while you have protected an Australian company from<br />
any possible foreign takeover, you have not laid down a policy to embrace all<br />
minerals and developments. How do you answer this?<br />
P. M. Well, I would first of all repeat what I said in the statement of<br />
Government policy on the 16 September last year that's a year ago if I<br />
can quote our objectives:<br />
" As we see it, the central aim of policy must be to provide<br />
on terms which are fair, as between overseas investors and<br />
the Australian people, the conditions under which investment<br />
will be attracted here. But we do not believe that we can or<br />
should seek to legislate in such a complex field."<br />
Now you have suggested one might lay down policy to apply to all minerals and<br />
all developments. I don't think anybody could lay down such a p-olicy. don't<br />
think they should, and I think if they tried to, they would find so much variety,<br />
so many different circumstances that they would be seeking to apply a completely<br />
inflexible policy to a whole series of problems all of which vary the one from<br />
the other.<br />
Q. Could I ask you about one circumstance that could arise in that it<br />
could have been just as easy for a foreigner, an overseas compay to have found<br />
this particular uranium strike, reportedly the richest in the world. Now if<br />
that had happened, what would you have done?<br />
P. M. Well, we would have not in any way have interfered with the company<br />
which had such a discovery any more than we interfered with ESSO-BHP when<br />
they discovered oil. Because we think that if overseas investors -risk their<br />
capital here preferably in conjunction with Australians but if they risk it,<br />
then they are entitled to the rewards for the risks that they have taken. B-t<br />
this is quite a different concept you are approaching here. We are not seeking<br />
to protect this particular discovery in order to prevent profits going out of<br />
Australia, or something of that kind. After all, we get half of the profitc from<br />
any discovery. But this is not the point. The point is that if this field is, as<br />
it is claimed to be, the richest in the world, and so much richer taQn aliy other<br />
field, then overseas people, theoretically, havbig uranium interests ailroad,<br />
could buy up shares and control this field and not put it into operation 2 </p>
<p>because by putting it into operation and by selling it at the price at which it could<br />
be sold, they could damage their own overseas investments. Now this is<br />
clearly quite a possibility. Also if it is as rich as it is claimed to be, then<br />
consumer countries seeking uranium might well be tempted to seek to buy shares<br />
to control the company and sell to themselves at a very low price the uranium<br />
which can be produced here at such a low price. So it is really designed to see<br />
that this is used for the greatest benefit of Australia that we have taken this<br />
action. But I do want to say one thing. I don't endorse the claims for the<br />
richness of this field. But claims have been made and I think we need to take<br />
notice of them.<br />
Q. But you would agree, Prime Minister, that it is very fortunate that it<br />
has been found by an Australian company?<br />
P. M. Very fortunate.<br />
Q. Could I ask you why there are differences in the amounts of foreign<br />
holdings allowed in Australian companies following your announcement last<br />
night. Now, in the case of uranium depositr, you propose to legislate for<br />
a maximum 15 per cent holding. Now under the M. L. C. legislation, the<br />
maximum foreign holding was set at 40 per cent, and under the BroadcaDting<br />
and Television Act, foreign shareholding was limited to 20 per cent. Now<br />
why are there these gradings?<br />
P. M. Well, I can't tell you why the Broadcasting Control Act which was<br />
brought in in 1942 or something of that kind was set at 20 per ce:. t. It must<br />
have been considered at the time that 20 per cent wasn't a controlling<br />
interest, I suppose. But I don't know. It's a long time ago. In the case o the<br />
M. L. it was set, as you say, at 40 per cent, and 21 per cent in the hands<br />
of any one individual owner. Now this was set because at the time at which<br />
we acted, that was the shareholding which overseas interests had acquired, and<br />
it didn't seem right or proper to move in an divest them of shares which they<br />
had bought in good faith. So we took the level at which it existed and said that<br />
level cannot be increased, and indeed, if in the future a foreign shareholder<br />
sells shares to another foreign shareholder, those shares will lose their voting<br />
right. That was why it was set at 40 per cent because that was the holdings<br />
which overseas people had bought in good faith. We have now moved to<br />
per cent in line with the guidelines for company takeovers which I<br />
announced in the House last year, a year ago, in which we said, amongst a<br />
number of other things, about first-come-first-served offers and so on, that<br />
control would be regarded as 15 per cent of a company's shares rather than<br />
the 33-1 3 per cent which had previously been considered to be control. That<br />
was announced a year ago. 3 </p>
<p>Q. Prime Minister, just one other point or, the uranium find. You were<br />
able to act quicdy to protect the uranium deposits from possible . oreign<br />
control because the two companies involved are registered in the Australian<br />
Capital Territory, and of course come under Commonwealth ordinance-. Now<br />
would you agree you could not have given this protection had the compa: iez been<br />
registered in one of the States?<br />
P. M. I believe that is so. I am not prepared to give a legal opinion that that<br />
is certainly so. But this is generally believed to be true and for the pur__ oses<br />
of this discussion, let us say it is true. Certainly, the fact that they were<br />
incorporated not registered incorporated in the A. C. T. was a fact vi-ich<br />
enabled us to take swift and immediate action. And had they been incorporated<br />
in the States, I don't think we could have taken such swift and immediate action.<br />
Q. Well this brings up the point that if the need arose of a company in one<br />
of the States, would you expect that the State would follow your guidelines and<br />
would in the national interest, do the same thing? Would you have any<br />
guarantee of that'i<br />
P. M. No, we are a Federal system and the States are sovereign States. They<br />
did agree at the Attorneys-General level last year to legislate under the<br />
Uniform Company Act for takeover codes for companies so that<br />
nominees owning more than 10 per cent had to disclose the beneficial interest,<br />
so that there must be a period of time between takeover offers and acceptance<br />
by shareholders, so that 15 per cent would be regarded as a controlling iterest<br />
in the company, and a number of other matters. They have not yet legislated<br />
along these lines. For that matter, neither have we because we have beelwaiting<br />
and hoping for uniform legislation, but we may have to move without<br />
it. But I can't guarantee what a State would do. I imagine that, if they were<br />
sensible, they would do what we do.<br />
Prime Minister, thank you very much. </p>
