    <content><![CDATA[<p>During my visit to the United States in May this year, I announced, as a joint initiative with the American Australian Association, that the Australian Government would contribute $25 million towards the establishment of a United States Studies Centre at a prestigious Australian university.</p>
<p>I would like to congratulate the University of Sydney on its selection by the American Australian Association to host the Centre.</p>
<p>The University of Sydney has an excellent standing, both in Australia and overseas, and its links with institutions in the US will complement and provide leadership on current Australian-United States educational endeavours.</p>
<p>I am confident that the partnership between the University of Sydney and the American Australian Association will make an outstanding contribution to the understanding of US culture, political climate and government and strengthen the relationship and educational links between both countries.</p>
<p>I am also pleased to announce that the Government will introduce legislation to allow, as of today, tax deductions for gifts of $2 or more to the American Australian Association.  Specific listing of the Association as a deductible gift recipient will assist the Association to attract public support for its activities in promoting friendship, cooperation and understanding between Australia and the US.</p>
