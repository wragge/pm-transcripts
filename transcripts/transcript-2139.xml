FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 81/ 1969<br />
FURTHER DROUGHT ASSISTANCE TO QUEENSLAND<br />
The Prime Minister announced today a further important<br />
measure of relief for drought stricken farmers in Queensland.<br />
Mr. Gorton said that the Premier had advised him that, with<br />
the increasing severity of the drought, many hard hit primary producers<br />
will find difficulty in meeting the Crown rentals on their land and their<br />
local authority rates.<br />
Recognising that neither the State Government nor the local<br />
authorities can suffer a loss of revenue by deferring or remitting these<br />
payments due from farmers and as much as $ 2 million could be involved<br />
this year the Commonwealth Government has undertaken to make<br />
non-interest bearing advances to the State Government. From these moneys<br />
advanced by the Commonwealth the State Government will be able, in<br />
appropriate cases, to make carry-on loans to the drought stricken farmers<br />
from which they can meet their payments of Crown rentals and local<br />
authority rates. Mr. Gorton said that these advances by the Commonwealth<br />
to the State Government would be free of interest and that it would be a<br />
matter for the Queensland Government to determine whether or not, as with<br />
their present carry-on loans to drought stricken farmers, they should<br />
charge interest at concessional rates in respect of the advances which they<br />
made because they will be meeting administrative costs and, within reasonable<br />
limits, any losses which may arise.<br />
CA NBERRA November 1969<br />
BACKGROUND: The Commonwealth has already agreed for 1969-70 to<br />
meet on a dollar-for-dollar basis expenditure on eligible drought relief<br />
measures up to $ 4 million and to meet the full cost in excess of $ 4 million.<br />
It was anticipated that payments under this agreement would cost the<br />
Commonwealth $ 8 million in 1969-70, but on the latest available information<br />
it is now estimated that the Commonwealth Government's share of drought<br />
relief measures in Queensland this year could amount to $ 17 million.<br />
In the four years ended June 1969 the Commonwealth<br />
provided Queensland with assistance totalling $ 17 million for approved<br />
drought relief measures. In 1966-67 and 1967-68 the Commonwealth<br />
provided special financial assistance of a general revenue nature to<br />
Queensland to help offset the adverse effects of drought on State revenue.<br />
This additional assistance totalled approximately $ 5 million. </p>
