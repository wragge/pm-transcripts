    <content><![CDATA[<p>I had the pleasure today of chairing the second meeting of the Prime</p>
<p> Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council and hearing</p>
<p> of the opportunities for value adding for all Australians flowing</p>
<p> from the excellence of Australian science.</p>
<p>PMSEIC agreed to improve the innovation potential of Australia through</p>
<p> strengthening the education system, providing better venture capital</p>
<p> markets and encouraging a more entrepreneurial culture throughout</p>
<p> Australian society.</p>
<p>The issue of disincentives for entrepreneurs arising from Australia's</p>
<p> tax system will be referred to the Ralph Committee work on business</p>
<p> tax.</p>
<p>PMSEIC also examined major issues affecting Australia's long</p>
<p> term development.</p>
<p>The Council looked at the issue of dryland salinity, as a major emerging</p>
<p> problem in Australia affecting agribusiness, infrastructure, rural</p>
<p> townships and some major urban areas. The Council considered a range</p>
<p> of possible solutions, and agreed that these could be developed further.</p>
<p>Consistent with Government strategy on greenhouse gases, the Council</p>
<p> received an update on the source of greenhouse emissions and the opportunities</p>
<p> that new technologies offered both for abatement of the emissions</p>
<p> and of new industry development. Motor vehicle and energy system technologies</p>
<p> were identified as providing considerable opportunities.</p>
<p>Developments in biotechnology and health-related medical research</p>
<p> are major opportunities for new Australian industries. Council members</p>
<p> identified major issues on research and commercialisation that required</p>
<p> consideration in order to secure Australia's place in the next</p>
<p> century, such as developing the education system, providing greater</p>
<p> incentives for venture capital for new companies and improving the</p>
<p> capital gains tax systems.</p>
<p>PMSEIC also agreed on the importance of keeping Australia at the leading</p>
<p> edge of major international science facilities and received reports</p>
<p> on Australia's position on securing a role in the Square Kilometre</p>
<p> Telescope Facility and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility.</p>
<p>Copies of the papers presented to Council members can be found at</p>
<p> the PMSEIC home page, under details of the second Council meeting</p>
