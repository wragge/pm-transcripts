FOR MEDIA 18 NOVEMBER 1987<br />
I want to make a brief general statement about the<br />
Aboriginal Employment Development Policy before Gerry Hand<br />
and Clyde Holding answer your questions about the detail of<br />
this new policy.<br />
The Aboriginal Employment Development Policy represents a<br />
major commitment by my Government to enhance the economic,<br />
educational and employment opportunities of Australia's<br />
Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders.<br />
This nation has few problems as tragic and as complex as the<br />
persistent poverty in which the majority of Aboriginal<br />
people live. Despite the earnest endeavours of Governments<br />
over the past twenty years, Aboriginal unemployment persists<br />
at unacceptably high levels five or six times higher than<br />
among the rest of the community and Aboriginal Incomes<br />
remain on average only half those enjoyed by other<br />
Australians In response to the pleas of the many Aboriginal people who<br />
reject the welfare dependency of the past, we must look to<br />
ways of ensuring the progressive development of Aboriginal<br />
economic independence.<br />
This is the fundamental objective of the AEDP. To achieve<br />
that goal it will create jobs for the nearly 50% of the<br />
Aboriginal population who live in remote and rural<br />
communities; ensure fair access for Aboriginals to jobs<br />
throughout the wider Labour market; and improve the<br />
educational and training opportunities for Aboriginal<br />
people. The AEDP is a carefully tailored and carefully measured<br />
approach. It arises from the recommendations of Mr Mick<br />
Miller's 1985 report on Aboriginal Employment and Training<br />
Programs. I want to congratulate Mr Miller and his<br />
committee for their hard work and for their valbiable<br />
recommendations.<br />
In 1986 the Government endorsed the broad findings of the<br />
Miller Committee and established the AEDP. Today we are<br />
embarking on a long-term co-ordinated policy involving a<br />
substantial financial commitment by the Commonwealth to<br />
achieve employment equity for Aboriginals and Torres Strait<br />
Islanders. 0 0 0-1 .1 </p>
<p>I have written to the six Premiers and the Chief Minister of<br />
the Northern Territory seeking their cooperation in the<br />
adoption of complementary measures. That cooperation, which<br />
I hope will be readily forthcoming, will introduce a new era<br />
of effective and efficient delivery of public sector<br />
services to Aboriginal people.<br />
I want to commend AEDP also to Aboriginal communities and<br />
organisations, trade unions and employer groups, all of<br />
whose support will also be critical for its effective<br />
implementation.<br />
The two hundred years of European settlement of Australia<br />
have been characterised by the development of Government<br />
policies which all too frequently have failed to answer the<br />
legitimate demands of the Aboriginal people.<br />
I believe a program such as the AEDP avoids the pitfalls of<br />
the past because it is based on the oft stated views of many<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that they want<br />
to be involved in the decisions about their future and about<br />
the way in which they will earn their livelihood.<br />
It is my hope that the Bicentenary celebrations will allow<br />
us not only to reflect on the richness of the 40,000 year<br />
old Aboriginal culture but also to appreciate with greater<br />
clarity the need for Aboriginal people today to achieve<br />
economic independence.<br />
This new policy cannot of course achieve results overnight:<br />
the imbalances in the standards of living of Aboriginals and<br />
of the rest of the community are too severe for that.<br />
But the AEDP does provide a tangible demonstration of the<br />
community's capacity to direct its resources in an effective<br />
way to alleviate the very real problems facing the<br />
Aboriginal people. 00U2 ) 02<br />
