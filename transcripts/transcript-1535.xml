1967<br />
Thank you, Mr. Hulme. It is an honour to be here<br />
today at the making of telecommunications history.<br />
I offer my sincere congratulations, and I am sure<br />
I can add the congratulations of the Australian people, to all<br />
who have made this possible.<br />
We have today the culmination of a great co-operative<br />
ent erpris e. Here is the end res; Jlt of a tremendous amount of<br />
energy and enthusiasm, foresight and vision, scientific and<br />
technical expertise, and organisational skills.<br />
It is a wonderful thing to know that Australia has<br />
been a major partner in this, under the expert guidance of my<br />
colleague, Mr. Hulme.<br />
I know that Australian enterprise has joined with the<br />
Government and made a very big contribution to this great project.<br />
I am told that Australia has supplied more than half<br />
the materials used for the SEACOM cable as well as an appreciable<br />
amount of equipment for the cable stations.<br />
Our manufacturing industries have supplied a<br />
substantial amount of the telecomiunications equipment.<br />
In these days it is easy to take for granted the<br />
miracles of modern technology.<br />
I know from my own work in the Trade field the<br />
tremendous importance of good communications. </p>
<p>As Acting Prime Minister, and as the responsible<br />
Minister for Australia's international trade I suppose I am as<br />
big a customer as anyone for overseas communication services.<br />
Communication services are an essential tool of<br />
my office. It makes all the difference to have a service which<br />
is speedy, safe, reliable, and efficient!<br />
BEGUN IN_ 1953 There is an interesting connection between today's<br />
ceremony and a conference which I attended at Montreal in 1958.<br />
This was a Commonwealth Trade and Economic Conference,<br />
attended by M. inisterial delegations from all Commonwealth countries.<br />
I was there as leader of the Australian delegation.<br />
The Conference was reviewing the part the Commonwealth<br />
had played in fostering economic prosperity, both for Commonwealth<br />
members, and the world as a whole.<br />
Against this background we were looking to see what more<br />
could be done towards these goals.<br />
One of the more concrete proposals the Conference had<br />
before it was a recommendation of the Commo-nwealth Telecommunications<br />
Board that an around-the-world coaxial telephone cable<br />
might eventually link all Commonwealth countries.<br />
It had only recently become technically possible to<br />
provide such a cable.<br />
There were still at that time many details to be<br />
worked out. Both, technical problems, and financial questions, had<br />
to be resolved. </p>
<p>* 3.<br />
Irecall with mnuch satisfaction that this Conference<br />
of Commonwealth 1iinisters, in consultation with their Governments,<br />
decided there and then, that Commonwealth countries would join,<br />
to proceed with this visionary plan.<br />
A way would be found to bring the concept to a reality.<br />
One of the rewards of high Government office is to<br />
have a hand in great new plans, and see them come to fruition.<br />
It is immensely satisfying to be here today at the<br />
opening of the Asian link of the Commonwealth Cable a tanigble<br />
result of a decision taken at that Conference where I spoke for<br />
Australia almost 9 years ago.<br />
From that point my former colleague, Sir Charles<br />
Davidson, took up the running.<br />
CLOSE TO ASIA In the intervening years Australia has grown towards<br />
a closer and closer association in the Asian region.<br />
Our traditional ties with Britain and Europe are<br />
strong. They have withstood the strain of geographic isolation<br />
for nearly 2 centuries.<br />
Just as the shrinking of distances in the modern<br />
world is rapidly reducing our isolation from Europe, so it is<br />
bringing our near neighbours nearer.<br />
Geography has put us close to Asia. The course of<br />
events both in Europe and Asia has sharpened our awareness of<br />
the fact. Our trade and commerce with Asia have been growing<br />
steadily. </p>
<p>.4.<br />
Today, a third of Australia's total exports go to<br />
Asian markets. In 1958, when vie first discussed the possibility<br />
of this cable, the figure was less than a quarter.<br />
Trade and Conmerce will be helped greatly by the faster<br />
and more effective communications which the SEACOI cable will<br />
provide. We have long had close ties with our Conmonwealth<br />
partners in Asia and the Pacific.<br />
The Prime 1, iinister has emphasi7. ed the importance<br />
that the Government attaches to Asian affairs in his statements<br />
and by his personal visits to Asian countries.<br />
As you know, the Prime Mtinister is at present on a<br />
round of official visits, to some of the Asian countries which<br />
have special significance to Australia, and with which he has not<br />
previously had personal contact as Prime 1 Jinister.<br />
AID TO OTHERS In world affairs generally, Australia is playing a<br />
bi[--er role. We recognise the gigantic problems faced by the<br />
developing countries. We have shown ourselves willing to carry a growing<br />
responsibility internationally helping the advancement of the<br />
less-developed countries of the world, and participating<br />
especially in the economic development of the Asian region.<br />
For example, the United Nations Conference on<br />
Trade and Development is seeking ways of iiiproving the trade<br />
earnings, and hence the income, of the less-developed countries. </p>
<p>In 1966, Australia led the world by granting<br />
concessions in the Australian tariff to products of these developing<br />
countries. Australia has become a member of the Development<br />
Assistance Committee, a world " club" of major donor countries in<br />
international aid.<br />
Our performance in official economic aid is recognized<br />
as high by any standard.<br />
And it is constantly improving in contrast to the<br />
performance of many other donor countries.<br />
Currently we stand about 4th among all the nations of<br />
the world, in terms of the proportion of our national income which<br />
we devote to international aid.<br />
Ely colleague, Tir. Hasluck, is at present overseas to<br />
attend a meeting of the United Nations' Economic Commission, for<br />
Asia and the Far East.<br />
Australia's full and active membership of this<br />
organisation gives formal recognition of our place in Asian development.<br />
Wie are participating fully in new Asian economic<br />
organisations such as the Asian Industrial Development Council,<br />
and the Asian Development Bank.<br />
Wie know the important role that industrialization can<br />
and must play as it has in our own country in creating jobs,<br />
diversifying exports, and raising living standards.<br />
We will shortly be exploring with Australian industry<br />
the ways and means by which Australia can help the Asian Industrial<br />
Development Council in its objective of fostering joint industrial<br />
undertakings in Asia. </p>
<p>.6.<br />
WORLD CO-OPERATION There are many forces at work in the world today<br />
many facilities and organisations bringing together the peoples<br />
of the world in closer co-operation.<br />
In them, we play our due part, and even beyond.<br />
It is oftenn'aid that the greatest successes of the<br />
United Nations, have been achieved by its commnunity activities in<br />
such fields as technical, scientific, and educational co-operation.<br />
Some of the broader international efforts break down<br />
through the sheer weight of complexity and conflicting interests.<br />
However, a lot can be achieved by more limited, but<br />
practical measures, towards specific objectives.<br />
Technical training, training in trade promotion techniques<br />
technical assistance with agriculture and industry, education and<br />
medical facilities. These are some of the scores of fields in which there<br />
have been concrete and effective advances in international co-operation<br />
and assistance. The International Telecommunications Union had its<br />
origins a little more than a century ago.<br />
From its very beginnings, telecommunications broke<br />
new ground in international co-operation.<br />
Certainly, nothing contributes more to mutual.<br />
understanding and help between nations than the breaking down of<br />
physical barriers by modern advances in transport and communicationo. </p>
<p>.7.<br />
NEW~ EPERIENCE Today we stand at the threshold of a new experience<br />
in communication. One result will be that the lives of millions of people<br />
in Asia will becox.-e involved with our lives as never before.<br />
We set our' course to the future to dedicate this new,<br />
technical, achievement to the goal of the betterment of all the<br />
people who live along its path.<br />
For Australia this new development in communications<br />
comes at a time which is crucial for the future of our own country<br />
and our relationship with Asia.<br />
I have mentioned various unfolding decisions of government<br />
directed towards our association with the countries of Asia, but<br />
in addition we have been adjusting to the political evolution of<br />
our neighbours in Asia.<br />
We will press on with our policies, so that Australia<br />
may further a continuing vigorous and independent relationship<br />
with Asia. We are, as it were, a bridge between 2 ancient cultures<br />
and ways of life European and Asian.<br />
From our shoreso will flow modern concepts of science<br />
and technology, To us will come the enrichment of Asia's cultural<br />
and social aspirations. We have our great achievement of today this new<br />
telecommunications era.<br />
Let us also direct ourselves today, and in all our<br />
tomorrows, in this region of A" sia and the Pacific, to peace,<br />
friendship and plenty. </p>
