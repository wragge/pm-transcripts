EMBAEGOI2D UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
LAUNCH OF PETER WILENSKI'S BOOR<br />
" PUBLIC POWER AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION"<br />
CANBERRA 14 OCTOBER 1986<br />
I Ghould first congratulate the publishers Hale and<br />
Iremonger, together with the Royal Australian Institute of<br />
Public Administration on the remarkable timing of this<br />
venture. it really is forward planning at its best.<br />
Because, here is a book called Public Power and Public<br />
Admirirtration being published at a time when its<br />
goes to the very heart of the comtemporary public debate in<br />
our cou~ ntry.<br />
Furthermore, it arrives less than three weeks after I<br />
announced in Parliament further major reforms to the<br />
Australian Public Service.<br />
one m~ ight almost think they had inside knowledge!<br />
So, by any measure, it is an immensely timely book on an<br />
immensely important subject.<br />
The timing, the theme and the author form a remarkable<br />
combination.<br />
As to the author, I need only say there is simply nobody in<br />
Australia so well qualified to write on this subject as<br />
Peter wilenski.<br />
I don't mean just his academic qualifications formidable<br />
as they are.<br />
But, for depth, diversity and directness of involvement,<br />
Peter has, I venture to say, few peers in the area of public<br />
administration in Australia.<br />
He has seen it from all sides.<br />
Throughout his service, Peter has maintained a strong<br />
commitment to public service reform the ongoing task of<br />
ensuring greater efficiency and effectiveness of the public<br />
administration in this country. </p>
<p>And I take this opportunity to acknowledge his splendid<br />
contribution to the work of reform which our Government has<br />
undertaken. The success of that work is absolutely fundamental to the<br />
achievement of the wider social and economic goals of this<br />
Labor Government of Australia.<br />
It is in this context of these wider goals that I place<br />
Peter wilancki's book. I perhaps do not need to stress that<br />
my launching of the book does not necessarily mean that I<br />
travel comfortably with every sentiment in it.<br />
Hugh Stretton has written a fine introduction.<br />
And he writes:<br />
" In the lucid argument of these essays, he confronts<br />
' Rightv pretensions of small government and enhanced<br />
public efficiency with the very different facts of<br />
' Right' performance. He exposes the assumptions and<br />
reasoning of New Right rhetoric and also quite a lot<br />
of Left rhetoric without mercy."<br />
of course, that is why this book is so timely.<br />
It comes at a time when there is an urgent need to subject<br />
the pretensions and panaceas of the so-called New Right to<br />
intellectual scrutiny.<br />
The moment that is done as soon as the rhetoric is exposed<br />
to the rigour of reason and the facts of experience the<br />
real motivez of the " New Right" become clear for all to<br />
judge.<br />
The fact is, of course, there is nothing fundamentally new<br />
about the New Right at all. It's just the old reaction in<br />
slightly more fashionable dress.<br />
The only thing really new is that, for the first time for<br />
forty years, the old reacticn has seized the ascendancy in<br />
the councils of the major non-Labor parties * of Australia.<br />
I suggest that should be a cause for deep anxiety on the<br />
part of the great majority of non-Labor supporters the<br />
decent, thinking Australians who were entitled to believe<br />
that the party of their choice, and its leadership, was<br />
placed firmly in the mainstream of the Australian tradition.<br />
And to them and indeed to the entire non-Labor leadership,<br />
in all its varying and conflicting manifestation, I<br />
heartily commend a reading of Dr. Wilenski's book.<br />
Let me emphasise that this is not in any way a partisan<br />
tract. It is a genuine contribution to the public debate, written<br />
from a standpoint of deep knowledge and experience. </p>
<p>Its lessons are valid and relevant for Labor and non-Labor,<br />
alike. But, of course, its main message must be to the public<br />
service itaelf.<br />
It's not just a question of knowing what the Boss is<br />
thinking though I have no doubt many might find that<br />
useful. But the im~ pcrtant message to be read in these pages is that<br />
the strength and effectiveness of the Australian Public<br />
Service depends very largely on public perceptions of its<br />
role and conduct.<br />
The public service is always an easy target and not only<br />
from the ra~ nks of reaction.<br />
But, in the end, its ability to resist attack will be<br />
measured by its standing with the Australian people. it<br />
will depend on the degree to which the people perceive their<br />
public service and public administration as efficient and<br />
effective, responsive and responsible.<br />
And the reforms our Government has undertaken cannot be<br />
fully understood, unless the members of the public service<br />
themselves understand their true nature and long term<br />
purpose. It would be a fundamental mistake to think that these<br />
reforms are merely some sort of cosmetic cost-cutting<br />
exercise, in response to Australia's present economic<br />
difficulties. Certainly, some aspects of our measures are a necessary part<br />
of our comprehensive attack on those immediate problems.<br />
But the higher goal remains a more efficient and effective<br />
public sector.<br />
And it's even more than that not only a more efficient and<br />
effective public service, but a public service perceived as<br />
such by the Australian people.<br />
And in that perception the trust and respect of the people<br />
lt~ es the enduring strength of the great Australian Public<br />
Service.<br />
And this book itself will be a valuable contribution, both<br />
to that perception and to that strength. </p>
