FOR PRESS P. M. No. 21/ 1966<br />
GOVERNMENT PARTIES UNANIMOUS<br />
ON VIETNAM POLICY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
The Government Parties devoted a major part of their<br />
available time at their regular Joint Party Meeting today to a<br />
discussion of criticisms by Australian Labour Party Members and<br />
others of Australian participation in military activities in<br />
South Vietiam and the inclusion of national service troops in<br />
the milita1y task force to be despatched to that country.<br />
I was requcsted by the meeting to state publicly that<br />
members of the Government Parties had re-affirmed their<br />
unanimous support for the decisions of the Government both on<br />
the desirabi hty of Australia's continued assistance to South<br />
Vietnam in its resistance to Communist aggression and the<br />
necessity for the inclusion of national servicemen in regular<br />
Army units to provide the most effective military force as<br />
required in Vietnam and elsewhere.<br />
CANBERRA March, 1966. </p>
