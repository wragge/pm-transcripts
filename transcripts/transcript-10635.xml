    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.........................................................</p>
<p> PRESENTER: </p>
<p>The Prime Minister, John Howard, is in Perth today. In fact, he</p>
<p>   has joined me in the ABC studios and he'll also take your calls.</p>
<p>   John Howard, good to see you again.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hello Peter, good to be here again.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Unemployment and interest rates edging up this morning, that's</p>
<p>   quite a potent combination, isn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Unemployment is around 8 per cent. It was 7.9 last time, it's</p>
<p>   8.1 this time, it was about 8.5 per cent when we came to power.</p>
<p>   We have created about 170,000 - 180,000 new jobs over the last nine</p>
<p>   months so there's employment growth. We'd like it to be</p>
<p>   better. We knew that it would bounce around a bit around the 8 per</p>
<p>   cent figure. We hope that it will go lower. Obviously that depends</p>
<p>   on Australia remaining competitive and making whatever further changes</p>
<p>   are needed, particularly in the taxation system to ensure that in</p>
<p>   this rather turbulent region in which Australia is located, we get</p>
<p>   our fair share of exports because it's through getting more</p>
<p>   exports to the rest of the world that we can generate some more</p>
<p>   jobs.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>What about interest rates though, the sign there is that they are</p>
<p>   going to head up?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Peter, for reasons that I am sure you will understand at this time</p>
<p>   of debate about the currency and coverage of the dollar and matters</p>
<p>   related to interest rates and the dollar, I am not going to talk</p>
<p>   about the direction of interest rates. It's never a wise idea</p>
<p>   for a Prime Minister or anybody else senior in the Government to</p>
<p>   talk about the direction of interest rates and I just won't</p>
<p>   do that.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>But you would concede that.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't concede anything. I don't assert or concede anything</p>
<p>   on the interest rate front.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Wouldn't rising interest rates though be counterproductive</p>
<p>   to what you've been trying to achieve over the past couple</p>
<p>   of years?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not going to assert or concede anything on the interest rate</p>
<p>   front.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>What about unemployment, what about employment targets, job targets?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I have said from the very beginning that setting a particular</p>
<p>   target means nothing. I noticed this morning that Mr Beazley said</p>
<p>   that if he had been in Government, he'd have had unemployment</p>
<p>   at 6 per cent. Well he had 13 years to be in Government and it was</p>
<p>   at 8.5 per cent when he lost office and he actually took it to 11.2</p>
<p>   per cent when he was Employment Minister in 1990. So it is very</p>
<p>   unwise to build those sorts of targets. Our objective is to give</p>
<p>   a job in this country to every person who wants one and setting</p>
<p>   a particular target means nothing other than generating an enormous</p>
<p>   debate about how close or how far you are from that target. It is</p>
<p>   much better to adopt policies that will reduce unemployment and</p>
<p>   that is what we are obviously endeavouring to do.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>My studio guest the Prime Minister, John Howard. Prime Minister,</p>
<p>   what about the health issue? You spoke at the hotel lunch at the</p>
<p>   500 Club a short while ago, a demonstration of nurses outside there</p>
<p>   to greet you and by the way, of course, you had some caustic comments</p>
<p>   when the Premiers walked out of the Premiers' Conference earlier</p>
<p>   this year. With regard to the health issue, where is it going, the</p>
<p>   funding of health, where's it going?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the dispute here in Western Australia is a matter between</p>
<p>   the nurses and the State Government. I am not going to buy into</p>
<p>   that. That's a matter that I am sure the State Government is</p>
<p>   handling appropriately and it is a matter for the State Government</p>
<p>   to handle. Federally.....</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>The State Government has said they would like to pay the nurses</p>
<p>   more but their hands are tied because they can't get enough</p>
<p>   money from the Commonwealth for the public hospitals.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not going to get into a long debate about this issue today.</p>
<p>   The pattern, I guess, of Commonwealth/State relations is often that</p>
<p>   State governments will say that they'd like to do certain things</p>
<p>   if only they had more resources from the Federal Government. We</p>
<p>   made a good offer at the time of the Premiers' Conference,</p>
<p>   it did involve an increase of 15 per cent in real terms over five</p>
<p>   years, and in anybody's language at a time of zero inflation</p>
<p>   that is a very genuine offer. However, it is something that we continue</p>
<p>   to talk about. I had a meeting with the Premier this afternoon,</p>
<p>   we talked about a range of things and obviously health was an issue</p>
<p>   that was discussed. I am not wanting to raise any expectations or,</p>
<p>   indeed, dampen them. You should see that meeting, I guess, as being</p>
<p>   part of an ongoing willingness on the part of both of us to talk</p>
<p>   about issues that are important to the Federal Government and important</p>
<p>   to the West Australian Government.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>But public hospitals are said to be in crisis in several of the</p>
<p>   States, particularly it's been said with regard to Western</p>
<p>   Australia. What's the way out?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you say they are in crisis. Now, I think public health standards</p>
<p>   are enormously important to Australians all over the country. In</p>
<p>   a Federation the Federal Government has responsibilities and State</p>
<p>   governments have responsibilities and without wanting in any way</p>
<p>   to sharpen the debate I have to make the gentle point that public</p>
<p>   hospitals are the responsibility of State governments within our</p>
<p>   system, not the responsibility of the Federal Government. It is</p>
<p>   our responsibility to provide a reasonable level of funding to the</p>
<p>   States. It is also our responsibility to provide proper support</p>
<p>   for private health insurance. We have direct responsibilities in</p>
<p>   health, they are particularly related to private health insurance.</p>
<p>   The States have responsibility with public hospital. Now we believe</p>
<p>   that the provision that we have made is reasonable. It is fair.</p>
<p>   We believe it contains a significant increase. I mean we've</p>
<p>   got zero inflation in this country at the moment and we have made</p>
<p>   an offer which represents a 15 per cent increase, that's 3</p>
<p>   per cent each year in real terms over a period of five years. Now</p>
<p>   the States have said, although I should point out that Queensland</p>
<p>   and the ACT have signed the agreement, the States have said they</p>
<p>   would like more. I guess I simply respond by saying that the matter</p>
<p>   continues to be discussed but I do believe the offer we have put</p>
<p>   on the table is a very reasonable one.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Can I just ask you the matter about elections which I am sure you</p>
<p>   would be surprised if I didn't ask you. You've got the</p>
<p>   mechanism there for a double dissolution election if you want it,</p>
<p>   how committed are you to a double dissolution election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I have never been committed to a double dissolution as such</p>
<p>   but I have been committed to getting certain pieces of legislation</p>
<p>   through.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Well you've got the machinery there to do it haven't</p>
<p>   you - a double dissolution?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I have.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Are you going to use it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that's something I'll make up my mind about at the</p>
<p>   weeks and months go by.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>How tempting is it though to take the Senate out as well as the</p>
<p>   House of Representatives?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Peter, I don't have a desire for a double dissolution</p>
<p>   as an end in itself. The only reason that you have a double dissolution</p>
<p>   is because the Labor Party and the other parties in the Senate have</p>
<p>   twice rejected crucial legislation and the legislation I have in</p>
<p>   mind is the Native Title legislation. And we have tried on two occasions</p>
<p>   to get this through the Senate and Mr Beazley and the Labor Party</p>
<p>   and the Democrats and the other minor parties have combined on two</p>
<p>   occasions to block a resolution of this long running native title</p>
<p>   problem which is of enormous significance to the State of Western</p>
<p>   Australia. No State is more in need of having the native title issue</p>
<p>   fixed up than Western Australia. And Mr Beazley, more than anybody</p>
<p>   else in the Commonwealth Parliament, himself from Western Australia,</p>
<p>   is determined to block a resolution of this very, very difficult</p>
<p>   issue. Now, I simply say this to the people of Western Australia,</p>
<p>   if you want the native title thing resolved without a double dissolution</p>
<p>   then you put pressure on the Democrats and the Labor Party representatives</p>
<p>   from Western Australia to change their mind and allow our fair,</p>
<p>   compromised, principled Bill on native title to go through. </p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>All right, the onus is on them then to change......</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The onus is absolutely on them because our Bill already represents</p>
<p>   a compromise. It's not as if we've adopted a radical,</p>
<p>   hardline position. We didn't go as far as some of our supporters</p>
<p>   wanted us to go in relation to native title. We adopted a middle</p>
<p>   ground position and what the Labor Party wants us to do is to sell</p>
<p>   out the interests of farmers and miners and go even further towards</p>
<p>   them. Well we won't do that and there is no way that the Coalition</p>
<p>   is going to alter its current position on native title, the right</p>
<p>   to negotiate, which the Labor Party wants to maintain thus giving</p>
<p>   privilege to Aboriginal land claimants that other Australians don't</p>
<p>   have, we will not agree to that in relation to pastoral leases.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>No further compromise, does that literally mean not a word, not</p>
<p>   even a comma of your Wik legislation that you'll change?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are not prepared to change anything of substance in it, no.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Nothing of substance?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Nothing of substance, no. That's been our position for months</p>
<p>   and people should understand that we are serious about that. There</p>
<p>   seems to be this funny idea now that there's concern about</p>
<p>   whether or not One Nation Senators might be elected in Queensland</p>
<p>   in a double dissolution, that that's a reason for us to cave</p>
<p>   in. I would have thought that if people are worried about One Nation</p>
<p>   supporting Queensland the last thing they want to do is for the</p>
<p>   Coalition to cave in on native title because if we were to do that</p>
<p>   we would deliver hundreds of thousands of additional votes to One</p>
<p>   Nation in States like Queensland and Western Australia. I think</p>
<p>   it would be a stupid thing tactically as well as being a quite unprincipled</p>
<p>   sell-out of farming and mining interests and the interests of the</p>
<p>   Western Australian people generally.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, when is the tax reform package going to hit the</p>
<p>   decks?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It will be ready soon. I am not going to put a time on it.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Are you talking weeks or months?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not going to talk weeks or months, it will be ready soon.</p>
<p>   I mean this obsession with trying to pin people down to dates consumes</p>
<p>   an enormous amount of air time. Obviously I am going to announce</p>
<p>   that package when it's finished and when I am ready. It's</p>
<p>   like the date of the election, I'll announce that after I have</p>
<p>   been to see the Governor General.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>What's the Liberal Party polling telling you about attitudes</p>
<p>   to a GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I never talk about Liberal Party polling whether it's good</p>
<p>   or bad.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Well given that John Hewson lost the unlosable election in 1993,</p>
<p>   said to be because of the GST, I mean what makes you think you won't</p>
<p>   lose your near record majority in one hit in an election fought</p>
<p>   on GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What I want to do is to give the Australian people a fairer tax</p>
<p>   system. I am not proposing the introduction of a GST on top of the</p>
<p>   existing taxation system. What I am proposing is a fairly basic</p>
<p>   change to the system that will address the unfairness in the present</p>
<p>   system. It will also address some of the difficulties of Commonwealth/State</p>
<p>   relations and I can assure the Australian public that when it comes</p>
<p>   out they will see that it is a very fair and balanced package and,</p>
<p>   above everything else, it won't involve any overall increase</p>
<p>   in the tax take. I don't think anybody who seriously looks</p>
<p>   at taxation in Australia can believe that a system that is riddled</p>
<p>   with the unfairness and the inequities that beset the present system</p>
<p>   where, for example, if you're a half a dozen people in Western</p>
<p>   Australia who can afford to buy a Lear jet, you don't pay any</p>
<p>   wholesale sales tax but, if like you and me and most of the listeners,</p>
<p>   our main mode of transport is the family car, we pay 22 per cent</p>
<p>   wholesale sales tax. Now I could spend the whole afternoon regaling</p>
<p>   you with examples like that which indicate the present system is</p>
<p>   unfair and we want a fairer system. </p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Right, Prime Minister, let's go to the phones now and our</p>
<p>   first caller this afternoon is Peter of Duncraig. Peter, good afternoon.</p>
<p>   Are you there Peter? Not much luck with Peter. Let's see if</p>
<p>   we can get Cameron from Wilson, Cameron are you on the line there.</p>
<p>   We are having a little bit of trouble with the phones Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'll have to be content with Peter of Perth then.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>You might have to be content with Peter of Perth but now, I mean,</p>
<p>   with regard to tax reform. I mean you didn't include a GST</p>
<p>   in your campaign in Â96, I mean what's the reason of doing</p>
<p>   it this time? You won in 1996, it could put you.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I believe it's in Australia's interests to change the</p>
<p>   present taxation system and give us one that makes us more competitive</p>
<p>   and is also a fairer system. And isn't it my responsibility</p>
<p>   as Prime Minister to do things that are in the best interests of</p>
<p>   Australia and not just do everything on the basis of short-term</p>
<p>   popularity? I mean do you want a Prime Minister who calculates every</p>
<p>   decision that he takes on the basis of whether or not the public</p>
<p>   is going to like it or do you want one who on occasions on important</p>
<p>   issues says to the public, that I as Prime Minister believe very</p>
<p>   sincerely that this reform is needed for the long-term benefit of</p>
<p>   Australia and I am prepared to lay out a plan for it and I am prepared</p>
<p>   to seek the approval of the people before I implement it. Now that</p>
<p>   is exactly what I am doing and I would have thought that the correct</p>
<p>   response from Mr Beazley would be to engage me in debate on it,</p>
<p>   not just to adopt this negative scare campaign that he is clearly</p>
<p>   going to do. But, that is his decision and the Australian people</p>
<p>   will decide it.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, let's go to the phones again and let's</p>
<p>   go to Brett from Perth. Brett good afternoon.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good afternoon, good afternoon John how are you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm very well Brett.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Brett if you'd ask your question of the Prime Minister then</p>
<p>   we'll listen to the Prime Minister's response.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Just in regard to the lead up to the next election, I was wondering</p>
<p>   whether or not the Liberals have a policy for contemporary music</p>
<p>   at the moment and will they be making a commitment to protecting</p>
<p>   Australian musicians?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the best policy we have for contemporary music is to have</p>
<p>   cheaper CDs for young music lovers and that is why we support changes</p>
<p>   that will allow young music lovers in Australia, well not just young</p>
<p>   music lovers, but I particularly think of the youth market, we're</p>
<p>   all music lovers, access to cheaper Cds. The Labor Party is intent</p>
<p>   on stopping Australian consumers from having cheaper CDs by maintaining</p>
<p>   a system which is particularly beneficial to multi-national music</p>
<p>   companies and very detrimental to music lovers. We prefer the ordinary</p>
<p>   Australian battler who likes a cheap CD to the profits of multi-nationals</p>
<p>   so that's our policy.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Brett, thanks very much for the call. We'll move through to</p>
<p>   George from Esperance. George hi.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Hi, yeah Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes George.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Can you tell me why you and your other federal politicians refuse</p>
<p>   to get off to Kalgoorlie and have a look around that area? I mean</p>
<p>   you get frightened.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we don't refuse George, we don't refuse. I was</p>
<p>   planning to go to Kalgoorlie in the middle of last year and I got</p>
<p>   pneumonia....</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>.....you just about had a heart attack....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I beg your pardon?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I thought you just about had a heart attack.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No my heart's very sound - it's not only sound but it's</p>
<p>   good.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>When it comes to going to the gold country......</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'll get there - George, George, it's not that I</p>
<p>   refuse, I will get there but Australia's a big country and</p>
<p>   I will certainly try and get there soon and I come to Western Australia</p>
<p>   on a very regular basis, I'll try and get there soon, but I</p>
<p>   did have a well laid plain and unfortunately the bug got me last</p>
<p>   year and I was in the Mater Hospital for a few days with pneumonia</p>
<p>   when I was meant to be in Kalgoorlie. I'm sorry, I'll</p>
<p>   get there soon.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>George you'll see the Prime Minister in Esperance before too</p>
<p>   long. Let's go to Mandurah now - Margaret, how are you Margaret?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Oh, good thanks. May I speak to the Prime Minister please?</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>He's listening.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Oh hi Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Look I was just wondering if you could come up with some idea of</p>
<p>   helping people like myself who have been in the private health scheme</p>
<p>   for fifty years, and now that I'm a pensioner I'm still</p>
<p>   struggling to stay in it but luckily at this stage I don't</p>
<p>   need to...my health is still good, but I was wondering if the Government</p>
<p>   could assist the HBF societies to pick up the gaps if and when we</p>
<p>   do need that to ......</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You're concerned about the gap. We are looking at a number</p>
<p>   of things that affect the operation of private health insurance</p>
<p>   at the present time, including that very issue that you raise. There</p>
<p>   are a number of things we've got to take into account but I</p>
<p>   do understand that a lot of people feel if they have private health</p>
<p>   insurance that they really pay three times. They pay the Medicare</p>
<p>   levy, they pay their private health insurance premium and then they</p>
<p>   end up getting a bill for the gap. Now I can understand the concern</p>
<p>   of people about that. It concerns me. I talk to a lot of people</p>
<p>   about this and I understand exactly how they feel. We are looking</p>
<p>   at ways and means of dealing with that - I mean that very genuinely</p>
<p>   - and we're doing that at the moment. Now I don't know</p>
<p>   what the outcome of that examination will be but I can say to you</p>
<p>   that the concern that you have expressed is both understandable</p>
<p>   and common.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Margaret thank you very much for the call. Let's go to Tom</p>
<p>   from Carlisle. How are you Tom? You there Tom? No we seem to have</p>
<p>   missed Tom. Let's go south to Albany. How are you Paul?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good. How do you do Sir? I'd just like to give you a bit of</p>
<p>   background. As a kid I knew Pig Iron Bob - Bob Menzies. The first</p>
<p>   aircraft I flew in belonged to a man called Fairly, the Minister</p>
<p>   for Air that was killed in an air crash. I've been a dedicated</p>
<p>   Liberal all my life. But with your stewardship up there, all I can</p>
<p>   say is with the GST that you're talking about bringing in,</p>
<p>   I've researched it very much, even back in John Hewson's</p>
<p>   day and I just could not abide by it, so therefore you have lost,</p>
<p>   and your whole group have lost my vote forever and a day, and also</p>
<p>   on top of that I would say that the debit tax would have been a</p>
<p>   damn sight better but you didn't even look at it, did you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, are you finished sir?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes, I'm a very angry voter and as far as I'm concerned,</p>
<p>   good on Pauline Hanson and Graeme Campbell - so you might as well</p>
<p>   have it straight.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's all right I don't mind that at all, I was just</p>
<p>   wondering if you'd finished, that's all.</p>
