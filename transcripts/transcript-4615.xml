A &amp;~ L<br />
FOR PRESS 31 JANUARY 1978<br />
ADDRESS* TO THE NATION<br />
Good evening. On this Australia Day holiday it is good to<br />
pause and think for a moment about those things that give<br />
us a sense of national identity and unity, a sense of pride<br />
in being Australian.. It is good to stop and think about<br />
where we are heading as a nation, as one people.<br />
of course, it's not just a question of thinking, it's also<br />
a question of acting. Like any other group of people, Australians<br />
are a product of the experiences they have had together, and<br />
of the history, tradition and culture that many people have<br />
brought to us from other lands.<br />
We have been through good times, we have helped each other<br />
through tough times, through war, through depression, through<br />
flood, and again this summer through bushfires and drought.<br />
Through it all we have built roads and great cities in Australia,<br />
we have established great factories and farms, we have set up<br />
vast mining projects in many parts of the country. We have<br />
established a whole complex civilisation in Australia. And<br />
when we get right down to it, Australia is one of the best<br />
places to live in, and to bring up a family.<br />
We have experienced many things together. We have achieved<br />
a great deal. We share common values and aspirations; the<br />
need to see that Australia grows and prospers; the need to<br />
see that everyone has a fair gol the common commitment to </p>
<p>freedom, protecting people from unfairness and injustice.<br />
But sometimes we take all of this for granted. We give too<br />
much weight to division and conflict, when we should be<br />
acting together for common aims and objectives.<br />
Politicians emphasise too much the differences they have<br />
with each other, when they should be working to build on<br />
those things that unite us all.<br />
We all know that Australia can be made a better country;<br />
that by working together we can create an Australia in which<br />
there is security and stability so we can plan our own and our<br />
family's future; in which there is social justice and equal<br />
opportunity for all Australians -no matter what their colour,<br />
their background, -or -their occupation may -be; ' an Australia<br />
that shows. care anda concern* for the disadvantaged, and which<br />
rewards initiative and enterprise in individuals.-<br />
Your Government is committed to working for these objectives.<br />
It is part of our vision for Australia's future, to bring out<br />
the things we agree on, not allow ourselves to be distracted<br />
by partisan interests, by sectional demand. Australia is a<br />
Civerse country, with many different ideas. But we are agreed<br />
on the great -fundamental objectives that we ought to be<br />
pursuing as a nation. We can achieve the things that tie-us<br />
together. We can achieve the great ideals that we all share.<br />
This isn't just a task for Government, it's a task for all<br />
Australians. We have achieved so much working together as<br />
one people, yet so much remains to be done. Not only for<br />
ourselves, but for those who follow. Let's work at it, together. </p>
