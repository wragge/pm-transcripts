IA STRAIAA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 14 JULY 1982<br />
RISHT HONOURABLE SIR PHILIP McBRIDE, K. C. M. G.<br />
I was saddened to learn of the death today of the Right<br />
Honourable Sir Philip McBride, K. C. M. G.<br />
Sir Philip gave long and valued service to the national<br />
Parliament as a Member of the House of Representatives<br />
for the Division of Grey from 1931 to 1937; as a Senator for<br />
South Australia from 1937 to 1944 and as a Member of the<br />
House of Representatives for the Division of Wakefield from<br />
-1946 to 19: 58.<br />
Sir Philip began his ministerial career as Minister for<br />
Supply and Development and Minister for<br />
Munitions . in tlhe firsL Menzies Uuvei ieiil and was t3 e l. ast<br />
surviving member of that first Menzies Ministry. During<br />
his long ministerial career he also held a variety of other<br />
ministeria. offices, including the Defence portfolio from<br />
1950-1958. After his retirement Sir Philip maintained<br />
his active interest in politics and was Federal President<br />
of the Liberal Party from 1960 to 1965.<br />
He made a major contribution to the political life of.<br />
Australia in peace and in war and to the Australian Government<br />
and I know the Australian people appreciated his long and<br />
distinguished service to this nation.<br />
As well as being a notable political figure, Sir Philip was<br />
also a well known farmer and was for a period the<br />
President of the Stockowners Association of South Australia.<br />
I offer my deepest sympathy to Lady McBride and their two<br />
surviving sohs. o0o---</p>
