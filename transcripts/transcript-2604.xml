PRIME MINISTER<br />
MACQUARIE NETWORK WEEKLY BROADCAST<br />
Bv the Prime Minister,<br />
The Rt Hon. William McMahon, M. P. 31 May 1972<br />
HEALTH<br />
Your health is of over-riding importance.<br />
That is why I want to talk to you now about the quality<br />
and the cost of our National Health Services Scheme.<br />
It is in your interests to know just what the<br />
National Health Scheme does for you. You should also know<br />
the differences between our practical health policies and<br />
the nationalised Labor blueprints. The two schemes are<br />
radically different.<br />
We, as Liberals, put the patient first in our<br />
working scheme. Labor, puts the system first in its<br />
grandiose theorising. We know, from overseas experience<br />
with so-called " free" health schemes, how easily the<br />
patient can be lost in the machine.<br />
We must start from the basis that good health<br />
is a priceless asset.<br />
Your health deserves the best medical and<br />
hospital care that can be provided. We have evolved a<br />
working Australian T-htional Health Scheme suited to<br />
Australian conditions and based on many years of<br />
practical. exnerience. What does'this scheme give you? It is<br />
voluntary you are free to join or not. You can choose<br />
any doctor, or change to any other doctor if you want to.<br />
Women know the absolutely vital personal value of this<br />
freedom of choice.<br />
The amount of the doctor's bill you have to pay,<br />
whether for surgery or home visits, is limited. Where<br />
doctors participate under the common fee plan your cost<br />
is 80 cents for a surgery visit and $ 1.20 for a home visit. </p>
<p>I have already stressed that Australians are<br />
entitled to expect the best medical attention there is.<br />
This requires the closest co-operation of the medical<br />
profession if it is to succeed. Under our voluntary<br />
scheme, the doctor : imself has freedom. He is not and<br />
cannot under the constitution be compulsorily made to<br />
provide his service for a fixed amount. Nor can he be<br />
compelled to accept a quota of patients under a salaried<br />
or nationalised health scheme. We do not want that in<br />
any event. With notable excentions, especially with<br />
some sections in New South Wales, the medical profession<br />
does co-operate. In the mid-sixties, the voluntary health system<br />
came under considerable stress because of the growing<br />
need for better medical and hospital care. How did we<br />
resoond? In 1968-69, we began to reconstruct the<br />
hospital and nursing home benefit arrangement. We also<br />
established the Nimmo Committee to make an in-depth<br />
study of health insurance. As a result, we made a lot<br />
of changes and reforms. These are not promises or<br />
pie-in-the-sky. But actual improvements bringing you<br />
bigger benefits and better services. They are all<br />
available to you today. Not maybe next year, maybe<br />
sometime, maybe never. But right now.<br />
I mention just a few reforms:<br />
Full hospital benefits without conditions,<br />
Simplified hospital insurance arrangements,<br />
A single medical table,<br />
The five dollar limit on cost to you where<br />
the common fee applies,<br />
Higher specialist benefits,<br />
No limitations for nre-existing ailments<br />
And so on.<br />
These benefits arc substantial and tangible. They protect<br />
you. I repeat. Under the Liberal scheme the interests<br />
of the patient come first. We will do all in our power to<br />
improve the scheme and further lessen the burden on you.<br />
We want a practical working scheme. But we can't get<br />
well or remain healthy on promises or theories.<br />
So think carefully before giving unthinking<br />
support to something labelled " free health", but which in<br />
reality will turn out to be a very expensive experiment<br />
in nationalised medicine without real benefit to you.<br />
That is why we want a National Health Scheme<br />
that is efficiently organised and run. We want a scheme<br />
that works and doesn't cost the earth, because, as you<br />
know. the taxpayer in the end always pays the bill. </p>
