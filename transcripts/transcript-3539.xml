INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE COMMISSION REPORT<br />
FOUNDATION GARMENTS<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, announced today<br />
that'as a long term objective the Government has accepted the<br />
Industries Assistance Commission's recommendation in its report<br />
on Foundation Garments.<br />
Mr Whitlam. said that in view of current economic<br />
conditions and the possible employment consequences of introduction<br />
of the reduced duties recommended by the Commission at this time,<br />
the Government considered that the recommended duty rate of<br />
would best be phased in and that in the case of brassieres<br />
( complete and incomplete) a tariff quota be adopted with a<br />
penality rate of $ 2.50 per garment when imports exceed a certain<br />
level, approximately 25% of the market.<br />
, Mr Whitlam, said that the tariff quotas which were<br />
being introduced consistently with Australia's rights and<br />
obligations under the GATT would remain in effect for the next<br />
12 months and that this form of assistance would be reviewed<br />
within that period as to the need for an extension of a further<br />
12 months. Implementation of the Government's decision will<br />
mean that in the first year existing rates of duty will be maintained<br />
for all goods under reference, subject to a tariff quota in<br />
respect of brassieres. Mr Whitlam added that tariff quotas would apply<br />
to all imports of the products concerned cleared for home<br />
consumption after the date of this announcement. A detailed<br />
statement of Customs Tariff changes arising from the Government's<br />
decision will be issued by the Minister for Customs and Excise<br />
when arrangements have been finalised to implement the proposed<br />
changes. The policy aspects of the administration of the<br />
tariff quotas will be the responsibility of the Minister for<br />
Manufacturing Industry who will announce detailed arrangements<br />
in the near future.<br />
