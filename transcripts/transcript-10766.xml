    <content><![CDATA[<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, good morning.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Neil.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is there a suggestion of a pre-emptive strike from India?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I have only heard the news reports. I don't have any additional</p>
<p>   information. What has happened is very disturbing, to some even</p>
<p>   frightening. One would have thought a few years ago that one thing</p>
<p>   the world had really got clever about was the possibility of nuclear</p>
<p>   war and in a sense, over the last few years most of us have assumed</p>
<p>   that the threat of nuclear war that many people lived under between</p>
<p>   the late 1940s and the late 1980s had disappeared.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well you would have to say it's back now.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It certainly is very worrying indeed and what of course is just</p>
<p>   appalling and tragic about this whole episode is that we are dealing</p>
<p>   with two countries that are still by world standards desperately</p>
<p>   poor. Pakistan worse so than India but both compared to what we</p>
<p>   have in this country, very poor. Inevitably the world must impose</p>
<p>   sanctions otherwise it just looks as though it doesn't care.</p>
<p>   Those sanctions will hurt the ordinary people of those two countries</p>
<p>   yet despite all of that, there appears on the surface anyway to</p>
<p>   be cheering in the streets in both countries, that each of them</p>
<p>   now has nuclear capacity and each is now in this, what many people</p>
<p>   would see, crazy man's club of possessing nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Now it is a very concerning situation. Words are easy on an occasion</p>
<p>   like this and in a sense, you run out of emphatic language to express</p>
<p>   your concern and disgust and obviously, we will be saying things</p>
<p>   later today. The Foreign Minister will be announcing a number of</p>
<p>   responses by Australia to what Pakistan has done. What I regret</p>
<p>   most of all is that Pakistan gave up the opportunity of occupying</p>
<p>   the moral high ground. Everybody urged Pakistan not to retaliate.</p>
<p>   President Clinton spoke to the Prime Minister of Pakistan. Other</p>
<p>   world leaders, including myself, got in touch with the Pakistani</p>
<p>   Government. The Foreign Minister did. Everybody around the globe</p>
<p>   was urging the Pakistani Government not to respond and if in fact</p>
<p>   Pakistan had not responded then I am sure the ordinary people of</p>
<p>   that country would have been the winners. Now what has happened</p>
<p>   is that both countries are internationally condemned. Now I don't</p>
<p>   want to be alarmist because the idea that we are sort of on the</p>
<p>   brink of some outbreak of hostilities between those two countries</p>
<p>   I don't believe on my assessment that that is the case.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I notice, the Foreign Minister said this morning there were suggestions</p>
<p>   from India that a pre-emptive strike has been prepared.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There were suggestions. Now we must hope that those are wrong and</p>
<p>   there are some grounds for believing that those reports could be</p>
<p>   wrong, but it is a much more dangerous situation now than what it</p>
<p>   was a few days ago. It is a much more dangerous situation than it</p>
<p>   was a few months ago. It's quite a challenge to the rest of</p>
<p>   the world. We can all express our alarm. We can all in different</p>
<p>   ways, and there's a particular responsibility on the major</p>
<p>   countries of the world, the most powerful, that is, the United States</p>
<p>   in particular, to bring all the pressure it can both through trade</p>
<p>   sanctions but also through diplomacy and argument and persuasion</p>
<p>   and appeals to commonsense and logic. I mean, nobody but nobody</p>
<p>   will gain anything and people, millions of people will lose an enormous</p>
<p>   amount if there is any outbreak of hostility between the two countries.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I see Pakistani leaders saying that the people are willing to eat</p>
<p>   grass to build their nuclear capability. It would seem that logic</p>
<p>   has gone already.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That was a statement, as I understand, made years ago by the former</p>
<p>   Pakistani Prime Minister, Mr Bhutto, the father of Benazir Bhutto,</p>
<p>   when he launched Pakistan's drive to get a nuclear capacity.</p>
<p>   I mean, it is crazy, it is unbelievable that a country as dirt poor</p>
<p>   as Pakistan should be diplomatically romancing, or strategically</p>
<p>   romancing in the idea that in some way it's reached a pinnacle</p>
<p>   of respectability by acquiring the nuclear capacity. It is very,</p>
<p>   very disturbing. It is a turn of events that has, I think, taken</p>
<p>   the world by and large by surprise because most believed that the</p>
<p>   idea of a resumption of the nuclear arms race, the nuclear contest,</p>
<p>   was very unlikely and something we had really put behind.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay, well what can Australia do? What aid is sent to Pakistan by</p>
<p>   Australia?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There is some aid and Alexander Downer will be announcing today</p>
<p>   what our response is. I can say that that response will be very</p>
<p>   similar to the response that followed the detonation of nuclear</p>
<p>   devices by India. We can do no less than retaliate the same way</p>
<p>   as we retaliated against India. We have to do that even though it</p>
<p>   will have a negative impact along with similar retaliation from</p>
<p>   other countries on the people of Pakistan and India. But there is</p>
<p>   no alternative. If you don't retaliate at all, then other countries</p>
<p>   that might be thinking of doing the same thing as India and Pakistan</p>
<p>   and investing precious resources that ought to be going towards</p>
<p>   improving the living standards of their desperately poor people,</p>
<p>   might be encouraged to do the same thing. </p>
<p>So we must do what we will announce later today that we intend</p>
<p>   to do. We must use whatever diplomatic influence we have. We do</p>
<p>   have some, not as much as other countries but we do have certain</p>
<p>   things in common with both of those countries, membership of the</p>
<p>   Commonwealth, shared historical and other links. We really do need</p>
<p>   to draw on all of those and the rest of the world needs to draw</p>
<p>   on all of those to confront both countries with the dangerous reality.</p>
<p>   And the amazing thing is that the ongoing tension between the two</p>
<p>   countries still, in the main, goes back to the dispute over that</p>
<p>   province that they argued over at the time of the partition of the</p>
<p>   Indian sub-continent in 1947 - that's Kashmir. And it really</p>
<p>   is just crazy but then I suppose it's fair to say that it's</p>
<p>   taken more than 50 years to get the warring tribes in Northern Ireland</p>
<p>   to sit down and talk to each other so I guess some would say 50</p>
<p>   years is not all that long.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you think there's a point to supporting boycotts and that</p>
<p>   sort of thing?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't like them. I don't see a lot of point in them, I don't.</p>
<p>   I never have.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you think this is, is it posturing, is it chest thumping or do</p>
<p>   you think it is genuinely dangerous, in the sense danger of conflict?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, once you have nuclear weapons in the hands of two countries</p>
<p>   next door to each other who have been at loggerheads, who have fought</p>
<p>   conventional wars with each other within the last 50 years, once</p>
<p>   those two countries have nuclear weapons the danger of something</p>
<p>   happening is much, much greater. Even in the calmest analysis you</p>
<p>   would have to concede that and these two countries, and there is</p>
<p>   an enmity based in history, in religious and ethnic difference and</p>
<p>   bitter political rivalry over the ownership of what was seen as</p>
<p>   a symbolic prize at the time of Indian partition in 1947 - that's</p>
<p>   the control of the state of Kashmir and that issue has still not</p>
<p>   been resolved. Now, we may all think that is unbelievable but I</p>
<p>   guess when you look at the disputes that have gone on for more than</p>
<p>   50 years in other parts of the world, those two countries are not</p>
<p>   alone in being at loggerheads over that one thing, and other things,</p>
<p>   but that's really at the core of it for such a long period</p>
<p>   of time.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay. We've got a caller through on this issue so we will take</p>
<p>   that if that's okay. Hello Dean, go ahead.</p>
<p> CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning. My gripe, if you like, is simply, how come these so-called</p>
<p>   third world countries with no money can afford to find the money</p>
<p>   for these bombs and yet countries like Australia keep on supporting</p>
<p>   them, when it's money that would probably be better spent here</p>
<p>   in Australia.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well, I suppose we are generous hearted enough as a community to</p>
<p>   believe that even though we have a lot of our own problems, the</p>
<p>   living standard of people in these countries is so desperately low</p>
<p>   and there is no comparison between life of the ordinary Indian and</p>
<p>   the ordinary Pakistani.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>If Australia is....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>We don't contribute an enormous amount of aid.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How much is it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well I think it would be in the tens of millions, it wouldn't</p>
<p>   be more than that. I can't tell you off-hand the exact figure.</p>
<p>   But they are not the major recipients of aid from Australia. They</p>
<p>   do get some aid from Australia and I think a country such as Australia</p>
<p>   should always be willing to give some aid to the less fortunate.</p>
<p>   But can I say....</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible] stops now does it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well we suspended non-humanitarian aid, that is, aid in areas other</p>
<p>   than say medicines and food stuffs and that kind of thing, items</p>
<p>   similar to that. We suspended those in relation to India. We will</p>
<p>   obviously be doing the same in relation to Pakistan. You've</p>
<p>   always got an agonising choice here. You want to punish the political</p>
<p>   deeds of the government of the country but you don't want to</p>
<p>   make it even harder for people who already find life very hard within</p>
<p>   that country. And that is a very agonising dilemma. But can I say</p>
<p>   to Dean, the answer to your question is, how can they find the money.</p>
<p>   They find the money by being even meaner in their dealings with</p>
<p>   their people. They are much meaner than they should be and I think</p>
<p>   it is morally reprehensible that countries as poor as India and</p>
<p>   Pakistan should squander their scarce resources on these sorts of</p>
<p>   exploits and that really is quite tragic. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, if we may move onto the tax .... </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Now obviously you stand by your promise that once a GST rate once</p>
<p>   introduced, it will not increase unless I'm correct and that's</p>
<p>   what you said.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And that's not just for a term of Parliament or that's</p>
<p>   how long....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>What it means simply is that as far as I am concerned it won't</p>
<p>   go up.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Okay. What about the tax rates? I assume that you will make changes</p>
<p>   to the tax rates as part of this package. Will the top tax rate</p>
<p>   come down, will the corporate tax come down?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well, I can't really go into that at this stage because quite</p>
<p>   frankly, quite frankly Neil, we haven't finished the package,</p>
<p>   we are still working on it. We are fairly well advanced but we haven't</p>
<p>   finished it. There will be reductions in personal income tax. But</p>
<p>   the most important thing I want to say to the Australian public</p>
<p>   about this tax reform package is that reforming the tax system is</p>
<p>   the next logical step in making Australia a more secure country</p>
<p>   economically. It is very important to our security and stability</p>
<p>   and safety, particularly against the background of what's happening</p>
<p>   in Asia.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Just one point I am making is that if the GST rate is to be set</p>
<p>   in stone it's not going to change and you do bring down the</p>
<p>   rates as you'll have to I assume as part of the package. Are</p>
<p>   they set in stone as well or do they increase at later stages?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well, deeds are more important than words I suppose in these things</p>
<p>   and we've brought down three budgets and there has been no</p>
<p>   increase in personal tax rates. There's been no increase in</p>
<p>   company tax rates and there's been no increase in wholesale</p>
<p>   tax rates in the three budgets that we've brought down. Obviously</p>
<p>   it would not be our wish to increase any levels of taxation.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Yeah but you see my point, you are going to the people....one would</p>
<p>   think, around the 30-30-10 tax rate and 10 per cent GST. Once you</p>
<p>   present that to people the is whole thing set or is there a possibility</p>
<p>   that down the track the GST stays the same but the tax rates go</p>
<p>   up again?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Neil, I'll be presenting the package, there is a lot of speculation</p>
<p>   around at the moment as to what's in it. I am not going to</p>
<p>   respond to this or that piece of speculation but obviously because</p>
<p>   a broad-based indirect tax or a GST would be a new way of levying</p>
<p>   indirect tax in this country, most of the focus will be on that,</p>
<p>   or has been on it. But it's the overall package and the benefit</p>
<p>   to the Australian economy of the overall package that really counts.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Okay, but we'd be right in assuming that there will be changes</p>
<p>   to the top tax rate and the corporate rate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well I am not going to go into the detail of what may or may not</p>
<p>   happen to individual rates or what individual rates might be. I</p>
<p>   have avoided doing that and I am going to continue avoiding doing</p>
<p>   that until the detail of the package is announced. I will, however,</p>
<p>   repeat the assurance I gave last year that the overall tax burden</p>
<p>   will not rise and that there will be reductions in personal income</p>
<p>   tax. Now in aggregate the package is designed to improve the strength</p>
<p>   and the security of the Australian economy. We are reforming the</p>
<p>   tax system because we think it is in the national economic interest</p>
<p>   to do it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can I ask about the fuel excise because Mr Fischer seemed to be</p>
<p>   suggesting a couple of days ago there'd be a change to fuel</p>
<p>   excise, is that correct?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well, once again that is one of the issues that, along with a whole</p>
<p>   lot of other issues, is being considered. I am not going to confirm</p>
<p>   or deny any changes in that area any more than I am going to confirm</p>
<p>   or deny changes to particular rates of income tax. I am just not</p>
<p>   going to go any further on that, not that I don't want to take</p>
<p>   the Australian public fully into my confidence. I mean they will</p>
<p>   have all of the detail before the next election. They will have</p>
<p>   time to consider it. We will lay out our plans and if the Australian</p>
<p>   public believes that our plan is in the best interests of the country,</p>
<p>   they'll support it. If they don't, well they can vote</p>
<p>   against it. Now I don't say that aggressively or provocatively</p>
<p>   but I do think that something as important as this people are entitled</p>
<p>   to be told before the election what our plan is and we are going</p>
<p>   to tell them. We are going to be open and transparent and honest</p>
<p>   and I'll answer questions on it. But until we've completed</p>
<p>   all the work I am not going to piecemeal respond to individual questions</p>
<p>   much in all as I understand the interest of you and your listeners</p>
<p>   and I don't blame you for asking me but I'm just not going</p>
<p>   to do it at the moment.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Okay. We've got a couple of calls.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Hello Ian, go ahead.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes Neil. It's regarding, Mr Howard, it's regarding the</p>
<p>   transfer of some of the tax collection from income to spending.</p>
<p>   I am a self-funded retiree and I feel that I am going to be a casualty</p>
<p>   here. I've earnt concessions on tax through deductible amounts</p>
<p>   in rebates but I don't pay tax on the first $30,000 I draw</p>
<p>   and I estimate that I'll probably spent....cost me about $30</p>
<p>   a week with the introduction of a GST.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well I don't know how you can possibly make that calculation</p>
<p>   unless somebody has sort of suggested a figure for the purposes</p>
<p>   of this programme because you don't know what the figures of</p>
<p>   our tax policy are. I mean how can you say you are losing $30 a</p>
<p>   week when you don't know what's in the package?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Well, it's only a rough estimate, I've....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>I am sorry sir....</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I've gone half at 10%.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well I am sorry sir, you don't know what is in the package.</p>
<p>   So can I say to you with the greatest of respect, please suspend</p>
<p>   your judgement until we bring the package out. I do ask you to do</p>
<p>   that, I mean, it's very easy at the moment for our opponents</p>
<p>   to run around saying this or that and creating concern in the community.</p>
<p>   It amounts to the easy, lazy political option for the Labor Party</p>
<p>   at the moment. But sir, wait until the package comes out. We have</p>
<p>   been very sensitive to the needs of self-funded retirees. In the</p>
<p>   last Budget, you know we extended the Seniors' Card to self-funded</p>
<p>   retirees. And judging by what you have told me, before that Budget</p>
<p>   announcement you wouldn't have been entitled to that Seniors'</p>
<p>   Card and from the 1st of January next year you will. So once again</p>
<p>   look at our deeds, don't listen to the words of our opponents.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Thanks Ian. Another GST call, Hayden, go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes, good morning Mr Howard how are you? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>I'm well.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I just thought I'd ask one area where you obviously can comment.</p>
<p>   The Opposition intends to block this in the Senate. I mean they're</p>
<p>   akin to saying they don't want people to breathe as far as</p>
<p>   the election goes. This issue is obviously going to be put up to</p>
<p>   an election and I would just call on Mr Beazley and others if the</p>
<p>   Liberal Party are returned to allow it to pass in the Senate. You</p>
<p>   know, we have democratic rights and freedoms and we would like both</p>
<p>   parties to accept those and uphold those.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Yeah, we did talk about that a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well I obviously agree with what Hayden said. I mean he is absolutely</p>
<p>   right. I will be going to the Australian public with a detailed</p>
<p>   tax plan. It will be a huge issue in the election campaign. If the</p>
<p>   public votes me back as Prime Minister then I have every moral,</p>
<p>   political and I think ordinary common sense right to say to the</p>
<p>   opposition parties in the Senate, "will you please let through</p>
<p>   the legislation that the Australian people supported". Now,</p>
<p>   if they in the face of that say no', they are really</p>
<p>   thumbing their nose at the public and they are demonstrating they've</p>
<p>   learnt nothing from their defeat in 1996.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, One Nation. On your personal ballot paper, would you</p>
<p>   put Labor ahead of One Nation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that is something I will announce when all other preference</p>
<p>   arrangements are announced.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What about your personal ballot paper?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You mean my personal ballot paper? Well I'll obviously, I'll</p>
<p>   obviously vote the same way in my electorate as I ask my supporters</p>
<p>   to vote. It would be rather hypocritical of me personally to say</p>
<p>   one thing to my supporters and then in the privacy of a ballot box</p>
<p>   do something else. I think that is the height of hypocrisy. But</p>
<p>   how I will recommend people vote in my electorate as Party leader</p>
<p>   is something that I will announce when other preference arrangements</p>
<p>   are announced.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Does that mean there's a possibility One Nation could still</p>
<p>   get the nod ahead of Labor?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think you should necessarily infer that. I don't</p>
<p>   think you should infer that in either way.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you agree with the comments of Malcolm Fraser today where he</p>
<p>   has attacked One Nation very strongly?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I disagree...</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>And criticising of the Queensland Government.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm not criticising the Queensland Government. I mean</p>
<p>   we ought to get a reality check about Queensland. There's only</p>
<p>   one issue to be resolved in Queensland, and that, over the next</p>
<p>   couple of weeks, and that is whether Rob Borbidge or Peter Beattie</p>
<p>   is the Premier after the 13th of June.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yeah but how far do you go with political expediency to achieve</p>
<p>   that and that's the point that Malcolm Fraser's making.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you're talking here about the question of who is the</p>
<p>   Premier of Queensland. Now there are a lot of people who are attracted</p>
<p>   to the One Nation Party apparently, in a superficial way, for I</p>
<p>   think, very insubstantial reasons and I think what the leaders of</p>
<p>   the mainstream political parties should be doing is talking directly</p>
<p>   to those people and saying that you are wasting your vote in supporting</p>
<p>   the One Nation Party. If the One Nation Party were to achieve influence</p>
<p>   in Queensland then that would be a bad thing.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you believe it would hurt Australia if One Nation won seats</p>
<p>   in Queensland, if the perception in Asia would be that we had moved</p>
<p>   to this new right?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it would be better if One Nation didn't win seats</p>
<p>   anywhere. But I don't think that the ways to ensure that is</p>
<p>   necessarily the path advocated by many people in the community who</p>
<p>   disagree with my approach. I believe the best way to diminish the</p>
<p>   influence of One Nation - I mean I agree with people who say it</p>
<p>   would be a bad thing if One Nation won seats, I do agree with them</p>
<p>   - I happen to believe the best way to diminish the influence of</p>
<p>   the One Nation Party is to talk in a calm sensible manner to the</p>
<p>   people who are superficially attracted to One Nation.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, should Malcolm Fraser have stayed out of this?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look I just don't want to talk about Malcolm Fraser I'm</p>
<p>   sorry. Well I mean you can ask me about him.....</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well he's criticised...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I know, all right...</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>You're the Prime Minister....[inaudible].</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I know, well he can do that but, I can also as the current Prime</p>
<p>   Minister, Neil, if I choose, I can choose simply not to respond</p>
<p>   to what Mr Fraser has said and can go on and talk about what is</p>
<p>   contemporary and what is important, and that is how my Party and</p>
<p>   the National Party say to those people who may otherwise support</p>
<p>   our two Parties, who may be flirting with One Nation, what we should</p>
<p>   be doing is saying to them it's a wasted vote, that the deep</p>
<p>   seated concerns that you have can best be addressed by the Liberal</p>
<p>   Party and the National Party without the negative things that attached</p>
<p>   to support for One Nation. I mean it's plainly the case that</p>
<p>   a number of the policies One Nation has embraced are wrong and negative</p>
<p>   and against Australia's interests. Now the best way to diminish</p>
<p>   One Nation's support is not to scream abuse at people who might</p>
<p>   be considering supporting One Nation, rather it is to talk to those</p>
<p>   people in.....</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Surely it's not to do a deal with to get yourself into Government</p>
<p>   which is what......</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well see, I don't agree with that. I don't agree with</p>
<p>   that at all. I believe the most sensible thing to do is to pursue</p>
<p>   a policy which diminishes the influence of One Nation by explaining</p>
<p>   to people who are attracted to that Party in a temporary transient</p>
<p>   way why it's a wasted vote to support that Party.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is it a racist Party?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think some of the people who support it are racist.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Are their policies racist?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well some of their policies , if they are seriously wanting to</p>
<p>   discriminate against migrants coming to this country on the basis</p>
<p>   of race, then of course it is. I mean I believe, I believe in a</p>
<p>   completely non-discriminatory immigration policy. But can I say</p>
<p>   this, that most of the people, or many of the people who are attracted</p>
<p>   to One Nation, it's very hard to quantify these things, are</p>
<p>   people in the main, living in regional areas of Australia who've</p>
<p>   suffered economic set backs. I understand that and I understand</p>
<p>   that life in some parts of regional Australia is difficult. And</p>
<p>   what I'm saying to them is that your concerns will be better</p>
<p>   met if you support the Liberal and National Parties. Pauline Hanson</p>
<p>   has no answers to regional unemployment that haven't been considered</p>
<p>   by my Government. I mean I haven't heard a single thing that</p>
<p>   Mrs Hanson or any of her supporters have uttered over the past few</p>
<p>   months that will in any way improve the lot of the people who are</p>
<p>   attracted to her. So, my policy and my approach is to try and engage</p>
<p>   some of the people who are attracted to her, listen to them, try</p>
<p>   and understand why they are attracted, point out the ill wisdom</p>
<p>   of supporting a party that is seen as offensive to many Australians</p>
<p>   of Asian descent and I think if we address the people who are attracted</p>
<p>   to her rather than yelling at them in a censorious fashion, we've</p>
<p>   got more opportunity of getting them back and denying Mrs Hanson</p>
<p>   any Parliamentary representation.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, than</p>
<p>Mr Howard, thank you very much for your time again.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
