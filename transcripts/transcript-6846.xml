    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>2 March 1986</strong></p>
<p>I am pleased to announced that Ms Suzanne Brooks has been appointed as Head of the Office of the Status of Women. Ms Brooks is currently a Senior Ministerial Adviser to the Treasurer of Victoria. In that position she was responsible for providing advice to the Treasurer and the Premier on strategic, budgetary, financial and economic policy. More recently she had responsibility for reform of the Victorian Motor Accident Compensation ( Compulsory Third Party) and new Workers, Compensation arrangements. Both reforms will improve the status and financial independence of women as earners and householders. Hs Brooks has also been involved in designing reforms to the Victorian public sector superannuation scheme which will improve women's entitlements in that scheme.</p>
<p>Ms Brooks will bring to the office of the Status of Women a strong background in economics and finance which will enable the Office to continue and enhance its record of advice on measures to improve women's economic status.</p>
<p>Ms Brooks will take up her position this month.</p>
<p>She will succeed Dr Anne Summers in this position and I want to take this opportunity to place on record my own and the Government's recognition of the contribution made by Dr Summers during her period at the office. in particular<br />Dr Summers' contribution in the development and introduction of the Affirmative Action legislation will stand as a tribute to her service in the office of the Status of women.</p>
