    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>2 MarchÂ 1986</strong></p>
<p>I am pleased to announced that Ms Suzanne Brooks has beenÂ appointed as Head of the Office of the Status of Women. Ms BrooksÂ is currently a Senior Ministerial Adviser to the Treasurer ofÂ Victoria. In that position she was responsible for providingÂ advice to the Treasurer and the Premier on strategic, budgetary,Â financial and economic policy. More recently she hadÂ responsibility for reform of the Victorian Motor AccidentÂ Compensation ( Compulsory Third Party) and new Workers,Â Compensation arrangements. Both reforms will improve the statusÂ and financial independence of women as earners and householders.Â Hs Brooks has also been involved in designing reforms to theÂ Victorian public sector superannuation scheme which will improveÂ women's entitlements in that scheme.</p>
<p>Ms Brooks will bring to the office of the Status of Women aÂ strong background in economics and finance which will enable theÂ Office to continue and enhance its record of advice on measuresÂ to improve women's economic status.</p>
<p>Ms Brooks will take up her position this month.</p>
<p>She will succeed Dr Anne Summers in this position and I want toÂ take this opportunity to place on record my own and theÂ Government's recognition of the contribution made byÂ Dr Summers during her period at the office. in particular<br />Dr Summers' contribution in the development and introduction ofÂ the Affirmative Action legislation will stand as a tribute to herÂ service in the office of the Status of women.</p>
