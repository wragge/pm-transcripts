FOR PRESS: PM No. 9/ 1971<br />
EXPORT OF MERINO RAMS<br />
Statement-by-the Prime Minister, Mr. john Gorton<br />
On Ist February '. 970 the Government, acting on the<br />
recommendation of the Australian Wool Industry Conference, partially<br />
lifted the embargo on the export of merino rams.<br />
The original embargo had been imposed by executive action<br />
and lifting it did not require legislation or Parliamentary sanction.<br />
Subsequently the A. C. T. U. placed a ban on the export of these<br />
rams, and trade unions have refused to refuel a foreign aircraft chartered<br />
by the overseas buyers of the rams.<br />
The Government cannot permit a situation in which Australian<br />
exporters are prevented from honouring their commitments in<br />
international trade.<br />
To do so would be to allow industrial action, undertaken for<br />
political purposes, to interfer with overseas trade and damage Australia's<br />
good name in the eyes of the world.<br />
This we will not permit.<br />
The Government has therefore taken steps to ensure that the<br />
rams will be delivered to those who bought them in good faith. Air Force<br />
facilities are being made available to enable the aircraft concerned to be<br />
refu. 1-led, load the rams, and depart for its destination.<br />
