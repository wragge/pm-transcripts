VISIT TO SOUTH EAST ASIA 1968<br />
SINGAPORE<br />
ARRIVAL PRESS CCNFERENCE GIVEN BY THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER, MR. JCHN GCRTCN, AT AIRPCPT 6 JUNE 1968<br />
Q. ( Question on reaction of Senator Kennedy's death.<br />
PM. I can only say what I said at home, that I was absolutely<br />
sickened when I heard that this attack had been made upon him. I do not<br />
see how a democratic country can run, if people who put a point of view<br />
with which you disagree are subject to assassination. I do not see how a<br />
democratic country can run if a minority resorts to force And violence to<br />
try and overthrow a point of view with which they disagree. I find this<br />
quite shocking, not only personally from the point of view of Robert<br />
Kennedy and his family but from the point of view of the proper conduct<br />
of public affairs. Although I have never met him, I find it completely<br />
devastating that this could have happened, particularly to two brothers,<br />
S two brothers of the one family in so short a time. Both really because<br />
they had points of view with which others did not agree.<br />
Q. Tell us something of the purpose of your visit. Is it a visit<br />
of friendship to see other Prime Ministers?<br />
PM. Well, the major purpose is to meet the people who are in<br />
charge of the countries in our region and to demonstrate that that -policy<br />
which my predecessor, Mr. Holt, furthered, of interest in and close<br />
co-operation with our neighbours, was a continuing policy as far as I am!<br />
concerned.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, how do you feel about going in to Vietnam<br />
e tomorrow morning?<br />
FM. W'hat do you mean how do I feel about it?<br />
0Q. Are you scared?<br />
PM. No. Look there is an old Italian proverb " Che Sera, Sera"-<br />
and I have no doubt it is in other languages also. So that's your answer.<br />
Q. Sir, when Mrs. Gandhi was in your country she said she was<br />
interested in international guarantees for the security of South East Asia.<br />
How do you feel about it?<br />
PM. We had a most delightful visit from Mrs. Gandhi. I think<br />
that she enjoyed her stay and we certainly enjoyed having her with us. A<br />
guarantee is a word and I don't think anything was spelt out during Mrs.<br />
Gandhi's visit, nor were any particular proposals put forward. But I do<br />
believe if all of us together in this region can do what we can to see that<br />
military force is not used, that aggression does not take place, that there<br />
is co-operation and -development, then that can do nothing but good to all<br />
of us in this region.<br />
Q. Do you think that Peking will react to any such proposal?<br />
PM. I wouldn't attempt to try and think of reactions in Peking to<br />
any proposal, whatever.<br />
Q. Would you like Australia to have a dialogue with communist<br />
China? </p>
<p>What precisely do you mean by a dialogue?<br />
Would you have diplomatic relations with communist China?<br />
The Government's policy is not to have diplomatic relations<br />
with communist China.<br />
PM. Q. PM. </p>
