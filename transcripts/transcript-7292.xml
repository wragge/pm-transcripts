PRIMINEI STE<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF THE-AUSTRALIAN BALLET CENTRE<br />
MELBOURNE 18 FEBRUARY 1988<br />
It is a very great honor to be here to open the new<br />
Australian Ballet Centre with my friend and colleague John<br />
Cain. I was interested to note, when the invitation was extended<br />
to me to be here today, that a Gala Performance of " Sleeping<br />
Beauty" is to be staged later this evening.<br />
It is of course a Ballet of great distinction, and I am<br />
looking forward to what will I am sure be a performance of<br />
excellence the kind of excellence and strength and<br />
discipline that ballet audiences in Australia and around the<br />
world have come to expect of the Australian Ballet Company.<br />
I wondered however whether there was any significance<br />
perhaps any compliment to my Government in the choice of a<br />
ballet called " Sleeping Beauty".<br />
I mean no disrespect to Tchaikovsky, but I wondered whether<br />
his title " Sleeping Beauty" refers to the state of the<br />
Australian nation before it was awakened, in the years<br />
following the election of my Government, by our policies to<br />
revive the economy, and reinvigorate the social and cultural<br />
life of our nation including through our support for the<br />
arts. But I realised that this was not an occasion for partisan<br />
considerations. I finally realised that " Sleeping Beauty" must refer to this<br />
part of Melbourne before it was revived and redeveloped into<br />
an arts precinct of a concentration and quality unrivalled<br />
in this country.<br />
When we think back to the Yarra banks before the National<br />
Gallery moved here and before the Arts Centre was built, we<br />
realise that here was a site that indeed was a Sleeping<br />
Beauty. 004471 </p>
<p>With the Victorian College of the Arts and the Performing<br />
Arts Museum and now the Australian Ballet Centre, that site<br />
has been converted into a brilliant Arts City of<br />
international stature.<br />
This Centre will be the new home of the Australian Ballet<br />
Foundation and the Australian Ballet School, as well as<br />
providing office space for the Victorian Ministry for the<br />
Arts. The Commonwealth Government, through the Bicentennial<br />
Commemorative Program and through its annual subsidies to<br />
the Foundation and the School, is pleased to have played its<br />
part in funding and creating the new Centre.<br />
I pay tribute to the Victorian Government and the Ballet<br />
Centre itself for their efforts in raising the funds to<br />
create the Centre.<br />
I wish everyone involved in the Ballet Centre good luck in<br />
their new home and that is a safe prediction because I<br />
know the Australian Ballet will consolidate and build on its<br />
already outstanding contribution to the cultural life of<br />
Australia and of the world. 004472 </p>
