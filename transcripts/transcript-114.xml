SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE RT. HON. R. G.<br />
MENZIES, AT THE MASTER BUILDERS FEDERATION OF<br />
r AUSTRALIA CONFERENCE, ILSON HALL MELBOURNE UNIVERSITY,<br />
MONDY. TH OCTOBER 19<br />
Sir and ladies and gentlemen, I was very interested to<br />
be reminded that I was the number one ticket holder. I am the<br />
number one ticket holder of the Carlton Football Club. I hope<br />
I bring more luck to the builders.<br />
Now I want to begin with a complaint. We have a practice<br />
in Parliament of having questions without notice, and if anybody<br />
has a complaint to make about having been misrepresented he may<br />
get up and utter it. Well I am uttering mine. I received two<br />
or three days ago, some time ago a mass of most informative<br />
notes about the Federation, its fusion for this purpose with the<br />
Asian group; the history of it, together with a few rather encouraging<br />
points about the building industry as a whole. The<br />
Secretary sent these to me. It is quite obvious to me that he<br />
also sent them to the President, and the President has used them<br />
first. So everything that I have to say to you is really a rehash,<br />
but before I say it, might I tell you that it is a great<br />
experience for me to come here and be in this hall, believe it<br />
or not for the first time. I knew a great deal about the old<br />
one from the inside, having sat many anxious hours writing violently<br />
on pads of paper when I was doing my law course. But I<br />
am not at all sure that there is not one thing that I miss. I<br />
do not know where you are going to hang the portraits Sir George<br />
of the Chancellors. W! e used to look at them in my examination<br />
days and try to extract some inspiration from them. As a source<br />
of inspiration they were hopeless, and therefore I suppose that<br />
explains why the architects, egged on by the Council, decided<br />
that they would have no room left to hang any of these worthy<br />
gentlemen again. Now, Sir, I am a great believer in the master builders<br />
of this country, and really very largely for reasons that you<br />
have already mentioned. This organisation, as one realises by<br />
contact with it, by reading its papers, its constitution and its<br />
proceedings, has a most helpful and constructive prposo. I<br />
really believe that this organisation does not exist in order to<br />
prefer the interests of builders to the interests of the community,<br />
but to improve the contribution that builders make to the<br />
community. And that is of course a tremendous contribution.<br />
Right through the piece I have been struck by the fact that so<br />
long as I have known it, and that has been over a fair number of<br />
years now, though not back to 1890 this Federation has set out<br />
to raise the standards of performance and the standards of community<br />
service. If we could all do just that thing, all of us,<br />
whatever our occupations may be, it would be a pretty remarkable<br />
country, even more remarkable than it is now. Jo have, of<br />
course, in Australia and I say this, not that it is news to Aus.-<br />
tralians here, but that it may be to some of our notable .' Tsitors<br />
whom we are so glad to see here we have been passing through<br />
an era, a very remarkable era of prosperity in Australia, prosperity<br />
and advance. VWe have been able to protract investable<br />
funds. We have had, on the whole, good prices for our exports.<br />
We have had, a largo movement into this country of migrant people.<br />
Population has risen in the most remarkable fashion. All of<br />
these things have boon in themselves, good. They have produced<br />
some of dangers, one of the dangers of course being that in a<br />
period of expansion we live under the constant throat of inflation,<br />
as one of the by-products of an expansion , rhich occasionally<br />
may move too fast. But those things are, one hopes, manage--<br />
able, and on the whole they have been managed. But in spite of<br />
the fact that we have boon going through this rumarkable period<br />
of expansion we have also had remarkable stability inAustralia.<br />
We have been able to conduct our affairs successfully because of<br />
the existence of confidence in this country, and of course all of<br />
these things, stability, good sense, confidence, high prices for </p>
<p>the things that we grow and sell all of those things ultimately<br />
have been translated into what I believe is the greatest period<br />
of development which we have had in Australia.<br />
Development: when one thinks of development what does<br />
one think of? I regret to say not of lawyers, though we are a<br />
very useful commodity. I can remember vividly when in my very<br />
young days at the bar, being greatly pleased to got into a few<br />
cases which involved building disputes, because they always lasted<br />
such a long time. But having said that kind wori for the<br />
lawyers, I turn to say that development in Australia is associa-<br />
-ted, essentially, primarily and in fact in some respects, almost<br />
exclusively, with the industries that are represented here this<br />
morning: engineers, buildings, contractors. These are the<br />
people through whom the urge and capacity to expand in a country<br />
like this expresses itself. We go to the country and we look at<br />
great works of development. What are they? Irrigation, hydroelectric<br />
schemes, great road works, great works of agricultural<br />
improvement of a physical kind. All of these things express<br />
themselves in terms of engineers and contractors. ' Je look back<br />
over the enormous increase that we have had in our population,<br />
and we say that that must have presented a remarkable problem,<br />
not only in housing but in business construction, because we<br />
sometimes forget that it is a balanced ration that you need in<br />
these things and that groat office blocks and great factories<br />
are in their place as essential as housing is. And wrhat do we<br />
find? This Federation, as the Secretary reminded me, conducted<br />
a spirited interchange of ideas with my colleague, the Minister<br />
for Development, early in 1958 and I read of it with groat interest;<br />
very carefully prepared views of the Feder. tisn, and the<br />
very carefully prepared replies and commonts by my colleague,<br />
But there was at that time a feeling that some particular stimulus<br />
ought to be given to housing, because a year or two before,<br />
for a variety of circumstunces, there had been a slight falling<br />
off in the rate ofconstruction. And I therefore really interrupt<br />
myself to say that whether it was the result of your vigorous<br />
prodding or not, I do not know Mr President, but in 1957-58<br />
there were 74,000 houses and flats completed in Australia. That<br />
is a very remarkable number I think. Andin 1958-59, not 74,000<br />
but 84,000: a most remarkable increase which all the indications<br />
are will continue in the rate of construction, and one which, related<br />
to the population of Australia, must be regarded, I think,<br />
as a very satisfactory one.<br />
Now, Sir, I have just said in general that the building<br />
industry, the constructional industry, are at the very heart of<br />
the material progress of the country. And they are, not only<br />
because they build dams or houses or factories or office blocks<br />
or whatever they may be, but also because the building industry,<br />
using that expression comprehensively, is at one and the same<br />
time the index of social prosperity and the cause of social prosperity.<br />
In other rords this is a crucial industry,, You may use<br />
it as a measuring stick. You say: " Well let us consider whether<br />
we have circumstances of depression in the country, Do not<br />
lot us look at a few little single instances you get nowhere by<br />
that but take an industry like the building industry, in all<br />
its ramifications and say: : How do things go here? How is employment<br />
here? What is the volume of business here?'". If they<br />
are both high, you may be certain that the country is prosperous.<br />
They are the very index of prosperity or depression. And, at the<br />
same time, because of their very nature, they are one of he<br />
cardinal causes of prosperity because a great success in building<br />
and construction grows on itself. It employs more people; it<br />
enables more people to come here and live; it enables more peopl<br />
to establish themselves in well-paid work; it enables more<br />
people to set out to get their own homes, and therefore a great<br />
movement in the building industry tends to perpetuate itself for<br />
the benefit of ordinary people and is one of the causes of economic<br />
. advance. And therefore building, Sir, thoroughly deserves </p>
<p>3.<br />
to attract the attention of anybody you care to invite to come<br />
here, because it is an index of prosperity; it is one of the<br />
main causes of continued prosperity and it is certainly in calm,<br />
clear, physical terms, the main instrui. tent in national development.<br />
Now, Sir, having said that, which after all you have already<br />
yourself said this morning, though I have endeavoured to<br />
put it in my own way, just let me add one thing which is put into<br />
the mind by the fact that this cohvention is, as it has been described,<br />
a fusion between the Master Builders' Federation, for<br />
this purpose, and the Federation of Asian and Western Pacific<br />
Contractors Associations. Now that is a rather arresting conjunc<br />
-tion of the planet. You know one so readily thinks of building<br />
as essentially local I remember many years ago it was weightily<br />
argued, if I remember correctly, in the High Court of Australia,<br />
that you could not have an inter-State industrial dispute in<br />
building because no building was in more than one State a purely<br />
local form of activity, building and that of course is something<br />
that we can very easily get stuck into our minds, that it<br />
is a purely local matter and no connection with the firm next<br />
door. Each of us has his oim knowledge, his own methods. What<br />
does it matter about what goes on ulsewhere. And therefore, it<br />
is to me, a most imaginative thing that there should have been<br />
this Association between builders, constructional people in Australia,<br />
and those in nearby, or comparatively nearby, Asian countries.<br />
It is at once a demonstration of the fact that building<br />
and construction are not to be looked at solely in local terms,<br />
and of the even greater truth that however clever we may think we<br />
are, . re always have something to learn from our neighbour.<br />
This is a move calculated to stimulate thought, to<br />
stimulate an emulation of each other in our various countries,<br />
and to stimulate a rise in technical and technilogical standards.<br />
And this is a good thing for everybody; it is a good thing for<br />
us in Australia. ! e must not detach the problems of life into<br />
water-tight compartments and say: " Well, we'll just deal with<br />
one". You think of it. Uhat is it that does so much social good<br />
in a country like ours, that produces so much of that sturdy<br />
fibre which has already made Australia and which must be preserved<br />
and encouraged? That note of independence in the mind and<br />
in the heart. What is it that does it? Nothing more remarkable,<br />
in my opinion, than the creation of homes for ownership and for<br />
pride. It is a wonderful thing for me to look back over the<br />
last ten years and to realise that the percentage of houses<br />
built for oiwmership in Australia has, in that period, increased<br />
enormously and that we should have a population living under its<br />
own vine and fig-tree, proud of its home, earning its home, its<br />
place in the world. This is one of the greatest things that can<br />
happen to a country. And if we are to have ownership and pride,<br />
with all the solid citizenship that goes with these things, then<br />
it is for the building industries constantly to strive to become<br />
more and more efficient; to pursue every advance in quality and<br />
economy, because you cannot have a home, you cannot have its<br />
ovmership or its pride unless the cost of it and the quality of<br />
it are able to attract you, having regard to your income and your<br />
prospects in life. Cost and quality, and both of these things<br />
depend upon an almost religious fervour in the pursuit of more<br />
and more efficient methods. After all, a house, a bridge, a<br />
great office block, some great works, may be and will be the<br />
visible and enduring memorial of the builder the engineer, the<br />
contractor. That is one of the great advanLges that he has.<br />
His memorial is visible, it is enduring, but the greatest memorial<br />
that the Building Federation can have is to know that year by<br />
year it is not only by using its own resources, but by cultivating<br />
the knowledge and friendship of people from the other countries<br />
around the world, that it is . improving standards, that it<br />
is building better, that it is putting quality into the work and<br />
that efficiency has meant that the cost of a home is not prohibited<br />
for the very man himself, who works onthe job. </p>
<p>4.<br />
I am a great believer myself, in the constant battle<br />
for the raising of standards. There is a great temptation in<br />
every democracy to lower then, on the ground that to lower the<br />
standard is democratic because more people can achieve it. This<br />
must be resisted. This Federation, and its allies for this purpose<br />
this morning, exists I venture to say, primarily to raise<br />
standards. I believe that it has worked in that sense with<br />
great vigor and with great honesty. I have a very profound respect<br />
for this work and for the people who are engaged in it. I<br />
wish it aell. I declare this Convention opened. </p>
