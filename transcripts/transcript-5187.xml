PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 28 OCTOBER 1979<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
DELIVERED BY THE TREASURER, THE HON. J. HOWARD, MP<br />
This Government's commitment to tax reform remains absolute.<br />
We have demonstrated that we are a government of lower taxes.<br />
our radical restructuring of the tax scales the lowering<br />
of those scales, our tax incentives to industry, the removal<br />
of estate and gift duties, the removal of tax inequities,<br />
and our f ight against tax avoidance unmatched by any other<br />
government since Federation stand as irrefutable evidence<br />
of our commitment to tax reform. That commitment is an ongoing one.<br />
In Parliament this week I introduced legislation to raise the<br />
retention allowance for private companies from 60 per cent to<br />
per cent. This comes on top of the previous increase from<br />
per cent to 60 per cent announced in the 1976-77 Budget.<br />
It will mean that small and medium sized companies will be able to<br />
retain more capital within their businesses which in turn will<br />
create investment and jobs.<br />
Small businesses are a vital part of Australian life and a source<br />
of creativity and new ideas often not found in larger concerns.<br />
We recognise the important part they play in our economy and we<br />
have progressively taken steps to assist them in maintaining<br />
adequate working capital.. The Government intends to increase<br />
the sales tax exemption levels for small businesses..<br />
The current levels of annual turnover above which a manufacturer<br />
is required to pay sales tax are $ 1,000 for goods made exclusively<br />
in the manufacturer's own home and $ 1,400 for goods made elsewhere.<br />
These levels have become increasingly unrealistic. So the new<br />
sales tax exemption level will now be based on an annual turnover<br />
of $ 12,000 and the annual sales tax liability exemption will be<br />
increased from $ 100 to $ 250. In deciding -to introduce these<br />
changes the Government particularly had in mind the many people<br />
engaged in handicrafts at home.<br />
The Government is also progressively introducing other measures<br />
to help personal income tax payers. These include the decision<br />
to increase the provisional tax threshold from $ 400 to $ 1,000<br />
which will free many thousands of taxpayers, particularly those<br />
with small investments, and pensioners, from the annual provisional<br />
tax payment. The Government has extended the exemption from sales<br />
tax on equipment for the blind and the deaf to cover equipment<br />
used by all. handicapped people. / 2<br />

<p>We have also taken action to remove an anomaly between the tax<br />
deductibility of-gifts to certain religious funds. This means<br />
that gifts to funds set up by Roman Catholic archdioceses for<br />
religious instruction in government schools will now be tax<br />
deductible. Australians are generous people. Their controbution to education<br />
and to need wherever it may arise should be helped and encouraged<br />
by any government.<br />
We . Lnderstood quickly that the horror of Kampuchea had struck a<br />
responsive chord in -the heart of all Australians. The Government<br />
acted in send5ing-immediate help to the people of that country<br />
and made private donations tofrhe Kampuchean Relief Appeal tax<br />
deductible. In the rural sector, the Government has also recognised a number<br />
of areas of special need. In the August Budget, a new iate of<br />
depreciation for on-farm hay, grain and fodder storage facilities<br />
was introduced. This decision was taken because of a heavy harvest<br />
which found bulk storage facilities wanting in Australia's great<br />
grain belts. More on-farm storage is needed to meet what could<br />
be another good harvest next season. The move will, of course,<br />
not only help to meet an immediate need but hopefully will<br />
encourage the man-on-the-land to conserve fodder.<br />
As you are all no doubt aware the tax surcharge imposed last<br />
November will come off from the end of next month. This means<br />
that for a person on average weekly earnings there will be an<br />
additional $ 4.45 a week in take-home. pay.<br />
The thrust of our policies is to lower the tax burden. This is<br />
a cornerstone of Liberal philosophy which spells out a simple<br />
message Australians must be given the capacity to determine<br />
their own priorities.<br />
We understand that higher taxes run counter to this belief; they<br />
minimise individual freedom, and increase the Government's<br />
direction over people's lives. Our political opponents stand<br />
for big government, big spending, big def its and big taxes.<br />
As Labor's economic spokesman, Mr Willis, has said, a Labor<br />
government would be committed to a " mammoth task in rebuilding<br />
the public sector.... in convincing the electorate that it should<br />
pay a higher level of tax to enable us to do so". They are his<br />
very own words. These words are a stark and telling reminder<br />
of our basic difference in approach to government.<br />
We reject Labor's high tax philosophy out of hand.<br />
