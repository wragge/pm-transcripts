COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY 2O2* C T~ 9<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
POWER HOUSE FOR CENTRAL QUEENSLAND<br />
( Minlisterial Statement)<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 26 September 1 969]<br />
Mr GORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
-by leave-In September 1968 the Premier<br />
of Queensland wrote to me concerning<br />
negotiations between the Queensland<br />
Treasurer and industrialists interested<br />
in major development in Queensland. The<br />
Queensland Government intended to build<br />
a power house in central Queensland to<br />
feed electricity into the Queensland grid,<br />
and proposed that the Commonwealth<br />
might provide capital so that the power<br />
house would be larger than one required<br />
solely for this purpose, and so that the<br />
additional capacity could be used to attract<br />
industries to central Queensland. The basic<br />
requirement for such industries, if they are<br />
to be so attracted, is the provision of large<br />
blocks of power on a continuous load basis,<br />
at tariffs comparable with those offering in<br />
major industrial centres overseas. If this<br />
could be attained it appeared there was a<br />
real possibility of the development, in that<br />
underdeveloped area, of a new industrial<br />
complex that would grow and become a<br />
tangible expression of our interest in decentralised<br />
development.<br />
At this point I stress the advantages<br />
which this underdeveloped part of Australia<br />
possesses. There are vast coal deposits and<br />
cheap steaming coal is available as a byproduct<br />
of the coking coal export industry.<br />
There are extensive brine deposits as raw<br />
material for a power intensive chemical<br />
industry producing caustic soda for the<br />
22750/ 69 alumina industry and chlorine for export.<br />
The existing alumina industry will expand<br />
with consequent opportunity for aluminium<br />
production, which requires large amounts<br />
of power. A deep water port and harbour<br />
facilities suitable for bulk carriers are<br />
ready at hand in Gladstone. All in all it<br />
is an area crying out for that development,<br />
and for that use of its natural resources,<br />
which will benefit the area itself and add<br />
to the greatness of the nation. It offers an<br />
exciting opportunity for a great stride forward<br />
in national development. And it offers<br />
opportunity to increase our exports.<br />
After preliminary consideration I<br />
arranged with the Premier that Commonwealth<br />
and State officials should examine<br />
the proposal. In March 1969 our officials<br />
met with their Queensland colleagues to<br />
consider the technical proposals prepared<br />
by the State Electricity Commission of<br />
Queensland. These official discussions continued<br />
in April and May. At that time the<br />
Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority<br />
was retained as consultants to make an<br />
independent study of the proposal. The<br />
Authority presented a comprehensive report.<br />
Following study of it by the officials, the<br />
Premier of Queensland, on 25th August<br />
1969, presented the State's financial proposals<br />
for the development of the project.<br />
An interdepartmental committee, after<br />
examining the project in depth, reported to<br />
us on 19th September. </p>
<p>The Government is greatly impressed<br />
with the potential of the project both for<br />
the development of central Queensland and<br />
for the development of exports. We are<br />
convinced that the project is feasible from<br />
a technical point of view. We believe the<br />
estimates of cost are soundly based technically<br />
and financially. We believe thatgiven<br />
the establishment of certain key industries-<br />
there is a real prospect of<br />
attracting a variety of other important<br />
industries in the future. Given an initial<br />
stimulus we think that growth will continue.<br />
We believe that the wide spaces of<br />
central Queensland, which are presently<br />
underpopulated, will be able to develop<br />
natural resources to the full and will see<br />
towns grow to cities. Therefore, on behalf<br />
of the Commonwealth I have advised the<br />
Queensland Premier and Treasurer that we<br />
are prepared to advance up to $ 80 million<br />
to the State over a 6 year period to help<br />
with this scheme. It is proposed that the<br />
advance should be repayable over 30 years<br />
and that it should bear interest at the semi-<br />
Governmental rate. This offer is made for the purpose of<br />
financing that part of the power station<br />
which will meet the requirements of the<br />
special industrial development envisaged<br />
and it is hoped that this will enable the<br />
power station to sell bulk supplies to the<br />
industries at rates which will enable them<br />
to compete in world markets. The offer will<br />
enable the Queensland Government to proceed<br />
further with its negotiations with<br />
industry and to settle with the Commonwealth,<br />
as a result of such negotiation, the<br />
exact amount of the advances which will<br />
be required and the final terms and conditions<br />
for the servicing of the loan. The<br />
offer is, of course, conditional on the State<br />
being able to satisfy the Commonwealth<br />
that it can attract a viable export-oriented<br />
industrial complex in central Queensland<br />
with a demand appropriate to the output of<br />
that part of the station which the Commonwealth<br />
contribution is intended to finance.<br />
Should this proposal come to completion<br />
I believe it will provide a great strengthening<br />
of Queensland and of the Commonwealth<br />
as a whole.<br />
