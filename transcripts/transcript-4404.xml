saThlutaneous elactions proposal, iclig &amp; Sir Charles Co. uxt,<br />

WbeA thtw decision to hold the reieiendumns was announced, Sir<br />
Ch. arleq Court comma-nte~ a thait tbe ' proposal ; Eor sirultaeo<br />
elections made " goo-d setse'<br />
ThiS, BUPppOrt was enti-rely consistent with the support giv! en by<br />
S; Lr Charles Court and other niembeis of the Wegtern Austzalian<br />
delegation -at Ioba-t.<br />
I regret tbe Premier's puzzling last minute reversal of ' hi s<br />
attitude on proposals theti-are . stzighfowat3, reasonalle and<br />
fair. This is out of. clbiacter for Oir ChaleB, esxpecially in<br />
-the light of the co~ 2ent by Sir Eric Wli<br />
The four proposals on which-Western Australians and all o tber<br />
Australians will ba asked to vote for~ on Saturaay ax-e:<br />
1. That elections for the House of Representatives an-the<br />
oldbe held at the ' same time. This is a rnatter<br />
of simple co~ ont Bense. Unless this proposal is pnssed,<br />
. ther-e could be as nany as four Federal elections in the<br />
next four years. The coiuntry does not want or need this.<br />
A ' Yes answver will strengthen the Senate anid, in par-ticular,<br />
pr-otect Western Australia and the: other leEss populous States.<br />
/ 2. </p>
<p>2. Thal if a Senator dieos or r4 sign3 he wl erpao o<br />
thie remainder of his to= n Of office b) Y a m.( e; Tber of the<br />
saume party.<br />
AYes vote on -ths i-roposal willI ensure that-the voters<br />
choio-e at the el~ cr'-tion -dill bra preserved. This i~ basic<br />
to our demnouracy.<br />
3. That e-leci-ors in Northern Territory and the Australi3an<br />
Capital ' Ierritory should be ab'le to vote in referendcums as<br />
do all other Itustralians.<br />
A Yes vcte V. gill give Territorial voters the same fundamental.<br />
rights. as -their fellow Australians.<br />
4-That, High Courb Judges should retire at the aqeof 70 and<br />
that a retiring age should be set for other Pedexal Judges,<br />
The Western Australian Government bas Bet a retirement age<br />
of 70 for their State Judges, and it is only fair that at<br />
the age of 70 judges in the V'cderal area should pass the job<br />
on to younger people.<br />
Western Austzralia has tha most progressive record of any State<br />
wi-th respect to constitutional reforms.<br />
I urge all Western PAustralians t~ o vote Yes on all fouir proposals<br />
on Saturday. </p>
