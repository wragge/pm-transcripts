PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIE MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SOUTH AFRICA REJOINS THE COMMONWEALTH<br />
I warmly welcome the announcement that South Africa has been re-admidtted into the<br />
Commonwealth of Nations from which the former regime withdrew in 196 1.<br />
In rejoining the Commonwealth, President Mandela's Government of National Unity<br />
has acknowledged the substantial contribution the organisation has made over the<br />
years to the successful transition to democracy. Australia has been proud to be part of<br />
this process.<br />
We believe the Commonwealth can continue to play a useful role in helping South<br />
Africa in the post-apartheid period.<br />
I look forward with pleasure to South Afica's participation in the Commonwealth<br />
Games in Canada and to President Mandela's attendance at the Commonwealth Heads<br />
of Government Meeting in Auckland next year.<br />
CANBERRA May 31, 1994 </p>
