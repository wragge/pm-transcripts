<p>FAMILY DAY 1IN THE ELECTORATE OF LINDSAY WITH JACKIE KELLY REGENT VILLE, WESTERN SYDNEY</p>
<p>E&amp; OE..........</p>
<p>Thank you very much Bob Woods, to Jackie Kelly, to my other parliamentary colleagues of which there are quite a number here today, to Mr and Mrs Mead who made their home available, very specially, to my parliamentary colleague Jackie Kelly, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>We shouldn't be having another vote. There's something odd about it isn't it? You win<br />something fair and square, you take out the prize, you win the grand final and they want a<br />re-run. It does strike most Australians as rather odd that somebody who joined the Royal<br />Australian Air Force, who rose to the rank of Squadron Leader in that air force, is<br />regarded in some technical way as owing an allegiance to a foreign power. But such are<br />the vagaries of the profession in which I once practised and far be it from me to cast any<br />critical aspersions on decisions of the courts, but simply let me say that it's a very odd sort<br />of situation and I think it strikes Australians and it strikes the people of Lindsay as being<br />rather odd. I think it also smacks of that old sort of Australian no-no and that is bad<br />sportsmanship to grizzle when the verdict has been given and the referee has blown the<br />whistle. Anyway it's happened, and we have got, can I tell you, one hell of a fight on our hands.<br />You all know that this area has traditionally, historically been a Labor Party stronghold.<br />It's called Labor Party heartland, and of all those magnificently warming results that we<br />received on the second of March few of them matched Jackie's victory here to get a<br />swing of eleven and a half per cent. It was a remarkable achievement and it's a remarkable<br />tribute to her and it's a remarkable tribute to you because so many of the people who<br />made that victory possible are here today. But despite having sort of conquered all those<br />enormous odds, despite having imagined that she could look forward, at least, to three<br />years of representing the people of Lindsay and doing good things for the people of<br />Lindsay she now faces a by-election. She faces a by-election which has been made more</p>
<p>difficult for her to win by the fact that the Labor Party, despite its noisy protestations<br />about its commitment to all sorts of things in terms of racial equality, a Labor Party that<br />has done a deal with the Australians Against Further Immigration Party, they've done a<br />deal with other organisations. I mean there's a real danger that Free will sneak over the<br />line by courtesy of the preference of the Australians Against Further Immigration and the<br />Shooters. Now there's no point in me as your political leader, as your Prime Minister and<br />as Jackie's parliamentary colleague mincing words on something like that. If it's a fair and<br />square fight she ought to win. But you've got a situation where they've entered into these<br />arrangements while at the other hand putting their hand on their heart and saying ' oh, you<br />know, isn't this terrible that organisations and people should say anything at all about<br />immigration'; I mean what sort of hypocrisy is that? On the one hand you're saying you<br />shouldn't talk about it and the next hand you go behind the shed and say ' look will you<br />give us your preferences' I mean that is basically what is happening. And I think that is<br />just monumental hypocrisy and Australians can pick phoneyism, but they can only pick<br />phoneyism when it's brought to their attention. So we have got a fight on our hands, a<br />real fight. There's a real risk that a bloke who, after 13 years, you threw out because he<br />hadn't done enough for the area can sneak back through the back door by courtesy of this<br />preference deal.</p>
<p><br />Let me say something about Jackie. She's a bundle of energy, she's new, she's fresh,<br />she's different and she's the wave of the future as far as this area is concerned. She's<br />asked more questions in the Parliament than any other member on our side. They're all<br />getting a bit envious, but she has and she gives me a hard time if she doesn't get the right<br />answers and that's what a local member ought to be about. And she's prepared to do that.<br />I mean, I just think it is terrific that the Liberal Party was able to extend its support into<br />areas like Lindsay. I mean the Liberal Party of all the political parties in Australia's history<br />is the one party that is owned by nobody. Nobody owns us. We're not owned by the<br />Trade Union Movement, we're not owned by big business, we're not owned by any<br />pressure groups, we're really not. We're made up of people from all walks of life. And<br />one of the reasons why Jackie won on the second of March was that the Australian people<br />were fed up with having a Government in power that bended its knees to the noisiest<br />interest group in the community. Run by a Government that was too beholden to noise<br />and not concerned enough about the mainstream of the Australian community. We are a<br />great community. Australia is now composed of people drawn from all parts of the world,<br />but they're united behind a common commitment to the ideals that make up this country.<br />So many people over the years have made a contribution. Instead of, sort of, focusing on<br />some of the things that divide us and push us apart, one of the things the Liberal Party and<br />I've certainly tried to do is to focus on those things that bind us together as Australians.<br />And that was one of the promises that I made on election night and is one of the promises<br />that I have carried forward. We brought down a budget, we were left with an appalling<br />financial mess, we were left with a much bigger deficit than we were told, we were left<br />with much higher debt than we were told and we had to make some difficult decisions.<br />But they were done in a fair way.</p>
<p>I met a business man in Adelaide the other day and he said, ' look, I had a look at your<br />budget, and he said you know, you did this and I didn't like that, it affected me, you did<br />that and I didn't like that and you did a whole lot of things that affected me but', he said,<br />' I've written you a letter congratulating you on the budget'. I said, ' why?' He said,<br />' Because it was fair'. And I'm very proud of that. There are a few things about being an<br />Australian and the Australian spirit that endure from one generation to the next. One of<br />those things is our great tradition of mateship and another things, of course, is our sense of<br />a fair go. And we did try to have a fair go. There were some things in that that hit a few<br />people that could afford it and there's also a few things that a lot of people didn't like.<br />But overall it did the right thing for Australia and that is why it has been well received, not<br />only here, but it's also been respected overseas. When I went to Japan and Indonesia a<br />few weeks ago the business community in both of those countries were very appreciative<br />of the fact that we had inherited difficulty and we had done something very material about<br />it. So ladies and gentlemen, can I do two final things. First of all I want to thank you for all<br />that you did to get this wonderful lady elected on the second of March. I want to thank<br />you very warmly. You have sent to Canberra a person of real vigour. She is new, she's<br />different, she does represent the future. She replaced somebody who was part of the<br />problem and now he's trying to sneak back by courtesy of a sleazy preference deal with<br />some Independents. Ladies and gentlemen, it's going to be tough, I thank you for what<br />you've done so far, but could I ask you to re-double, treble, quadruple those efforts over<br />the next week. Because if we can defy those forces in the community here in Lindsay that<br />would, sort of, reverse the freely given verdict of the people on the second of March. If<br />we can demonstrate that that kind of political cynicism is unacceptable, and it will be a<br />very tough fight to do so, we will have not only done a very good thing for the people of<br />Lindsay, we will have confirmed in office an outstandingly energetic local representative in<br />Jackie Kelly, but we will also have said to the people of Australia that we want something<br />new and different and better and that is really what Jackie represents and that above<br />everything else is why she ought to be returned on Saturday. Thank you.<br />0</p>
