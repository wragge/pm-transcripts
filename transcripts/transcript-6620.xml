outward-looking industrial structure, to foster industries<br />
which are able to respond flexibly to changing market<br />
conditions and to take full advantage of international<br />
market opportunities.<br />
This hid been underpinned by the creation of a stable macroeconomic<br />
environment directed at the promotion of strong<br />
growth, moderate inflation and good industrial relations.<br />

economic links with the region and the major opportuni ties<br />
for doing so with China. The Australian Government wished<br />
to assure China that Australia will continue to be a<br />
reliable and competitive supplier of mineral. and </p>
<p>-2<br />
technology necessary for China's development.<br />
General Secretary Hu said that it was important to have a<br />
long term point of view and to plan for friendship and<br />
cooperation for at least a generation. He pointed out that<br />
the Chinese Government is carrying out economic reforms for<br />
the purpose of ensuring sustained economic growth and the<br />
continuous improvement of the livelihood of the Chinese<br />
people. China had adopted an ' open door' policy to<br />
strengthen cooperation in economic and other fields with<br />
other countries. The friendship between China and Australia<br />
and the absence of fundamental conflicts of Interest between<br />
the two countries provided . a-C rm-foundation--. f-or-eeo-nmic<br />
cooperation.<br />
General Secretary Hu noted that under China's 7th five year<br />
plan ( 1986-1990) China,-wanted to step up the modernisation<br />
of its Industries and the whole Chinese economy and improve<br />
efficiency. Prime Minister Hawke said that Australia stands<br />
ready to provide the quality raw materials and robust<br />
technology which would be required for China to achieve the<br />
objectives of the plan.<br />

Mr Hawke noted that Australia's process of modernisation and<br />
structural change will offer expanding market opportunities<br />
in which China will be well placed to share. The<br />
modernisation of Australian industry over the year and<br />
decades ahead would provide increasing opportunities for<br />
exports of the light industrial products which are a major<br />
focus of Chinese industrial modernisation.<br />
The General Secretary an) 9 the Prime Minister agreed that<br />
while the businesS-enterprises in the two countries must<br />
establish arrangements on an objective and mutually<br />
profitable basis the two Governments could assist in<br />
providing a framework of information and confidence within<br />
which that cooperation could continue. This applied in a<br />
number of particular ways, as follows<br />
The work of the Joint Study Group on Iron and Steel<br />
established in February 1984 would continue with a view<br />
to . urther cooperation in trade, investment in both<br />
countries, and technology sales and cooperation.<br />
The Joint Working Group on-Coal Cooperation established </p>
<p>in October 1984 would similarly continue its work.<br />
A new Joint . Study would be undertaken in relation to<br />
all stages of the wool industry.<br />
Following the visit to Australia by Chinese Delegates<br />
dealing with non-ferrous metals and railways,<br />
Australian delegations would visit China to review with<br />
Chinese authorities the possibility of further<br />
cooperation in these areas.<br />
Australia would send a high level delegation to China<br />
to discuss the oppo. rtunities-. for-. vrlope-ration in the<br />
development and plannipg of China's transport Industry.<br />
Cooperation In agricultural development of China would<br />
continue and be extended.<br />
In the area of iron and steel cooperation, it was noted that<br />
under the auspices of the Joint Study Group much progress<br />
had been made. The two sides agreed that the prospects were<br />
very good, and agreed to encourage enterprises of the two<br />
countries to reach mutually profitable commercial<br />
arrange. nents as soon as possible, in accordance with the<br />
principles accepted by both sides and in particular to<br />
cooperate on Channar and KwInana and other projects.<br />
Cooperation in the iron and steel Industry could be In the </p>
<p>form of joint ventures or long term trade contracts. Upon<br />
the satisfactory conclusion of current negotiations, the<br />
Joint Study Group would turn its attention to the<br />
development of a framework of principle within which<br />
Australian and Chinese enterprises would be encouraged<br />
further to extend cooperation, including through largerscale<br />
investment in steel making in China utilising<br />
internationally competitive raw and semi-processed materials<br />
from Australia.<br />
The General Secretary and the Prime Minister noted that the<br />
two Governments are to review future priorities for the<br />
program under the. Agre emt-.-n-Xechnaical-Cooper-ation in<br />
Development. The General Secretary and the Prime minister confirmed the<br />
common wish expressed by Prime Minister Hawke and Premier<br />
Zhao Ziyang during Prime Minister Hawke's visit to China in<br />
February 1984 that Australia/ China economic cooperation<br />
should be a model for cooperation between countries at<br />
different levels of development and with different social<br />
systems. -9.<br />
