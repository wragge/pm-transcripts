EMBARGO: 7.30 PM<br />
PRIME MINISTER 13 November 1974<br />
NATIONAL BROADCAST<br />
In Parliament last night I outlined a number<br />
of measures which the Government is taking to deal with<br />
some of our current economic difficulties.<br />
The two greatest of these are, of course,<br />
rapid inflation and rising unemployment. In a modern<br />
economy like Australia, in a mixed economy like Australia,<br />
these are now twin problems; they are interlocked. This<br />
is a situation we find throughout the world in all<br />
similar economies, in all comparable countries. It's the<br />
first time in modern history where peoples and governments<br />
have been faced with these two problems at the same time.<br />
We have had unemployment before, we have had<br />
inflation before, but the combination of the two poses<br />
problems not before encountered, to a degree not before<br />
encountered, in modern times, anywhere in the world.<br />
This does not mean that the problems are<br />
insoluble. It doesn't mean that the situation is out<br />
of control. It doesn't mean that we just submit passively<br />
to whatever fate or events beyond our control may decide.<br />
We don't have to, and as far as your Government is concerned,<br />
we are not going to.<br />
But what it does mean is that democratic<br />
governments have to be extraordinarily alert and flexible<br />
in their response to rapidly changing circumstances. This<br />
is what we are dong; and because circumstances are liable<br />
to such rapid change, policies must be especially flexible.<br />
It is a cliche now to say that there is no<br />
simple or easy cure for this world-wide problem. All the<br />
more important, therefore, that governments be unremitting<br />
in their efforts to seek solutions for these problems;<br />
unremitting, earnest and compassionate in their efforts to<br />
protect those who suffer worst and first from the immediate<br />
consequences of these problems. I offer the measures I<br />
announced last night as evidence of your Government's<br />
determination and sincerity in doing just that.<br />
Briefly, the proposals I announced have four<br />
broad aims: / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
First, we want to maintain consumer demand<br />
through a substantial reduction in personal income tax.<br />
Secondly, we want to attack inflation by<br />
reducing the pressure for wage increases through a substantial<br />
improvement in after-tax take-home pay next year and<br />
specifically to break the wage-price spiral by giving<br />
business a breathing space in wage demands based on price<br />
increases in this December quarter.<br />
Thirdly, we want to enhance profitability by<br />
a reduction in company tax, by requesting the Prices<br />
Justification Tribunal to give particular consideration to<br />
the adequacy of return on capital and by urgently<br />
investigating the implications of rapid inflation for the<br />
taxation of companies; and<br />
Fourthly, we want to support particular industries<br />
where special problems are emerging housing, cars, textiles,<br />
beef. And those four objectives are summed up in one<br />
overriding objective, and that is to create the conditions<br />
for co-operation with all sections of the community and between<br />
all sections of the community. Without co-operation, without<br />
responsibility, without restraint, we cannot solve our problems.<br />
No Government can do it alone. We are all in<br />
this together, not just as Australians but as members of<br />
a world community all experiencing times of profound difficulty,<br />
together, and at the same time.<br />
Yet how fortunate we still remain amongst all<br />
the members of the world community. Our immediate problems<br />
are certainly not worse than those of our partners and friends<br />
and, of course, are immeasurably less than those facing most<br />
members of the international community.<br />
Of the measures I announced last night, the<br />
one of most immediate interest to most Australians is, naturally<br />
enough, the cut in personal tax. And this is a substantial cut.<br />
For the family man on $ 100 a week it's just as if he got a<br />
8 per cent wage increase. For the family man on $ 150 a week<br />
it's just as if he got a 5-3/ 4 per cent wage increase. I want<br />
everybody really to understand what we are trying to do. By<br />
these tax cuts, we are guaranteeing you an immediate improvement<br />
in your standard of living a protection against the immediate<br />
rises in prices. But this protection will disappear if wage<br />
demands push costs and prices through the ceiling. We have<br />
provided the chance for you to get ahead of prices. Don't<br />
throw away the opportunity. We must break the vicious circle<br />
of wages chasing prices, and prices chasing wages.<br />
I don't co~ nceal that the next few months will be<br />
quite difficult. The figures won't be good. The measures<br />
we have taken any economic measures take time to take their<br />
effect. But behind the headlines, behind the raw figures,<br />
lies the great unchanging truth of the basic strength of the<br />
Australian economy and I deeply believe the basic strength<br />
of the Australian community. These are national assets which<br />
can't be diminished by temporary fluctuations in the statistics<br />
and the indices. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
The measures I outlined last night, combined with<br />
the continuing effect of the measures taken in the Budget,<br />
give every ground for confidence that we shall turn the<br />
corner before the middle of next year.<br />
I am not saying, of course, that all our problems<br />
will be solved, but the important thing is to realise that<br />
we are not powerless to control the course of events. No<br />
Australian no section of the Australian community should<br />
fear that he or she will be left unprotected by the Government,<br />
left to despair, left without hope.<br />
These and other measures will work if they are<br />
given a chance to work and that does require co-operation,<br />
particularly from the most powerful sections of the Australian<br />
community, employers and employees. For both those groups<br />
whose interests are mutual the measures I announced give<br />
good grounds for co-operation with each other and with the<br />
elected Australian Government.<br />
These measures are your Government's response<br />
to our present difficulties. But if they are to work, those<br />
who immediately benefit from them must also respond. We are,<br />
for the first time, offering tax cuts in return for restraint.<br />
If that is to work, it calls for genuine co-operation, genuine<br />
restraint. We can meet and beat these problems together<br />
certainly better than any other people in the world. Last night,<br />
I am confident, we made a good start. </p>
