ERICSSON AUSTRALIA TELECOMM( UNICATIONS<br />
BROADMEADOWS, AUGUST 26 1993<br />
It is a great pleasure to be here today.<br />
In manufacturing, the name Broadmeadows has usually meant<br />
one thing Ford Australia.<br />
Without the slightest disrespect to Ford, let me say that<br />
Broadmeadows should mean one more thing in Australian<br />
manufacturing Ericsson Australia.<br />
It gets the balance right small items here, large items'<br />
up the road.<br />
Both innovative, both exporters, both very significant<br />
employers. Both multinational companies with their parents abroad<br />
but both making vital contributions to the Australian<br />
economy and helping to take it in the direction it must<br />
go. To the Asia-Pacific, and to the world.<br />
Ericsson have been here for a long time they've been in<br />
Australia for a century, and in Broadmeadows for thirty<br />
years. They have long been a company of the kind Australia needs<br />
and, I'm pleased to say, is now producing a company<br />
which believes in success through innovation.<br />
The changes in telecommunications over a century have<br />
been remarkable of course from the phone you bolted to<br />
the wall to the phone you put in your top pocket.<br />
But there has never been a change like the one which is<br />
occurring now.<br />
There has never been a change so dramatic, nor one so<br />
full of possibility.<br />
We are seeing Australia assume the status of a regional<br />
and, indeed, world leader in telecommunications. </p>

We are seeing that leadership translated into rapid<br />
export growth in the Asia-Pacific.<br />
The Government estimates that Australia has the potential<br />
to achieve telecommunications exports of $ 2 billion by<br />
1997 and much of that will undoubtedly be in our<br />
region. It is a strategically important industry for Australia.<br />
With one of the most advanced telecommunications networks<br />
in the world we have the base for expansion into Asia.<br />
I was in South Korea and China a few months ago and the<br />
opportunities were plain to see: over and above our<br />
traditional minerals and energy and agricultural<br />
products, there are burgeoning markets for things we do<br />
well and things we make well things like computer<br />
software, education services, processed food,<br />
environmental services and, perhaps most obviously of<br />
all, telecommunications.<br />
And the same opportunities exist throughout the region.<br />
If telecommunications is a strategic industry for<br />
Australia's economy, Ericsson Australia is strategic to<br />
the industry.<br />
Ericsson Australia has extended its markets in the Asia-<br />
Pacific to China, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Sri Lanka,<br />
Cambodia, Fiji and Papua New Guinea.<br />
And there can be no doubt that in these countries<br />
Ericsson's reputation has contributed to Australia's<br />
reputation as a telecommunications leader.<br />
Today I am pleased to be given the opportunity to<br />
announce some of the initiatives in the expanded role<br />
Ericsson Australia will soon be playing in the Asia-<br />
Pacific. The company has decided to extend its operations in<br />
the rapidly developing economic regions of China by<br />
expanding its marketing of Australian manufactured<br />
telephone exchange switching products into two new<br />
provinces Sichuan and Liaoning.<br />
Also in China, Ericsson Australia will supply<br />
support for the operations of mobile telephone<br />
networks in 11 provinces, catering to more than<br />
600,000 existing customers.<br />
In future, where Australian companies win major<br />
overseas contracts that involve the supply of<br />
Ericsson product, that product will be supplied by<br />
Ericsson Australia as they are already supplying<br />
the mobile telephone operations of Telecom Australia<br />
in Sri Lanka and Vietnam. P) I PRESS OFFICE( it 003 </p>
<p>Ericsson Australia has also been designated as a<br />
major supply centre for analogue mobile telephone<br />
network equipment f or the Ericsson Group's worldwide<br />
market.<br />
In a decision which establishes the company's<br />
Research and Development Centre as a major exporter<br />
of Australian technology, the Ericsson Australia<br />
designed and developed Queuing System, which has<br />
already generated $ 180 m~ illion in exports, is to be<br />
incorporated in Ericsson PABX systems and sold<br />
world-wide<br />
And, finally, I understand the Group is<br />
considering the feasibility of establishing an<br />
Information Technology Centre in Australia to<br />
service the communication needs of the Asia-Pacific.<br />
I was in Tasmania earlier this week at Ulverstone, where<br />
Pacific Dunlop are investing in a potato processing<br />
operation which promises to secure that region's future<br />
by securing a major slice of the Asian market.<br />
The key to their operation is the faith to invest coupled<br />
to international Best Practice from the ground up.<br />
In other words, making the growing and processing and the<br />
management and labour, as sophisticated as any in the<br />
world. I could have gone to any number of other companies around<br />
Australia this week and seen the same sort of thing<br />
happening and I intend to go to many of them in the<br />
next few months.<br />
The lesson everywhere is the same Australia's economic<br />
future rests on companies like this.<br />
Companies which are innovative, determined to export,<br />
intent on establishing at every level from the technology<br />
to the labour force, standards which are second to none<br />
in the world.<br />
The Government is encouraging the growth of these<br />
companies. In fact I might say I have been encouraging them for a<br />
decade since as a Government we decided that Australia<br />
could be a modern manufacturing nation indeed had to be<br />
a modern manufacturing nation and set about the task of<br />
making the necessary changes to the economic structure<br />
and the business and industrial culture.<br />
We are now seeing the fruits of our labour. </p>
<p>The increased export business that flows from today's<br />
announcements here, make it very clear that the reforms<br />
we are introducing for the telecommunications industry<br />
extend well beyond the measures which put Telecom and<br />
Optus into competition.<br />
In the 1990' s we're seeing Australian companies change<br />
direction. We're seeing the emergence of new companies born of the<br />
new export culture, and the new awareness of<br />
opportunities in the Asia-Pacific.<br />
And we're seeing when we look at the growth in<br />
manufactured exports how absolutely essential it was to<br />
make those changes.<br />
For without that growth we would now be in a genuinely<br />
dire economic circumstances, and we would have a<br />
genuinely dire future.<br />
Today, despite our problems, we have a marvellous future,<br />
As a nation we have the best chance in our history to<br />
secure the kind of long term economic security which will<br />
underwrite our way of life and assure Australians of<br />
employment. We have to find the solutions to unemployment and we<br />
expect the major study we have commissioned to give us a<br />
more comprehensive and effective strategy than we have<br />
ever had.<br />
We are not alone in this. President Clinton of course<br />
has called for an unemployment summit. In Europe they<br />
are doing the same.<br />
Unemployment is the great curse of our era and overcoming<br />
it will teat our ingenuity and our commitment to the<br />
nation and each other. It will test all of us.<br />
But we do know that at least part of the solution a<br />
large part of it lies in the initiative and success of<br />
companies like Ericsson Australia.<br />
Because through them and I mean from the upper levels<br />
of management to the men and women who work in the<br />
offic ' es and on the factory floor through companies like<br />
this one, our economic success will be assured and<br />
employment in substantial measure restored.<br />
That's why I say that for all the hard work we in<br />
Government put in and even for all the flak we took<br />
along the way ultimately success depends on not on<br />
Government but on companies like this; and it is<br />
companies like this with the vision and the courage who<br />
properly deserve the credit. </p>
<p>You will know that in the Budget and in other measures<br />
taken in recent times the Government is seeking to<br />
encourage the development of small and medium sized<br />
manufacturing exporters.<br />
But we also encourage the role of multinational companies<br />
like Ericsson, with their broad exposure to world markets<br />
and the market access they can provide for Australia.<br />
Ericsson Australia have earned their expanded role on the<br />
world, and by doing that they are helping take Australia<br />
into those markets where our future lies.<br />
So I congratulate you all and thank you for inviting me<br />
along. </p>
