PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
HOLDEN'S ENGINE COMPANY, TWO MILLIONTH EXPORT ENGINE<br />
MELBOURNE, 2 MAY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Well, thank you very much, Peter ( Thomas), Tom McDaniel and Bill Hamel,<br />
Your Excellencies, the Consul General of Britain, and the Federal Republic of<br />
Germany and other distinguished guests, and my Parliamentary colleagues,<br />
the Leader of the Opposition in Victoria, and ladies and gentlemen.<br />
It is a great pleasure to be here on this occasion, and the point is not lost on<br />
me that in a week when the Government will deliver a White Paper on<br />
employment in this country, the first in over 45 years, was the -s-am e time<br />
years ago when the then Chiefly Labor Government, the Government that<br />
produced the first White Paper on employment and post war reconstruction,<br />
was the Government which was negotiating with the General Motors<br />
Corporation to see the development of the General Motors Holden Company<br />
in this country.<br />
And now, just on half a century later, we have this amazing coincidence of the<br />
Governments, Australia's, second White Paper on employment coinciding<br />
with the export of these hi gh technology products, the tiv-rnillionth Holden<br />
engine. I<br />
On the occasion when the General Motors Holden Company unveiled its first<br />
car, my predecessor, Ben Chiefly, doffed his hat to the car. Well, I don't<br />
happen to have a hat to doff,* but if I did I would doff it to those high<br />
technology engines on that clamp. Because what we are seeing here is the<br />
face that the General Motors Company has displayed in this country from the<br />
days of the old Holden Motor Body Company and the engines which General<br />
Motors Corporation of the United States used to sell to the collaborative<br />
program, the acquisition and then the building of GMH in Australia. </p>
<p>And it was to many Australians recognition of the fact that we have come of<br />
age as an industrial country, when we can produce our own motor vehicles.<br />
And we saw the fledgling Australian motor vehicle industry emerge from that<br />
time. We also saw Holdens being sold all over the world, but I am sure we<br />
would have thought in market terms, in those days, of markets like New<br />
Zealand and like South Africa and the developed countries of the Southern<br />
Hemisphere, we wouldn't have been thinking in term of mainstream products<br />
in the mainstream international markets of the Asia-Pacific, of your largest<br />
customer for engines in Korea, or indeed supplying General Motors engines<br />
to other parts of the General Motors Corporation Companies throughout the<br />
world. So, the Holden's Engine Company has now a very great and distinguished<br />
performance since its inception, and the tradition of the belief and faith that<br />
the General Motors Company has had in this country and its working is borne<br />
out of the successes the company is having today. And it gives me very great<br />
pleasure to acknowledge and to salute that success.<br />
We have been through, all of us, an amazing transformation in the last<br />
decade. We turned our back on tariff protection, we've said we want to<br />
engage with the world, we want to be part of the story of the Asia-Pacific. We<br />
want to be part of the story of a confident, outward looking, dynamic<br />
economy. And the changes which we have made, and we have all made<br />
them together, all of us, have produced a now confident, externally oriented<br />
country which can do things which we wouldn't have dreamt of ten years ago.<br />
And so we are now seeing at this point that the country that lived its life on<br />
wheat and wool, and then more latterly iron ore and coal, now finds that its<br />
fastest growing exports are its Elaborately Transformed Manufactures.<br />
We don't want to be a low wage, low productivity society. We want to be a<br />
high wage, high productivity, high innovation society. We want to do the<br />
clever things which can be done by research and development, product<br />
innovation, education and training, commitment, employer to employee,<br />
unions to management so that we advance as a country doing the skilful<br />
things which millions of countries in this region won't, or will not be able to do<br />
for many years into the future.<br />
Fundamental to our view of Australia has been the belief that our great<br />
comparative advantage is not our paddocks of wheat or the great harvest of<br />
the bales of wool or the natural endowments of our minerals, but our great<br />
comparative advantage has been our education system.<br />
Australia is at a point now where this year eight kids in ten will complete<br />
secondary school. That was three in ten, ten years ago. We are streaming<br />
now 40 per cent of those through tertiary institutions and we are now<br />
rebuilding vocational education along side the universities to carry the rest<br />
into training and skills and to reskill them for life's work. The statement which<br />
I'll introduce this week will say a lot more about education and training and </p>
<p>particularly the importance we give on the school to work transition regarding<br />
the period 15-19 years of age as a period of vocational preparation for work<br />
and where we see the skills path start to open up already in secondary<br />
schools.<br />
This is the rock upon which all of our innqvaticons in the future will be built.<br />
But perhaps beyond that the great structural dhantie of the last ten years has<br />
been the collaborative and co-operative attitude of Australian employees at<br />
work. And the attitude of Australia's employees and our unions and the<br />
corroboration that has been engendered between them and management<br />
across the country have given us now an inflation rate under 2 per cent; an<br />
inflation rate for the last quarter of .4 per cent; the lowest interest rates in<br />
thirty years; the highest profit share in our history and now coupled with a<br />
company tax rate competitive with most any rate in the Asia-Pacific<br />
massively competitive when compared to other industrial developed nations<br />
these are the ingredients of a productive culture which Australia has not<br />
really known in the past.<br />
So, we're seeing this transformation across the economy, but I was glad that<br />
Peter Thomas ( Managing Director, Holden's Engine Company) mentioned the<br />
suppliers here today. Let me pay tribute to you too. Because I'm sure many<br />
suppliers don't regard themselves primarily as exporters, but in fact they have<br />
become exporters because the product which they produce, the efficiency<br />
with which it is produced, the quality control and the delivery schedules, all of<br />
these things that make up a good on-going commercial relationship have<br />
come to pass and now we've got this great team spirit between suppliers and<br />
particularly in the motor vehicle industry this has become very apparent.<br />
It wasn't so many years ago, not so many, when motor companies in this<br />
country would say to the Government we find it very difficult to survive without<br />
a tariff wall of great size because we can't get the competitiveness into a<br />
vehicle components parts industry; we can't get the commitment of<br />
component parts suppliers. Well, that has happily all changed. I think one of<br />
the things which changed it is the fact that we decided that we would be<br />
competitive and throw off the protection of high tariffs and as we've seen<br />
tariffs decline over. the period, this has put competitive disciplines on<br />
companies, on motor vehicle manufacturing management, but it has also<br />
brought the suppliers to the party so that now, together, we are all able to<br />
produce cars of greater quality and lower price so that Australians can enjoy<br />
owning a car of comparable international standards, but at prices which are<br />
far more competitive than would have been the case a couple of years ago.<br />
This has been a great endeavour and a great outcome by the motor vehicle<br />
industry in this country and in this respect the commitment of General Motors<br />
Corporation of GMH to that its national undertaking, has been central to the<br />
change in the quality and price of their cars, to their export potential and, of<br />
course, the spin-off in manufacturing of engines as we see in this plant here<br />
today. </p>
<p>So, this is a considerable success story and it can't be there simply because<br />
of an enlightened management; it can't be there with enlightened and<br />
competent plant managers, it can only be there with the commitment of the<br />
workers, the employees to a partnership with the management that makes<br />
these things possible and a commitment by the company to product<br />
innovation and to playing a role in Australia's exports.<br />
So, it is with a considerable degree of pride and genuine pleasure that I come<br />
to this place, to Fishermens Bend, where Ben Chifley came nearly half a<br />
century ago to take his hat off to the first Australian made car. And, as I have<br />
the pleasure as leader of the Labor party and Prime Minister to introduce a<br />
White Paper on employment in this country, on the development of regions in<br />
this country; of industry policy; of training and re-training and a commitment<br />
to the young, on this occasion, in this week nearly half a century later I have<br />
the historic opportunity to visit Fishermens Bend and to not doff my hat, but to<br />
pay a well earned round of tribute and praise to everyone involved in the<br />
production of the engines of the Holden's Engine Company.<br />
So, ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, one and all it is with very<br />
great pleasure that I am here in the company of the Chief Executive Officers<br />
of the Corporation and to be here on this the occasion of the building and<br />
packing of the two millionth Holden engine.<br />
Thank you very much indeed. </p>
