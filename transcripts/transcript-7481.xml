CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LUNCHEON OF COMBINED BUSINESS COMMITTEES<br />
BANGKOK 3 FEBRUARY 1989<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
As part of my visit to the United States last year, I had<br />
the pleasure of addressing a luncheon hosted by the Economic<br />
Club of Chicago.<br />
After I spoke, the Chairman of the luncheon thanked me and,<br />
as was fitti. ng in an international forum, hie produced a<br />
classic definition of diplomacy.<br />
Diplomacy, he said, was the art of saying " nice doggie, nice<br />
doggie", while you look for a big stick.<br />
That line came to mind when I read the recent important<br />
speech your Prime Minister, General Chatichai, delivered to0<br />
the Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand last December..<br />
The Prime Minister made the crucial point that diplomacy i~ s<br />
changing. In the past, he said, when battlelines were clearly drawn<br />
Obetween friends and foes, diplomacy was all about strategic<br />
management to use the Chicago analogy, it was all about<br />
looking for the big stick to fend off the snarling dog.<br />
Now, as Prime Minister Chatichai said, diplomacy has become<br />
" tthe art and science of managing peace"<br />
We see t.-he proof of this critical transformation clearly in<br />
our region.<br />
It is true that in the past the nations of the Pacific Rim,<br />
including Thailand and Australia, were greatly preoccupied<br />
with strategic issues, most notably during the Vietnam war<br />
years. But it is equally true that those preoccupations are no<br />
longer paramount. I </p>
<p>They are being replaced by difficult, but far more rewarding<br />
issues: how to remove the obstacles to economic growth and<br />
maximise the opportunities to raise the living standards of<br />
our people.<br />
It is on that issue that I want to concentrate today.<br />
Indeed, it is that issue that underpins my visit to your<br />
country.<br />
For no-one in our region can ignore the fact that Thailand<br />
today is set to join the ranks of Asia's most dynamic<br />
countries. Quite simply, the economic miracle that you have performed<br />
in recent years is impossible to ignore.<br />
The rapid growth and structural change of the Thai economy<br />
over the last decade led to a crucial point of transition in<br />
the mid-80s from a primarily agricultural economy to one<br />
where a greater proportion of GDP and export income derives<br />
from the manufacturing sector.<br />
There are three specific lessons that your success teaches<br />
us.<br />
The first concerns Australia, the second the region, and the<br />
third the global economy. Let me discuss each of them in<br />
turn.<br />
First, it is crystal clear to me that Australia and Thailand<br />
can do a lot more business together than we are doing now.<br />
0 Compared with our trade with other ASEAN nations, two-way<br />
trade with Thailand is surprisingly small.<br />
Our two-way trade with Singapore is worth $ 2.1 billion, with<br />
Malaysia $ 1.2 billion and with Indonesia $ 1.1 billion. With<br />
Thailand it amounts to only $ 650 million.<br />
However even this figure represents a significant expansion<br />
in our relationship.<br />
In 1985, our two governments set a target for two way trade<br />
of $ 500 million by 1988. That target was achieved twelve<br />
months ahead of schedule.<br />
In my talks with the Thai Government yesterday, we have set<br />
a new target of $ 1.3 billion by 1991. It is certainly an<br />
ambitious target it would represent a doubling of our<br />
two-way trade in just over three years from now but I<br />
believe it is certainly achievable. </p>
<p>Indeed those talks have, as I said yesterday, created a new<br />
framework for our relationship, with a number of agreements<br />
underway to facilitate our shared economic development.<br />
This new framework is an unequivocal statement of the<br />
political will on both sides to further develop our economic<br />
relationship, and it is a clear lead to the private sectors<br />
of both our countries.<br />
Private sector involvement in the Thailand/ Australia Joint<br />
Trade Committee, which began last year, is a valuable<br />
contribution.<br />
O I pay tribute also to our hosts today, the Australian-Thai<br />
Chamber of Commerce and the Australia-Thailand Business<br />
Council, for their steady promotion of closer commercial<br />
ties between our two countries.<br />
Australia sees particular opportunities to assist a rapidly<br />
growing Thailand with its infrastructure development in<br />
areas such as coal, power, ports, telecommunications,<br />
railways and agriculture.<br />
We are also proud of our capacity to provide raw and<br />
processed material, manufactured components, consumer goods<br />
and services. More than 3000 student visas were issued in<br />
1987 for Thais wishing to study in Australia.<br />
Australia's private sector expertise and competitiveness is<br />
supported by my Government's major program since 1983 to<br />
implement more outward-looking economic policies. We have<br />
floated the Australian dollar, deregulated our financial<br />
markets, liberalised foreign investment guidelines, reshaped<br />
our tax system and achieved historic cuts in protection.<br />
In other words, Australia and Thailand make natural partners<br />
for a much wider range of commercial activities. We should<br />
make sure, both of us, that we don't miss the opportunities<br />
that lie before us.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I didn't come here solely to advance Australia's direct<br />
bilateral commercial interests as important as they are.<br />
For the -second area I wish to address today is a broader<br />
message, of relevance to our region as a whole. I </p>
<p>We have become familiar with the glowing predictions that<br />
are frequently made about the Pacific Century predictions<br />
that the next era of international economic growth will be<br />
dominated by the nations that border the Pacific.<br />
We have seen example after example of nations proving they<br />
have the capacity, through flexible and competitive<br />
policies, to capitalise on the pervasive dynamism of the<br />
region.<br />
This process saw Japan become an economic superpower, with<br />
nations such as Korea and Singapore following in its wake,<br />
and now with Thailand following in turn.<br />
O All have recognised the truth of the complementary and<br />
interdependent nature of our region, and all have prospered<br />
as a result.<br />
This dynamism has been sustained heavily in the past by US<br />
demand, but regional trading and investment patterns are now<br />
undergoing significant changes, particularly as a result of<br />
the increasing role played by Japan as an engine for growth<br />
in its own right.<br />
Not all nations in the region have been able to exploit the<br />
opportunities available. Vietnam stands out as an isolated<br />
and relatively backward economy but even there, evidence<br />
is emerging that the leadership, encouraged no doubt by the<br />
positive attitudes of the Thai Government, is willing to<br />
explore closer economic links with its neighbours.<br />
It is clear from all this that we should as a region be<br />
Sworking at ways of improving our co-operation so as to<br />
expand the opportunities for regional prosperity.<br />
In Korea earlier this week I urged the region to look<br />
closely at the model provided, in a different context, by<br />
the OECD.<br />
What Australia seeks is for the region to develop a capacity<br />
for analysis and consultation on economic and social issues,<br />
so as to help inform policy development by our respective<br />
governments.<br />
We are currently assessing regional attitudes towards the<br />
possibility of creating a more formal intergovernmental<br />
vehicle of regional co-operation and we believe a<br />
ministerial meeting would be a useful forum to investigate<br />
the question. I </p>
<p>The Korean President, Roh Tae Woo, endorsed these proposals<br />
and enthusiastically supported the idea of pursuing them<br />
further through regional consultations.<br />
I am particularly pleased that the Thai Prime Minister,<br />
General Chatichai, yesterday also welcomed the proposals.<br />
This leads naturally to my third point the implications<br />
for the global economy.<br />
For given the impasse at Montreal, a prime focus of any new<br />
institution of regional co-operation must be to foster a<br />
fair and open multilateral trading system.<br />
Let me describe the significance of this task in this way.<br />
I have already referred to the potential of the<br />
Australian-Thai relationship as significant.<br />
We are both ~ undertaking substantial adjustment programs to<br />
improve that relationship, and to exploit the poteritial of<br />
the region as a whole.<br />
But there is a limit to the extent that any country or any<br />
region can determine its own fate in this increasingly<br />
interdependent world.<br />
All those efforts we are making, and all those efforts of<br />
our regional partners, will be put in jeopardy if the<br />
world's multilateral trading system is allowed to<br />
disintegrate.<br />
The GATT system has provided the backdrop to decades of<br />
sustained post-war growth.<br />
But it is clear that the major economies today are unwilling<br />
to be governed by the spirit of multilateralism that<br />
inspired the original GATT parties more than forty years<br />
ago.<br />
There is now a wide recognition that the GATT system is<br />
unfair. For the main players, the United States, the<br />
European Community and Japan, whose main exports are of<br />
manufactured goods, the GATT system has rules which, whi: le<br />
not always clear and comprehensive, at least provide a<br />
recognisable framework within which trade can prosper. </p>
<p>For other players such * as Australia and Thailand, and many<br />
less developed countries, agricultural goods form a large<br />
part of our exports. And for these exports there are few<br />
formal rules to restrict blatantly unfair trading practices<br />
and to prevent massive subsidies, sometimes amounting to<br />
many times the market price, from perverting the trading<br />
system. It is the subsidies provided by countries whose main exports<br />
are manufactured goods those who benefit most from the<br />
GATT system that are so polluting trade to the detriment<br />
of large agricultural producers.<br />
The dumping of agricultural surpluses on world markets by<br />
the European Community, and policies of retaliatory<br />
sbsidisation adopted by the United States, have severely<br />
depressed and destabilised world agricultural prices and<br />
contributed to massive inefficiencies in the world economy.<br />
A study by the OECD estimates that the t axm policies of the<br />
European Community, Japan and the United States have cost<br />
taxpayers and consumers in these countries $ US200 billion a<br />
year over the last few years.<br />
The European Community and the United States talk of their<br />
low tariffs on manufactured goods. That is commendable.<br />
But it is not a relevant response to the complaints of those<br />
who export predominantly agricultural goods.<br />
It is disappointing not to mention paradoxical and<br />
irrational that at a time when international financial<br />
markets and exchange rates are being freed up, and many<br />
domestic economies are adjusting to become more efficient<br />
* and competitive, international trade is being subjected to<br />
ever more restrictive, inefficient and fundamentally<br />
short-sighted measures.<br />
These measures including non-tariff barriers and other<br />
means of restricting market access, escalating subsidy wars<br />
in agriculture, and the exclusion of whole product groups,<br />
such as textiles, from effective international competitionare<br />
all clear examples of the diminishing commitment by the<br />
major economies to the spirit and objectives of the GATT<br />
system.<br />
This deterioration appears now to have reached a critical<br />
stage. We are at a turning point.<br />
The recent Mid-term Review of the Uruguay Round in Montreal<br />
saw the process of GATT reform stall primarily because of<br />
the impasse on agriculture between the European Community<br />
and the United States. </p>
<p>Progress in all 15 GATT negotiating groups, covering the<br />
spectrum of GATT activities, is now suspended.<br />
The GATT Trade Negotiations Committee is to reconvene in<br />
April to attempt to break the deadlock.<br />
By general consensus, agriculture is now the central issue<br />
of this GATT round.<br />
Without substantial progress towards reforming agriculture,<br />
it appears no progress will be made.<br />
Without such progress the GATT system must, slowly but<br />
surely, disintegrate.<br />
Anyone who has heard me address an international audience in<br />
the past couple of years would know the importance I place<br />
on this issue.<br />
Quite simply, I see it as fundamental not only to the<br />
maintenance of economic growth but also, ultimately, to the<br />
continued stability of international relations into the<br />
1990s.<br />
When I last visited Thailand in 1983 I initiated a series of<br />
Regional Consultative Meetings designed to promote a<br />
stronger regional voice in, and commitment to, the<br />
Multilateral Trade Negotiations.<br />
Strong support by Thailand for this concept has greatly<br />
contributed towards its success.<br />
SIndeed, Thailand and Australia have been close partners in<br />
seeking to restore and extend the multilateral trading<br />
system. I pay tribute to your contribution, through membership of<br />
the Cairns Group, to the collective effort of fair traders<br />
to get the major powers to see sense, particularly on this<br />
vital issue of agricultural trade.<br />
As Australia and Thailand have consistently argued,<br />
liberalisation of agricultural trade is in the longer term<br />
interests of us all.<br />
It would of course have direct benefits to producers of<br />
agricultural goods.<br />
It would also make important inroads into the United States<br />
twin deficit problems. </p>
<p>It would also significantly boost real incomes of developing<br />
countries, allowing them to reduce their debt burdens.<br />
So what is the way forward?<br />
The impasse in Montreal reflected the inability of the<br />
United States and the European Community to move from their<br />
diametrically opposed starting positions.<br />
The European Community was unable to commit itself to<br />
substantial reform.<br />
Tehvee nUtnuiatl edc oSmtpalteetse wliabneterad liaslalt iopanr tiocf ipaagnrtisc utltou rcaolm mitrta dteo<br />
bee discussion of detailed issues could commence.<br />
Both used the intransigence of the other to justify their<br />
own inflexibility.<br />
The solution, surely, is clear.<br />
The stand-off must be broken by simultaneous action by both<br />
sides.<br />
Simultaneously the European Community must commit itself to<br />
reforming substantially the support systems underlying the<br />
Common Agricultural Policy; and the United States must agree<br />
to discussion on this basis.<br />
This can be achieved but political leadership is needed.<br />
That is why I have, very recently, written to President<br />
Bush, European Community Commission President Delors and<br />
hads of a number of governments in the European Community<br />
urging that they follow this path.<br />
And we are also proposing that a further Cairns Group<br />
ministerial meeting be held in Wellington in March.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I have seen reports that the MIT economist Lester Thurow<br />
believes " GATT is dead".<br />
GATT is not dead.<br />
But if the current deadlock is not broken, then we will have<br />
moved not to the end of GATT but quite possibly to the<br />
beginning of the end. </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The problems which I have discussed today are difficult arid<br />
at times may appear intractable.<br />
What is required to solve them is vision, leadership and a<br />
high sense of responsibility.<br />
As I look at Thailand, and the courageous and creative way<br />
in which it is approaching the difficult and, as we used to<br />
think, apparently intractable problem which it has faced in<br />
Indo-China, I believe that your country sets an example<br />
which should inspire us all.<br />
During my talks in Bangkok I have been deeply struck by the<br />
far-sighted vision being shown by Thai planners and<br />
decision-makers, as they contemplate a South-East Asia in<br />
which the wound of Cambodia has been healed.<br />
Prime Minister Chatichai has talked of turning Indo-China<br />
from a war zone into a peace and trading zone.<br />
It is precisely that vision which has led my Government to<br />
offer to build the Mekong Bridge between Thailand and Laos.<br />
With the same spirit of friendly co-operation, Australia and<br />
Thailand must work together to build our own economic<br />
wellbeing, to build economic relations throughout the region<br />
and to build a world of prosperity, stability and peace.<br />
