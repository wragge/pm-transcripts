    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Mr Dauth; to Mr Morgan; to Her Excellency, the</p>
<p> Ambassador of the Republic of the Philippines; to my Ministerial colleagues</p>
<p> who I welcome here today and most particularly, in the context of</p>
<p> this occasion, the re-appointed Cabinet Minister, the Minister for</p>
<p> Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and also the Cabinet Minister</p>
<p> I've appointed as responsible for reconciliation, Mr Philip Ruddock;</p>
<p> to my many other Parliamentary colleagues, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>I want to thank the organisers of this exhibition for the opportunity</p>
<p> of participating in this opening and the opportunity that it gives</p>
<p> me to say a few words on behalf of the Government about what the exhibition</p>
<p> represents.</p>
<p>This exhibition will showcase to the world, and most particularly</p>
<p> to our region, one of the great realities and one of the enduring</p>
<p> realities and one of the enduring strengths of the Australian nation</p>
<p> and that is its very rich cultural and ethnic diversity.</p>
<p>Many words have been spoken about the diversity of Australia and many</p>
<p> things have been said about what represents the triumphs of the Australian</p>
<p> nation. And also in the process of saying those words and writing</p>
<p> those things we acknowledge, of course, like any other nation, our</p>
<p> past and our history has had its blemishes. But the sum total, the</p>
<p> balance, is a very positive and a very favourable one of which all</p>
<p> of us as Australians, irrespective of our background and irrespective</p>
<p> of whether we were born in this country or whether our parents were</p>
<p> born in this country or we have adopted Australia as our country,</p>
<p> it is something that we all share in common, that we do have a very</p>
<p> rich record of achievement and a great record of tolerance and openness</p>
<p> of which we should all be undeniably proud.</p>
<p>We have, of course, in our history a special place for the indigenous</p>
<p> people of Australia. And that special place is represented in the</p>
<p> exhibition and it is properly and fully acknowledged in the exhibition</p>
<p> as rightly it should be.</p>
<p>This is an occasion to remind us that in the last 50 years we've</p>
<p> had five-and-a-half million people who have immigrated to this country</p>
<p> from 150 different nations around the world. There isn't an example</p>
<p> anywhere in the world of the successful absorption and integration</p>
<p> into the broader Australian community of such a diverse group of people.</p>
<p> We have been able to do it better than any other country. We have</p>
<p> been able to unite people of that diversity into a harmonious, positive,</p>
<p> forward-looking Australian society. But we have been able to do it</p>
<p> in a way that continues to respect the individual racial and ethnic</p>
<p> and cultural background of the different groups that make up the Australian</p>
<p> nation.</p>
<p>As I said on the night of the last election, Australia was a nation</p>
<p> of many parts and many origins. The things that unite us as Australians</p>
<p> will always be more powerful and more enduring than the things that</p>
<p> divide us. And we have been able to achieve something quite unique</p>
<p> in the world. We've been able to achieve a sense of national</p>
<p> unity and preserve our sense of nationhood and our characteristic</p>
<p> identity as Australians without denying to the many parts that make</p>
<p> up the sum of the Australian nation a right to preserve and to nurture,</p>
<p> to love and to enjoy and to cherish their individual ethnic identity</p>
<p> and origin and the culture that goes with that individual ethnic origin</p>
<p> and identity.</p>
<p>So this is an occasion, and the opening of this exhibition is an opportunity</p>
<p> to talk about, in a very confident and assertive way of the Australian</p>
<p> achievement, particularly over the last 50 years. But it's also</p>
<p> an opportunity and an occasion to remind ourselves that that achievement</p>
<p> is not something that can be taken for granted. That we must always</p>
<p> reaffirm the essential principles of tolerance and decent treatment</p>
<p> of all Australians irrespective of their background. That we should</p>
<p> always, as a people, reject and shun intolerance and discrimination.</p>
<p> We should always proclaim the self-evident importance that every man</p>
<p> and woman in this country is entitled to equal treatment irrespective</p>
<p> of their racial, national, religious, ethnic or other origin. And</p>
<p> that any kind of racial discrimination is abhorrent to the Australian</p>
<p> value and to the Australian way of life. And that any practices or</p>
<p> attitudes that encourage intolerance and encourage insensitivity towards</p>
<p> people on account of their racial or religious background or intolerance</p>
<p> is something that should be rejected and shunned by all Australians</p>
<p> and that is one of the verities of modern Australian life and it's</p>
<p> a verity that we practice, it's a verity that we proclaim here</p>
<p> in Australia and it is something that we communicate and we proclaim</p>
<p> to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>One could not encompass in a short speech of this nature the contribution</p>
<p> of people of so many different backgrounds have made to the Australian</p>
<p> nation. We think of the massive contribution of so many people of</p>
<p> diverse backgrounds to our cultural life, to our business life, to</p>
<p> our political life, to our diplomatic life, to our sporting life.</p>
<p> We see the entry into sports hither to be seen as somehow or other</p>
<p> connected to one particular aspect of our national identity or our</p>
<p> national history of people of different and diverse backgrounds. And,</p>
<p> of course, the contribution that people of so many different backgrounds</p>
<p> have made to the view the rest of the world has of Australia has been</p>
<p> absolutely incalculable.</p>
<p>It is a well accepted fact that one of the many things that swung</p>
<p> the International Olympic Committee in favour of Sydney those several</p>
<p> years ago and one of the reasons why we will have the opportunity</p>
<p> in this beautiful city of hosting the Olympic Games in the year 2000</p>
<p> was the knowledge of the racial diversity and the cultural harmony</p>
<p> and diversity of the Australian nation. And it was something that</p>
<p> weighed very heavily in our favour and something that worked very</p>
<p> much to our credit. And there is much to celebrate in the modern Australian</p>
<p> nation.</p>
<p>We are, as I have remarked on many occasions, a nation that occupies</p>
<p> a unique intersection. We are in so many ways a projection of Western</p>
<p> civilisation in this part of the world. We have deep and enduring</p>
<p> links with Britain and the other nations of Europe and we share much</p>
<p> of the great cultural and politically liberal inheritance, and I say</p>
<p> liberal not in any party political sense but in a generic sense, of</p>
<p> European background. We also have very profound links with the nations</p>
<p> of North America and we have shared with the United States of America</p>
<p> the most powerful and the largest democracy in the world many experiences</p>
<p> both in war and in peace.</p>
<p>But here we are in the Asian-Pacific region of the world and we have</p>
<p> within the Australian nation itself a very, very vibrant community</p>
<p> of people of Asian descent who are playing a magnificent role in contributing</p>
<p> to the strength and the vitality of the modern Australia. In combining</p>
<p> those three things we have a special opportunity and we have characteristics</p>
<p> and assets that no other country in the world has. And we have an</p>
<p> opportunity if we use those characteristics and those assets in an</p>
<p> effective way we have an opportunity to achieve things that no other</p>
<p> country can achieve.</p>
<p>We are seen in Asia as having the advantages without the disadvantages</p>
<p> of our European and our American associations. We are seen in Europe</p>
<p> and in North America as having insights into the politics and the</p>
<p> culture and the life of the nations of the Asia-Pacific region. Not</p>
<p> only because of our geographic proximity but also because of the people-to-people</p>
<p> links, that exist between so many Australians of Asian descent and</p>
<p> the countries of that region.</p>
<p>And when I think of that unique intersection we occupy, that unique</p>
<p> conjunction of cultural and historical and geographical assets I can</p>
<p> only but be very excited and enthusiastic about the opportunities</p>
<p> that lie in front of this country as we move into the 21st</p>
<p> Century.</p>
<p>It's incredibly exciting and positive time to be alive in Australia,</p>
<p> to be involved in the affairs of our nation and to have the opportunity</p>
<p> of sharing in all those events that are going to unfold in the next</p>
<p> few years Â– the Olympic Games, the celebration of 100 years of</p>
<p> the Australian Federation, the achievement, I hope, of a lasting reconciliation</p>
<p> between the indigenous people of our country and the rest of the Australian</p>
<p> community. And what this exhibition will do will be to say confidently</p>
<p> to the rest of the world what modern Australia represents. It represents</p>
<p> a group of people who are proud of what we have achieved, acknowledge</p>
<p> the mistakes that we have made, celebrate our tolerance and our diversity</p>
<p> and thank the peoples of the world for the contribution over the years</p>
<p> they have made to the building of the Australian nation.</p>
<p>So, therefore, as Prime Minister I am particularly delighted to congratulate</p>
<p> the organisers of the exhibition, to wish them well, to thank them</p>
<p> for the many months of toil that they have put into establishing this</p>
<p> exhibition. I know it will be a huge success because it will tell</p>
<p> the truth about Australia and it will represent the modern Australia</p>
<p> to the rest of the world in a most effective and illuminating fashion.</p>
<p> I declare it open. Thank you.</p>
