    <content><![CDATA[<p>A new World Health Organisation (WHO) commissioned evaluation of the</p>
<p> Swiss heroin trial has cast significant doubt over previous claims</p>
<p> about the benefits of the trial.</p>
<p>The WHO report entitled Report of the External Panel on the Evaluation</p>
<p> of the Swiss Scientific Studies of Medically Prescribed Narcotics</p>
<p> to Drug Addicts, found that Âsome of the findings of the</p>
<p> study' conducted by the Swiss Government Âhave been somewhat</p>
<p> over-interpreted as favourable to heroin maintenance treatment'.</p>
<p>The evaluation pointed to the fact that the Swiss trial included comprehensive</p>
<p> social and psychological services.</p>
<p>Given the provision of the non-drug treatment and support, it cannot</p>
<p> be concluded that prescribed heroin contributed to the improved the</p>
<p> health and welfare of participants.</p>
<p>The report said that with the absence of a control group it was not</p>
<p> clear if the same results could have been achieved without the prescription</p>
<p> of heroin.</p>
<p>In other words, the improvements recorded in the health and well being</p>
<p> of participants could have been due to the intensive non-drug treatment</p>
<p> they received.</p>
<p>Significantly, the evaluation found that there is not convincing evidence</p>
<p> that heroin prescription generally leads to better outcomes than methadone</p>
<p> treatment, even for hard core users.</p>
<p>The report also found that while reported criminal activity declined</p>
<p> no data was provided to indicate the frequency or financial costs</p>
<p> associated with these offences, or to back up claims that reduction</p>
<p> in criminal behaviour persisted after dropping out from treatment.</p>
<p>Heroin prescription trials occurred between 1994-96 in Switzerland</p>
<p> for addicts with at least 2 years of heroin use who had attempted</p>
<p> other treatment more than once.</p>
<p>The WHO evaluation is particularly significant given that the 1997</p>
<p> annual report of the International Narcotics Control Board (a United</p>
<p> Nations publication) expressed the Board's firm belief that no</p>
<p> further experiments should be undertaken until the Swiss project had</p>
<p> undergone full and independent evaluation.</p>
<p>The International Narcotics Control Board said in it's 1997 report:</p>
<p>"The Board is concerned that the announcement of those results</p>
<p> (the Swiss Government's own evaluation released in July 1997)</p>
<p> and a subsequent national referendum on the Swiss drug policy have</p>
<p> led to misinterpretations and hasty conclusions by some politicians</p>
<p> and the media in several European countries."</p>
<p>It also stated:</p>
<p>"The Board regrets that, before the evaluation by WHO of the</p>
<p> outcome of the Swiss experiment, pressure groups and some politicians</p>
<p> are already promoting the expansion of such programmes in Switzerland</p>
<p> and their proliferation in other countries."</p>
<p>Now that we have the evaluation, the caution urged by the International</p>
<p> Narcotics Control Board has proved justified because the WHO has raised</p>
<p> real questions about the validity of many of the claims made about</p>
<p> the Swiss trial.</p>
<p>With regard to the views of the Australian Government, the WHO evaluation</p>
<p> confirms our doubts about the true value of the Swiss experience,</p>
<p> and provides no reason to change our opposition to heroin trials.</p>
<p>If a trial were to be held in Australia it would send exactly the</p>
<p> wrong message to the community, and would work against our education</p>
<p> efforts.</p>
<p>In light of the new doubts raised through the WHO, a heroin trial</p>
<p> remains a risky proposition that is unacceptable to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>The assistance provided under the Federal Government's Tough</p>
<p> On Drugs strategy which has already directed more than $60 million</p>
<p> to treatment and rehabilitation services is of far greater long term</p>
<p> benefit to drug users and will save far more lives than a heroin trial.</p>
