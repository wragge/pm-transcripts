4~ j&gt; A USTRAL ( A<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 26 March 1978<br />
I have again written to State Premiers regarding the adoption<br />
by th-e Australian Loan Council of proposed new guidelines for<br />
the Council's consideration of proposals for special addition<br />
to the semi-government borrowing program and for overseas<br />
borrowings by statutory authorities.<br />
In responding to my earlier letter, some State Premiers had<br />
baulked at t he suggestion that the voting arrangements on<br />
proposals put to the Council should be a simple majority<br />
including the Commonwealth.<br />
In suggesting this arrangement, the Commonwealth is conscious<br />
of the need to make the proposed new guidelines as flexible<br />
as possible while, at the same time, ensuring they are<br />
consistent with the Commonwealth's responsibility for<br />
national economic and financial management.<br />
I have pointed out to the Premiers the importance at this<br />
stage of exploring as soon as possible these new arrangements<br />
which will be of great benefit to Australia. I suggested<br />
that those Premiers who wished could submit proposals for<br />
additional borrowing authority for Loan Council consideration..<br />
I urged them to take up the proposition advanced by the<br />
Commonwealth and submit projects which they considered to be<br />
of significance to the economic development of Australia.<br />
