    <content><![CDATA[<p>Simon Benson';s article in today';s The Daily Telegraph is inaccurate.  The Government announced on 22 January this year that the Commonwealth had sold ComLand to Lend Lease for $165 million.  Contrary to the claims in the article, the signed contract does include a commitment that Lend Lease develop a 100 hectare Central Park.  New sporting facilities, such as the playing fields and tennis, netball and basketball courts which I announced yesterday, will be developed within the existing regional open space outside the Regional Park while facilities such as bicycle paths, walking trails and picnic facilities will be provided within the Regional Park.  This will require relevant State Government approvals including endorsement through the Regional Park plan of management.</p>
<p>Throughout this project, the government has acted to protect the conservation values at St Mary';s, in particular the remnant stands of Cumberland Plain woodland on the site.  In March 2002, the Commonwealth significantly increased the conservation area at St Mary';s and placed a further 250 hectares on the Register of the National Estate.  As a result, approximately two thirds of the 1,545 hectare site will be retained as parkland, with the Regional Park to be handed over to the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service for management as a Regional Park under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974.</p>
<p>This outcome represents a good balance between conservation of the national heritage and meeting the housing, employment and sporting needs of the people of western Sydney.</p>
