I thank Agnes Shea for the Welcome to Country and pay my respects to the traditional owners of this land on which we gather.</p>
<p>In making that acknowledgment, I honour the dignity and resilience of all Indigenous Australians.</p>
<p>And I recall with pride today the fact that eight recipients of the Australian of the Year Award have been Indigenous, including the late Lionel Rose whose loss we mourned in May.</p>
<p>I also acknowledge:</p>
<p>Ministerial and parliamentary colleagues</p>
<p>Adam Gilchrist, Chair of the National Australia Day Council and fellow Council members</p>
<p>Australia Day sponsors and supporters.</p>
<p>Australian of the Year, Simon McKeon</p>
<p>Young Australian of the Year, Jessica Watson</p>
<p>I also acknowledge Professor Ron McCallum, 2011 Senior Australian of the Year, and Don Ritchie, Australia's Local Hero for 2011, who can't be with us today.</p>
<p>Friends, for more than 50 years now, the Australian of the Year Awards have played a vital role in our community  -  helping us to find outstanding role models for us all to admire.</p>
<p>And they do so in a way that is so deeply grounded in our Australian outlook and values.</p>
<p>Donald Horne once wrote that Australians are notoriously reluctant to reward “eminence without excellence.”</p>
<p>In other words, they will not doff their caps merely because someone holds an office or a position.</p>
<p>And that is how it should be.</p>
<p>That is something truly special about the society we have created here under southern skies.</p>
<p>We are not a people of hierarchy or deference or fine gradations of social status.</p>
<p>There is comparatively little pomp and ceremony in our public life.</p>
<p>I love a nation where the Prime Minister can walk down the street and grab a coffee and have people yell out “Julia give us  a wave.”</p>
<p>The Australian of the Year Awards are a way of manifesting our democratic temper.</p>
<p>A way for our society to hold up a mirror to itself and discern the qualities and characteristics that are most valued by our community.</p>
<p>The Australian of the Year Award in fact tells a consistent and faithful story of what we value:</p>
<p>As I've noted, eight awards have gone to Indigenous Australians.</p>
<p>Sportspeople are well represented but by no means as much as one might imagine.</p>
<p>There is a generous selection of artists and performers.</p>
<p>A very large number of scientists and medicos.</p>
<p>Two churchmen.</p>
<p>And only one politician!</p>
<p>The 51 years of this award indeed show a grown up nation able to make mature and insightful choices.</p>
<p>A nation that can honour Steve Waugh but also Manning Clark.</p>
<p>John Farnham but also Neville Bonner.</p>
<p>And this year, a unique moment in the history of the awards - the appointment of our first Australian of the Year acknowledged for social entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Making the point that as we become a wealthier nation,we must also become a more generous nation.</p>
<p>Friends, the single thread uniting five decades of this award is their connection to the Australian community.</p>
<p>Nominations come from the community.</p>
<p>They are not imposed from above.</p>
<p>All Australians have a chance to have their say by nominating someone who they think reflects the qualities that we admire.</p>
<p>I encourage all Australians to take advantage of this opportunity to share the stories of people that they know,or know of, by nominating them for the Awards.</p>
<p>The criteria are very simple:</p>
<p> * 	Demonstrated excellence in their field<br />
 * 	Contribution to the Australian community and the nation<br />
 * 	An inspirational role model for the community</p>
<p>Sometimes that brings forward obvious and outstanding names like Mark Taylor or Peter Cosgrove.</p>
<p>Sometimes those whose brilliance doesn't always occupy the headlines like Gus Nossal or John Yu.</p>
<p>But there is always a deep wisdom in the names chosen.</p>
<p>The abiding wisdom of a free people in a democratic and egalitarian society.</p>
<p>That is what these accolades celebrate.</p>
<p>Our better angels.</p>
<p>Our nation as it can and should be.</p>
<p>Friends, in launching these awards, I thank our major sponsor, the Commonwealth Bank, for more than 32 years of generous support.</p>
<p>I thank our newest supporter, ABC Television, who have just come on board as the Awards' broadcast partner.</p>
<p>I also thank our other corporate partners:Fairfax Media; Qantas; Holiday Inn; ABC Local Radio and SBS Radio.</p>
<p>I thank Adam and all his colleagues at the Australia Day Council and across government who support these awards and the wider Australia Day celebrations throughout the year.</p>
<p>Nominations for the Australian of the Year Awards 2012 will close on August 31.</p>
<p>That's plenty of opportunity for all Australians to get involved.</p>
<p>So log on to the Australian of the Year website and have your say.</p>
<p>In that great Aussie tradition, ‘have a go'.</p>
<p>If there's someone you look up to or admire, put their name forward.</p>
<p>You never know where it might lead.</p>
<p>It is now my pleasure to declare nominations for the 2012 Australian of the Year Awards officially open. </p>
