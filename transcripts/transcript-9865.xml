SPEECH AT THE AREA CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE CHAIRS<br />
NATIONAL CONFERENCE, HOTEL INTERCONTINENTAL, SYDNEY,<br />
4 DECEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Well thank you, Monique ( Aho], Simon ( Crean], my colleague, Derek Volker,<br />
distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
Well we appreciate very much you coming together. But, more particularly,<br />
for giving us support over the course of the last year in doing what, I think, is<br />
a new thing for Australia. That is, a partnership between the Government<br />
and business in focussing on the labour market and particularly on the long<br />
term unemployed.<br />
One of the things, I think, we have always believed well we like to believe<br />
certainly it is one of our characteristics, is that sense of fairness and<br />
egalitarianism which I know you all share and I think most Australians share.<br />
And there was no way that we can continue to lay claim to those qualities if a<br />
large proportion of the workforce were denied opportunities to take their<br />
place in society and to enjoy the things the-rest of us have been able to enjoy<br />
and to share in the opportunities and the bounty of Australia.<br />
And the difficulties of unemployment and longterm unemployment have been<br />
pretty obvious for quite a long time and even in the 1 980s where we had<br />
spectacular rates of employment growth, we could never get unemployment<br />
below about 6 1/ 2 per cent because we could never get down into the people<br />
who had already lost their place in the labour market. And I think we always<br />
need to keep a sort of mind's eye picture of the labour market of people<br />
coming into the pool, perhaps staying there a few weeks or a few months,<br />
and then going out to employment. And the fact that some people in the pool<br />
are there a very long time and they drift to the bottom of that labour market<br />
and when we get strong employment, there is not enough pulling power from<br />
the employment to tug the new entrants along and to pull them out of<br />
longterm unemployment.<br />
So you find we have this pattern of those who join the labour market are the<br />
school leavers, women moving into the labour market often rejoining it, or </p>
<p>for the first time migrants. * Aiid so even in an economy which is growing as<br />
strongly as this one has where we have had employment growth of around 3<br />
1/ 2 per cent to 4 per cent it is taking up the new entrants and it is taking<br />
down unemployment. But it is not necessarily getting to the longterm<br />
unemployed and for all the reasons that Monique mentioned a few moments<br />
ago, people lose their self esteem, they lose their sense of importance and<br />
their sense of self worth and, after a while, they are psychologically not really<br />
prepared to apply for jobs or even were they lucky to snare one are they in<br />
the right sort of shape to make a contribution to hang onto one.<br />
So the challenge has been for us to deal with the longterm unemployed as<br />
well as the raw demands of employment. Now I am very happy with the rate<br />
of growth we have been getting in employment growth. We had the largest<br />
fall in unemployment in the last 12 months we have ever had. But even so,<br />
8 1/ 2 per cent unemployment is too high and you can see that even with the<br />
economy growing somewhere between 6 per cent and 4 per cent in the last<br />
few years, in fact we have had 17 quarters of consecutive growth. This is the<br />
longest growth phase in Australia since the war. We have never had 17<br />
consecutive quarters of growth since the Second World War and yet we have<br />
still got unemployment with an eight in front of it.<br />
Now our target is to get to unemployment of 5 per cent by the turn of the<br />
century, which means as we continue with employment growth and we get<br />
towards that 6 1/ 2 per cent we had in the late 80s this time with Working<br />
Nation in place we ought to be able to go down further through the<br />
arrangements we have in place with you and people like you, in the Area<br />
Consultative Committees, and with employers across the country to focus on<br />
the longterm unemployed so that we can actually get down to that group that<br />
we weren't able to get to in the 1980s.<br />
Now since Working Nation was introduced, we have had a 25 per cent fall in<br />
longterm unemployed. And, I think, even after the end of the 80s with that<br />
huge period of employment growth, we only reduced longterm unemployment<br />
by something like 8 per cent or 9 per cent. So this is a huge improvement<br />
and it couples in with what we are trying to do in education and training<br />
generally. This morning I was out at the Canterbury-Bankstown Leagues Club, talking to<br />
the Southern Sydney and South West Area Consultative Committees, and I<br />
was making the point there about education and how education and training<br />
are the bridges to better opportunities for everybody. It allows people to<br />
crack through the barriers economic, social, however they perceive them<br />
and find the opportunities for themselves.<br />
Now a decade ago, only three young people in ten completed secondary<br />
school. This year it is eight in ten and a decade ago we were putting 40 per<br />
cent of young people through university and we are still putting 40 per cent<br />
through, which has meant with a massive increase in participation and<br />
completion rates in secondary school we have had a huge addition to the </p>
<p>stock of tertiary places. We" -have 66ne from 325,000 university places in<br />
1985 to over 600,000 this year.<br />
So we have got that 40 per cent coming through. But, of course, in a much<br />
fairer sample because so many more young people are completing Years 11<br />
and 12 and going on. But we also had the problem of that other 60 per cent<br />
cascading into very little training and in a country that wants to be<br />
technological clever and innovative there is no way you can talk about a<br />
clever country for a start, if only three in ten young people completed<br />
secondary school, and even if we get to eight in ten as we are now, if we<br />
can't get a higher proportion of them trained, we are not going to make the<br />
grade in terms of their expectations and opportunities and our own for the<br />
country. So we are doing two things. We are building a tertiary education system of<br />
quality and we have had a big revolution in tertiary education and we are still<br />
working our way through that. We have now expanded it. We have now got<br />
to continue to lift the quality on that so we don't get lower common<br />
denominator effects and now out into vocational education in the One Nation<br />
statement of 1992, we put together the Australian National Training Authority,<br />
which for the first time is putting together a national TAFE system, with<br />
national accreditation. Now this was a big effort.<br />
Joan Kimer is with us today. She was Premier then and I owe her a great<br />
debt in supporting that initiative and we brought the other States to it. Wayne<br />
Goss was ANTA is now based in Brisbane and he was, if you like, one of<br />
the founding Premiers in it and the impact of it has been, I think, already<br />
rather profound. And we are going to build a national vocational education<br />
system and with it appropriate certification so that the standing of somebody<br />
with a certificate from TAFE or ANTA across the country will be able to find<br />
recognition as they find for a tertiary degree.<br />
Now all of this, of course, fits the story of training and in Working Nation we<br />
focussed on the longterm unemployed through this novel thing of a Job<br />
Compact, where we say after you have been unemployed 12 months or more<br />
we will give you a Case Manager, who then manages you and that person will<br />
manage around 30 people and get to know you, your educational<br />
attainments, your work experience, your aptitude, your family situation and<br />
has the option of giving you a job subsidy and getting that person placed into<br />
a job. But the essence of the Compact is they must take the job.<br />
Now through that device we have had a lot of success in bringing longterm<br />
unemployment down and that, in part, also means bringing the business<br />
community into the picture. Because it can't be done only by the<br />
Government, it can't be done by the CES. We are also trying to develop a<br />
private training market and Joan is chairing ESRA, which Simon and I<br />
developed to create a market for employment services so it is not just, again,<br />
the monolith of the CES. But we have also got other private providers of<br />
employment services out there, just as we are going to have private providers </p>
<p>of training. It won't just be the AN1AITAFE monolith, but private training<br />
providers. And just out at Canterbury-Bankstown this morning, a representative of a<br />
construction firm was saying how they have set up their own training unit and<br />
they are putting about 170 people a year through it. And we are supporting<br />
that, financially, and we are supporting those sorts of activities financially<br />
around the country to see a private training market emerge as well.<br />
The other important thing, I think, we are doing is we are starting to try and<br />
encourage young people in Years 11 and 12 to get some out of school work<br />
experience and start to focus their career into TAFE and giving them TAFE<br />
accreditation while in Years 11 and 12, through the Youth Training Initiative<br />
of Working Nation.<br />
So, in other words, instead of them finding at the end of Year 12 when they<br />
have left school and all of a sudden they can't find a job and are not sure<br />
what they do next and they are not quite prepared for the next step, we start<br />
getting them thinking about what they might do and getting them prepared<br />
and getting them focussed and streamed in Years 11 and 12.<br />
In Working Nation we thought it was important to declare that we wouldn't let<br />
any young people under 15 years of age slip through the system. We were<br />
regarding 15 to 19 years as a period of vocational preparation. We don't<br />
expect young people to be away from school, or away from structured training<br />
and, if they are, we try and pick them up through the labour market<br />
programs, or get them back into accredited training. At least they should<br />
have the opportunity that, to 19 years of age, they can then come and say I<br />
have had education to a certain level, or training to a certain level, or<br />
post-secondary training of some quality and they can prepare themselves<br />
better for entry into the labour market.<br />
So this is a very great change and it all, I think, underlines this question<br />
about what sort of society we want to be. Now as you know there would be<br />
no place for Working Nation or One Nation in the Contract with America.<br />
There is no way our friends in the Republican Party, there, would have a bar<br />
of it because they say if you are out of work, bad luck. Bad luck, do your best<br />
and get moving.<br />
But what that attitude and state of mind does is, I think, damn a lot of people<br />
to longterm unemployment. Their children grow up in the environment of<br />
their parents being longterm unemployed and it produces a sub-culture which<br />
is not only dispiriting and completely dismal for them, but starts then to erode<br />
the whole egalitarian ethos of the country and the social cohesion we have<br />
always had.<br />
Employment in Australia has always been the way you got your hand on<br />
some of the national cake. And if you are not employed or you can't get a<br />
job, then those opportunities are denied to you. And we say that a target of<br />
per cent unemployment is achievable. It means we have got to grow the </p>
<p>economy a bit faster than Wewouldini the traditional structure. But with an<br />
Accord we can grow the economy faster than we would say in Western<br />
Europe or North America.<br />
I mean you hear a few of my opponents talking about labour market reform,<br />
which is just code for cutting wages on the bottom end of the labour market.<br />
You look at America which has got an army of working poor on very low rates<br />
of pay, exceptionally low rates of pay, and yet the American speed limit is 2<br />
1/ 2 per cent GOP growth. It has not made the American labour market more<br />
flexible. Or if it were to be more flexible, America could grow faster than 2 1/ 2<br />
per cent. But it never does.<br />
Yet we have been averaging around 4 per cent and we did this mostly<br />
through the 1980s and any country that is growing at 4 per cent a year is<br />
creating a lot of wealth and this economy of ours is $ 500 billion of GOP, 4 per<br />
cent of that is $ 20 billion. So there is $ 20 billion of new value every year is<br />
being created and it helps Humpty Dumpty to stay together if there is<br />
billion out there of new real wealth being created.<br />
Now there are bigger and smaller Humpty Dumpties all around the country<br />
we all know that. There are a couple of big Humpty Dumpties in this city. But<br />
the fact of the matter is we have got to have that sort of creation to get the<br />
economy moving.<br />
Now I think it is worth pondering, we had the National Accounts out last week,<br />
and after 17 quarters of growth, we are now in our fifth year of consecutive<br />
growth and growing. For instance, in the year to September last year at 6 per<br />
cent, growing this year at 3.5 per cent. But, basically, around 4 per cent to<br />
per cent you can say, on average, in these last three or four years. The<br />
Non-Farm GOP Deflator, the broadest measure of inflation. The one that is<br />
not messed up by weightings in the CPI basket, the broadest measure was<br />
2.8 per cent in last week's National Accounts for the quarter. So after 17<br />
quarters of growth and running at that speed and strength, we have still got<br />
inflation at 2.8 per cent in the broad, which is a mighty achievement.<br />
Now there was a time, of course, when if you said things like 2.8 per cent, or<br />
2 1/ 2 per cent inflation we have been running between 1 1/ 2 per cent and<br />
2 1/ 2 per cent really for the last three to four years. People are now getting a<br />
bit blase about it. They shouldn't. Inflation is a scourge. It slows your<br />
economic growth, it pulls peoples' assets down, it wrecks their savings, it<br />
gives them big mortgages. But the reason we can run the economy faster is<br />
the Accord we have with the unions and, essentially, it is that essential<br />
undertaking: growth and employment growth for sensible wage outcomes.<br />
The unions say give us growth and employment growth and we will give you<br />
sensible wage outcomes. Now we are getting, now, quite strong growth in<br />
real wages. But we are still protecting the inflation rate with good productivity<br />
growth coming from the enterprise bargaining system. So we have got a<br />
good strong economy on our hands. We have got good profits, good<br />
investment numbers around. </p>
<p>There is no reason why these strong employment rates can't stay up and if<br />
they stay up we have got to pull the longterm unemployed into it. We just<br />
can't take the new entrants the school leavers, women joining the workforce,<br />
or rejoining it, or migrants and just let the longterm unemployed people<br />
languish in the longterm pool of unemployment.<br />
So that is why your Area Consultative Committees matter. That is why the<br />
link to business matters because if we can't get you interested and to know<br />
that you do end up as this chap this morning was telling us about his<br />
construction company that is getting a good class of trained people coming<br />
from longterm unemployed people. He is training them himself and then he<br />
knows that he has got tremendous loyalty from them in the firm and they are<br />
going on.<br />
Now I know in these sorts of ventures people say oh well, you know, there is<br />
a bit altruism required here. But it is not altruism. There is a bit of<br />
good-spiritedness about it. There is a bit of compassion about it. But there is<br />
also a lot of efficiency about it and good sense because, obviously, we will<br />
never make the sort of growth rates we can and enjoy the sort of incomes we<br />
expect if a large part of the country's resources are either under employed, or<br />
unemployed. So we are doing something for all of us if we get the longterm unemployed<br />
back to work and we are doing something particularly for them and we are<br />
making our society more cohesive.<br />
Now the other day, my Tory opponents jumped all over me for talking about<br />
the rates of deaths in California amongst young people. And I read this<br />
chilling statistic in, I think it was, Time magazine saying that in California<br />
more young people die of gun shot wounds than die of car accidents and that<br />
is pretty frightening. The main reason for t hat is because under these crazy<br />
American laws, they let people carry guns around. But it is also part of the<br />
social malaise of unemployment and disillusionment and rejection. It is all<br />
out there and we don't want to see any of that cancer coming into the<br />
Australian society. I mean some of that malaise has been there with the<br />
longterm unemployed and as a society we have got to get in and do<br />
something about it.<br />
Now Working Nation is the most valiant attempt ever been made in this<br />
country to deal with it and, as far as we know, while other countries similar<br />
countries are into labour market programs, none of them have quite got the<br />
innovation of Working Nation, we don't think, and we think we are a real show<br />
of building on that 25 per cent reduction in longterm unemployment since it<br />
was introduced and getting that down and making a very big difference into<br />
the way Australia functions and the fact that people can share in it.<br />
Now the Government has taken a very big interest in regional Australia<br />
because now in some of the regions they are growing much faster than the<br />
capital cities. A lot of the employment opportunities are in some of the<br />
1 77 </p>
<p>regions. We are trying to get regional leadership, we are trying to give<br />
regions focus and, at the same time, we are trying, in that, to get a focus on<br />
Iongterm unemployment which is prone to be more difficult in the regions than<br />
in the cities. And we are very pleased that so many of you are from the<br />
regions of Australia and you have seen yourself committed and interested<br />
enough to be in it with us, to do something about it. Because the whole thing<br />
about One Nation is that we think of ourselves as one nation when we are all<br />
pulling together and it is not just programs for the capital cities, but for the<br />
provincial cities and the towns and the regions around the country as well.<br />
So I would like to take this opportunity of thanking you for your interest in<br />
work and training and I think we all know that when we give these people<br />
training and work experience, even with a job subsidy, when the job subsidy<br />
finishes the retention rates we are getting are so encouraging that people are<br />
staying in the jobs and going on.<br />
So we may well be able to fill those jobs which the labour market is requiring<br />
us to fill with employment growth. The main thing is we fill them by taking a<br />
good share of the longterm unemployed up into them as well. So we have<br />
some real fairness operating in the system and we have the sort of country<br />
that we have always believed Australia should be.<br />
Anyway thank you very much for coming along today. Simon and I are<br />
delighted with the progress of it. Simon has done a great job with Working<br />
Nation, as Minister. He has got a great Secretary in Derek Volker and a<br />
great team in DEET. We are absolutely delighted with it and pleased as<br />
punch you can be involved with us.<br />
