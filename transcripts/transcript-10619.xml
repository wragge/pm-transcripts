    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today I announce the latest step in the Federal Government's fight against domestic violence with a programme to encourage corporate Australia to play its part.</p>
<p>Entitled Business Against Domestic Violence, the initiative recognises that employers have ways of reaching people that Governments, churches and charities cannot.</p>
<p>Business will be encouraged to contribute top level leadership, develop policies linking the workplace to services addressing domestic violence, or donate to public benevolence projects.</p>
<p>To provide an incentive for organisations to become involved in this initiative, the Government has decided to amend the income tax law to allow tax deductions for gifts of the value of $2 or more.</p>
<p>The initiative will be co-chaired by Robert Champion de Crespigny of Normandy Mining, Paula Gerber, a partner in the law firm Maddock Lonie and Chisholm, and Anne Badger of Melbourne Grammar School.</p>
<p>In NSW alone it is estimated that domestic violence costs the community $1.5 billion annually through medical expenses, legal costs, corrective services, lost productivity and forgone income.</p>
<p>While half of this is borne by victims, an estimated $400 million is paid by Governments through services such as sole parent pensions.</p>
<p>The remaining bill is carried by business themselves, as raised anxiety levels reduce productivity rates or offenders and victims stay away from work altogether.</p>
<p>Already many large Australian companies operate alcohol and drug programmes but more can be done.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth and State Governments spend $226 million annually on crisis services for the victims of domestic violence, including a $25 million programme announced last Friday to find new ways of preventing the cycle of violence infecting a new generation of abusers.</p>
<p>I am proud to be the patron of this initiative because domestic violence has the capacity to destroy families, now and in the next generation.</p>
