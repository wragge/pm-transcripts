TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH KEITH CONLAN, ABC RADIO, 16 MAY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
KC: Prime Minister Paul Keating welcome to South Australia.<br />
PM: Thanks very much Keith, glad to be here.<br />
KC: Before we get onto some of those bigger issues, I know people<br />
combed the Budget for news on the Mount Barker Road. I understand<br />
you may be able to tell us something in Adelaide today.<br />
PM: Yes, I am able to say and am pleased to announce that the<br />
Commonwealth Government will undertake the building of the Mount<br />
Barker road and also the extension of Adelaide airport. The<br />
Commonwealth will build an 8.3 kilometre divided freeway which will<br />
include, Keith, a six lane tunnel to replace the present road which is<br />
steep and winding and undivided on Mount Barker which is thegateway<br />
to Adelaide on Ade laide-MelIbourne national transport<br />
corridor. I think the total cost is somewhere about $ 130 million, it will<br />
be funded from the Commonwealth National Highway program.<br />
KC: That has been in the queue for a long time as you know and we<br />
expected to hear that within weeks. Does this tell us that you really<br />
are, as many commentators suggest, very much in election mode?<br />
PM: We are building this through safe Liberal party electorates. They are<br />
not Labor party seats, so there is no electioneering in that. I mean, we<br />
are building it because we see the need there and it has been a very<br />
unsafe piece of road for a long time. The other thing which I think is<br />
important to the State and that is we are prepared to commission<br />
immediately design work and undertake the necessary environmental<br />
studies to finalise plans for the extension of Adelaide airport. The<br />
South Australian Government said they will propose $ 20 million<br />
towards the extension. We will fund any short fall over that and<br />
construction of the airport can then proceed ahead of the leasing of<br />
Adelaide airport. </p>
<p>KC: Can you help us with the picture there, Prime Minister, because the<br />
Premier here, Dean Brown, is keen to offer you the sort of lock, stock<br />
and barrel option. We will take it over, we will get on with it quickly,<br />
how does this fit in?<br />
PM: I think, this is even perhaps better for him and for South Australia.<br />
That is, we are saying that we will sell it, but what we'll do is we will<br />
then refund to South Australia $ 20 million from the proceeds. That<br />
way we can keep it in the sale program with the other airports. So, in<br />
other words, we will build it. South Australia puts in $ 20 million. When<br />
it is sold, we will refund the $ 20 million back out from it.<br />
KC: Now, Minister Alston in the South Australian government has been<br />
looking at buyers for Adeiide airport. Again, how does that work, you<br />
will talk to him about who is in the ring?<br />
PM: No, well we'll talk to him perhaps, but the thing is we have announced<br />
in the Budget that we will be selling the major airports which will<br />
include South Australia. What, I think, the South Australian<br />
government was after and, I think, what we would like to have seen<br />
and we will now see is the building of this airport ahead of the sale<br />
process. In other words, we will get cracking on the construction<br />
extension ahead of the leasing of the thing and that way South<br />
Australia will have this facility, it will get a bigger connection into the<br />
rest of Australia and the rest of the world. Can I just also say, Keith,<br />
that in a week's time I am launching the One Nation train. Do you<br />
remember in One Nation we decided to put a standard gauge railway<br />
between Adelaide and Melbourne? Well, I will be launching that in<br />
about two weeks from now and that will mean for the first time ever<br />
South Australia is linked via Melbourne to the east coast by rail. So,<br />
you will get this new decision on the airport and those two things will<br />
be important to further increasing South Australia's integration with the<br />
rest of the country and the region.<br />
KC: Listeners around the State are keen to raise budget matters with you<br />
and I know you are willing to take calls Prime Minister, but can I just<br />
tidy up that announcement which you have made this morning. The<br />
money will flow in both cases immediately, they are this year's budget?<br />
PM: Well, that is the case with the freeway. With the airport, the<br />
construction will proceed as quickly as we can get the design work and<br />
the environmental studies undertaken. But, we will commission those<br />
immediately. So, in other words, we will start the airport project off<br />
now immediately and we will be spending, this year, money on the<br />
Mount Barker road.<br />
KC: Can I look at two issues before listeners start to raise their matters.<br />
This State has received the Budget somewhat coolly it seems and<br />
perhaps that is because even before your comments about small </p>
<p>business, company tax going up in a state like this with nought growth<br />
in the last year as opposed to six per cent in Queensland, seven per<br />
cent in the west, can you understand that company tax here on small<br />
business, which is also the engine of our economy, will be seen as a<br />
brake on going nowhere.<br />
PM: Yes, well except the profit share of business, the proportion of national<br />
income going to profits, is now so high it has no historic precedent. It<br />
has never, I don't think ever, been any higher than this. It is as high as<br />
the late 1980s and the late 1980s had no historic precedent.<br />
Therefore, you remember Keith, just after the election the Government<br />
dropped the rate from 39 to 33. A very big fall. To get the economy<br />
going and to get it cracking. We are putting it just back to 36, so it is a<br />
fairly affordable cost on business and if those very large profits are<br />
coming through and the-Commonwealth needs to make up some<br />
revenue, you mean should it be the business sector which is highly<br />
profitable at the moment or should it be individuals or excise or<br />
something like that, we took the decision that the company tax change<br />
was basically one that was affordable.<br />
KC: Do you concede that this is not as good as it gets in South Australia,<br />
we have nought growth as yet?<br />
PM: South Australia has lagged behind the other States, that is true. But<br />
again, I don't think the company tax rate is going to change. There is<br />
also very strong investment outlook for South Australia and in the last<br />
year we about 34 per cent investment growth in South Australia, from<br />
memory, and that is quite high. So, I don't think the company tax rate<br />
is going to be a problem. The good thing for South Australia and all<br />
the States is that we have taken the pressure off interest rates which is<br />
going to have a much bigger effect than any modest increase in<br />
company tax. If you ask yourself what is going to happen to big effect,<br />
I mean, in the Budget we reduced the bond selling program. Last<br />
year, Keith, we sold $ 21 billion worth of bonds, $ 21,000 million worthof<br />
Commonwealth bonds. This year as a result of the Budget we will<br />
sell only $ 6,000 million. So, we have taken $ 15 billion off the bond<br />
selling program and that is just an unbelievable number; $ 15,000<br />
million off one year. So, what happens, if there is less paper around,<br />
less Commonwealth paper, the price of it rises. When the price of a<br />
bond rises the yield falls, the interest rate falls. That is why 10 year<br />
bonds fell by one percentage point in the last week or so and that is<br />
why we are now seeing interest pressure come off on housing and<br />
other things. So, for South Australia the big benefit is really that<br />
pressure off interest rates and that weight off monetary policy onto<br />
budgetary policy, outweighed by multiple and multiples any increase in<br />
the company tax rate.<br />
KC: Interest rates will no doubt get a guernsey sometime with our listeners.<br />
Now Robert calling. </p>
<p>C: Good morning, Prime Minister.<br />
PM: How are you Robert?<br />
C: I'm pretty hot under the collar, Paul, with your tobacco excise increase.<br />
Now, why don't you get stuck into the and not the aged pensioners.<br />
It is our only solace in life is to have a smoke and watch the rain<br />
tumble down.<br />
PM: Well, I mean, we are trying to get you off it, I think that is the thing. I<br />
don't know whether it is real good for you is it?<br />
C: Prime Minister, I didn't think you were one of these pathological types.<br />
PM I'm not really, no. I'm not-Look Robert, is basically both a health and<br />
a revenue measure. We have been trying to discourage people from<br />
smoking, we have all these warnings on the boxes and one of the<br />
other discouraging factors is price and again in a budget where we<br />
needed to lift the revenue and cut the outlays, where we needed to<br />
change the budget balance, it was just one of those things that has<br />
been increased over the years and we took the opportunity to increase<br />
it again.<br />
KC: Robert, thanks very much. Student funding now, Prime Minister and<br />
indeed there is a student funding focus event on the University of<br />
Adelaide campus today and David wants to raise it with you.<br />
C: My question is why should students support Labor, what have you<br />
done to actually take the pressure of universities charging up front<br />
fees for post graduate study?<br />
PM: Why should we support Labor? Because we have added 65 per cent<br />
of places to universities since 1985. We have added the equivalent of<br />
about 20 universities the size of Adelaide to the system. It has been<br />
the most enormous growth. There was 325,000 university places in<br />
1985/ 86 and this year it is just under 600,000. That is the main<br />
reason. That has cost, by the way, $ 3000 million, those additional<br />
places have cost $ 3000 million and all of the proceeds of the higher<br />
education charge the HECS charge all the proceeds, 100 per cent<br />
of them go back into places. So, 100,000 of those places, of the<br />
university places exist today are paid for by the return of the HECS<br />
funds. So, it is not only equitable, it is participatory and all of the brewha-<br />
ha about how the Government was going to put up front fees in the<br />
budget or change the HECS arrangement, I told people we were not<br />
doing it and it came to nothing. So, that is why I thought the Students'<br />
Union and other student bodies were pleased by the budget's<br />
reception. That is, that we didn't have any up front fees there because<br />
the Government opposes up front fees for undergraduate courses.<br />
We have made that as clear as day. </p>
<p>C: What about the increase in the number of post graduate courses that<br />
are charging full fees.<br />
PM: Put it this way, we will watch the development of that and see how it<br />
goes, but again we have given a lot more autonomy to universities and<br />
we have, of course, provided many more universities themselves, but<br />
the big thing is undergraduate fees. There was a notion being that we<br />
would in some way and can I just say to you, the only people who want<br />
to charge undergraduate fees are the Liberal party. At the last election<br />
their policy was full fees. In other words, you get to university if your<br />
parents can pay for it not that you get to university if you have the<br />
educational abilities, the attainments in the matriculation or at year 12,<br />
but whether your parents can charge full fees. Here we are virtually<br />
more than doubling the system and at the same time having a most<br />
democratic change with HiCS. You understand how HECS works.<br />
C: Yes.<br />
PM: We charge students about 23 per cent only of the cost of a course with<br />
HECS, about 23 per cent and then we lend them the money, we don't<br />
ask them then to refund any of it until their wages get to average<br />
weekly earnings and then it is taken out through the tax system. So, inother<br />
words, they only pay 23 per cent in the first place, they don't pay<br />
it back until they get to average weekly earnings and when it is paid<br />
back, 100 per cent of it goes into more places for students in<br />
university. None of it is kept by the budget. It is a pretty fair and<br />
reasonable scheme.<br />
KC: If I can just interject, interest rates Prime Minister, it is an important<br />
subject for us all, do you think they have well and truely peaked and<br />
they will now keep falling?<br />
PM: The best guide in that is the bond market. The short term interest rate<br />
is set in the market, but it is set with reference to the Reserve Bank's<br />
overnight cash and call rate. In other words the Government and the<br />
Reserve Bank had a role in it, but the long term bond rate is set<br />
exclusively in the market. It has nothing what so ever to do with the<br />
Treasurer or the Governor of the Reserve Bank or the Board.<br />
KC: So essentially, you agree that what happens in the United States may<br />
have a lot to do with this?<br />
PM: But also what happens here and I think that is why the chap from<br />
Moody's who was on ABC Radio " AM" last week said ' look, what we<br />
are looking for is a budget surplus and a big reduction in the bond<br />
selling program' and that is basically what they got and the long term<br />
bond rate fell from, I think, 10.1 per cent to 9.1 per cent in about eight<br />
days which was a very large change and I think that is the influence<br />
that has now affected the thinking of the domestic financial market<br />
here, including the banks. </p>
<p>KC: What about the notion John Howard puts that yes, they are coming<br />
down now, but they will go up again and so you will be going in for<br />
something in the way of an election before the end of the year.<br />
PM: But, that is his usual line, the sky is falling in. He has been running<br />
around with this cynical opportunist line that we have had five minutes<br />
of sunshine. We have had three and a half years of growth since the<br />
recession and now the Treasury is saying, forecasting that we will<br />
have three more years of growth in the budget papers. So, three years<br />
from now is 1998, if you take from 1983 to 1998, you will have<br />
years of growth bar 18 months, bar 1991/ 92. Fifteen years of growth<br />
bar 1991/ 92 and certainly six years of growth since the recession. So,<br />
it gives the lie to that little sort of opportunist claim. And, this other<br />
claim that the sky is f-ling, chicken little, the sky is falling in,<br />
whingeing around radio stations trying to mislead people, the fact of<br />
the matter is that the Government has made a very large change in the<br />
Budget and people may say the change was not only about a change<br />
in the budget balance from a deficit of over $ 12 billion to a surplus of<br />
$ 700 million, but we have got the biggest change of all in there in<br />
terms of the first comprehensive savings plan for the whole country<br />
with superannuation. In this Budget we have left provision there for<br />
every Australian person to have 15 per cent of their wages and<br />
salaries put away for their retirement and what this will do, it will liftsavings<br />
in superannuation funds from $ 186 billion now to $ 2000<br />
billion, about 12 times our national debt. The consequence will be,<br />
let's take someone on average weekly earnings now of $ 33,000. It<br />
would mean that such a person, when the scheme is mature, will end<br />
up with a lump sum of $ 470,000 and an annual retiring income of<br />
$ 30,000.<br />
KC: But, that person has to be 25 I think Prime Minister, isn't that sum done<br />
on someone who is 25 and just coming into the workforce?<br />
PM: Yes, but let me take somebody who is in their 30s now. Someone who<br />
is in their 30s now and who retire would go out with an amount about<br />
per cent greater than the age pension and their children will go out<br />
with an amount 100 per cent greater than the age pension.<br />
KC: To Rhonda on superannuation.<br />
C: I have two questions actually. One really comes before that, there was<br />
an earlier Labor promise that all recipients of social service pensions<br />
and part pensions would be exempt from income tax by 1995. That<br />
hasn't happed, but now we have the newly announced proposal of<br />
income tax cuts to be taken as payment into superannuation funds.<br />
Now, I'm not in my 30s, I can't look forward to that benefit. I'm in my<br />
and those tax cuts are virtually eliminated in the budget for people<br />
of my age who are already on superannuation, how does the </p>
<p>government propose to compensate for that lot of tax cuts for a group<br />
of people who really badly need it?<br />
PM: Let me just remind you what we did do with pensions. For a start we<br />
have got the level of the pension up to 25 per cent of average weekly<br />
earnings. That was at 21 per cent when the Government took office.<br />
It is up to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings and we have<br />
maintained there. The second thing we did was extend quite<br />
dramatically the free area, that is the amount of money that a<br />
pensioner could earn and yet still keep full pension. The next thing we<br />
did was to actually remove any taxation on money earned within the<br />
free area. You see, once a pensioner could earn money in addition to<br />
pension but you start to lose pension if you did, we have stopped any<br />
loss of pension, but you then paid tax on the earnings. We have now<br />
removed that completely tfom the tax system so that free area beyond<br />
the pension where you can earn without losing a dollar of pension is<br />
also now untaxed. Whenever the general pensioner groups and<br />
representative groups of pensioners speak about changes to<br />
pensioner values and the pension system they tend to focus on the<br />
maintenance of the basic pension and the free area and those<br />
arrangements rather than exempting any income for part pensioners<br />
from the tax system.<br />
So, we have focussed on those priorities. The benefit in all this is, of<br />
course, that when my generation are 65 there will be half as many<br />
retired aged people again as now and when my children are 65 there<br />
will be twice as many retired aged people as now. That will mean the<br />
working cohort then will have to carry a huge retirement population.<br />
What we have done on Tuesday night last and beginning of 1985/ 86<br />
with a three per cent superannuation arrangement then the five per<br />
cent and then the nine per cent under the superannuation guarantee<br />
charge and now rising to 15 per cent, is we will get to a position where<br />
not only will the basic pension system which is the essential building<br />
block of our retirements income policy be able to be maintained under<br />
the weight of that huge growth in the retired age population, but the<br />
actually population will have a much higher standard of living in<br />
retirement than say you do now with a pension.<br />
This should have happened 30 years ago, but that is point. Nothing<br />
happens in this country unless a Labor government does it.<br />
KC: Prime Minister, we will come to a question on families in a moment,<br />
family allowance benefit. Can I just ask you a little on the<br />
Commonwealth Bank first the people's bank and so on and how<br />
very quickly that has turned around, the idea of selling the<br />
Government's half. Just 20 months ago, the Treasurer said he had no<br />
intention what so ever of reducing its share holding and there was an<br />
iron clad commitment, absolute commitment that you wouldn't sell the<br />
other half. Can you understand people saying that is getting cynical. </p>
<p>PM: But why get cynical? Let's just go back. The Treasurer did say that<br />
months ago and 20 months ago that was our view. We have changed<br />
our view because we think we needed to get the budget into surplus<br />
more rapidly. That big reduction in the bond selling program I<br />
mentioned earlier was important for interest rates and to the ongoing<br />
recovery into the future.<br />
KC: It means for economic reasons, promises don't mean a thing.<br />
PM: It is not a promise. If someone asks the Treasurer of the day, do you<br />
intend to sell the Commonwealth Bank? And he says no, that is the<br />
governments intention. It is not a promise, it is an intention.<br />
Governments have a right to do things.<br />
KC: It is an absolute commitme-nt.<br />
PM: It was not an absolute commitment, no.<br />
KC: He was asked that on Channel 9, ' do you give an iron clad<br />
commitment?' Absolutely, yes.<br />
PM: But understand this. Governments have prerogatives to do things in<br />
the national and public interests, they don't need to respond to<br />
Channel 9 reporters.<br />
KC: He gave us the commitment, not just to Channel 9 a commitment.<br />
PM: No, but again people ask for an indication from governments, whether<br />
they say it is a commitment or whatever it is, I mean, all that<br />
governments can ever do is say where they stand at the time. But just<br />
understand this point about the so-called sale of the Bank, the<br />
people's bank, it was a peoples bank when it was a Reserve Bank. I<br />
mean the mythology about the Commonwealth Bank was developed,<br />
particularly in Labor circles when King O'Malley and these other<br />
people saw it develop and it developed in the 1920s and 1930s as<br />
virtually the Reserve Bank. But when the Menzies government bought<br />
the Reserve Bank Act in 1959, the Commonwealth Bank remained<br />
then simply a savings bank and later became a trading bank.<br />
Subsequently became just a commercial bank. I mean, the<br />
Commonwealth Bank is just a commercial bank. You have got to say<br />
what is the Commonwealth doing in the long run owning a commercial<br />
bank? What is the South Australian government doing in the long run<br />
or the short run with a commercial bank.<br />
KC: Not for long.<br />
PM: What were they ever doing with a commercial bank and what we have<br />
done is price this. I sold the first quarter of it in 1989, then we thought<br />
it was worth about $ 3 billion. By lifting its profits, getting some capital<br />
into it, we have now got the second half of it valued at $ 4.5 billion and </p>
<p>we have already raised $ 3 billion from it. So, we have turned an<br />
institution we thought was originally worth $ 3 billion into $ 7.5 billion.<br />
Now, that is a great benefit for public and that is what governments<br />
have got to think about, not what some interviewer asks on the Sunday<br />
program or something. What a conscientious Minister does in the<br />
public interest.<br />
KC: We are joined now by Michelle.<br />
C: Good morning. I would just like to know why there is such a big<br />
difference between the basic parenting allowance and the child care<br />
rebate. It has been discussed and protested against and still there is a<br />
great discrepancy between a two income family and a single income<br />
family.<br />
PM: I don't think the discrepancy is that great. What we did in the election<br />
is say we would introduce a generalised child care rebate and we have<br />
done that and as you know that is recoverable for people who are in<br />
child care from Medicare offices. You go to Medicare and you pick up<br />
the rebate. It was one of the important commitments in the election<br />
and one that we introduced in legislation almost immediately after the<br />
election was over. That is now operating. The parenting allowance is<br />
a different concept again. It is looking at where we had a work test on<br />
somebody who was unemployed and where the money was being paid<br />
to a couple and the wife had to be work tested. In Working Nation we<br />
abolished all that, we changed that and we have left it to the position<br />
that that person can elect to stay at home, not need to qualify for the<br />
work test and be paid half the married rate at home and that is only<br />
then diminished once the partners income gets over a certain level.<br />
Where once any income the partner received reduced the total family<br />
income, what it does now is reduce only the partners income and let's<br />
say, in most cases the wife's income, the parenting allowance ends up<br />
being kept there and only starts to be reduced after the partner gets<br />
over, I think, $ 320 a week, from memory.<br />
So, it is quite a dramatic change which recognises the value, the fact<br />
that many women who are looking after children and who are in such a<br />
family, there is not much point in them qualifying under the work test<br />
anyway and that way we give people a choice about whether they<br />
leave home and if they do, they have got the child care support, both<br />
in places. Remember also that when the government came to office<br />
there were 40,000 child care places. There is now 255,000 child care<br />
places and now as well as that we have got fee relief and now the<br />
generalised child care rebate.<br />
KC: Prime Minister, Paul Keating, thanks for coming in this morning.<br />
PM: Good, Keith.<br />
