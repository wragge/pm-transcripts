PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 20 JULY 1979 4<br />
PRIMlE MINISTER'S ADDRESS TO THE IN AUGURAL MEETING OF THE<br />
NATIONAL FARMER'S FEDERATION, CANBERRA.<br />
It certainly gives me a very real amount of pleasure today to<br />
open this new national farming organisation conference.<br />
The amalgamation of farming youth organisations has been debated<br />
amongst different organisations in different States for many,<br />
many years. I think it was way back in the Second War that<br />
one organisation was formed, designed to be one major, united<br />
organisation. But, of course, it was starting from scratch.<br />
There were many existing traditional organisations in being<br />
which had no intention of going out of business. So, that<br />
particular operation just added one more organisation to the ranks<br />
of producer groups.<br />
But, now, you have achieved a very great deal. A number of<br />
organisations that have served Australia very well over the<br />
time are going out of business, and you are forming one new<br />
major Farmers' Federation.<br />
I have alays believed, both as a farmer and as a politician,<br />
that farmers and pastoralists need to speak with a strong voice.<br />
You can deal with government much better if that is so. You can<br />
do it so much better if you are speaking with one voice rather<br />
than with two or three or four divided voices. So, I -welcome<br />
very much what you have achieved.<br />
In want to speak for a few moments, not only about the position<br />
of rural industries as I see it, but about Australia, and<br />
Australia's wider place in he world. Firstly, I would like<br />
to try and get Australia's position in perspective. So often<br />
press comment goes widely with the swings of the pendulum.<br />
In January and February of this year there were so many optimistic<br />
forecasts about 1979 and beyond that some people were almost<br />
saying, " There are no problems left, the Government has done its<br />
job, recovery is with us, that is the end of'it". Well of course<br />
it is never as good as that. But then it was certainly not<br />
as bad as those same commentators were saying in April and May<br />
in this year when there were some shifts in monetary policy,<br />
there were some changes that the government had to introduce.<br />
The euphoria of January and February changed to what appeared<br />
to be, from the Government's point of view, a totally dnjustified<br />
gloom later on in the autumn.<br />
We do need to get a sense of balance and a sense of perspective<br />
in these particular matters, so that we can really understand<br />
the nature of policy, where Australia is going, and what our<br />
national objectives truly may be.<br />
Now, what is the position today? As a result of Government </p>
<p>-2<br />
policies, as a result of decisions, Australia is more competative,.<br />
than she has been for many, many years. The first major<br />
decision that started. to bring that about was the devaluation<br />
two or three years ago. But then, what did the commentators say<br />
about that? Some of them said, " madness, stupidity". But no<br />
single act of the government,. I think, has proved more right<br />
than that particular devaluation and the way in which the<br />
management of the exchange rate has been conducted since.<br />
It has been a material factor, coupled with the control of<br />
inflation, and seeing that there are reasonable returns for<br />
Australia's primary industries. . J It has also been a material<br />
factor to enable the manufacturing industry to get a better<br />
share of the local market and to move out into export markets<br />
in a fashion that they just have not been able to achieve for<br />
many years.<br />
The balance of payments is now stronger than it has been for<br />
a long while. Since February, private capital inflow has been<br />
well over $ 1,000 million. In the eight months to February,<br />
export prices rose almost twice as fast as import prices,<br />
and that again, is good for Australia, and for Australia's exporters.<br />
Next year, our expectations are continued, reasonable returns<br />
for Australia's primary producers. In beef sale yard prices<br />
are 2 to 3 times of those of a year ago. In wheat prices<br />
we had a record crop last year. There are continuing high<br />
export prices and there has been a larger area planted again<br />
this year. So, granted reasonable seasons, which some Premiers<br />
may claim to be able to control but the Commonwealth does not<br />
claim to be able to control, granted these reasonable seasons<br />
the wheat industry should also be in a very good position<br />
throughout the course of this coming year.<br />
The wool industry is looking to the future with confidence and<br />
strength. Remember when about five or six years ago, the<br />
very time government actions were needed to restore confidence<br />
and strength in the wool market, the government of the day<br />
pulled the floor out and reduced the floor by 50Â½. That did not<br />
survive. I think it is the first time I noted a demonstration<br />
by farmers outside the front of Parliament House. The cry<br />
from Australia and around the world secured the reverse of that<br />
decision. Over recent years, the floor has been steadily<br />
increased and reserves are now lower than they have been for<br />
a long while. The market is strong and there is no reason why<br />
we cannot expect that strength to continue reasonably into<br />
the future.<br />
Rural recovery is certainly no accident. When times have been<br />
difficult, there has been special assistance from the government to the<br />
beef industry in particular. Longer term: measures have been<br />
introduced. The Primary Industry bank which I think many people<br />
were sceptical about they said that the commitment had not<br />
really been fulfilled as producers might have expected<br />
but since I the Bank has been operating, it has demonstrated<br />
its success and has already refinanced over $ 100 million.<br />
Income equalisation deposits were introduced some time ago, Although<br />
not so much use when incomes are low, it is starting<br />
to demonstrate the very real benefits to farmers and pastoralists<br />
now.<br />
With wheat stablilisation programmes, support for the Wool / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Corporation, new and improved tax averaging that gives great<br />
benefits to producers again not so much when there are no<br />
incomes to average we are starting to see the benefits<br />
through the last year of better returns and through the next.<br />
The major part of the trade offensive overseas has been designe. d.<br />
to secure reasonable outlets for Australi~ is major rural exports.<br />
When we started the trade offensive into the European Community,<br />
there were some who said, " Why are we bothering about this. We<br />
have been excluded from that market, we should be concentrating<br />
only in Asia". But, we took the view that Australia could not<br />
ignore the largest and wealthiest trading group in the world,<br />
we could not ignore them for two reasons: We had every right<br />
to be able to sell into Europe, and we were very concerned<br />
about the policies of export subsidies which so often damaged<br />
our exporters in third markets damaged sugar, damiaged wheat,<br />
whatever, you name it, and we had to secure, if we could, a<br />
modification of that policy.<br />
There has been no revolution in their attitude, but there has<br />
been a change and the doors are open, We will now be in<br />
continual communication with the European Community to build On<br />
what has been achieved.<br />
In 1974, we lost access to Japan for beef but that has been rebuilt<br />
with global quotas now 110 11S.: O00 tons. Through the MTN<br />
it will be significantly higher than that. Access to the United<br />
States has been secured. . Many governments over the years<br />
have talked about seculing a reduction in the American wool<br />
tariff,, but it is our negotiations my government's negotiations<br />
with the United States-which has, in fact, achieved<br />
reduction in that wool tariff, at least with the administation<br />
It is a question of confirmation, of course, by Congress, but<br />
we have no reason to expect that there will be any difficulty<br />
with that.<br />
For the rest of the economy, through last year, non-farm gross<br />
domestic product increased by 3 in real terms. In the nine months<br />
to March, company profitability rose by over 20% and'in the year<br />
to March, investment expenditure was up by 25%. Mining investment<br />
was up by well over 40%. Under our predecessors, real investment<br />
in mining and manufacturing fell on significant estimates by an<br />
average of 8% a year. Is it any wonder that Australia got into<br />
trouble as a result of that.<br />
Now, the fundamental policy, of course, is to get the basics<br />
of the economy right. to control inflation, to control<br />
government expenditure, increased by 46% in ' 74-' 75 by 8.3%<br />
probably a bit less than inflation as it might finally come out<br />
through the course of the last year.<br />
There are 56,000 less Public Servants than if the recruiting<br />
policies of our predecessors had in fact been continued.<br />
There have been unexpected events through-he course of this year.<br />
The events -in Iran,, the extent of the rise in beef prices,<br />
was not as predicted, although it was needed to<br />
make up for the damage of past years. Thes-e things have obviously<br />
added to inflation, but they have been good -for producers and good<br />
for the balance of payments although the higher beeT -prices<br />
and the record wheat crop . has given us some' inflationary problems. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Therefore, we had to act to exert pressures in the other<br />
direction. So, we had a mini-budget.<br />
If we had not had that mtini-b5udget, people<br />
would have been entitled to say that if the Government were<br />
still determined to overcome inflation, why was not the<br />
government reactingto changed evcnts and taking the decisions<br />
that it ought to be taking. As a result of it<br />
and as a result of some fairly rigid expenditure controls<br />
during the Premiers' Conference nobody should have any<br />
doubts about our determination to continue with a path<br />
that will bear down on inflation even if pressures of one<br />
kind or another for a time, will be such that the downward<br />
movement of inflation cannot be continued and indeed is<br />
likely to move a bit in the other direction.<br />
If there are pressures for increased inflation in Australia,<br />
those same pressures are considerably worse in a number<br />
of other countries.<br />
One of the things which gives us a very great deal,<br />
of concern about the future, and a great deal of concern about<br />
what is happening at the moment and I know that that is shared<br />
out in the wider community is the level of industr'ial disputes.<br />
There is not the slighest doubt that the activities of some<br />
trade union leaders could well destroy Australia's future,<br />
prosperity, could well destroy Australia's living standards,<br />
There is a selfishness in some trade union actions which I think,<br />
knows no parallel within Australian society. It would seem<br />
that a number of trade union leaders want confrontation, and<br />
do. not want consultation..<br />
It is worth noting that Mr Hawke has withdrawn the ACTU<br />
from the National Labor Consultative Council. Many<br />
of the actions of the union leadership would appear to be<br />
irrational and totally unreasonable.<br />
In some things, there is a lack of Commonwealth constitutional<br />
power over State employees for example. State governmnents need<br />
to act, and some with much greater resolution than they have in.<br />
the-past. I think the position of-some State Premiers in<br />
legislating to take matters out of the hads of indus-tr * ial tribunal,<br />
leglislating to reduce hours, is totally destructive in the<br />
sensible industrial relations environment. It is no accident,,<br />
therefore, that in NSW there has been more disputes and worse<br />
disputes than in other States in Australia.<br />
The State Premiers have now agreed that the States should join<br />
with the Commonwealth in discussing the arrangements, the sharing<br />
of power between the. States and the Commonwealth. We want<br />
to have a more rational arrangement than that which now<br />
occurs, and achieve arrangements which will,. to some extent,<br />
prevent the competative business between State and Federal<br />
tribunals, and the leap frogging one with the other.-<br />
In relation to Commonwealth employees, of course, we have the<br />
clear power and the responsibility. We proclaimed the Commonwealth<br />
Employees Employment Provisions Act. that was used in.. the Telecom<br />
dispute, and as a result, the bans were lifted. Employing<br />
authorities and the Public Service generally, have been told that<br />
if they need to use the provisions of that Act, they will have<br />
IWIIA W N_ -T-At0 7i </p>
<p>5<br />
the full support of the government. The Postal Commission<br />
has been told of that. Already 2,000 employees have been<br />
stood down under other provisions. The pay cheques going<br />
out through the Postal Commission for a large number of employees<br />
will be very empty cheques indeed, as a result of the provisions<br />
that the Postal Commission has already used.<br />
We have to make sure that those who. want to pursue<br />
industrial action at this time or the sort that is now present<br />
within the Public Service themselves have to pay a cost, rather<br />
than the community alone paying the very substantial cost.<br />
Some public servants believe they have a right to<br />
determine what part of the work they do, and go on getting<br />
their full pay. That is what has happened. Now there are<br />
stand-down provisions in the Public Service Act, and for the<br />
first time perhaps in the history of Australia public servants<br />
are being stood-down and will continue to be stood-down unless<br />
they do their full work.<br />
What has happened in the Public Service has been condemned by<br />
the arbitrator who wrote the stand-down clauses in the award,<br />
and condemned by very senior public servants, such as Arthur Tange.<br />
The Public Service Board knows that if the stand-down clause that<br />
was written into the award two or three days ago proves inadequate<br />
the Commonwealth Employment Provisions Act will be used fully<br />
and effectively.<br />
We are not going to put up with a situation in which public<br />
servants, who basically have security of tenure, who have a<br />
superannuation scheme which is second to none in Australia<br />
and paid for by other taxpayers to a large extent, are going to<br />
determine that part of the work which they do and that part<br />
which they don't do. </p>
<p>-6<br />
If, as a result of the attitudes of the Government in relation<br />
to these matters, we have to put up with a period of difficulty,<br />
then so be it. We were prepared, if necessary, for Australia<br />
to be without telephones for some weeks or a longer period.<br />
If it is necessary in relation to the postal dispute for Redfern<br />
finally to be shut down until this matter comes to some sense,<br />
then it will be shut down. It will be a price to pay and a<br />
difficulty in the Australian community, but I think a fight<br />
must be a fight over that particular matter rather than to let<br />
it go on and drag on indefinitely with continuing disruptions and<br />
difficulty. I hope that if we are in that position we will have<br />
enough support from the community generally and people won't<br />
say after the first week " You had better give in, it is a<br />
bit difficult, I haven't got the mail", or whatever the service<br />
might be. If that pressure then started to then come out of<br />
the Australian community then it would undermine the Government,<br />
which is seeking to do what it must, and that is to protect the<br />
ordinary people of Australia against unreasonable and predatory<br />
use of union power.<br />
We also need to understand that nobody is saying in this that<br />
people don't have wage claims, that sometimes they are not<br />
reasonable. What we are saying is that there are procedures,<br />
there are triubunals to examine these matters and make<br />
judgements and we are saying that there is no need to use<br />
strikes, bans and limitations in pursuit of claims.. If people<br />
are going to do that, there will be a cost to bear, and not<br />
just a cost to the Australian community. It is a question of<br />
supporting arbitration -that is what it is abouat. </p>
<p>-7<br />
There are other problems also oil, as you know We have<br />
taken a number of decisions in relation to that. President<br />
Carter announced some major policy initiatives two or three<br />
days ago, but that policy is still deficient in one respect<br />
because it does not have world parity pricing for fuel.<br />
Unless you have that, a decision to limit into the United States<br />
the quantity of oil that comes into the United States will impose<br />
enormous and substantial rationing problems within the United States.<br />
Price is the best determinant of wise and sensible economic use<br />
of a scarce resource. OECD and other nations have recognised that<br />
the decisions which Australia took just about a year ago in that<br />
are inevitable and are right. They are painful and they are<br />
diffucult. But there is no alternative.<br />
There are three main elements to our policy: conservation,<br />
suitable alternative forms of energy, greater oil search and<br />
development and research. In conservation, world parity pricing<br />
is obviously a very significant part of the policy, because<br />
without that people won't really turn to other forms of energy<br />
which might not be in such short supply they won't have the<br />
incentive. We have a capacity to save up<br />
to 10% of the petrol that we now burn by some changes in<br />
octane ratings which will take place, by a small revision of<br />
lead content in fuel, and by changed emission controls. As to<br />
the first we have the power to do it; as to the second two it<br />
is within the power of the States. We have four States in<br />
agreement with our view. We have New South Wales and South<br />
Australia, so far, determined to press ahead with the revised<br />
and third stage of emission controls which will again lead to<br />
more inefficient engines and more expensive engines. Against thE!<br />
present fuel situation I don't believe that Australia can<br />
afford to just throw away 10% of the fuel that we would otherwise!<br />
have. I hope very much that the State governments will review<br />
their positions in relation to the lead content and emi'ssion<br />
changes. We are pursuing alternative forms of energy. Ag ' ain world parity<br />
pricing has a significant part to play in that. There are<br />
incentives to move to LPG. Commonwealth vehicles in the future<br />
will be LPG powered, except for ones that have to go out into<br />
the country, where the gas might not be available. Much greater<br />
sums are being spent on research and development.<br />
It ought to be noted, I think, that in a country like Australia<br />
we can't match and shouldn't seek to match the enormous sums<br />
spent on research and development in the United States and in<br />
Europe, because they will be doing the work, the results of that<br />
technology will be available. it would be wasteful of our<br />
resources if we sought to match and do that work separately and<br />
independently for ourselves. The sort of research we need in<br />
this country is that which might be directed to the particular<br />
and peculiar problems of Australia, not at the question of a<br />
duplication of the vast sums that are spent in other countries.<br />
In oil search and development, world parity pricing again is<br />
significant, because it provides the incentive to companies<br />
to go out and look for oil, to develop reserves. 600 million<br />
to 700 million barrels have been added to reserves as a result / 8 </p>
<p>8<br />
of that pricing policy. $ 500 million is being committed to<br />
search and development quite directly as a result of world<br />
parity pricing.<br />
One thing that we all need to guard against: I believe that<br />
around Australia now there is some evidence, I am told from<br />
the Department of National Development, of unnecessary<br />
hoarding of fuel. I can understand that farmers might be<br />
concerned that they will not be able to get adequate supplies<br />
of diesel for example when they have to sow their crops or<br />
harvest their crops. -There is a responsibility to see that<br />
there isn't a shortage in those circumstances. But if there<br />
is unreasonable and unnecessary hoarding over and above the<br />
normal requirements that farmers and pastoralists have had<br />
in the past--that kind of thing of course can create a<br />
shortage and create difficulties for other people for whom.<br />
otherwise there might not be one.<br />
The Government has made a decision to establish a body, a<br />
national allocation and supply committee, which will have<br />
represented on it consumers, producers, the States, representatives<br />
of manufacturing industry, representatives of the rural industry<br />
to advise government in relation to supply and allocation of<br />
petrol and fuel if there is likely to be any shortage.<br />
We recognise that there is a responsibility to make sure that<br />
industries that need fuels at particular times of the year have<br />
fuel available to them. We know very much-and you will understand<br />
the reasons for the shortages of Avgas -especially in the<br />
northern parts of Australia and in Queensland. I also know that<br />
if people want to spray a cotton crop at a particular time, that<br />
crop has to be sprayed, then Avgas will have to be available.<br />
That is an obligation on the companies. It is also an obligation<br />
on Government in those circumstances to make sure that essential<br />
industries are not damaged by particular shortages at a<br />
barticular time.<br />
The committee that will be established will have a responsibility<br />
to advise us in relation to these matters so that, if there are<br />
particular shortages in particular areas and circumstances, we<br />
will be able in conjunction with the states, to take appropriate<br />
action. I think it is worth looking at Australia's position, generally<br />
and comparing it with what is happening in a number of overseas<br />
countries. If we do, it gives every reason to confirm the<br />
strength and underlying stability of the Australian economy and<br />
what we are in fact achieving within this country.<br />
In the last six months inflation in the United States has been<br />
running at an annual rate of about 12%. In the United Kingdon<br />
it is about 13%, and on the admission in their own budget up<br />
to 16% and 17%. In Canada it is about 10% and rising; in Italy<br />
about 15%. Over the same period, Australia's inflation was<br />
about 8%.<br />
We know there are pressures in this country to put inflation<br />
up. Thie Government has to counteract that and put the<br />
movement again in the right direction. That won't be able to<br />
happen for some time because oil prices will be moving through / 9 </p>
<p>9<br />
the economy, and the effect of that will occur during this<br />
quarter and the next quarter. So long as we can maintain<br />
the competitive margin between Australia and countries<br />
overseas, the competitive position of Australia's exports<br />
and manufacturers will continue to be improved. During the<br />
previous high inflation in Australia, of course, our inflation<br />
was much above those countries I mentioned. So, under those<br />
circumstances we were losing our competitive position and<br />
getting into very real difficulties. But our industries<br />
will still improve their position while we keep inflation<br />
under that of a number of our major and significant trading<br />
partners. If we look at growth rates forecast by the OECD for 1979<br />
they are OECD forecasts,. they are not mine, let me emphasise<br />
that Australia 4% real growth, that is well above the OECD<br />
average; the United States the United Kingdom 1<br />
Canada 31 % 0.<br />
If we look at productivity improvement, the OECD again forecasts<br />
for Australia in 1979 3 for the United States, nothing; for<br />
the United Kingdom for Canada h%.<br />
That points to some difficult situations in economies overseas,<br />
and it points also to a significantly better position within<br />
the Australian economy.<br />
I believe, with the one question mark over industrial relations,<br />
and that is going to have to be sorted out there can't be<br />
any options for us, that we can look to the 1980' s with very<br />
great confidence indeed. We can, and have it within our power<br />
to keep inflation lower than that of many other countries.<br />
That makes our now competitive industries even more competitive.<br />
It makes our homes and export markets even more secure'than<br />
they now are.<br />
With economic stability there is a great encouragement to<br />
investment. I have mentioned the private capital inflow for<br />
the last seven or eight months. There is $ 2000 million worth<br />
of new investment going to the aluminium, industry, another<br />
$ 2,000 million going into the coal industry. Our great<br />
national resources give us a capacity to get through difficult<br />
circumstances much better than other countries that aren't so<br />
well endowed.<br />
If you look at other resource producing nations of conscience,<br />
you will find some difficulties within them that give investors<br />
cause for concern. That again makes Australia a much more<br />
attractive country for investment than some others that would<br />
otherwise be competitors.<br />
So if we play our cards right, however difficult the world<br />
trading situation miaht be through the 1980' s.---<br />
I expect it to to remain difficult because I expect<br />
inflation to remain too high in a number of major countries,<br />
and with that beina so growth rates will be too low.--<br />
Ile can look afterourselves well and secure a rprosperous decade<br />
in the 1980' s. </p>
<p>10<br />
Because we have great resources of energy and minerals we<br />
can attract investment. We have commodities that the world<br />
needs, we have exports from the primary industries that the<br />
world needs. We have secured, to a greater extent than before<br />
I believe access to significant markets overseas. So it is<br />
within our power. If we play our cards right, keep inflation<br />
under control, run a sensible economy and have more sensible<br />
industrial relations than we have in the past, then Australia<br />
can have it made.<br />
For all these reasons we have many advantages. It should also<br />
be said that the Government has no intention to throw away the<br />
advantages and the gains over the last three and a half years<br />
and destroy the possibilities of the coming years. We have a<br />
great future. Rural industries have a vital part to play in<br />
that future. I have never been one to accept the view that<br />
rural industries are less important to Australia than they<br />
once might have been. Certainly our exports have diversified.<br />
The proportion of people employed in rural industries is less<br />
than it was. But without the strength of Australian rural<br />
industries, without the exports that come from that, Australia<br />
would in maany instances be a dying nation, and we have no<br />
intention of allowing that to happen.<br />
The strength of your industries is vital for the future of<br />
this nation. It is importILant also, I know, for yourselves<br />
and for your organisation and for the people who make up the<br />
great Australian rural industries.<br />
I have very great pleasure indeed in opening this inaugural<br />
meeting of the National Farmers Federation. I wiish you all<br />
good fortune in your future deliberations and I am sure that<br />
you will serve the interests of your constituent parts well<br />
and vigorously, as best you see their interests. </p>
