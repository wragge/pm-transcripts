    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am very pleased to announce that the Australian Government will contribute $50,000 to the Amy Gillett-Safe Cycling Foundation.  The Foundation has been established by Cycling Australia with the support of Amy's parents, Denis and Mary Safe, and Amy's husband, Simon, following the tragic road cycling accident in Germany in July in which Amy died.  The Foundation will honour Amy's memory by providing a scholarship programme for young female cyclists and will promote road safety awareness among cyclists and motorists.</p>
<p>I understand this will bring to around $250,000 the funds already raised or committed, including a $50,000 contribution from the South Australian Government and $5,000 from Cycling Australia.</p>
<p>My Government is in discussions with the Foundation concerning tax deductibility issues.</p>
<p> The Australian Government has provided assistance to the injured cyclists and their families since the accident.  I acknowledge the work of our Ambassador in Germany, Pamela Fayle, and her consular officials and the medical staff in Germany, under the direction of Professor Hofmann, who did so much to alleviate the pain and suffering of our young cyclists.</p>
<p>I commend Cycling Australia, Denis and Mary Safe and Simon Gillett on their initiative and send the best wishes of my Government and the Australian people to Alexis Rhodes, Louise Yaxley, Kate Nichols, Katie Brown and Lorian Graham for a speedy recovery.</p>
