COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRAL~ rr<br />
SPEECH ss 16<br />
BY I( A<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, 7M<br />
ON<br />
APPROPRIATION BIL ( No. 1) 1969-70<br />
Second Reading<br />
( BUDGET DEBATE)<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 21 August 1969]<br />
Mr G. ORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
[ 8.301--Mr Deputy Speaker, at the beginning<br />
I wish to endorse the remark made by<br />
the Treasurer ( Mr McMahon) that the Budget<br />
which he introduced to the House last<br />
week is one of -the best budgets to come<br />
before us in the last 20 years. And that is<br />
really saying something, for successive budgets<br />
under a Liberal Administration have<br />
led in that period of time to a situation<br />
where, compared with 1948-49, our mean<br />
population has grown from 7,796,000 to<br />
12,171,000; our gross national product at<br />
constant prices has risen from $ 8,391m to<br />
$ 21 ,077m; our steel production has risen<br />
from 1,178,000 tons to 6,599,000 tons; our<br />
new motor vehicle registrations have risen<br />
from 103,149 to 459,885; our construction<br />
of new houses and flats completed has<br />
risen from 52,684 to 115,357; our mineral<br />
exports have risen from $ 12,883,782 to an<br />
estimated $ 464,079,000 and our unemployment<br />
rate has fallen to a stage where all<br />
our people can be said to be fully employed<br />
to an extent that has never been known in<br />
this country before.<br />
It is estimated, too, that the increase in<br />
average earnings in this coming year, after<br />
income tax, will be some 5% and that the<br />
average income earner will be some 5%<br />
better off. This is a pretty significant record<br />
of achievement as a result of the planning<br />
and the budgets that have been introduced<br />
20930/ 69 in the past. It is a very good augury for<br />
the achievements that are available in the<br />
future and will be availed of by further<br />
budgets introduced in the next 3 years by<br />
a Liberal Government which has this<br />
record of achievement behind it. In the circumstances<br />
in which we find ourselves<br />
today, with great pressure on our labour<br />
resources, as I have indicated, and considerable<br />
pressures on some sectors of demand<br />
in the economy, the Budget is, as it<br />
needed to be, deflationary rather than inflationary.<br />
It is mildly deflationary. It has<br />
reduced an overall Budget deficit of $ 385m,<br />
which was budgeted for last year, to an<br />
estimated overall Budget deficit of only<br />
$ 30m in this financial year. It has increased<br />
a domestic surplus of some $ 200m last<br />
financial year into an estimated domestic<br />
surplus of $ 500m this financial year. It is,<br />
Sir, financially responsible.<br />
Yet at the same time it has made very<br />
significant advances along the road to social<br />
justice. Steps along this road were taken<br />
last year. Further steps are apparent in this<br />
' Budget and yet further steps remain for<br />
future budgets presented by a Liberal<br />
Administration. Some 17 months ago the Governor-<br />
General stated in his Speech:<br />
My Government will review the field of social<br />
welfare with the object of assisting those in most </p>
<p>need while at the same time not discouraging<br />
thrift, self-help and self-reliance.<br />
Let us see what has happened in the<br />
intervening time to fulfil these intentions.<br />
We will have in the space of a year increased<br />
the basic rate of age pension by<br />
$ 2 a week for single persons. This is an<br />
increase of more than 15%, which is an<br />
unprecedented increase and which is an<br />
increase far in excess of any increase in<br />
the cost of living. In the same period we<br />
will have increased the rate for the married<br />
couple pensioners by $ 3 a week, increased<br />
the pensioner wife's allowance by $ 1 a<br />
week, increased the allowance for the first<br />
child by $ 1 a week and for other children<br />
by $ 2 a week. We will have increased the<br />
pension for a widow with two children by<br />
a week and given an additional $ 2 a<br />
week if one of the children is under 6 years<br />
of age or is an invalid. We will have increased<br />
the unemployment and sickness<br />
benefit by $ 1.75 a week and the wife's<br />
allowance by $ 1 a week. We have given a<br />
personal care subsidy of $ 5 a week for<br />
persons over 80 years in hostel type accommodation<br />
under the Aged Persons Homes<br />
Act. Our deserted wives and home care<br />
programmes open up a new aspect of cooperation<br />
with the States in the welfare<br />
field depending not merely on cash grants.<br />
I do not argue that no more remains to<br />
be done, for, of course, much does remain<br />
to be done. But I do suggest, Sir, that this<br />
is a practical. demonstration of moving to<br />
carry out an intention-not a vote catching<br />
intention but rather is it an honourable<br />
approach to fulfil a promise honestly made<br />
some 17 months ago, and very greatly<br />
fulfilled at this stage.<br />
But what of our other stated intention, to<br />
encourage thrift and self-help, which previously<br />
were discouraged? Previously if a<br />
certain amount had been earned or had been<br />
gained in superannuation, a pension was<br />
reduced by $ 1 for every extra $ 1 earneda<br />
100% tax. What of our stated intention<br />
to overcome those problems? We have in<br />
this Budget made what I think is a most<br />
significant breakthrough in that direction by<br />
the introduction of the tapered means test.<br />
This is a measure which really does encourage<br />
thrift and self-help and I1 doubt whether<br />
its benefits are even yet fully understood in<br />
the community. Under these proposals,<br />
those who have provided for their retirement<br />
through superannuation or through other means of saving will no longer have<br />
their pensions reduced by $ 1 for every $ 1<br />
they receive in excess of $ 10 a week if they<br />
are single or $ 17 a week if they are married.<br />
Further, a single man or woman whose<br />
income or means as assessed equals or<br />
exceeds $ 25 a week at present receives no<br />
pension at all. Under our proposals such a<br />
person will receive a pension, reducing as<br />
his income increases but not ceasing until<br />
his income reaches $ 40 a week.<br />
-In addition such a person with an income,<br />
for example, of $ 30 a week, who<br />
previously paid $ 72 a year in tax, will now<br />
pay tax of only $ 17, a further increment<br />
and a further encouragement to saving.<br />
Indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker, he receives a<br />
double benefit-a pension increased from<br />
nothing to $ 5 a week and a tax benefit of<br />
$ 1.05 a week. An aged single person<br />
receiving $ 40 a week of taxable income does<br />
not get any pension under our proposalsbut<br />
he does get a tax concession of approximately<br />
$ 1.60 a week.<br />
As a further example of how the scheme<br />
works, a married couple who are pensioners<br />
with income or means as assessed of<br />
a week will have their pension increased<br />
from nothing to $ 5 a week, and they will<br />
receive tax concessions amounting to<br />
approximately a further $ 1.42 a week. And<br />
the benefits continue for a single person<br />
until he receives an income of $ 44 a week,<br />
and continues for a married couple until<br />
such a couple receives $ 80 a week. At all<br />
these ranges of income these benefits are<br />
matnifest. They should be fully understood.<br />
I do not wish to take up the time of the<br />
House in giving further detailed examples<br />
of particular rates of income or means as<br />
assessed and the benefits which flow from<br />
them, but instead with the concurrence of<br />
honourable members I will incorporate in<br />
Hansard, at the conclusion of my speech,<br />
three tables which show the benefits flowing<br />
from part pension and the benefits flowing<br />
from tax concessions in each income<br />
range. But I emphasise again that it is necessary<br />
when computing the encouragement given<br />
to thrift to take into account not only the<br />
benefit from the part pension now to be<br />
paid but also the tax concessions now to<br />
be available. I doubt, Sir, if there has ever<br />
been such an incentive to thrift-such an </p>
<p>incentive to self help-proposed in this<br />
House previously and I believe it will result<br />
not only in a just approach but also will<br />
reduce the total pensions bill otherwise to<br />
be borne in the future by the working taxpayer,<br />
and we have done this without<br />
increasing taxation.<br />
I would like to contrast those proposals<br />
which I have just spelt out with what<br />
I take to be the proposals of the Opposition,<br />
but unfortunately there is great difficulty in<br />
doing this properly because when one reads<br />
the Budget speech made by the Leader of<br />
the Opposition, he has not made any firm<br />
proposals at all. All he has told us in relation<br />
to high, wide and handsome statements<br />
about abolishing the means test for everybody,<br />
no matter what their range of income<br />
or superannuation schemes-all he has told<br />
us is that if his Party is elected it will then<br />
appoint a committee to tell them what they<br />
ought to do, because apparently they do not<br />
themselves yet know what to do or have not<br />
yet worked out a scheme which they could<br />
put before this Parliament. This is a completely<br />
nebulous approach, and it is also an<br />
improper approach, because it means that<br />
the Opposition is either afraid or unable to<br />
make firm proposals as to how they would<br />
carry out whatever their proposals areafraid<br />
or unable to present these before the<br />
people so that the proposals and the cost of<br />
those proposals may be judged by the people<br />
themselves. For my part I believe the<br />
explanation of this extraordinary cavalier<br />
approach is that the Leader of the Opposition<br />
is afraid to put his proposals forward,<br />
even imprecisely. For, Sir, if those proposals<br />
are to follow the recommendations of Professors<br />
Downing and Gates, as he suggests<br />
but does not definitely state, then they<br />
would require increased taxation on the<br />
working population to raise S880m a year-<br />
$ 880m a year being the part to be paid by<br />
employers, or a tax of approximately 6%<br />
on payrolls. And they would require an<br />
additional tax on the wage earner ranging<br />
from about $ 15 a year for the lowest paid<br />
contributor who is compulsorily to be taxed<br />
to $ 182 a year on income earners of $ 90 a<br />
week or above.<br />
Dr J. F. Calms--I think you are all<br />
mixed up.<br />
Mr GORTON-The honourable member<br />
for Yarra ( Dr J. F. Cairns) suggests that it<br />
20930/ 69-2 may possibly be that I am in some way<br />
mixed up. If I am it is because there have<br />
been no definite proposals put before us<br />
but merely a suggestion that if the Party<br />
opposite is elected they will get somebody<br />
from outside to tell them what to do, which<br />
is of course what they have been doing<br />
in a different way ever since they have been<br />
the Opposition. Furthermore, it is worth<br />
noting in these Downing proposals, as I<br />
understand them, that the benefit to be<br />
received on retirement by the working man<br />
who has been taxed during all his working<br />
life, is also to be taxed in his hands after<br />
he has retired.<br />
Mr Griffiths-Well, they are taxed now.<br />
Mr GORTON-Do not deny it. It is also<br />
worth noting that those proposals, if they<br />
are the proposals ultimately to be adopted,<br />
require that such benefits even though they<br />
have been paid for during a working life<br />
are to be reduced by one-half of any<br />
earnings continuing after the age of<br />
This is supposed to be something called<br />
' the abolition of the means test'. So these<br />
proposals require the community to accept<br />
substantial and compulsory increases in<br />
taxation throughout their working lives; to<br />
accept increased costs and prices due to<br />
an additional compulsory 6% levy cn payrolls,<br />
and to accept that when they do get<br />
benefits those benefits are taxable and<br />
subject to a means test of one-half when<br />
they reach<br />
Let me make two additional points about<br />
this strange amorphous non-proposal. The<br />
first point I want to make is to bring home<br />
by illustration the increased burden of taxation<br />
that the scheme-which is apparently<br />
to be put forward but, of course, we do<br />
not really know what it is but it has been<br />
hinted at-would require. For the Professor<br />
Downing scheme, if that is the one to be<br />
adopted, requires all who are self employed<br />
to pay in addition to their own tax to which<br />
I have referred the contribution that would<br />
otherwise be paid by their employer. So a<br />
self employed man, a farmer, anybody in<br />
his own business or a shop keeper with a<br />
wife and three children, who is earning<br />
a week, after allowing for average concessional<br />
deductions would be required to<br />
pay income tax of something over $ 200<br />
per annum to be increased under Professor </p>
<p>Downing's proposals and the Opposition's<br />
proposals, unless they are told to do something<br />
else, by $ 100 per annum or almost<br />
This is actually the employee's contribution<br />
and because he was self employed<br />
he would also have to pay the employer's<br />
contribution-an additional amount of $ 200<br />
per annum-so that the total income tax<br />
bill would rise from $ 218 to $ 518 per<br />
annum. I do hope that there will be some more<br />
precise proposals put before this House in<br />
regard to what aspects of this scheme are<br />
or are not to be adopted than the mere<br />
statement: ' Well, we are rather in favour<br />
of this kind of course. We do not quite know<br />
how to do it. Ii we get elected we will put<br />
a committee up to tell us and it will be<br />
something along the lines of the Downing<br />
scheme'-which I have just shown to the<br />
House requires these sacrifices from the<br />
taxpaying man, from that section of the<br />
community the Leader of the Opposition<br />
was so sorry for, for whom he wept crocodile<br />
tears, but who would be the really hurt<br />
people should this compulsory additional<br />
tax be introduced.<br />
Mr Crean-Tell us who is paying the<br />
$ 800m extra tax this year.<br />
Mr GORTON-I will not interject on<br />
the honourable member and I ask him not<br />
to interject on me. But, Mr Deputy<br />
Speaker, I have been asked a question and,<br />
if you do not mind, I will reply to it<br />
because it is an interesting point. I have<br />
been asked who is paying the $ 850m extra<br />
tax to be raised by the Treasury this year.<br />
The people earning wages and salaries are<br />
paying this, but their rates of taxation are<br />
not being increased by one cent-and no<br />
one can say that the Opposition's proposals,<br />
if they are implemented, would not require<br />
an increase in rates of taxation. I will move<br />
on to that later. It is no wonder that the<br />
Leader of the Opposition has not made any<br />
firm proposals. It is no wonder that he<br />
adopts as a policy a promise to ask other<br />
people to tell him what his policy should<br />
be. But it is a wonder that he should believe<br />
the Australian people are as gullible as he<br />
seems to believe they are, and I suggest<br />
very strongly that he and the Party who sit<br />
behind him are Under an obligation, if they<br />
are to retain any credibility in this matter<br />
at all, to put precisely before Australians just what they do propose to do and just<br />
what extra taxation and just what increases<br />
in taxation rates they propose to impose<br />
on the working population in order to do<br />
it. For our part we can say with truth<br />
that our proposals are clearly and<br />
concretely set out in the Budget for Australians<br />
to judge, as they ought to be.<br />
Mr Duthie-You are the Government<br />
and you can do this.<br />
Mr GORTON-They have been costed<br />
and they do not require any increase in<br />
taxation. It is said that we are the Government<br />
and that is what we should be expected<br />
to do. I agree. That, indeed, is what we<br />
have done. But they are the Opposition and<br />
they can be expected, if they propose to<br />
put an alternative scheme, to put it in the<br />
same finite, concrete, costed way that the<br />
Government has put its scheme before<br />
Australians. Apart from advances in the field of<br />
social services, the Budget provides for great<br />
advances in providing for education. It provides<br />
for a continuation of the grants now<br />
made by the Commonwealth for science<br />
blocks and libraries in secondary schools,<br />
both government and independent. It provides<br />
for a continuation of the grants made<br />
for building secondary technical schoolssolely<br />
government secondary technical<br />
schools. It provides for a continuation of<br />
the $ 8m a year for capital to build teacher<br />
training colleges for State governments to<br />
train teachers for State government schools,<br />
except that there is a small percentage of<br />
private teachers trained in them. It also<br />
indicates that that grant will be increased<br />
to $ 10m a year in the future, and all of<br />
these grants require no matching contribution<br />
from the States whatever.<br />
Further, the Commonwealth accepts the<br />
proposals put forward bythe Martin Committee<br />
that teacher training should be permitted<br />
as an integral part of colleges of<br />
advanced education and should. attract Commonwealth<br />
grants when they are so integrated<br />
and accepts that recommendation<br />
from the Martin Committee, again to the<br />
advantages of State education systems. It<br />
accepts the proposals of ihe Australian<br />
Universities Commission for the coming<br />
triennium and of the advisory body on colleges<br />
of advanced education for the coming<br />
triennium, and as a result expenditure from </p>
<p>all sources-Commonwealth, State and fees<br />
-will rise from the record $ 651m in the<br />
present triennium, which ends at the end<br />
of this calendar year, to $ 910m in the<br />
triennium beginning on 1st January 1970.<br />
It provides for increased scholarships and<br />
it provides something which has been<br />
attacked by the Leader of the Opposition in<br />
the sense that he does not think it should<br />
be provided in the way it is. It provides for<br />
assistance to be given to the recurrent costs<br />
of independent schools. This assistance f~ r<br />
all independent schools is to total $ 16m for<br />
recurrent costs in this financial year and<br />
for science blocks and libraries in this<br />
financial year. That is what this Budget in<br />
this financial year is providing for independent<br />
schools-a total of $ 24.8m. This is<br />
fully justified and fully warranted. For our<br />
part, we believe in a dual system of<br />
education. . Mr Bryant-Why do you neglect the<br />
State schools?<br />
Mr GORTON-I will show you that we<br />
do not. We believe -in a dual system of<br />
education. We believe that it is good for<br />
education itself for there to be alternative<br />
approaches able to be tried out both in the<br />
government schools and in the independent<br />
schools. We believe that those who bear<br />
their full share of taxation should be able to<br />
receive some return if they decide that they<br />
wish their children to attend other than a<br />
government school, and we believe, looking<br />
at the matter purely from an economical<br />
point of view, that it would be nothing less<br />
than a disaster for the government schools if<br />
the independent schools were not able to<br />
continue and nothing less than a disaster for<br />
the nation if the independent schools, being<br />
able to continue, were to provide a bad type<br />
of education. It is necessary to see that both<br />
these problems are attacked, and this Budget<br />
sets out to attack them, yet the proposal is<br />
criticised by the Leader of the Opposition<br />
on the grounds that the Budget makes no<br />
provision for government schools, echoing<br />
an interjection made fairly recently by one<br />
of the Leader of the Opposition's closest<br />
followers. To quote the words of the Leader<br />
of the Opposition: ' There is not one cent in<br />
the Budget for government schools'. Such a<br />
statement reveals either ignorance or a<br />
determined and quite futile attempt to<br />
conceal the truth, for this Budget provides in total for independent schools, as I have<br />
said, $ 24.8m in this financial year, and it<br />
provides in total for government schools,<br />
including the provision of teacher training<br />
in that field, not $ 24.8m but $ 39.4m. There<br />
are a lot of cents in $ 39.4m, and I am<br />
surprised that the Leader of the Opposition<br />
could say that there was not one cent in<br />
the Budget for government schools.<br />
I should not conclude without referring<br />
to some of the most glaring of the attempts<br />
at misrepresentation which were evident in<br />
the speech delivered here by the Leader of<br />
the Opposition. He implies that the Budget<br />
increases taxation. It is perfectly clear that<br />
it does not. The rates of -income tax or<br />
indirect taxes are not raised by one cent.<br />
If he had said that total collections from<br />
taxation will rise he would have been correct,<br />
but he chose instead to imply that<br />
rates of tax were to rise, which is untrue.<br />
He claims that the Budget makes no considered<br />
approach to the needs of all schools.<br />
both* independent and government, and I<br />
have shown that the Budget provides indirect<br />
grants for government schools and the<br />
provision of capital for training teachers for<br />
government schools, more than it provides<br />
for independent schools. He claims that it<br />
ignores the problems of capital cities, yet it<br />
contains provision for the first steps in the<br />
Government's decision to provide S600m<br />
for urban roads and freeways over the<br />
coming 5 years to relieve one of the greatest<br />
pressures on the urban system-the congestion<br />
of traffic and the time wasted and<br />
economic loss through that congestion. He<br />
claims that it makes no attempt to grapple<br />
with social services, and I have shown both<br />
that it does, and that there has been no<br />
concrete alternative proposal advanced.<br />
rExtension of time granted.] I thank the<br />
House and will not take advantage of it.<br />
The Leader of the Oipposition claims in<br />
his speech that the Treasurer spoke of a<br />
growth rate of 6% in the coming year and<br />
said that the Treasurer had refused to<br />
indicate how much of that growth rate<br />
would be real growth and how much inflation.<br />
Yet the Treasurer's speech specifically<br />
states as reported on page 33 of Hansard of.<br />
12th August 1969:<br />
An increase of at least 6% in gross national<br />
product at constant prices<br />
I interpolate that that means in real terms.<br />
It seems a reasonable forecast to make. </p>
<p>Yet we are told that the Treasurer had<br />
refused to give that information. It is there.<br />
It was there for the Leader of the Opposition<br />
to see, but it was misrepresented to this<br />
House. The Leader of the Opposition claims that<br />
' the Treasurer concedes that to abolish the<br />
means test entirely over the next 5 years<br />
would cost less in each of those years than<br />
the present proposal will cost this year'.<br />
The Treasurer has not, as far as I know<br />
and from any document I can read, conceded<br />
anything of the kind. But the Leader<br />
of the Opposition's remarks, being translated,<br />
mean that he thinks that to abolish<br />
the means test would, when it has been<br />
done, cost annually six times as much as<br />
our own taper proposals, without providing<br />
even one extra dollar for the areas of Deed<br />
that remain.<br />
Mr Crean-That is not what he said.<br />
Mr GORTON-That is what he said. I<br />
will quote what he said. I am told it is not<br />
what he said. Indeed what he said was:<br />
The Treasurer concedes that to abolish the means<br />
test entirely over the next 5 years would cost less<br />
in each of those years than the present proposal<br />
will cost this year.<br />
This means that he thinks that this year,<br />
next year, the year after and so on for the<br />
following 5 years you add at least as much<br />
as is provided this year, which means that<br />
it will be six times as much annually as is<br />
provided now, and that, Mr Deputy<br />
Speaker, will not leave one extra dollar to<br />
relieve those who have no other m eans at<br />
all; to relieve the widows; to take any<br />
further steps along the road of helping real<br />
need. I think that the statement as it was<br />
made was made in a way designed to lead<br />
the unwary to be taken in.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition said:<br />
For the first time in memory this Budget contains<br />
not a single development proposal. This<br />
Budget continues the silence on Queensland water<br />
projects. Amongst the papers presented with the<br />
Bu dget for all to read who have the intelligence<br />
to read and the will to honestly<br />
reproduce what they read, the Budget contains<br />
money, makes provision for the<br />
Copeton Dam, for the King River Dam, for<br />
continuing the Tailem Bend pipeline in<br />
South Australia, for the Fairbair ' n Dam, for<br />
a loan of $ 14.7m to Tasmania for power.<br />
In total an increased developmental project of $ 71m in the Budget over last year. Yet<br />
we were told that for the first time in<br />
memory the Budget contains not a<br />
single developmental proposal. 1 cite these<br />
examples, and they are examples selected<br />
out of many that could otherwise be chosen<br />
to illustrate what I believe to be the false<br />
and unsustainable basis of attacks on our<br />
p roposals, for, coupled with the nebulous,<br />
imprecise, audacious suggestions of ' Elect<br />
the Labor Party and we will get somebody<br />
else to tell us what to do', and coupled with<br />
an inability to level genuine criticism and<br />
attacks on the proposals we ' have made, it<br />
leads me to the conclusion that this long list<br />
of misrepresentations, this long list of misstatements,<br />
points up the bankruptcy of new<br />
ideas, points up the inability of a concrete<br />
and proper attack on the proposals the<br />
Government has put forward. For we have<br />
put forward matters finitely presented and<br />
finitely costed. That they can only be<br />
attacked by misrepresentation must mean<br />
that there are no finite alternative proposals<br />
ready to be put before this House.<br />
I just wish to make one other point. it<br />
was clear from the opening remarks made<br />
by the Leader of the Opposition in this<br />
House that there has suddenly burst upon<br />
him with a startling clarity as some new<br />
revelation from on high, that when new proposals<br />
are made, that when advances in<br />
social services or education or development<br />
are made, the money to make them has<br />
got to come from the taxpayer. He suddenly<br />
realises this, apparently, because he points<br />
out with an air of surprise that this is where<br />
the money is coming from; it is coming<br />
from the taxpayers. OK, we knew that, and<br />
I think most people knew it before. Let us<br />
accept that. But what is more important<br />
than this new revelation is what I hope will<br />
be a subsequent revelation, and that is, that<br />
if all the proposals, I will not say advanced,<br />
but imprecisely sketched and put before<br />
this House were ever to take a concrete<br />
form, then the money would still continue<br />
to come from the taxpayers, but i much<br />
larger amounts than at present and as a<br />
result of much higher rates of taxation than<br />
at present. What we are proposing, a3 1<br />
said, is a Budget which takes good steps,<br />
which is financially responsible, and which<br />
will not take from the taxpayer by raising<br />
rates of taxation one single penny this year.<br />
I commend it to the House, and I believe<br />
it will commend itself to the country. </p>
