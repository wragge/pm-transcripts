FOR PRESS P. M. No. 42/ 1963<br />
SHOW TO BE OPENED BY TELEPHONE HOOKUP<br />
The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, tomorrow afternoon<br />
at 2.30 will officially open the Moree Agricultural Show without being there<br />
in person. Instead, over a two way telephone hookup between Canberra<br />
and Moree, Sir Robert will listen to the Mayor of Moree introducing him and<br />
will then perform the opening ceremony by speaking into a microphone on his<br />
desic. A public address system at the Moree showgrounds will<br />
0 amplify his address to the people present.<br />
The telephone hookup for this unusual procedure is being<br />
arranged by the Post Office. The two centres will be connected via Sydney<br />
over a telephone system which will give perfect reproduction in Mores of Sir<br />
Robert's voice. The Prime Minister is performing the ceremony at the<br />
request of the Agricultural Socioty and the Federal Member for Cwydir ( Mr.<br />
Ian Allan). Owing to commitments in Canberra, Sir Robert cannot visit More<br />
personally. But rather than disappoint the residenlts of this important and<br />
progressive centre, he agreed to the opening being performed by " remote control".<br />
