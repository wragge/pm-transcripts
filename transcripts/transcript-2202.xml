FOR PRESS: R 70 " J9<br />
V. N . Isued from the Office<br />
of the Press Secretary<br />
PRIME MINISTER TO VISIT EXPO<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton, will visit Japan<br />
in May for Australia's National Day at Expo.<br />
Mr. Gorton said today that he would be absent from Australia<br />
for only a few days. But he was anxious to be present in Osaka on<br />
the 8th of May for the special day of activities featuring Australia.<br />
Our contribution to Expo had already won much favourable<br />
comment, and he felt he should represent the Government on this<br />
special occasion. Mr. Gorton said he would probably also spend a day in<br />
Tokyo, but the details of the visit were still being worked out.<br />
