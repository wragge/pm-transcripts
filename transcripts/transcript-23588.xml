    <content><![CDATA[<p>Tomorrow, the Government will be re-introducing our Bill to scrap the carbon tax.</p>
<p>Scrapping the carbon tax is a vital part of this Governmentâs Economic Action Strategy because the carbon tax is bad for jobs, it hurts families and it doesnât help the environment.</p>
<p>By scrapping the carbon tax weâll save the typical household about $550 a year.</p>
<p>Electricity prices will be lower â by about 9 per cent â and everyone benefits from lower power prices â from the local butcher running fridges and restaurants running ovens, to our largest manufacturers exporting to the world.</p>
<p>And every hospital, school and charity will benefit when power and gas bills fall.</p>
<p>So itâs time to end this bad tax and to terminate Laborâs failed carbon tax experiment.</p>
<p>Labor still canât admit itâs wrong on the carbon tax â just like they still canât admit they are wrong on border protection.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, Australia reached a significant milestone â six months had passed without a successful people smuggling venture.</p>
<p>We are stopping the boats.Â  Our polices are working.</p>
<p>In border protection, in the Budget and across government, we are purposefully, methodically and successfully delivering an Economic Action Strategy that is building a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia.</p>
