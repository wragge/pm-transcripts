    <content><![CDATA[<p>Tomorrow, the Government will be re-introducing our Bill to scrap the carbon tax.</p>
<p>Scrapping the carbon tax is a vital part of this Government’s Economic Action Strategy because the carbon tax is bad for jobs, it hurts families and it doesn’t help the environment.</p>
<p>By scrapping the carbon tax we’ll save the typical household about $550 a year.</p>
<p>Electricity prices will be lower – by about 9 per cent – and everyone benefits from lower power prices – from the local butcher running fridges and restaurants running ovens, to our largest manufacturers exporting to the world.</p>
<p>And every hospital, school and charity will benefit when power and gas bills fall.</p>
<p>So it’s time to end this bad tax and to terminate Labor’s failed carbon tax experiment.</p>
<p>Labor still can’t admit it’s wrong on the carbon tax – just like they still can’t admit they are wrong on border protection.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, Australia reached a significant milestone – six months had passed without a successful people smuggling venture.</p>
<p>We are stopping the boats.  Our polices are working.</p>
<p>In border protection, in the Budget and across government, we are purposefully, methodically and successfully delivering an Economic Action Strategy that is building a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia.</p>
