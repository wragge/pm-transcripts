    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce the Governor-General has appointed Dr James Renwick SC as Australia’s Independent National Security Legislation Monitor. Dr Renwick has been acting as the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor since early 2017.</p>
<p>The Independent National Security Legislation Monitor performs an important role in ensuring that Australia’s national security and counter-terrorism legislation accords with the rule of law and is applied in a manner consistent with Australia’s human rights obligations.</p>
<p>Dr Renwick’s appointment demonstrates the Government’s ongoing commitment to national security. As an eminent barrister, Dr Renwick brings a wealth of legal expertise and a strong understanding of national security issues and the operation of relevant security agencies.</p>
<p>Dr Renwick is currently Senior Counsel at 12 Wentworth Selborne Chambers in Sydney and has been a senior member of the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal since 2014. He was appointed Senior Counsel in 2011 and was formerly a Principal Legal Officer at the Commonwealth Attorney-General’s Department and Northern Territory Department of Law.</p>
<p>I congratulate Dr Renwick on his appointment.</p>
