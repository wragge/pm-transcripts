FOR MEDIA5 April 1984<br />
The attached letter was delivered 1: o Mr Peacock tonight. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER CANBERRA<br />
0 5 APR 198_ 4<br />
The Honourable A. S. Peacock, MP<br />
Leader of the opposition<br />
Parliament House<br />
CANBERRA ACT 2600<br />
Dear Mr Peacock<br />
Thank you for your letter of 5 April 1984 in which you<br />
advised me of the intention of the Opposition to invite<br />
to Australia three South African politicians and requested<br />
the Government to issue visas to them.<br />
I am somewhat surprised at the importance attached to<br />
giving aid and comfort to South Africa in the<br />
Opposition's foreign policy, as evidenced by this<br />
invitation on behalf of yourself and a section of your<br />
opposition colleagues, but acknowledge that this is your<br />
own affair. I now understand a little more clearly the<br />
report in the Capetown Argus of 29 February, attributed<br />
to the Opposition spokesman on Foreign Affairs,<br />
Mr Mackellar, that the Coalition Parties proposed to<br />
develop a more accommodating policy towards South Africa.<br />
The Government takes the view that South Africans<br />
holding official positions will not be permitted entry<br />
to Australia if the principal purpose of their visit<br />
is to promote apartheid doctrine or policies. This<br />
follows from the peculiarly odious character of the<br />
apartheid doctrine practised by the South African<br />
Government. It is not merely that apartheid is the antithesis<br />
of the fundamental democratic values of our open<br />
liberal society which you call in aid: but the<br />
racism of apartheid is fundamentally and intolerably<br />
anti-human. Apartheid discriminates on nothing more<br />
than the biological circumstances of one's birth:<br />
there is nothing over which one has less control.<br />
It is moreover the case, as you will be well aware,<br />
that the south African Government does not allow<br />
prominent and vocal domestic opponents of apartheid<br />
to freely leave and return, nor does it allow prominent<br />
and vocal international opponents of apartheid to visit<br />
South Africa for the purpose of publicly challenging<br />
apartheid doctrine and practice. </p>
<p>2.<br />
To give aid and comfort under these circumstances to<br />
official South African spokesmen to promote apartheid<br />
doctrine and policies would not only be utterly at odds<br />
with the positions Australia has consistently taken in<br />
world forums, with our practice in specific policy<br />
areas such as sporting contacts, with our internationaf<br />
human rights treaty obligations, and with the dignity<br />
and aspirations of our indigenous Aboriginal minority,<br />
but would lack any justification in principle.<br />
It was because of his awareness of their intent to<br />
promote the racial obscenity of apartheid that my<br />
colleague, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic<br />
Affairs, decided last month not to issue visas to<br />
Messrs Durr and Rajab.<br />
For any of the proposed delegates to be a member of<br />
the South African Parliament adds nothing to the quality<br />
of the case you make, given the utterly unrepresentative<br />
and undemocratic character of the South African Parliament<br />
with its wholly racially-based franchise.<br />
If you are able to give me a written assurance that<br />
the proposed presence in Australia of the South African<br />
politicians, as the Opposition's guests, will not be<br />
exploited by them for the purpose of promoting apartheid,<br />
the Government will be prepared to approve the<br />
applications for visas which may result from your request.<br />
Yours sincerely<br />
R. J. L. Hawke </p>
