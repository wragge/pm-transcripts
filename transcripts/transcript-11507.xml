<p>E&amp;OE .............................................................................................</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>We have in the studio, the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr John Howard.</p>
<p> And a very good morning to you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, very nice to be with you Stan, very nice indeed.</p>
<p> ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Usually I am saying good evening to you.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You are, and it will be an interesting experience for both of us. The</p>
<p> last time we conversed across the microphone was in the evening and .</p>
<p> . .</p>
<p> ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Well, you are certainly going to have more announcers to talk to in the</p>
<p> morning now.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, they seem to be very thick on the ground, particularly in Sydney.</p>
<p> ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>It is going to be very competitive.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh well, that is my philosophy.</p>
<p> ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Competition hurts nobody.</p>
<p> ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Absolutely. Now I know that you're very busy this morning, so if</p>
<p> we can get right into it. Because a lot of things to talk about. Today's</p>
<p> Telegraph quotes you as saying the sacked workers from the National Textiles</p>
<p> in the Hunter Valley are victims of economic reality. I mean you can understand</p>
<p> that they're going to be a little bit angered by all this - the workers</p>
<p> out there.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, let me say immediately that I feel very sorry for those workers</p>
<p> and their families - deeply sorry - and I feel very sorry for any worker</p>
<p> in Australia who loses his or her job. And we are doing everything we</p>
<p> can to ensure that the entitlements that they have are properly covered.</p>
<p> I am told by the receiver who has been appointed that these employees</p>
<p> will receive all of their unpaid wages, all of their superannuation, their</p>
<p> annual leave and their long service leave, their rostered days off, their</p>
<p> sick leave and at this stage it is estimated that there will be enough</p>
<p> money for 50 percent of the outstanding notice in lieu and redundancy</p>
<p> payments.</p>
<p> ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Will the Government make up the rest?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Peter Reith's indicated that he'll be taking a scheme</p>
<p> to Cabinet in eight, or ten days time.</p>
<p> ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Will you endorse it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I support it. Let me make it clear at the beginning. Now . . .</p>
<p> ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>But Mr Reith said last year thought it was going to be ready by January</p>
<p> 1.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, but he also said this morning that the new scheme when endorsed</p>
<p> will have effect from the 1st of January this year. Therefore</p>
<p> it will cover the people who have been affected by the National Textiles</p>
<p> close down.</p>
<p> ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Ok, so he is going to put the scheme up, you're going to endorse</p>
<p> it. If you endorse it we can say that it is a lay down misere, it'll</p>
<p> go through.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it has a fair chance of going through. But it is a matter for</p>
<p> Cabinet. And it is the sort of thing that must be endorsed by a full Cabinet</p>
<p> meeting. And it's a scheme that will expect some support and contributions</p>
<p> from State Governments as well, it's a safety net scheme. It is not</p>
<p> possible in something of this kind, for every last dollar of somebody's</p>
<p> entitlements to be covered, but certainly . . .</p>
<p> ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Workers have to be covered though, don't they?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, workers should be covered by companies. And one of the other things</p>
<p> that Mr Reith has said in relation to National Textiles, and indeed to</p>
<p> other companies, is that if there is anything untoward in the behaviour</p>
<p> of directors - and I am not suggesting there is in this case, or there</p>
<p> has been in other cases - but if there is then those directors should</p>
<p> be pursued. We are in fact proposing to further strengthen the law to</p>
<p> make it even more obligatory on directors to ensure that adequate provision</p>
<p> is made for redundancy payments to their workers.</p>
<p> ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Okay, but your brother is the non-executive chairman of the actual company.</p>
<p> Have you spoken to him? A lot of people are saying, well why wouldn't</p>
<p> you pick up the telephone and ask him, well what went wrong?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, one of the reasons why I haven't spoken to him since the receiver</p>
<p> was appointed is that once the receiver was appointed that person has</p>
<p> legal control over the assets of the company and the directors cease to</p>
<p> have any control at all. And the other reason is that it is precisely</p>
<p> because he is my brother, so I think it is better for somebody else to</p>
<p> deal with the company because people might think that because your brother</p>
<p> is there you may not handle it in quite the arms-length, correct way that</p>
<p> you would if it was somebody who was unrelated to you. My brother has</p>
<p> a number of business interests and he has been a very successful person,</p>
<p> and he has always conducted himself with total integrity. But I've</p>
<p> always taken care, and he has, to ensure that we don't deal with</p>
<p> each other, other than is entirely necessary because, precisely because</p>
<p> we are related.</p>
<p> ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Well, we can understand that. But this is a story of national importance.</p>
<p> And one would have thought that you would have picked up the phone, being</p>
<p> your brother or not, and said well listen, what has happened with this?</p>
<p> What's happened with the company? How did you get yourself into this?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, look I, I, like any other textile company, it was obvious from</p>
<p> what I have been told by a number of people, and not only him, that it</p>
<p> was difficult - because textiles, the textile industry is a very difficult</p>
<p> industry. And the point I was trying to make yesterday was that companies</p>
<p> in that industry have to compete against very cheap imports and I know</p>
<p> there is a natural tendency for people to say well we should keep all</p>
<p> cheap imports out. The only trouble is that if we do that then other countries</p>
<p> will keep out our exports, and we will end up suffering a lot more damage</p>
<p> than we seek to prevent.</p>
<p> ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Are we going to see more problems with textile industries?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well . . . .</p>
<p> ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>With more companies going bust because labour is too expensive in this</p>
<p> country?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, labour is not too expensive compared with countries that have the</p>
<p> same living standards as us. In fact our labour costs now are more competitive</p>
<p> than they have been for some time. But you cannot compete against countries</p>
<p> that are paying their workers a pittance every hour, that is very hard</p>
<p> unless you have very high tariff levels. And the problem with that Stan</p>
<p> is that if we make our tariff levels very high than other countries will</p>
<p> retaliate and keep our products out. I mean, it happens enough now, look</p>
<p> at the problem with President Clinton and our lamb exports. But a small</p>
<p> country like Australia finds it very hard to do that. Now, as I say I</p>
<p> am very sorry for what has happened to these workers, and we are doing</p>
<p> all that we can to ensure that they get their entitlements. The receiver</p>
<p> is in charge of all of that.</p>
<p> ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Can you actually guarantee them that they are going to get all their</p>
<p> entitlements?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, what I can do is repeat what the Government has been told by the</p>
<p> receiver. We don't control the company when it goes into receivership.</p>
<p> Let's understand that.</p>
<p> ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Where is it there then?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What the receiver has told us is that they will get all of their entitlements,</p>
<p> their holiday pay, their sick leave, their long service leave, their superannuation.</p>
<p> The area where, at this stage, there are only resources for up to 50%</p>
<p> is redundancy and payment in lieu. And it is that other 50%, or a portion</p>
<p> of that other 50% that we will be addressing when we discuss the matter</p>
<p> in Cabinet in about eight or ten days time.</p>
<p> ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Okay, on another subject. Australian of the Year, Sir Gustav Nossal,</p>
<p> says he thinks it is okay if Aborigines protest during the Olympics. Do</p>
<p> you agree with that sort of thinking? Do you...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I wouldn't encourage anybody in the aboriginal community to</p>
<p> protest, no. Anybody has a right to protest at any time in this country,</p>
<p> providing the process is carried out in accordance to the law. And people</p>
<p> have a democratic right to peacefully protest at any time in Australia.</p>
<p> But, it would be counterproductive to the cause of the aboriginal community</p>
<p> for protests to take place during the Olympic Games. I don't think</p>
<p> that will increase the level of concern and understanding in the Australian</p>
<p> community about the position of aboriginal Australians. Indeed I think</p>
<p> it could have the opposite effect.</p>
<p> ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>So, you don't think it will achieve anything by the aboriginal people</p>
<p> protesting at the Olympics?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think if a protest occurs and it creates an adverse impression, not</p>
<p> only domestically but around the world, that will reduce the concern in</p>
<p> the Australian community for the aborigines, rather than improve it. And</p>
<p> I would, whilst I acknowledge the right of any Australian to engage in</p>
<p> a lawful, democratic protest about anything, because that is part of our</p>
<p> inheritance, I would discourage aborigines from joining the protest against</p>
<p> the Olympic Games and I would counsel those who would encourage them to</p>
<p> do so in the name of increasing awareness of aborigines' problems,</p>
<p> I would counsel those people against encouraging them.</p>
<p> ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Okay, while you were on holidays, there was all sorts of confusion about</p>
<p> whether businesses will be able to round up prices when they add on the</p>
<p> GST. Will they, or won't they be able to round up? And if something</p>
<p> comes to, say for argument's sake when you round it up to 97 cents,</p>
<p> what do people do then?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there are two issues here. There is the normal rounding up that</p>
<p> occurs at the checkout now. Where, if you buy a basket of goods and it</p>
<p> comes out at something that is not denominated in 5 cents, then you either</p>
<p> round down or up to the nearest 5 cents. Now that has been going on now</p>
<p> since we abolished 1 and 2 cent coins, it's got nothing to do with</p>
<p> the GST. That will continue, and that is totally unaffected. But that</p>
<p> . . .</p>
<p> ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>But you said with the rounding up as long as there is in the 10% rate.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That is a separate issue which is raised by the GST, is that companies</p>
<p> have what they have price points. In other words, they typically price</p>
<p> some of their goods at something 99 cents or 49 cents. And what they want</p>
<p> is a capacity to keep those price points for marketing purposes and to</p>
<p> either go up in some cases or to go down in others. Now, what we have</p>
<p> said...</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Do you really believe though everybody's going to go down?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hang on. What we have said is number one, you can't in any way profiteer</p>
<p> out of this. Number two, in no circumstances should anything go over 10</p>
<p> per cent, as far as an increase is concerned because that was a commitment</p>
<p> we made in the last election. And number three, there'll be very,</p>
<p> very tight controls on the parameters within which, and the circumstances</p>
<p> in which this kind of rounding up or rounding down can occur. And the</p>
<p> ACCC is still working on those guidelines and they'll be made available</p>
<p> very soon.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Small businesses are going to, as I understand, are going to get a $200</p>
<p> voucher, is that correct, to help them cover the cost of implementing</p>
<p> the GST. But an independent report by Ernst and Young released last week</p>
<p> estimates that businesses in New South Wales will have to spend up to</p>
<p> $20,000 each to comply with the GST. It makes the $200 look pretty sick.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the representation of that report by the New South Wales Government</p>
<p> was wrong. I've had a look at that report and one of the interesting</p>
<p> things that comes out of that report is that the businesses surveyed said</p>
<p> that they would not be involved in nearly the expense they expected in</p>
<p> implementing the GST. The other point I want to make is that the taxation</p>
<p> office at the moment is working on an arrangement whereby those businesses</p>
<p> particularly with relatively small turnovers that have a mixture of goods</p>
<p> that are subject to the GST and goods that are not subject to the GST</p>
<p> they're working on a simple apportionment formula that will enable</p>
<p> those firms to cope with that particular problem. I saw an article in</p>
<p> one of the papers yesterday that had this bloke, I think it was in a Queensland</p>
<p> country town, saying look, I'm going to have a problem because some</p>
<p> things are subject to the GST and some aren't. Well, what I am saying</p>
<p> to that man and others like him is that if your business is below a particular</p>
<p> turnover, and the tax office will be announcing details of this fairly</p>
<p> soon, then you are going to be allowed to apportion the goods in relation</p>
<p> to whether they are subject to GST or no GST. And you won't have</p>
<p> to, sort of, do a separate calculation for each individual item. And that</p>
<p> is going to save those small businesses an enormous amount of effort and</p>
<p> it's really going to be quite a boon to those particular businesses.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>You must be concerned though because a lot of people are still concerned</p>
<p> about the GST, they still don't understand it. Now, a lot of people</p>
<p> are saying well, okay, when is all of this publicity going to come out,</p>
<p> when are we going to find out the nuts and bolts on how it all works.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Stan, I think everybody knows that on the 1st of July</p>
<p> we'll have a $12 billion tax cut that when the GST, the new tax system</p>
<p> comes into operation we'll have cheaper exports, lower business costs</p>
<p> and cheaper fuel in the bush. What we have got to remember is that the</p>
<p> GST is only one component of a total overhaul of the Australian taxation</p>
<p> system that will leave the Australian economy in a much stronger state.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Well, there's no argument from a lot of people out there...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But the important thing for people to remember that you never lose sight</p>
<p> of the big picture, the main game, the thing that really matters and that</p>
<p> is that we are doing this because it will leave the Australian economy</p>
<p> in a stronger, healthier state.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>But why are so many people confused though? Everybody is confused. I</p>
<p> get calls from everybody right around the country, they are confused about</p>
<p> the GST. When will your Government put out all the details, the nitty-gritty</p>
<p> of exactly how it's going to work so everybody understands?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Stan, you have got to remember that one side of politics in Australia</p>
<p> is deliberately creating confusion. Now, I have had two examples in the</p>
<p> last week of members of the New South Wales Labor Government distorting</p>
<p> the position on the GST. Faye Lo Po, one of the Ministers in the New South</p>
<p> Wales Government, falsely claimed that tampons in Canada were free of</p>
<p> GST. That was wrong but she still made the allegation. It was completely</p>
<p> wrong, it was demonstrated to be wrong and we still haven't had a</p>
<p> serious retraction from her. You've had the Premier of New South</p>
<p> Wales in relation to that Ernst and Young report misquoting it and not</p>
<p> acknowledging the fact that the report produced an analysis that didn't</p>
<p> support the argument he may have wanted. When you have got one side of</p>
<p> politics entirely devoted towards creating difficulty of course people</p>
<p> are going to get the impression that there are questions to be answered.</p>
<p> And look, I acknowledge that although there are huge benefits involved</p>
<p> in this new taxation system there is an implementation challenge and people</p>
<p> do need advice and do need assistance and that is being provided. And</p>
<p> you say, what about the information? People in small business are being</p>
<p> bombarded with information from the Australian Taxation Office.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I mean, I met somebody yesterday who is an importer. I met her at an</p>
<p> Australia Day function in my electorate and she said: this is a fantastic</p>
<p> reform. She said: I have a much better cash flow position, it's a</p>
<p> much better system for me as a small business proprietor to run it. She</p>
<p> said: it can't come quickly enough.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Well, just getting to a sporting goods manager, he estimates he would</p>
<p> have to spend about $10,000 re-negotiating contracts with suppliers, sub-contractors,</p>
<p> customers and sponsors, about $2,000 on pricing and cash flow management</p>
<p> as well. $6,000 on staff training, nearly $1,000 on technology implementation,</p>
<p> about $600 on compliance and other issues and about 530 man hours between</p>
<p> now and July 1. The total cost, according to him, is around $20,000. Now,</p>
<p> when you hear that all broken down I mean you can understand that the</p>
<p> $200 you are putting forward and the information that you are trying to,</p>
<p> sort of, get across to people just isn't...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Stan, I can't...</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Your version and their version...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Stan, with so many of these things, with most respect to that example</p>
<p> and whoever provided it, I am just not prepared to accept on face value</p>
<p> that it's a fair analysis. And I would have to talk to the person,</p>
<p> I would have to go through all the propositions he's put before I</p>
<p> could be satisfied that what he is saying is correct.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Can I put him in contact with your Department?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, of course, he can get in contact with my office. He can ring my</p>
<p> office any time and we'll go through it with him. Or better still,</p>
<p> I'll send him over to the tax implementation unit. But we are very</p>
<p> keen, the Government in total, is very keen to assist people because together</p>
<p> we want to work with small business in particular so that the implementation</p>
<p> is as smooth as possible. Because when it does come in there will be an</p>
<p> enormous benefit. I mean, every business in Australia will enjoy a reduction</p>
<p> in the operating costs. Our exporters will sell more competitively on</p>
<p> world markets and in the bush our fuel will be a lot cheaper and on top</p>
<p> of that, we'll all participate in a $12 billion cut in personal income</p>
<p> tax. And 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers will be on a top marginal</p>
<p> rate of no more than 30 cents in the dollar. Now, they are the big picture</p>
<p> benefits of this huge change, this hugely beneficial change to our taxation</p>
<p> system.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Okay. Now, a lot of people are worried about the banks, putting up fees</p>
<p> and charges to cover the costs of implementing the GST. Are the banks</p>
<p> well behaved in this? I mean, can they be better controlled by the Government,</p>
<p> is there any way that they can be better controlled? I mean, what are</p>
<p> you going to do to make sure that customers don't get slugged again?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, like everybody else the banks will be subject to surveillance by</p>
<p> the ACCC, the Competition and Consumer watchdog, to see that there is,</p>
<p> you know, a correct handling of the GST implementation. And, I mean, Australian</p>
<p> banks are very strong, they are very profitable and we want to be absolutely</p>
<p> certain that in the process of implementing the GST there are no charges</p>
<p> passed on in the name of the GST which are not in any way attributable</p>
<p> to the GST.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Another thing, one of my listeners, Mal from Erskine Park, wants to know</p>
<p> if stamp duty on things like cars and houses, that's going to be</p>
<p> abolished once the GST comes in?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Over time it will be, yes.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>But not straight away?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, not straight away but it will be over time, yes.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Why not straight away?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, because there is not enough money in the kitty for it to occur</p>
<p> straight away.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>But see, once again here's the confusion.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, it's not confusion. This was made very clear right at the</p>
<p> beginning Stan. I mean, what we are abolishing straight away is the wholesale</p>
<p> sales tax. That will go in total, in its entirety on the 1st</p>
<p> of July and we have already begun some of the reductions in reducing things</p>
<p> on whitegoods down to the more basic rate of 22 per cent. But other things</p>
<p> will take a number of years to abolish as the GST builds up. See all of</p>
<p> the GST is going to the States, the States are going to in a few years</p>
<p> be hugely better off therefore they will be able to abolish those things.</p>
<p> The Financial Institutions Duty will go quite early in the piece. Wholesale</p>
<p> sales tax will go immediately and over time these other things are going</p>
<p> to be abolished.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Okay. Now, look, I know that you are short on time...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You can keep going.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>No, no, that's fine. But there's a lot of other stuff that</p>
<p> we want to discuss before you have to fly off to Canberra and I most appreciate</p>
<p> it because I know that you were leaving earlier to go to Canberra this</p>
<p> morning and you put that trip off for us. The Indonesian President, Wahid,</p>
<p> has agreed to possibly come here to Australia, that must be a big coup</p>
<p> for you as far as getting him out here?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'd like to compliment Alexander Downer on handling this issue</p>
<p> very carefully and very professionally. He had a very good visit to Jakarta</p>
<p> and I am pleased that the Indonesian President has indicated a willingness</p>
<p> to come to Australia. He is very welcome to visit this country. It will,</p>
<p> in fact, be the first visit to Australia by an Indonesian President since</p>
<p> the mid 1970s so it will be quite an important event. Look, on both sides</p>
<p> there's a desire to rebuild the relationship, rebuild it on mutual</p>
<p> respect. We as a country believe that we have behaved correctly in relation</p>
<p> to Indonesia and Indonesia, of course, has certain sensitivities which</p>
<p> we understand but that is the past and what is important is the two countries</p>
<p> that lie next to each other share a common future and it is important</p>
<p> that we work on rebuilding the relationship and I welcome what the President</p>
<p> has said and I am certainly keen that he come and we are in the process</p>
<p> now of nailing down the details of the visit. But he'll be most welcome</p>
<p> and I think it's a very important step along the road to rebuilding</p>
<p> the relationship. But we have to be realistic, it will take time because</p>
<p> of the differences over East Timor and we have to be realistic about the</p>
<p> progress that can be made in a relatively short period of time. But Alexander</p>
<p> Downer's visit has brought the relationship a long way on the road</p>
<p> forward and I thank him and congratulate him for that.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Okay. We've got 3,277 illegal immigrants in detention at the moment.</p>
