FOR MEDIA 15 MARCH 1990<br />
I have today reaffirmed the Labor Government's unequivocal<br />
commitment to a fair, balanced and non-discriminatory<br />
immigration policy, and to multiculturalism as a policy for<br />
all Australians.<br />
Foundations for the Future, the ALP's election policy<br />
document, summarizes the Government's significant<br />
achievements of the past seven years in the areas of<br />
immigration, ethnic affairs and multiculturalism.<br />
These policies will continue under the fourth Hawke<br />
Government and will be supplemented by a number of further<br />
initiatives I announced today. These commitments build on<br />
the National Agendag for R Multic-ultural Augtralia, the<br />
comprehensive policy and program package released last July.<br />
In its fourth term an ALP Government will:<br />
develop a nationally networked ethnic radio news and<br />
current affairs service, through the S85, public radio<br />
stations and the Public Broadcasting Foundation, at a<br />
cost of up to $ 1.4 million in a full year million<br />
over the next three years)<br />
earmark $ 0.9 million over the next three years, through<br />
the ABC and SBS, to provide training and career<br />
development opportunities for non-English speaking<br />
background Australians in the television industry<br />
recognise the important communication role of the<br />
ethnic press by aiming to direct at least 5 percent<br />
( approx $ 1.5 million per annum) of government print<br />
media advertising through ethnic newspapers<br />
*-extend the reach of SBS television and legislate to<br />
estbl-sh-SBS-as -on-independent--corporation committed<br />
to multilingual and multicultural broadcasting<br />
continue to develop the National Policy on Languages,<br />
including continued support for a balanced program of<br />
second language learning for all Australians<br />
establish a National Bureau of Language Services to<br />
provide better interpreter and language services across<br />
the nation. </p>
<p>At the same time the Government will continue implementation<br />
of the reform processes initiated in the National Agenda,<br />
including new arrangements for the recognition of overseas<br />
qualifications; examination of the needs for interpreters in<br />
courts; review of the law and of administrative<br />
decision-making processes as they operate in a multicultural<br />
society; promotion of multicultural education in schools<br />
through our National Strategy for Schools; development and<br />
implementation of the Government's expanded and strengthened<br />
Access and Equity requirements; and substantially increased<br />
spending on English language programs.<br />
Although the Opposition Parties have pulled back from the<br />
brink of divisiveness that had characterised their stance on<br />
immigration issues, there remain significant differences<br />
between the major parties. Unlike the Opposition:<br />
we will not deny social security benefits to permanent<br />
settlers during their first year in Australia<br />
we will not slash $ 20 million from the immigration<br />
portfolio budget<br />
we will not make the acquisition of Australian<br />
citizenship harder by increasing the qualifying period<br />
from two to four years<br />
we will not contemplate marginalising the influence of<br />
the Office of Multicultural Affairs by moving it from<br />
the Prime Minister's portfolio<br />
we will not abolish the Human Rights and Equal<br />
Opportunity Commission.<br />
The Government's record in the area of multicultural affairs<br />
is unimpeachable. They are policies designed to achieve<br />
three purposes: to enhance individual rights, to promote<br />
greater social justice, and to maximise the efficient use of<br />
Australia's human resources.<br />
Today I unequivocally commit my Government to a<br />
non-discriminatory immigration policy and equal opportunity<br />
for all Australians no matter what their birthplace or their<br />
colour, no matter what their religion or first language. We<br />
have stood by our great ethnic communities when the going<br />
was at its toughest and we will continue to do so during the<br />
-Cgrm of the fourth Hawke Government. </p>
