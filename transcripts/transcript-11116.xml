<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>We have the Prime Minister on the line. Good morning, Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, John.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>I think your preamble is terrific.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, thank you very much. I think it's Australian.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>I do too, very, very Australian. You might have heard me mention part</p>
<p> of that fax from a woman listening to us: Âpeople may expect</p>
<p> some pompous piece of rubbish just because this is supposed to be</p>
<p> part of some official thing but I don't think we're a pompous</p>
<p> people.' Obviously you don't think we are either.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We're not. And there's no point in loading up an Australian</p>
<p> preamble with a whole lot of Âwhereas's' and Âwe</p>
<p> the peoples' and Âhumbly relyings.' They are the words</p>
<p> and that is the language of another country, countries, another age,</p>
<p> another generation. What I did try to do with this, with Les Murray's</p>
<p> help, is to write it in contemporary Australian English and to embrace</p>
<p> concepts that were common to Australians, to embrace ideas that all</p>
<p> Australians would not object to, although some would like to go further.</p>
<p> But in this business, if you go too far on one subject you'll</p>
<p> start losing people in order to try to placate the passions of a minority,</p>
<p> and preambles are not like that. And as for the word Âmateship',</p>
<p> well, I'm not surprised that that's attracted a lot of attention.</p>
<p> It is the most unambiguously, passionate, unmistakable Australian</p>
<p> word and it conjures up whole lots of things about our way of life</p>
<p> and I can't imagine a contemporary Australian preamble without</p>
<p> the notion being in it.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Yeah, well I'm with you totally on that. I also had another fax</p>
<p> from Helen Deloraine in Tassie saying as far as I'm concerned</p>
<p> mateship is an Australian institution, part of our history since convict</p>
<p> times and the thread that has kept us all going through the tough</p>
<p> times. People feel very strongly about the word.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, they do. And whatever its male origins might be, it has acquired</p>
<p> a generic meaning and it evokes a sense which is distinctively Australian</p>
<p> and it speaks of helping each other in adversity. It reminds you of</p>
<p> bush fires. It reminds you of people dragging bodies out of the rubble</p>
<p> under a ski lodge, of train smashes, all of those sorts of things</p>
<p> when Australians pull together and forget our differences. And one</p>
<p> of the reasons why Australian soldiers survived better in prisoner</p>
<p> of war camps than those of many of our allies was mateship, they worked</p>
<p> together. And there's so much of our history bound up with that</p>
<p> notion. I can't conceive that you could write something like</p>
<p> this and try and make it contemporary without bringing that notion</p>
<p> into it. And that's why I wanted it included. And, frankly, I</p>
<p> don't care what some of the critics say. I feel very passionately</p>
<p> that you've got to have that concept in it.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>I agree with you. I talked to Natasha Stott-Despoja earlier. I think</p>
<p> she might have changed her line a little bit on the mateship thing.</p>
<p> But what I suggested Â I also talked to Christopher Pearson and</p>
<p> I know that he and Les Murray were fairly close in discussions on</p>
<p> this whole thing Â about that paragraph: "we value excellence</p>
<p> as well as fairness, independence as dearly as mateship". I put</p>
<p> to both of them, and both liked the idea, if we added two very simple</p>
<p> words. I'm sure we'd keep everybody happy if we had: we</p>
<p> value excellence as well as decency and fairness, independence as</p>
<p> dearly as love and mateship.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Mmm, that's an interesting thought.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Yes, because decency, I mean, we all should be, in Australia, striving</p>
<p> for decency and fairness. And, love, placates those who think that</p>
<p> mateship might be in any way sexist.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's an interesting thought. I'll think about that. I'm</p>
<p> not, I mean, I'm not so fanatically egotistical about this that</p>
<p> there's no one word I would agree to change. I've said it's</p>
<p> a draft but it's a draft that received a lot of thought and I'm</p>
<p> obviously not going to tear it up and start again. And I'm obviously</p>
<p> not going to sit down with a committee of people with each, sort of,</p>
<p> having 10 words - you end up with a complete camel. But I am interested</p>
<p> in people's views and I have sent a copy of it to the Leader</p>
<p> of the Democrats, to Mr Beazley, to the State Premiers, and I'll</p>
<p> be interested to hear what some of them have got to say. I mean, I've</p>
<p> heard what Mr Beazley had to say. Meg Lees, the Leader of the Democrats,</p>
<p> hasn't said anything yet. She just wrote me back a very polite</p>
<p> letter saying thank you for sending me a copy and we'll certainly</p>
<p> respond. So, I want debate on it. I expected debate. I didn't</p>
<p> expect everybody to like every word of it. This is the first time</p>
<p> in 100 years an attempt has been made to write what people say is</p>
<p> the new preamble. In reality the existing preamble is part of the</p>
<p> British Enabling Act and it's not really part of our Constitution</p>
<p> but it is colloquially seen as a new preamble and, therefore, we do</p>
<p> need a period of debate. But you can't have something like this</p>
<p> that doesn't express what the country is about. And this sort</p>
<p> of knee-jerk reaction of always racing off to the American Constitution</p>
<p> and saying, well, where's Âwe the people'. Well, that</p>
<p> may have been all right for Jefferson, and that's fine, but surely</p>
<p> we can be original enough to devise a preamble that is quite different</p>
<p> from the preamble in any other constitution.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that's absolutely right. Are you prepared to look</p>
<p> at that word, Âcultures'?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the only reason we put cultures in is that there is sensitivity</p>
<p> between Â you mean the fact that it's plural?</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>No, the fact that it's there instead of the word Âstewardship'</p>
<p> that I think was mooted as being more acceptable.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Les Murray originally said that he wanted to say Âstewardship</p>
<p> of their lands'. Now, some people might regard that as having</p>
<p> been a little too cute in that Âtheir lands' might sound</p>
<p> very expansive. Yet some people might say, well, what are their lands,</p>
<p> they don't have all the lands they want to have. Look, once again,</p>
<p> I'm not saying this is the perfect formulation. But what I tried</p>
<p> to do with the indigenous section was to use words that nobody could</p>
<p> object to, although they may fall short of the expectations of those</p>
<p> who wanted more.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Yeah, well I doubt anybody could object to culture. And as I said</p>
<p> earlier when I was talking to Christopher that I think the word stewardship</p>
<p> is a nothing word because it's sort of one short of a, it sounds</p>
<p> like somebody who's frightened to say ownership.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's the problem, you see. I mean, you have to understand</p>
<p> that if there is, within this document, words that in a sense get</p>
<p> into the native title debate, it will have a lot of opposition.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And you'll lose people. And what I say to the Aboriginal leadership</p>
<p> and I say it very respectfully is, what is there now is an advance</p>
<p> on the present situation because there's no reference to the</p>
<p> indigenous people in the original preamble, no reference at all. And</p>
<p> what I've put in my draft acknowledges the historical truth that</p>
<p> they were there from the beginning of time and that we honour their</p>
<p> cultures and that they're ancient and continuing. Now, that is</p>
<p> a huge advance on the present situation. I know that they would like</p>
<p> us to go further but in the process of our going further other Australians</p>
<p> are going to say, that's too far.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>It's a very difficult thing to do.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You'll lose the whole...[tape break]</p>
<p> LAWS:</p>
<p>....feel the same way about it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's very encouraging.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Could I ask you, just before we go, what's happening with the</p>
<p> Telstra bill?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's off for Â the debate's not going on at the</p>
<p> present time. Look, my best guess on Telstra is this, John, that I</p>
<p> hope that although the Democrats and Brian Harradine and the Labor</p>
<p> Party have said no to the sale of 100% that we can get the further</p>
<p> 16% through and we'll keep trying to get the sale of the rest</p>
<p> of it through. But, I mean, I believe that the whole of Telstra should</p>
<p> be privatised. I believe in the end it will be privatised. I think</p>
<p> we'll all be better off and if we can get the whole lot of it</p>
<p> sold we can totally eliminate the Federal Government's debt.</p>
<p> That's its debt, not the foreign debt of a country but the Federal</p>
<p> Government debt could be just about totally obliterated in one hit</p>
<p> if we can get the whole of Telstra sold and we're going to keep</p>
<p> trying. But at the moment we can't get the numbers in the Senate</p>
<p> for the sale of the lot of it but I'm hopeful that we can at</p>
<p> least get the numbers in the Senate at some stage for the sale of</p>
<p> another 16%.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>So it's adjourned indefinitely.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't think it's adjourned indefinitely, I think it's</p>
<p> just adjourned for the time being.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Okay, and could I just ask you again to consider decency and love</p>
<p> in that...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I will consider decency and love.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>In that paragraph because I'm sure that would placate most of</p>
<p> it and it doesn't add much to it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Anyway, I think it's great and congratulations on creating it</p>
<p> and Les Murray too.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Nice to talk to you, Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
