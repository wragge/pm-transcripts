SVISIT TO INDONESIA, SINSAPORE A ND MALAYSIA<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN B~ Y THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE RT HON. WILLIAM4 JcMAHON, CHI, MP.<br />
ISTANA TPA" 7_ U, "', LAYSIA 14 Juno., 1972.<br />
yv intention, with yonr ap~ roval is to t:-. ke you fairly quickly<br />
through the communique which was issued at probably somewhere about<br />
two o'clock today, and wrhich has been agreed to .1. y the Governments of<br />
Malaysia and my own country after fairly full and dotailed discussions<br />
bet, 07cn Tun Razak and myscelf. if then subsequently you want to, by<br />
all means ask me questions. I'll want to give priority in the asking<br />
qf questions to members of the Malaysian rnress. So, if that is<br />
satisfactory to you, I'll carry o-n in the way I've just mentioned.<br />
i' Well, first of all, could I preface my remarks by saying<br />
something to you. I came up hore, first to Indonesia, then Singapore,<br />
and now Malaysia on what I t%-ermed initially a's a good-will mission.<br />
I wanted to make certain that the relation~ ships bo~ twoen Australia<br />
and the~ three countries I visited were based unon a sound fcoting and<br />
that we had their confidence and good-,, ill. I ar sure that as I go<br />
homne that objective has been achieved. Now, this gniodwill confidence<br />
and trust is not based solely on historical consilderations or an<br />
historical background. It'S based, to a large extent, on the fact<br />
that we all know that we have tn play our part in the future in trying'<br />
t%. o ensuro ocace and pros ority and progress iLn an area in which each<br />
of us lives. And we knew t" H. 7. t none of us none of" the four<br />
countries can -n -thdraw fromr It-he area, or withdraw fro,-m the<br />
obligation that we've got to our own people, and in co-operation, try<br />
to ensure the kind of oblectives that I Mentioned tro you a few<br />
moments ago.<br />
I could not have asked fo-r a better relatinnship with President<br />
Soeharto than I have. AXs ' owu, we were able to rqive Indonesia<br />
substantially increased defence and civil aid, for w,, hich they<br />
expressed their approval. 11nd I think we could take it that on most<br />
matters of mutual interert, there was a meeting of minds and'a<br />
coincidence of views. Eqiually , too, when I went to Sing-pore, I<br />
found exactly the same with Lee T.' uan Yew, who, is an old friend<br />
of mine one who I have known for a long time and regard not only as<br />
the groat Leader of his ow. kn c.-untry, but in a personal way as well.<br />
Again, the relationship could not have been better, and we had a<br />
common view on most of the problems that arose. / 2 </p>
<p>I think I can summarise his views in a statement that he made<br />
at a dinner that he gave for me. If you haven't got copies of it<br />
the members of the Kuala Lumpur press pleaso let me give you a<br />
copy, because it does show the strength of goodwill between the two<br />
countries and the way in which our views coincide. He said he's got<br />
faith and trust in the Five Power Arrangements: He wants them to be<br />
sustained. He wants tourism to develop between our two countries, and<br />
he knows that together we-must play our part in the development and<br />
progress of the South East Asian theatre.<br />
I'll just read it out our attitudes on South Vietnam are the<br />
same. Our attitudes to development of the South Asian countries are<br />
the same too. And what he does say is that the Five Power Defence<br />
Arrangements have received a degree of importance that over-shadows<br />
the other matters that we've discussed. He also says that the Dafence<br />
Arrangements of the Commonwealth Five Powers have provided continuing<br />
stability to an area important to us, the people who live in it, and<br />
perhaps to you in Australia, and there is no reason why we should<br />
not make further progress in regional co-operation to consolidate the<br />
present stability of the area. He also refers to a position that is<br />
exactly the same as ours relating to South Vietnam, and he expresses<br />
the view that when the American forces do withdraw and he hopes not<br />
in disgrace then the forces that are left behind can be allowed to<br />
sort out their future by themselves without external interference by<br />
force. That, of course, is a view that is shared by my own Government<br />
and by my own actions. We've clearly indicated where our heart and<br />
where our will lies.<br />
Now to come here, I want to say this too, and I want to say it<br />
frankly. I've known your Prime Minister for some time, I've known<br />
him again on a friendly, and I believe, a basis of complete trust<br />
between two people, and I could not have hoped for greater co-overation<br />
and goodwill that I have found here during the course of the last<br />
three days. Naturally enoug I talked to him when he came out to the<br />
airport to bring me into Kuala Lumpur. I have had dinner with him on<br />
two occasions, and I have had a long discussion with him on matters<br />
of mutual interest. For a large pa'rt, the discussions centred around<br />
what was happening in the Asian theatre.<br />
His pre-occupation, as with our pre-occupa tion, in international<br />
affairs, is what contribution could we make the people of goodwill,<br />
the people who regard themselves as friendly and co-operative<br />
neighbours what contribution we can make to the objectives that<br />
I've mentioned in relation to the other countries, and the objectives<br />
that Tiln Razak himself shares with the other three of us. But we also<br />
went over a wiete range of other matters. But,-first o-f all, know<br />
Tun Razak is very intereste' in the problems not only bijateral, but<br />
multilateral ones as well and he did raise with me the question cf<br />
the part that he took in the Kuala Lumpur Declaration, and his<br />
attitude towards the neutralisation of South-East Asia.<br />
For my part, after discussion with him and I think you can take<br />
it that this joint communique is a summary of my discussions with him<br />
of the occasions that I have mentioned I did confirm that the<br />
Malaysian Government's goal that South Fast Asia should be a zone of<br />
peace, freedom and neutrality, under effective international<br />
guarantees, is entirely consistent with the policies of his own<br />
Government. ./ 3 </p>
<p>We welcomed the declaration as a regional initiative directed<br />
towards peace and stability in the area. These were words that I<br />
believe we could generally say in paragraph eight that the Prime<br />
Ministers agreed that the common objectives of the two Governments<br />
was the creation of conditions of peace, security and independence<br />
in this area, in which the work of regional co-operation and national<br />
development can go forward.<br />
Then we come to paragraph nine, which, as far as the defence area<br />
is concerned, does, I think, clarify the relationships between the<br />
two countries. Again, I could not have asked that my discussions with<br />
him could have been any better. They were frank. They were free,<br />
and they were based upon the idea of mutual interest, goodwill, and<br />
a desire to co-operation.<br />
What we did agree was that the Five Power Arrangements provide a<br />
framework for close and effective co-operation, which is of value to<br />
both Governments. Then the Prime Minister for Malaysia assured me t<br />
that the continuing presence of Australian forces, both land and air,<br />
in Malaysia/ Singapore in the context cf the arrangements is welcomed<br />
by the Malaysian Government and contributes and confidence in the<br />
area. I go on to add the two Governments have no differences under the<br />
Five Power Arrangements, and I reaffirm that Australia would at all<br />
times honour its obligations. I think that most of you are pretty<br />
able and talented pressmen. I draw your attention to the whole of<br />
paragraph nine. But I think I can just repeat that the Prime minister<br />
of Malaysia assured me that the continuing presence of Australian<br />
forces, both land and air, in Malaysia/ Singapore, in the context of<br />
the arrangements, is welcomed by the Malaysian Governmnent and<br />
contributed to defence and confidence in the area.<br />
We then passed on I'm not giving you the actual sequence of<br />
events in which events occurred because this is not the actual<br />
sequence, but this is the ay in which they were drafted. We then<br />
went on to the question of the second Malaysia Plan and the<br />
desirability of having continuation of Australia's aid, which is<br />
making a steady and continuing contributinn to Malaysia's economic<br />
development. Various pr,.-jects were, in fact, mentioned, such as I won't go<br />
through thorn, but they are in paragraph II a~ nd you will see some<br />
of them there. We discussed a Pahang River basis study, and<br />
assistance to Mardi in pastoral and fodder research. I did<br />
subsequently arrange for one of my very senior officers who came<br />
with me -the second in command of our Dep~ artment of Trade and<br />
Industry -to discuss with three senior nfficers of the Malaysian<br />
administration, a wide range of matters that had been raised by the<br />
Malaysian Prime Minister with me. I thought it was better in these<br />
cases, where technical problems were involved, that the,, 6fficials<br />
should carry out the discussions.<br />
Then we referred to the question of the numbers of students who<br />
are visiting Australia, and we reaffirmed the strength of the<br />
friendship and goodwill between our two Governments and people. </p>
<p>4.<br />
All in all, therefore, I can only comment this way. I personally<br />
believe it was a successful mission. I know it was carried out with<br />
a maximum . of goodwill. I can repeat and these are the words of the<br />
Prime Minister of Malaysia himself, referring to the Five Power<br />
Arrangements that there are no problems between us, and I can<br />
specifically refer you to the paragraph that relates to the Asian<br />
theatre, and the ideals that the Malaysian Prime Minister has set<br />
himself and the goal he wants to achieve in the K~ uala Lumpur<br />
declaration. Have said all that, I now ask, and narticularly the Malaysian<br />
Press, if there are any questions you would like to ask me.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, I read this communique and I found there is<br />
nothing said regarding the problem of the Straits of Malacca...<br />
PM. The problem of what?<br />
Q. The problem of the Straits of Malacca, because this is a<br />
matter of concern to the Malaysian Government. So I would like<br />
to find out from you the Australian view or opinion on the matter.<br />
Pm. The problem of -, the Straits of tMalacca was not mentioned<br />
between myself and the Malaysian Prime Minister.<br />
Q. Sir, in what way can your country help the countries of this<br />
region achieve the objectives of neutralisation of South East<br />
Asia? What role can your country hope to play?<br />
Pm. I have to look at this Problem of neutralisation in the Asian<br />
context. And., as you know, we are not, and have not been, invited<br />
to join ASEAN but, as I see the concept, it means that the<br />
participating countries of course and at the moment they are<br />
only the Asiancountries of course would give up their bilateral<br />
arrangements and they would join together, whether it happens to<br />
be five or ten of the South East Asian countries or up to ten<br />
anyhow, and they would seek international guarantees by the super<br />
powers and by China.<br />
But, as yet, tho concept of neutralisation has not been<br />
defined. I said it is the statemce. nt that is hore this sets<br />
Out my Government's point of view and our attitude towards it.<br />
I think you will get a completecrystallisation oIf how it is in<br />
the relevant Paragraph there. Is that what you were seeking?<br />
Q. What I intended to ask is, in what way can your country<br />
contribute towards neutralisation or these objoctives?<br />
PM. I don't know at the moment what can he done because that's<br />
purely a hypothetical question. The goals, or the immediate<br />
intention of the ASEAN countries is to try and get a greater<br />
number of countries to co-ordinate their effort. And when<br />
they have done that and they don't expect this to happen for<br />
some time, probably two, probably three years then when they<br />
have got co-operation amongst the 01outh East Asian countries,<br />
themselves, they will ask at least the two super Dowers and the<br />
People's Republic of China to give effective international<br />
guarantees. </p>
<p>Whether they would ask us to be one of the quarantors, or to<br />
join with a group of other countries as a guarantor, is something<br />
that has not yet been raised. So I can't be any more precise on<br />
that aspect than I have been.<br />
Q. Sir, in this context, did you discuss the future relations<br />
with China and how China would come into this strategy on this<br />
neutralisation plan. In the context of this neutralisation, did<br />
you discuss future relations with China and how to go about it?<br />
PM. We discussed President Nixon's visit to Moscow and to Peking.<br />
We discussed the problem of effective guarantees by the Soviet,<br />
by the U. S. A. and by the People's Republic of China. We didn't<br />
go any further than that. But the Prime Minister did mention<br />
that in time perhaps it would be accepted as a fact of life that<br />
Australia was one of those who could bo regarded as a supporter<br />
of Malaysia, and our common approach to the problems of<br />
neutralisation as set out in the communique.<br />
Q. Could you tell us about policy towards China in the future?<br />
I mean when do you hope to normalise relations with China?<br />
PM. No. China is not one of the problems that I choose to say<br />
very much about. JWo've made it clear that, from our point of<br />
view, we are prepared to normalise our relationship with them and<br />
to move steadily towards recognition. But it is on two conditions.<br />
The first one is that we do not, and will not, desert Taiwan,<br />
and the second one is, of course, that Australia's national<br />
interests must be paramount in our thinking.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, speaking of defence in this area. In<br />
Canberra in June 1969, your predecessor said the defence of<br />
Malaya, not Malaysia, and Singapore was indivisible. Is that still<br />
the Australian Government's position?<br />
PM. Let me say this. I am not going back over the past, and I've<br />
made it as a rule, as you should know, that I will not discuss<br />
statements that have been made by my predecessor in office.<br />
The Five Power Arrangements so far as I and my Government<br />
are concerned, cover, in terms of consultation, both East, West,<br />
and East Malaysia. The obligation to consult is one that we would<br />
recognise covering Malaysia.<br />
Q. ( Inaudible only a couple of words)<br />
PH. Well, I'm talkingnow only against the Malaysian background.<br />
Of course it covers Singapore too. But you asked your question<br />
specifically relating to East and West Malaysia.<br />
Q. Sir, paragraph nine. The words at the top of page three<br />
" and contributed to the defence and confidence of the area". Do<br />
you regard this as a complete deviation of Prime Ministerial<br />
approval, i. e. Malaysian Prime Ministerial approval, of the<br />
official briefing given us that the Malaysians are not overly<br />
concerned about the withdrawal of the presence of land forces? / 6 </p>
<p>6.<br />
PM, I would never come into that sort of a discussion overseas,<br />
and, if I did, the ones who would resent it most bitterly would<br />
be the Australian press and media backc home.<br />
I think it is unforgiveable for any member of the Government<br />
to raise political, or to * iiscuss political matters of this kind<br />
openly when he is the quest of another Government. But, to put<br />
it absolutely clearly and. beyond any doubt, that is the<br />
arrangement I have made on behalf of Australia with the Prime<br />
Minister of Mlalaysia.<br />
It is a communique issued at the top, and carries the full<br />
authority of the two Governments.<br />
Q. Pir. Prime Minister, could I -ask when was it dLacidecd to issue,<br />
a communique here and why there was no similar communique issued<br />
in Singapore?<br />
Pm. I wanted it issued because I thouaht -that so much confusion<br />
has been caused in the Australian press, that it was highly<br />
desirable that our attitudes should be clarified, and they shouild<br />
be definitive and on paper. That was the reason why I felt it<br />
was better that it should be done.<br />
Q. Sir, you said before that the things which and didn't<br />
necessarily appear in the order in which they appear here.<br />
Could you tell us when you had your discussions with the<br />
Malaysian Prime Minister concerning the Five Power Defence<br />
Arrangements.<br />
Pm. I won't go into that because, quitc frankly, I've talked<br />
to him each time I've met him on it. So its been running<br />
discussion since I've boen here. I couldn't identify when each<br />
mlatter was raised. We continued t1-he discussion when it was<br />
finalised, hut it's gone on during the whole of the time I have<br />
been here.<br />
A. Did you discuss th.-t in your first talks?<br />
PM. Which one is this?.-Five Power. Yes, but not in the<br />
definitive sense in which it is here. But I did discuss it with<br />
him.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister. Could I just clarify that? Did you<br />
contact the Prime Minister of Malaysia on this matter of the<br />
Five Power Agreement following the-briefing that was given to<br />
the Australian press here on the first day of our visit?<br />
PM. Following which briefing?<br />
Q. Following the briefing the Australian press was given by the<br />
Foreign Ministry. On Monday morning, the Australian press party<br />
here was given a briefing by the Foreign M-. inistry.<br />
PM. By one member of the foreign office.<br />
Q. Yes. The Deputy Sccretary of the foreign office. On<br />
Monday afternoon we received word that you, through Mr. Rowland,<br />
had been in touch with the Prime Minister, and that the Prime<br />
Minister had asked. thiat he would prefer the statement to be<br />
made from the foreign office. Did you contact the Prime Minister<br />
that afternoon on this mat1-ter? _/ 7 </p>
<p>PM. No. I didn't contact the Prime Mirnister that afternoon. You<br />
ask me did I contact the Prime Ministor. ' go, I did not.<br />
Also tho statement that is contained rel~ ating the field of<br />
defence was not in the specific tsrms in which it is contained<br />
here, but in general terms as discussed in my first meeting with<br />
them.<br />
Q. Sir, could you outline for us the promise on which the<br />
Australian military commitment to Malaysia and Singapore was<br />
based?<br />
P. M4. The premise.<br />
Q. The principal premise on which the commitment was based?<br />
PM. If somebody could give me a copy of the memorandum issues<br />
I would want to quote exactly I am sorry. What<br />
You want is what is the foundation, what is the rason dletre.<br />
What I have said about the top of page throe that it is<br />
welccmed by the Malaysian Government and contributes to defence<br />
and confidence in that area. And I will also find out for you,<br />
because wev got about four different principles set out<br />
relating to Five Power Arrangements. I can get those for you and<br />
I can let you have them as soon as this conference is over.<br />
0. What I really wanted to know, Sir, was whether the pro-mise<br />
was still that we, Australia, has its forces in thesetwo countries<br />
because these two countries want Australian forces there, or is it<br />
some other reason.<br />
Pm. These are the reasons set out here as agreed to by the Prime<br />
Minister of Malaysia and myself as the reason by<br />
To set out the last four lines, the Prima Minister of Malaysia<br />
assured the Prime Minister of Australia that the continuing<br />
presence of Australian forces, both land and air, in M. alaysia/<br />
Singapore in the context of the arrangements is welcomed by the<br />
Malaysian Government and contributes to defence and confidence<br />
in that area. That is the premise on which it is based.<br />
Q. Prime Minister Meyer, ABC.<br />
By that area do you moan Australia. To what extent does it<br />
contribute to the defence and confidence of Australia.<br />
PM. Well, if you read it, you will see that in Malaysia/<br />
Singapore in the context of the arrangements is welcomed and<br />
contributes to defence and confidence~ in that area. The words<br />
are these clear enough.<br />
Q. Sir, to put the question again and perhaps re-phrase it.<br />
From the Australian view the presence of Australian troops here.<br />
On what premise is that based? The question is what Mr. Reese<br />
was trying to get at.? And does this in any way contribute to the<br />
defence of Australia and the confidence in that area?<br />
PM. What we are aiming at in this is clear enough and so far as<br />
tho Five Power Arrangements are concerned they are making for<br />
Australia's contribution to the defence and security of, using<br />
the words that are there, Malaysia/ Sinaapore, in the context of<br />
the Vjv P' Arraign-mants. ' 8 </p>
<p>I take it no further than that, other that it is our objective,<br />
that happens to be the~ objective too of the other four countries<br />
or powers under the Five Power Arrangements, that we want peace<br />
and security. We believe that it will be a contribution to the<br />
peace and security here, and for that reason we strongly support<br />
it and are taking concrete action of a kind such as standing our<br />
forces here, giving military and civil rai~ d as our contribution<br />
to those objectives.<br />
Q. Well, Sir, do you still regard the positioning of Australian<br />
forces here as being part of a forward defence concept of<br />
Australia and, if the Five Power Arrangements are no longer<br />
considered necessary by the member Governments, what will be<br />
your attitude then?<br />
PM. If the governments we are up here and we have an<br />
indefinite commitment to stay here. If there~ were... and I<br />
Would be raising now a very hypothetical question and one that<br />
frankly because of the communique that is being issued and<br />
the precision with which it is being expressed shows the<br />
attitude of the Malaysian Government and what they feel about<br />
the presence of forces in the area. ' That shows the present<br />
position. If they change their minds, that is a matter for<br />
them, and we have made it clear again and again that if they<br />
said that they did not want our forces to remain of course that<br />
would terminate it. I want you toi understand this, I don' t<br />
want to get irnvolved in semantics about this, but his speaks for<br />
itself. It is a document of goodwill and of intention, and if<br />
you read the words carefully, I think that you can tak~ e it that<br />
goodwill in our intentions to assist them not only in their<br />
development, not only in sustaining confidence, but in helping<br />
them to build up their own defences and to be -ible to develop<br />
their own sense of security and to look after themselves.<br />
Q. Sir if I could perhaps put one last question<br />
PM. No...<br />
MR. GAUL Just two last questions. It's already gone on for more than<br />
thirty minutes.<br />
PM. I don't mind thcir going on, but I<br />
Q. Sir, did you fi-nd at any times an indication on the part<br />
of Malaysians Prime Minister that for discussing more serious<br />
issues like China and neutralisation after the elections in<br />
Australia is over so that they will know who will be in the<br />
position<br />
PM. I think I have already given an answer to that. First of all<br />
I would not relate in detail what discussion took place .' etwee-n<br />
myself and the Malaysian Prime Minister except to the extent that<br />
it was in the communique. But what I can assure you of is this.<br />
I think of him as a friend, and the warmth and goodwill seems<br />
to move from him to my own country and from him to the people<br />
of Australia, and I think the same goes for the Deputy Prime<br />
Minister, too. </p>
<p>Q. Indistinguishabhle.<br />
Pill. Yes. Its now a long time and I can't elaborate on that. I<br />
would refer to that in the sense as to what was said by Mr. Lce<br />
Kuan Yew, the Singaporean Prime Minister. I can't elaborate on it<br />
other than that the objectives of his Go-, vernment are the same<br />
as ours and we want South Vietnam and for that -matter the other<br />
countries Laos and Cambodia, to(-be able to-. live In peace free<br />
from external agcression.<br />
Q. Sir, do you detect that noutralisation, Palaysia's intere: st<br />
in neutralisati " on, has diminished its interest in the Five Power<br />
Airrangements?<br />
Pm. No.<br />
Q. Sir, d o you want yoursel1f -a: nd your Governimnt, in the event<br />
of proven substantial external assistance ' f-r Malaysia's<br />
continuing insurgancy p~ roblem with the. . Malayan Communist party<br />
if this were a proved -Fact in tk-he future would you consider it<br />
a reason for consu7lt ti c-. n under the Five Power Agreemenint if agreed<br />
and if necessary Jfor intervention.<br />
P. You are putting too big a hypothce-tical question to mne. 1-T<br />
have our obligations under the Five Power , rrangement, which we<br />
will koeep, findl they are in obligation to consult under cortain<br />
circumstances. I can assur-e you and I h-nvo set this out in the<br />
communiquo th-1l -e'live, up to our oblig~ ation and that is<br />
understood and -iccept-d by the Ma lays ian Go-. vernmont.<br />
Q. Sir, I don't want to quote but 1 don't want to bring in<br />
internal Australian politics..*., but I mean it is a matter of<br />
substance to Mlalaysiai, when the-Deput ' y Loadcr of the Labor<br />
Opposition was through here, the Shadow Minister of Defence, he<br />
ruled out all these conditions categorically. Do you imake the<br />
same exemotion? I<br />
Pm. Again I nave to inform You that I will not enter into<br />
controversy with any other person, any other Australian Member of<br />
Parliament whi lst am overseas. You have got to listo-p to what<br />
t-he Deputy Leader of the Opposition said and judge him on what<br />
he says and what hco has sublsoquentlyI. said, and I h-ope mpost of<br />
you have see, n titel comment that lhe made on the IADS and'the<br />
Australian Air Force component as reported in this morning's<br />
Malaysian newspaPers.<br />
Q. SiJr, this referonce to the Ku&amp; la Lumpur Jaclaration. Would<br />
this be a'far more nc-sitive reaction of Australia than before?<br />
Pm. It may be a little more concrete, but it was cleared with Mr.<br />
Bowen and at least still the paragraphs himvo been drafted by<br />
him the stateme~ nt he made in our own House on the<br />
telephone about three timesthis morning, I could not give you the<br />
precise time. </p>
