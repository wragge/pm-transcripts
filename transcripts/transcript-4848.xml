FOR PRESS 13 OCTOBER 1978<br />
LEVIES ON CATTLE PRODUCERS<br />
The Prime Minister today replied to a request from the Premier<br />
of New South Wales, Mr Wran, not to increase levy contributions<br />
paid by cattle producers towards the cost of animal disease<br />
eradication programmes.<br />
The Government has clearly stated that it would not increase<br />
charges at this stage, and would ensure that producers had<br />
the opportunity to recover from the recent recession in the<br />
industry before the matter was looked at again.<br />
This Government has provided substantial assistance to producers<br />
to alleviate personal hardship in the industry during the recent<br />
industry recession. The beef industry incentive payments<br />
scheme has provided direct cash payments to producers who have<br />
carried out recognised disease control or husbandry procedures<br />
beteen 23 September 1977 and 22 September 1978.<br />
Total payments to producers under this programme already exceed<br />
$ 100 million. A total of $ 28 million in concessional carry-on<br />
loans under the rural adjustement scheme was made available to<br />
beef producers during 1976/ 77 and 1977/ 78, and further assistance<br />
is available in 1978/ 79.<br />
To supplement this direct income support, the meat export<br />
inspection charge was suspended from 1 March 1976 with an<br />
estimated saving to producers of $ 28 million in 1977/ 78 alone.<br />
In conjunction with the Queensland Government a moratorium has<br />
been agreed on for loan repayments by Brigalow Lands settlers,<br />
according to need, for an average of 2 years. The Commonwealth<br />
Government has also offered to extend the Queensland Government's term<br />
for repayment of Commonwealth loans by a further 7 years, on the<br />
expectation that a similar extension will be offered to the<br />
settlers. The Commonwealth Government has offered to the States<br />
on a cost-sharing basis a programme of financial assistance<br />
to cattle producers in Northern Australia affected by bluetongue<br />
virus control measures.<br />
The Government has also taken a number of steps to improve<br />
beef marketing. Up to $ 6 million will 1'. e provided towards the<br />
capital cost of implementing carcass classification in cattle<br />
meat chains and the implications of weight and class selling<br />
for cattle, and of possible price stabilisation schemes are<br />
being examined. The Prices Justification Tribunal is examining<br />
costs and margins at every stage of beef marketing, and its<br />
report will provide a valuable insight into beef marketing costs.<br />
./ 2 </p>
<p>In respect of export markets, the Government has repeatedly<br />
made representations at the highest level to obtain access to<br />
traditional markets which impose quota restrictions on<br />
Australian beef. The recent increase in the permitted level<br />
of 1978 U. S. beef imports is an encouraging development.<br />
Special efforts are being made to stimulate the exports of meat<br />
to the Middle East.<br />
These measures represent a very substantial programme of<br />
Government support for the beef industry, and a recognition of<br />
the problems faced by producers over the past few years.<br />
The Prime Minister advised the Premier that he should appreciate<br />
that the Government is very conscious of the need for producers<br />
to recover from the recession in the industry, and should know<br />
full well that it had no intention of increasing the levies<br />
referred to in his telex message while producers are still<br />
recovering from those difficult years.<br />
