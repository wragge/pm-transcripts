I<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DEFAMATION ACTION AGAINST SENATOR BAUME<br />
My solicitors yesterday commenced proceedings for defamation against Senator Michael<br />
Baume. A statement of claim lodged with the NSW Supreme Court registry sets out the basis for<br />
this action.<br />
For more than eight months, Senator Baume has in an organiscd way raised untrue<br />
allegations against me in the Senate under Parliamentary privilege.<br />
Denied such privilege over the New Year period, in a radio interview in Melbourne<br />
Senator Baumc falsely accused me of putting my personal financial interests ahead of the<br />
interests of the nation when I delivered the One Nation statement in February last year.<br />
Senator Baume accused me of introducing a development allowance scheme In the One<br />
Nation package after I had made a private investment so as to obtain substantial tax<br />
benefits for a company in which I have an interest. Senator Baume stated as a matter of<br />
fact that a company in which I have a purely financial interest applied for such benefits.<br />
This is untrue and totally without foundation. No such application was ever proposed or<br />
made. No more serious allegation can be made of a Prime Minister than that he broke the<br />
obligations of his office and introduced a policy so as to obtain for himself a private<br />
financial bcnefit.<br />
In a weak public defence of his actions today, Senator Baume is reported to have said: " I<br />
think it's in the Australian public's best interests to know what the facts are."<br />
Senator Baunic has made defamatory allegations about me without any basis in fact. </p>
<p>TEL: 22. Jan. 93 16: 31 No. 011 P. 02/ 02<br />
The making of defamatory allegations by any person against another in public life does<br />
not of itself render such allegationls to be matters of public interest.<br />
Statements which are untrue, without basis, or which are defamatory are not removcd<br />
from the reach of the law simply because they are said of and about a person in public life.<br />
