SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME AUSTRALIA GRADUATION CEREMONY<br />
PERTH TUESDAY, 8 MARCH 1.994<br />
It is a great pleasure to be here tonight.<br />
I suspect that until you see a graduation ceremony you<br />
haven't fully appreciated what education means to people.<br />
I mean you don't very often see the sort of general and<br />
unmitigated happiness you see on people's faces here.<br />
You don't see all that evidence of fulfilment and hope in<br />
one room very O~ ften.<br />
For me, being with you this evening is also a pleasure,*<br />
because I missed my own graduation ceremony.<br />
Not that I didn't have a classical education but it was in<br />
the Australian Labor Party.<br />
Apart from a few degrees in economics, it afforded me a Ph. D<br />
in Varieties of Human Behaviour.<br />
Tn fact, of all the Primp Ministers since the 1940s, with<br />
the exception of John McEwen, who was in the job for just a<br />
few days, I am the only one not to have had a university<br />
education. My academic education ended at the age of seventeen.<br />
I am quite sure that the great majority of people from my<br />
background in those years would not have expected to set<br />
foot in a university in their lifetimes.<br />
It was beyond reach -or at least seemed to be.<br />
It is true that with application and intelligence the sons<br />
and daughters of working people aQ get there.<br />
But not many of them. The majority simply couldn't afford<br />
it. And there were not many universities.<br />
However, the physical limits were not the only impediment,<br />
nor perhaps the most important one. </p>
<p>There was a psychological obstacle. A university education<br />
was beyond the reach of our social expectatiohs.<br />
It required young people to think beyond their<br />
circumstances, beyond the patterns of life in their families<br />
and communities. It meant very often leaving those families<br />
and communities.<br />
It required a leap of the imagination which most of us could<br />
not make.<br />
Most did not expect to go to university or even finish<br />
secondary school indeed, just a decade ago only three in<br />
ten Australians were finishing secondary school. That is in<br />
1984.<br />
And so long as jobs were available we were not very<br />
concerned. In the 1950s and 1960s jobs were available: not particularly<br />
interesting jobs but jobs. Jobs like the one I took, aged<br />
fiftaon. AA nlrk in thp Svdnpv Cnntv Cominil.<br />

All over the world in modern economies like this one, the<br />
old low-skill jobs are going. All over the world the story<br />
is education and training.<br />
Personal opportunities depend on it. The success of nations<br />
depends on it.<br />
Now, I suspect that it is customary for politicians making<br />
these addresses to speak on one of two or three themes<br />
themes from which some lesson can be learned to guide you<br />
through your lives.<br />
For instance, I could tell you that while your formal<br />
education is a very good thing, your real education is about<br />
to begin in life, in work, in the school of hard knocks.<br />
I could tell you there is no substitute for experience.<br />
Or I could tell you that we're delighted to see you all<br />
graduating today at this lovely new university but, in<br />
all modesty, you owe it to us, for really we made it all<br />
possible. I intend to spare you a speech on these themes today, but<br />
there is a little truth in both of them.<br />
On the second one, I cannot refrain from saying that my<br />
pleasure in seeing these young people graduate today is<br />
appreciably greater because I know that, in the course of<br />
the last decade, tens of thousands of young Australians have<br />
been given an opportunity to study and earn degrees at new<br />
universities and colleges. </p>
<p>Since the 1980s, the equivalent of twenty major universities<br />
have been added to the system by the Commonwealth Government<br />
Commonwealth Labor Government.<br />
This expansion of our tertiary education has not only<br />
delivered new opportunities to countless individuals, but it<br />
has made it possible for people to get higher education<br />
without leaving their communities.<br />
My pleasure is greater because the Government, and<br />
particularly John Dawkins, played a part in it. If you<br />
like, the milestone you reached today is something of a<br />
milestone for us as well.<br />
Where people from working class suburbs and poorer ru~ ral<br />
areas not so long ago never imagined that their children<br />
might go to university, it is now one of their life options.<br />
The lesson is: look what can flow from engagement in public<br />
life, look what this democracy can do, look how we have it<br />
in our power to change.<br />
Look how, like the graduates here today, we can imagine<br />
something better and turn it to reality. We can do it as<br />
individuals, as communities and as a nation.<br />
As for the first of the familiar themes it is true that<br />
the very best of formal education is still no substitute for<br />
life lived. It is true that in this life one is constantly<br />
learning. But no one today would stand here now and discount the need<br />
for a formal education. The fact is young Australians need<br />
one as never before more than one, because it is a<br />
statistical certainty that the majority of people graduating<br />
today will be re-trained at least once and probably twice in<br />
their lives.<br />
So what is the lesson? Be open to change. Believe in your<br />
capacities to understand the contemporary world and<br />
confront the challenges. Embrace the future, don't retreat<br />
from it.<br />
Which leads me to a third cliche of these addresses: it is<br />
to say that in your hands the future of Australia lies.<br />
I suspect this has most often been said by politicians who<br />
didn't care to have the future in fheir hands.<br />
It is a half-truth.<br />
It is obviously true that the future depends on young<br />
Australians, but I have to tell you my generation is not<br />
quite ready to hand over responsibility.<br />
It is my generation on whom the responsibility falls: we<br />
hold the instruments of power in the national parliament,<br />
in the states, in the community. </p>
<p>And your generation should judge us all by the same<br />
criteria: Are we prepared to confront the necessities which<br />
face us? Are we prepared to make over those elements of our<br />
national life which need making over?<br />
Or are we prepared to let things drift?<br />
The temptation in politics is alwys to let things drift.<br />
It is very easy to decide to play safe and manage your way<br />
through. It is much harder to imagine reforms, set them as goals and<br />
go for them and trust that the momentum which comes from<br />
the pursuit will carry you through.<br />
It is also easy to become preoccupied with the day to day<br />
business of politics warding of f aggressors, pursuing a<br />
more potent media profile, handling the little crises which<br />
dog all democratic governments.<br />
Sometimes political life is a bit like being inside a<br />
pinball machine: with balls whizzing around all over the<br />
place, you can find yourself with your eyes closed and your<br />
hands over your head adopting a crouch as a permanent<br />
political position.<br />
You can preoccupy yourself with every missile, with every<br />
seeming necessity, with every process, with every ritual and<br />
think you're playing the game, yet forget that the game is<br />
ultimately about getting done what has to be done.<br />
The lesson is: power is for using. It is not to be wasted<br />
or feared or despised. It is to be used to deliver our<br />
democratic ambitions in my case, our gnnial democratic<br />
ambitions. Which brings me to MX theme for tonight.<br />
You will have heard, I'm sure I sincerely hn~ you have<br />
heard those terms which have become watchwords of the<br />
Australian economy, and for that matter, Australian society.<br />
I mean words like " competitive", " internationally<br />
competitive" -" an internationally competitive economy"<br />
You will have heard a lot of talk about " productivity".<br />
These were the words which emerged to describe our economic<br />
ambitions in the 1980s. In the 1990s, we can safely say,<br />
they describe much more of the reality.<br />
What you might have heard less frequently are the words<br />
which describe our Anial ambitions.<br />
Yet we pursued them with equal energy. We were determined<br />
from the start to make the Australian economy<br />
internationally competitive, yet no less determined to see </p>
<p>that the principles of a competitive economy did rnot flow<br />
over, as it has in some countries, into a creed of<br />
selfishness, or a justification for abandoning our<br />
traditions of social fairness.<br />
Because if you abandon these, you abandon opportunity and<br />
thereby abandon talent. And you abandon the social cohesion<br />
on which national success depends.<br />
In the nineties, I think it is essential that we maintain<br />
the momentum of our economic reform while also maintaining<br />
our determination to see Australia emerge as one of the<br />
truly advanced social democracies of the world.<br />
This was our reputation at the end of the last century. I<br />
have absolutely no doubt that it can be our repaliit. y at the<br />
end of this century.<br />
We can do it through continuing to make our economy and our<br />
federation more creative and efficient, and at each step in<br />
that process ensuring that the benefits flow to the whole of<br />
the country and all of the people: making the safety net of<br />
social services more effective and sophisticated, extending<br />
the reach of opportunity and assistance to communities and<br />
regions which have been denied them.<br />
I am talking about dealing everyone into national recovery<br />
and national prosperity and making everyone feel part of<br />
the national equation.<br />
There is no intellectual copyright in political life only<br />
the satisfaction which comes from having persuaded the other<br />
side of politics to one's own view.<br />
So it is deeply satisfying, not to say flattering, to hear<br />
Dr Hewson talking about remaking Liberal Party policy into<br />
something more socially " inclusive" in other words<br />
something rather like L. AQnr Party policy.<br />
For, in fact, it will be no bad thing if there emerges a<br />
general consensus on the need to share in Australia's<br />
future, because there are extraordinary opportunities for<br />
Australia in the modern world most particularly in modern<br />
Asia. " Asia" is another word you hear a lot of these days, and<br />
often in the context of " competitiveness" and<br />
" productivity".<br />
For Asia does set us these same economic imperatives: and<br />
meeting them successfully translates into words like<br />
" opportunity" unrp( rPcented opportunity to build a rich,<br />
creative, complex society and set up generations of<br />
Australians in the twenty-first century.<br />
The truth is we have never been in this situation before:<br />
riot with a chance to make it on our own, in our own region,<br />
by our own genius and endeavour. </p>
<p>But it is essential that in doing this we make sure that<br />
these opportunities the chance to benefit and the chance<br />
to contribute are extended to Australians wherever they<br />
come from and whatever their social and economic<br />
circumstances may now be.<br />
The economic and the social are not separate categories.<br />
The major issue now facing us, long-term unemployment, falls<br />
into both.<br />
We have to tackle long-term unemployment for reasons of<br />
social equity,-for reasons of compassion, for the reason<br />
that we will never be able to say that we have succeeded as<br />
a nation so long as we have several hundred thousand men and<br />
women and their families unable to find work, and with it<br />
dignity and hope.<br />
But it also has to be understood that unemployment has<br />
economic costs as well: we lose the productive output that<br />
they would otherwise create, we lose their talent and<br />
energy. And we lose again, because we need to support them<br />
when they might be supporting themselves.<br />
Now there are some people who will say that the way to make<br />
Australia more competitive is to reduce wages. They believe<br />
that a less equal society is a more efficient one because<br />
the labour market is more competitive. For which read<br />
more desperate, more " do or die".<br />
This is the path that some countries chose in the 1980s.<br />
It is emphatically the wrong one for Australia.<br />
The human and social cost of privation and uncertainty is<br />
too high. The cost of inequalities to efficiency and<br />
cohesion is too high. The cost to Australian ambitions to<br />
our Sense of what it means to be Australian is too high.<br />
In my view it would betray not just our century-old<br />
traditions of social justice, but all we have done in the<br />
past decade to make Australia a country which can profitably<br />
make its way in the world.<br />
The acceptance of a low wage society would be to deny our<br />
capacity to improve. It conveniently takes the pressure of f<br />
our efforts to create a better country here a low wage<br />
society for instance, has less need to provide educational<br />
opportunity for all.<br />
The alternative the only alternative is to improve<br />
productivity: improve the quality of everything we do from<br />
the workplace to the boardroom, our farms, our schools,<br />
colleges and universities, in government, be it local. State<br />
or Commonwealth. </p>
<p>And this is where you come in the graduates here tonight<br />
and their families.<br />
This is where every Australian comes in.<br />
Higher levels of productivity are only possible with high<br />
quality human resources high quality people.<br />
If we are going to be competitive, we need a skilled, highly<br />
educated population.<br />
The future belongs to societies that organise themselves for<br />
learning. What we know and what we can do now holds the key<br />
to our economic success, just as our command of natural<br />
resources once did.<br />
Because we are so rich in natural resources, it has often<br />
been said that for much of our history we have tended to<br />
believe that our country would always deliver us. Now there<br />
is no question that we have to deliver our country.<br />
Our mining and pastoral industries, like the great freedoms<br />
which Australia's space and environment provides, will<br />
continue to enrich us.<br />
But only if we match it with human creativity, engagement<br />
and ideas. Only if we do things and make things which in<br />
one way or another wear the badge of Australian learning,<br />
imagination, confidence and endeavour.<br />
As I said, that is where you come in.<br />
Where once the great majority of Australians left school to<br />
do work that required few skills and little knowledge, and<br />
had no reason to expect that they would ever need them;<br />
where once it could be safely said that the best school was<br />
the school of experience, now the acquisition of skills and<br />
knowledge must be inseparable from that experience.<br />
It therefore must be the duty of my generation, and<br />
especially the duty of those of us in positions of power, to<br />
deliver to the generation of people represented by those who<br />
graduated here tonight educational systems which make<br />
learning part of our national life part of the experience<br />
of all Australians.<br />
I said a moment ago that these remarks applied not just to<br />
the new graduates, but to their families.<br />
And of course it is true. The most fundamental learning<br />
begins with them: it is where our attitudes are shaped, our<br />
aspirations and expectations formed.<br />
We get our approach to learning from our families. They can<br />
teach the value of work and faith in the future. They can<br />
teach us the value of ourselves and others.<br />
They can also fail to do these things. </p>
<p>8<br />
But when they do them, they do for Australia everything good<br />
governments strive to do. I mean they provide security<br />
nets, education, health care, cohesion, certainty, identity,<br />
ambition. And the truth is, they do it so much hZtt~ than<br />
governments. It would be inappropriate to conclude this speech without<br />
saying something abo~ ut Notre Daime Univel3ity. The le s I<br />
can say is how impressed I am.<br />
Impressed, yet not so terribly surprised. When we are<br />
talking about extending educational opportunity to everyone,<br />
we are talking about extending human dignity. I am very<br />
well aware of just how powerful a motive this is in Catholic<br />
education. And so long as I am in the Australian Labor<br />
Party, it is quite impossible to forget it.<br />
I began by talking about how opportunities for tertiary<br />
education were largely denied to most Australians in the<br />
days when I was growing up. The great change which has come<br />
over our education system since then has been reflected in<br />
virtually every element of Australia's life.<br />
Those new educational opportunities for people of working<br />
class backgrounds were vital in the transformation of the<br />
union movement and the Labor movement in general. They were<br />
vital to a generation of migrants and their children. They<br />
were vital for women. They have been vital for business and<br />
the public service.<br />
The confidence and capacity to transform ourselves as an<br />
economy and a society in this last decade has been<br />
substantially derived from the transformation in our<br />
education system.<br />
It seems to me that in the 1980s, for the first time in our<br />
history, Australians had the confidence to take on the<br />
world. That has been the task of my generation. It will<br />
also be yours.<br />
In this, the education you have had here at Notre Dame will<br />
serve you well but as an old De La Salle boy, and a Labor<br />
Party man, let me tell you that while education is essential<br />
to your lives, and always will be, there is no substitute<br />
for faith.<br />
That's my lesson: believe in yourselves, believe in your<br />
generation, believe in your ideals, believe in your country.<br />
Keep the faith. </p>
