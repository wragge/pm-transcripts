    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am delighted to launch a new Australian Government program aimed at supporting high standards of governance in Pacific states.</p>
<p>The $6 million Pacific Governance Support Programme will fund activities designed to develop public sector expertise in Pacific states, build institutional capacity and strengthen regional approaches to shared problems.</p>
<p>Twenty-one activities will be funded under the program in 2004-05 including measures to improve maritime and aviation security, public sector capacity, financial institutions, electoral processes and judicial administration.</p>
<p>Australia recognises that good governance is vital to the future stability and prosperity of the Pacific region.  We are already working with Pacific nations on a range of measures aimed at improving governance and strengthening institutions in the region.</p>
<p>This new program will enhance the opportunity for linkages between Australian government agencies and their Pacific counterparts so that networks can be established and expertise shared. It will be a practical contribution to the Pacific Plan which Pacific leaders have agreed will be developed.</p>
<p>This collaboration may be in areas such as personnel exchanges, training programs, technical assistance or policy research. Activities may be short term or form part of multi-year projects.</p>
<p>The program will be managed by the Australian Government's agency for international development, AusAID.</p>
<p>A list of activities and Commonwealth agencies taking part in the Pacific Governance Support Program in 2004-05 is attached.</p>
