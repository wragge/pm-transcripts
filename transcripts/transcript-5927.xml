ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The significant tax cuts announced in the budget would not<br />
have been possible had the Government not taken successful<br />
action against contrived and artifical tax avoidance and<br />
evasion schemes. Those tax cuts will be of very great benefit<br />
to all Australians, and in particular, to families.<br />
From 1 November, Australians will be able to earn $ 400<br />
more before any taxation is levied, raising the tax free<br />
threshold-to $ 4,595. In addition, the standard rate of<br />
income tax, that is, the rate of tax that most people pay<br />
on incomes above $ 4,595, is to be cut from 32 cents in the<br />
dollar to 30 cents in the dollar. And the income level at<br />
which the 46 cents in the dollar tax rate applies to each<br />
additional dollar is t. be. increased 1 from just under $ 18, 000 -to<br />
$ 19,500. This will make sure that those on average weekly<br />
earnings will not have to pay more than 30 cents in the<br />
dollar, over the year.<br />
Those personal income tax benefits will be supplemented<br />
significantly by the introduction of a tax rebate on housing<br />
mortgage Interest payments of over 10% on a principal home.<br />
This measure will apply to the first $ 60,000 of a housing<br />
loan. It will be available to all Austkalians paying off<br />
a house, not just people who have bought their first home<br />
in the last five years and who are already being helped by<br />
the housing measures we introduced last March.<br />
In addition, single income families with children will have<br />
their tax payments further reduced as a * result of more<br />
generous spouse rebates and sole parent .* rebates, and all<br />
families will be helped by an increase in family allowances.<br />
These initiatives will be worth $ 17 to $ 18 a week for a single<br />
income Australian family earning $ 300 a week with two children,<br />
and a mortgage of say, $ 25,000. That is a fairly typical situation.<br />
That is a considerable increase in spending power and is the<br />
equivalent of a before tax pay rise of $ 25 or $ 26. a week.<br />
On top of all this, small investors will be helped by a tax<br />
rebate at the standard rate of tax on up to $ 1,000 of<br />
dividends for resident companies. This is the first time this<br />
tax concession has been introduced and it is an important<br />
initiative to help businesses as well as Australian investors.<br />
All this is going to help all Australians enormously at a time<br />
when help is most needed. ./ 2 </p>

This sort of budget would not have been possible had we<br />
not shown great resolve over recent years to 5taimp out<br />
tax avoidance and evasion schemes. And more recently,<br />
. determination through legislation we have introduced<br />
into Parliament to recover company income taxes owing<br />
to vs but evaded by bottom-of-the-harbour schemes.<br />
For the first time in many years, the Commissioner of<br />
Taxation said it will not be necessary to make allowance<br />
in tax revenue estimates in the budget for revenue loss<br />
through tax avoidance.<br />
Putting aside the extra revenue we received from action<br />
against tax avoidance and tax evasion, tax collections<br />
will be lower in real terms this year, in larle part<br />
because of the tax cuts. For several years, there has<br />
been a fiercely fought contest between those few people<br />
who have evaded and avoided pay/ ing -taxes, and the Governm~ ent,<br />
which is determined that all Australians will pay their fair<br />
share of the tax burde-n. The Government is now winning that<br />
contest. A responsible govern-mentL which represents all Australians<br />
must act with total determination to stamp out practices<br />
such as bo-ttom-of-the-harbour schemes and to recover what<br />
is due. This is exactly what the Government has done, and<br />
as a result, taxpayers generally will be starting to feel<br />
the benefits because the tax cuts we have introduced in<br />
the laut budget will flow through to tax payers generally<br />
from November 1 this year. This would not have been possible<br />
to the same extent if if had not been for the action that<br />
John Howard has taken over the last few years in relation<br />
to tax avoidance and tax evasion. </p>
