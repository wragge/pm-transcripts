VISIT TO BHP, SHANGHAI, CHINA<br />
Saturday 29 March 1997<br />

J. Prime Minister, how impqrwat is it that Austfalia becom~ e involved inthis<br />
8azing cconomnic boorn?<br />
PM: Well this is probably the pst rapidly industrialising part of th world.<br />
It is certaihly thd most rapidly industialising part of China. That in a<br />
sense says it all. If Australia is to be relevant in this part of the world<br />
then obviously it has to be part of the economic action. BR? clearly is<br />
and many other Australian companies arc and I congratulate the men and<br />
women of Australian business who have invested in this extmraodinary<br />
economic phenomenon.<br />
J: Seeing it first hand, have you been astounded?<br />
PM: The visual impact of this intense industrialisation and construction is<br />
quite amazing. You can read about something like that To see so wauy<br />
buildiip, so many mates, so much activity,' to drive along a road that<br />
didn't exist four years ago and be told that every building on either side<br />
of t road is less'than 3 years old, It's quite extraordinary.<br />

PM: I hope that in a number of areas there will be. The importance, of this<br />
visit is to drive home the economic links as well as having a political<br />
dimension. The economic links are very important that's why there is<br />
such a sernior and very, very, authoritative business delegation<br />
accompanying me.<br />
J: Prime Minster, if the political links are improved after this visit this<br />
Piime Ministerial visit to China, what kind of impact and flow-on will<br />
that have for business links to Australia?<br />
PM: ' Well, I think they are complementary in a way, although it is fair to say<br />
that in some areas such as wool and wheat Australia has done very well<br />
irrespective of the nature of the political association.<br />
You have to keep a sense of perspective about that. I think the better the<br />
political climate the more beckoning, I suppose, the econonic<br />
atmosphere. But, it is also an interesting fact of Australia's association<br />
with China that in areas like wool and wheat the association goes back<br />
long yea r and it is a vezy, very, old association and on a number of<br />
occasions in the past when things haven't been as warm as perhaps they<br />
have been on other occasions we've nonetheless done quite well.<br />
J: Prime Minister, can I just throw forward to the Ansett opening this<br />
afternoon, what does it mean to have an airline link between the two<br />
couniries?<br />
PM; It is very relevant, for example, to the Olympic Games. And, one of the<br />
things that is occurring in China as is occurring in so many countries in<br />
the region is that there is a rapidly burgeoning middle class and you only<br />
need in peftentagc terms a small middle class in a very large country<br />
and you have an enormous new tourist market. You have an enormous<br />
new potential market in services generally, as well as, of course, a huge'<br />
consumer market for manufactured exports. But the people to people<br />

3<br />
links between Australia and China will grow. B3ear in mind that there<br />
are something in the order of 300,000 Australians claiming Chinese<br />
ancestry. Now, certiny a large percentage of those don't come from<br />
China itself, although a growing number do. But the thing that springs<br />
very readily to mind, of course, is the Olympic Gamnes.<br />
Thank you. </p>
