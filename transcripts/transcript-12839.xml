    <content><![CDATA[<p>
I warmly welcome the New Zealand Prime Minister';s announcement of her intention to lead a business delegation to Australia from 28-31 May, accompanied by Research, Science and Technology Minister Hodgson.<br />
As the twentieth anniversary of our trans-Tasman Closer Economic Relations partnership approaches, I welcome Helen Clark';s personal commitment to strengthening bilateral ties and developing business and investment opportunities.<br />
CER has delivered great benefits to both countries.  I am keen that we continue to develop new opportunities for partnership and collaboration – for example in science and innovation – whenever they arise.  I am confident Miss Clark';s delegation will highlight some important new prospects of interest to Australian firms and institutions and commend this initiative.<br />
I look forward to meeting the New Zealand Prime Minister and her delegation of business leaders from the biotechnology, information and communications technology, manufacturing, creative industries, venture capital, tourism and the food and beverage industries on Friday in Sydney. </p>
