CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
COMBINED ANNUAL DINNER OF THE<br />
HEAVY ENGINEERING MANUFACTURERS' ASSOCIATION<br />
AND THE<br />
HEAVY ENGINEERING PROJECTS<br />
CORPORATION OF AUSTRALIA<br />
CANBERRA 4 OCTOBER 1989<br />
Heavy engineering today is a very different industry from<br />
that of just a few years ago.<br />
After the so-called resources boom was found to be largely<br />
illusory, despite the feverish overselling of the previous<br />
Government, your industry faced up to and confronted a<br />
number of deep-seated structural problems that had been<br />
swept under the carpet by policy makers far too long: over<br />
capacity, restrictive work and management practices,<br />
increased import competition in a contracting domestic<br />
market. In short, you confronted a classic, and an urgent, need for<br />
industry-wide rationalisation.<br />
The dramatic transformation your industry has wrought, and<br />
the manner in which you have achieved it, demonstrate your<br />
resilience and the newfound commitment of your management<br />
and workers to co-operate in pursuit of essential reform.<br />
Your story also illustrates the Government's uncompromising<br />
determination to play its part in revitalising Australian<br />
industry. Let me say at the outset tonight, the Government remains<br />
determined to achieve the goal of a restructured,<br />
competitive Australian economy and we will look to your<br />
industry, as we have in the past, to meet your<br />
responsibilities and fulfill your potential in this great<br />
national tai,<br />
The message has to be clear: reconstruction of the<br />
institutions and attitudes of the Australian economy is the<br />
essential, the only, path to sustainable prosperity for this<br />
nation. If you're not part of it, you'll be left behind and, worse<br />
still perhaps, you'll act as a drag on the rest of the<br />
economy. </p>
<p>I start out with those direct words because your industry<br />
faces a particularly critical time ahead.<br />
When I last spoke to your annual dinner in 1984, the Heavy<br />
Engineering Adjustment and Development Program was yet to<br />
come into being.<br />
It was in July 1986 that we, together, forged a tripartite<br />
agreement to develop a long term strategy to rehabilitate<br />
the industry to achieve improvements in the efficiency of<br />
this vital industry so you could enhance your local market<br />
position and upgrade your competitiveness on export markets.<br />
For our part, we said we would provide assistance for labour<br />
retraining and relocation, management enhancement, and<br />
concessional finance for capital stock upgrading<br />
conditional upon real progress being made in the removal of<br />
restrictive work practices.<br />
We made it clear that this support required a commitment<br />
from both management and unions to fundamental reform.<br />
As you know, the heavy engineering plan had its teething<br />
problems and, at the start, progress on the crucial work<br />
practices issue was slow.<br />
But I think the plan is now generally viewed as having done<br />
much to help restructuring in the industry as have our<br />
efforts to abolish discriminatory state purchasing<br />
agreements. Heavy engineering still has a great number of internal and<br />
external problems to overcome before it achieves a<br />
satisfactory level of efficiency and profitability, but we<br />
can look back on this plan as a major contribution to the<br />
restructuring that has taken place.<br />
The plan has also brought about what I believe have been<br />
some remarkable attitudinal changes in your industry<br />
changes which originated with the formation of consultative<br />
management and union groups and which have continued through<br />
to the Metal Industry Agreement and the award restructuring<br />
process. These are truly path-breaking developments, whose<br />
significance is hard to overstate. Through award<br />
restruct ring we are achieving real and enduring<br />
productivity improvements, and we are doing so in a way that<br />
builds trust and confidence in tl iorkplace where before<br />
there was too much confrontation.<br />
As you know, my colleague John Button recently announced a<br />
new program, the Metal-Based Engineering Program, to focus<br />
further assistance on two aspects of the industry that will<br />
be vital to your future identification and exploitation of<br />
export markets and adaption to technological change. </p>
<p>This is a $ 15 million four year program that recognises the<br />
reality: the heavy engineering industry of 1989 is a key<br />
strategic industry manufacturing the capital investment<br />
goods needed for the development of the Australian economy.<br />
Make no mistake: that development is taking place, and you<br />
are playing a central role in it.<br />
In steel, for instance, BHP has five projects, at different<br />
stages of completion, involving expected capital outlays in<br />
excess of $ 600 million, which will not only cater to the<br />
domestic market but service niche export markets.<br />
In the smelting and chemicals sectors, four projects ( Risdon<br />
zinc smelter, Kemerton silicon smelter, Gladstone sodium<br />
cyanide/ chlorine plant, and the Bunbury titanium dioxide<br />
plant), involving total capital outlays of around $ 500<br />
million, are all due to come on stream by the end of the<br />
year. The twin staged Bell Bay wheel Plant, involving expected<br />
total capital outlays of $ 100 million, will have a strong<br />
export focus.<br />
The new Submarine and ANZAC ship projects are underway.<br />
Last but by no stretch of the imagination least the<br />
North West Shelf Project has generated very considerable<br />
work for your industry. As I observed last month in Perth<br />
when I attended the inauguration of the LNG Phase of this<br />
great project, about three quarters of the $ 6 billion<br />
already spent on this project has been spent in Australia.<br />
Taken together and I have not been exhaustive projects<br />
such as these amount to an investment boom in which your<br />
industry is and will remain a major participant and from<br />
which you will be a major beneficiary.<br />
Having said all that I think we should be realistic about<br />
what Australian industry can and cannot do.<br />
We are today witness to an annual increase in business<br />
investment of over 15 per cent in real terms in each of the<br />
last two years as a share of GDP, business investment is<br />
at record levels. We have industry telling us of<br />
billion in planned investment in major manufacturing<br />
projects across the broad spectrum of industry.<br />
These projects will provide your industry with a base level<br />
of demand and the opportunity to develop new skills and<br />
techniques which will in the future enhance your ability to<br />
compete, both here and overseas, for more-specialised work.<br />
But it would be unrealistic to expect that Australian<br />
industry would have been able alone to fulfill this<br />
dramatically increased demand or to expect that Government<br />
should provide artificial assistance to help local industry<br />
do so. </p>
<p>We are looking to you to make a greater contribution to<br />
import replacement.<br />
In the meantime, such imports as are necessary contribute to<br />
our current account deficit. But when these projects come<br />
on stream they will translate into export growth and import<br />
replacement, and in so doing help alleviate our external<br />
balance problems. For example, the North West Shelf project<br />
will yield exports worth up to $ 2 billion a year from 1994.<br />
At the same time, heavy engineers in this country are<br />
finding new markets for Australian products overseas.<br />
I pay tribute to the active role of HEPCA in promoting<br />
Australian involvement overseas through encouraging the<br />
formation of suitable consortia of Australian engineers,<br />
contractors and manufacturers to bid for major contracts<br />
abroad. I know you have a good number of projects underway and that<br />
you are working closely with AUSTRADE on them. I am always<br />
pleased, on my own overseas visits, to give what support I<br />
can to the efforts of Australian businesses to develop new<br />
investment opportunities and I applaud you on the success<br />
you are having.<br />
These initiatives show the buoyancy of activity within the<br />
heavy engineering industry and they show, too, that<br />
Australia is heading in the right direction with the<br />
development of a mature export culture.<br />
But let me take up a very serious and important point that<br />
emerges most recently, from your latest annual report.<br />
You call there for " a co-ordinated national policy to ensure<br />
that the bulk of design, engineering and manufacturing work<br />
on major Australian projects is carried out in Australia by<br />
Australian companies under licence or in joint venture with<br />
overseas technology holders". I note also your criticisms<br />
about our recent changes to DIFF and mega-DIFF funding.<br />
One reading of your suggested guidelines covering domestic<br />
project work is that you are concerned to ensure that you<br />
get a fair go and that you want only to show that your<br />
industry can deliver on major construction undertakings. If<br />
this is all you are saying then let me assure you that my<br />
Gover-ment would view very dimly indeed any systematic bias<br />
against Australian industry participation in large scale<br />
project work.<br />
However, I would be concerned if your strategy of maximising<br />
Australian industry involvement, and the suggested licencing<br />
system referred to, were to operate as a de facto local<br />
content scheme. </p>
<p>Because I would have hoped that if we have learnt anything<br />
from our past experience of protectionism and intervention<br />
it would be that such policies have failed to foster the<br />
development of the sort of outward looking, entrepreneurial<br />
and self-sufficient industry Australia needs if we are to<br />
make our way in an increasingly integrated world economy.<br />
Artificial guidelines would not in practice help either your<br />
industry or the national economy. They would serve more as<br />
a serious disincentive to major projects coming to Australia<br />
in the first place.<br />
You don't need me to tell you that the best way of building<br />
a truly capable domestic industry is not through a resort to<br />
some sort of new protectionism but through genuine and open<br />
competition in world markets.<br />
Let me just add this point, in the light of three years of<br />
the Heavy Engineering Adjustment and Development Program and<br />
the current Metal-Based Engineering Program.<br />
These programs were not intended to be open-ended nor were<br />
they intended to be substitutes for genuine industry<br />
reconstruction.<br />
I have expressed my appreciation of the restructuring that<br />
has already taken place in the industry. But I have to say<br />
as well that if the industry doesn't take advantage now of<br />
the opportunities offered for reform within the stable<br />
framework we have provided, then it will find the task that<br />
much harder when it has to be performed after existing<br />
measures have run their course.<br />
In relation to the recent changes to DIFF funding and<br />
administration, your annual report comments that Governments<br />
must be mindful of the industry support offered by<br />
competitor countries, and must take into account the size of<br />
Australia's industrial base and access to and distance from<br />
international markets.<br />
You say that to question Australia's export support and<br />
encouragement measures on the basis of perceptions of<br />
resource allocation or on the basis of what you call " simple<br />
cost cutting measures" is " unrealistic and<br />
counterproductive" Let me point out that DIFF funding has increased<br />
dramatically from $ 16 million to over $ 90 million in the<br />
past three years. My Government will accommodate DIFF<br />
outlayt. ( if up to $ 100 million in future years. The changes<br />
we made to DIFF administration are designed to sharpen its<br />
trade and aid performance and to ensure that DIFF funds flow<br />
to the most deserving projects.<br />
I think it is important for you to accept that the<br />
Government cannot, and in my view should not, attempt to<br />
match the concessional finance packages which other<br />
countries may make available on a fairly indiscriminate<br />
basis to support overseas project work. </p>
<p>This is just the sort of beggar-thy-neighbour attitude that<br />
has led to the impasse between the EEC and the US on<br />
agricultural support policies.<br />
And again, it runs the danger of cultivating the dependence<br />
that has dogged Australian industry for too long and that we<br />
are trying so hard to shake off.<br />
My Government has done more than any other before it to<br />
encourage the development of an export culture in this<br />
country. Eventually, however, industry must identify its strengths<br />
and look to markets and activities where they can go it<br />
alone. on a more general level, my Government is doing all that it<br />
can to promote the trading performance of Australian<br />
industry. on the world stage, we are vigorously promoting<br />
policies aimed at securing an open, liberalised,<br />
international trading system. In my Government's view, such<br />
a system will best enable us to fully develop our resources<br />
by they primary, mineral, manufacturing, or services.<br />
Australian industry is today less inclined to view the<br />
prospect of greater trade exposure as a threat to be<br />
resisted and more as an opportunity for growth and<br />
diversification. If we are to succeed there is a need for<br />
industry to respond flexibly to global market developments<br />
and to demonstrate a willingness to adapt to the rapid pace<br />
of technological change.<br />
In this regard I am encouraged by the obvious change in<br />
outlook in your industry and the instrumental role played by<br />
both HEMA and HEPCA in bringing about this change.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
There is, as is perhaps inevitable in this great endeavour<br />
of national economic reconstruction on which we are jointly<br />
engaged, one further challenge that awaits us.<br />
Last week the ACTU held its Biennial Congress in Sydney.<br />
That Congress considered a report posing the question,<br />
Can Unions Survive?<br />
And it endorsed, with support across the spectrum of the<br />
union movement, a sweepin lan for reform for the<br />
Australian trade union movement and for the Australian<br />
economy. The key element of the plan is the creation of fewer, larger<br />
and better unions. Bill Kelty has said he wants to reduce<br />
the number of unions in the ACTU from 308 to </p>
<p>With this plan the ACTU is declaring its commitment to<br />
ensuring the Australian economy continues to grow in<br />
competitiveness, efficiency and quality, by removing one of<br />
the deep structural inefficiencies of our economy.<br />
I hope this message was not lost on your organisations or on<br />
the employers and companies you represent.<br />
This audience will need no reminding about the significant<br />
role that the trade union movement has already played in the<br />
crucial task of national economic reconstruction.<br />
The transformation that has taken place in heavy engineering<br />
matches the transformation that has taken place in the<br />
economy as a whole.<br />
That transformation has not been an easy one and it is<br />
certainly not one that can be described as complete.<br />
However the achievements are real:<br />
the creation of 1.5 million jobs;<br />
significant improvements in the social wage;<br />
and the undertaking of sweeping workplace reforms<br />
such as award restructuring.<br />
The Accord between the trade union movement and the Federal<br />
Government has been a critical instrument in the achievement<br />
of these goals.<br />
I do not wish in any way to understate the significance of<br />
the contribution made by employers, individually and<br />
collectively, or by the wider community.<br />
But the significance of the last ACTU Congress is that the<br />
trade union movement has shown its readiness to embark on a<br />
new phase of economic reconstruction in this country.<br />
This blueprint for sweeping change in the structures and<br />
attitudes of the union movement will ensure the survival of<br />
the trade union movement as a relevant and constructive<br />
player into the next century.<br />
Employers in your industry and throughout the economy<br />
should recognise that an unparalleled opportunity now exists<br />
to assist and support this task and to ensure thereby the<br />
continued force and strength of Australian industry.<br />
The deliberate and determined reduction in the number of<br />
unions can only provide a massive assistance to both<br />
employers and employees by reducing the number of<br />
demarcation disputes and negotiation difficulties. </p>
<p>8.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I congratulate you on the tangible progress your industry<br />
has made over the last few years. But there is still room<br />
for improvement in work and management practices and in<br />
enhancing our skills base and technological capabilities.<br />
We cannot afford to become complacent or to ignore the<br />
challenges of the increasingly competitive environment<br />
confronting Australian industry.<br />
I am confident that your industry realises what it will take<br />
to succeed and will shoulder its responsibilities in shaping<br />
its own destiny and so contribute to reshaping Australian<br />
industry. </p>
