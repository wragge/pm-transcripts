AUSTHALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
E. O. E. -PROOF ONLY--<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PRIME MINISTER ON 2UE 21 AUGUST 1985<br />
JONES:<br />
The Prime Minister is on the line. Good Morning Prime Minister.<br />
PHIMX MINISTERl:(<br />
Good Morning Alan.<br />
JONES: Well Prime Minister you've got a bit of a fight on your bands<br />
if the polls are to be believed I suppose.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well the last poll has us In front.<br />
JONES: That's right.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Now that's the sort of fight I like. Are you saying I've got to<br />
fight to get further in front -and that's right, 3 and we'll get<br />
there.<br />
JONES:+ flight. Well congratulations firstly on tbe youth initiatives.<br />
Some commentators argue that you're long on rhetoric and short<br />
on facts. I must say that I feel that we're most probably a<br />
bit short on rhetoric these days. Do you think that there's<br />
a greater need to encourage young people to be ambitious and<br />
positive and committed?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Indeed I do, Alan, but I wean it's no good just urging them.<br />
You've got to give them a realistic framework within which that<br />
ambition has the opportunity of being achieved. And I believe<br />
we've struck just the right note. I've been very impressed,,<br />
Alan, as I've moved around and talked with young people that<br />
contrary to the sort of knocking that goes on from a lot of<br />
older people about our young I believe we are enormously<br />
fortunate in the quality of our young people. They want to<br />
work. They really do.. There is a very, very miniscule minority<br />
who don't want to. But there haven't been enough Jobs for them.<br />
So what we've got to do, Alan, and particularly what the<br />
traineeship is about is to direct our attention to those young<br />
people who haven't, for one reason or another and Its<br />
normally not their own fault -the opportunity of going on to </p>
<p>-MLNLi6* Fk( UN 2UL<br />
' PRIME MINISTER ( cont'd):<br />
either tertiary education, further technical training, or<br />
apprenticeships the kids that ei. ther have had no job or have<br />
gone Into dead end sort of jobs. So the traineeship idea is<br />
about giving financial incentive to employers and to the tra. ning<br />
institutions to have kids going into these areas being trained<br />
on the job and then having a quarter of the year off the job to<br />
have a broader training so that they just don't stay in dead end<br />
jobs but get the capacities they've got developed so that they<br />
can move on to more satisfying and rewarding jobs and that's<br />
Lhe Idea.<br />
JONES: Is the setting of the rate at $ 90 perhaps a concession that<br />
your minimum award rates may be a factor in preventing people 1<br />
from-putting young people on?<br />
PRlIME MINISTER:<br />
No wbat is involved there is, you see what Paul said last night<br />
was that they'll be negotiating between employers and unions<br />
taking into account time spent at the work place and it will<br />
involve payment of at least $ 90 a week. Niow that's recognising<br />
that you can't be expecting employers if they are going to not<br />
just having people working for them but some of the time is<br />
going to be spent training them, and some of the time about<br />
a quarter of the year Is going to be spent away from the job<br />
in training institutions, that you can't have the expectation<br />
that. you're going to get a full award wage when a lot of it~. s<br />
going to be training away from the job. So it's directing<br />
yourself to the realities of the sort of employment and training<br />
mix that will be taking place, Alan.<br />
JONES: Right, well now PM difficult problems in relation to the framing<br />
of the Budget and I suppose a lot of public attention on the<br />
deficit and particularly an wages policy do you feel that in<br />
spite of the fact that you've schieved this desirable dip<br />
underneath the $ 5 billion and a very sgni. ficant reduction in<br />
the deficit which I'm sure the community would welcome, that there<br />
is nonetheless a bit of a time bomb inside that given that<br />
PAYE continues to go up and there are a lot of people who'l11 be<br />
moving to higher marginal tax rates if we can't get them some<br />
relief. PRlIME MINISTER:<br />
You appreciate that we will be bringing down a tax package next<br />
month where we will be directing our attention to the level of<br />
rates and we've recognised from the beginning of the tax<br />
discussion at the end of last year that the rates have to be<br />
reduced and they will be.<br />
JONES: Right. Well now wages policy: there's a very firm commnitmnent,<br />
which I'm sure has been welcomed by the community, that you<br />
can't be passing on problems with the movement in the dollar<br />
into wages. But it does focus on the fact that much of your<br />
success is derived from the importance you've attached to the<br />
Prices aud Incomes Accord, and yet full wage indexation is a<br />
central plank of that. Hiow do you see your ability to resolve<br />
that seeming conflict? 12 </p>
<p>MINIZSi'LH UN 2UL<br />
P13IME MINISTEH:<br />
That's an important question. Let me make these relevant points:<br />
the Accord refers to ttAe importance or' full wage indexation, and<br />
it also In the context of the Accord refers to taking account of<br />
relevant economic cir'iumstances. And what we're saying not<br />
merely to the trade union movement but to the whole of Australia<br />
is that we've been given ani enormous opportunity by the<br />
competitive advantage bestowed upon us by the devaluation and<br />
that means that Australian industry can now better compete on<br />
overseas markets and can better compete against imports. Now we<br />
don't want to dissipate that -advantage by passing on the<br />
effect of the devalUation into wages. So we are asking for that<br />
to be taking into account. Not that we're walking away from the<br />
Commitment to the maintenance and through time the improvement<br />
in standards. That's a legitimate expectation of Australian<br />
working men and women. What we're going to do is say well now<br />
look we've just got to take account of this now In a number<br />
of ways including discounting we're saying and that will<br />
mean that the existing jobs which people have will be made more<br />
secure. But Importantly it means that we'll create thousands<br />
and thousands more jobs for the kids of people who are working.<br />
2And I believe that working men and women are concerned, not just<br />
for themselves, for creating opportunities for more jobs<br />
particularly for their own kids.<br />
JONES: Quite right.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
And that's what we're about.<br />
JONES: Yes I thin'U there'd be-widespread support for that. PM I just<br />
wonder one of the real problems that most probably Australia<br />
doesn't understand nationally is this problem about tr. ade.<br />
Difficulties with the commodity prices in the world and then<br />
the problem about the import prices because of the dollar<br />
movement. Are you worried about this growing trade deficit<br />
and the problems that we're going to have in reduicing it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't want to go into technical economist jargon but what we're<br />
experiencing is i-. curve that's the language of the economist,-<br />
which simply means that in the immediate impact of devaluation<br />
you get a worsening of your current accounts because the price<br />
of imports goes up. But then when the devaluation starts to<br />
go in and be taken advantage of so that your Australian industry<br />
can compete better against imports and is more competitive in<br />
the export market,, then you come into the position where you get<br />
the benefit of the devaluation. And they's why 1 mean it's<br />
a very logical question for you to put after the previous one<br />
that's why it's so important to ensure that we get those benefits<br />
and don't dissipate them.<br />
JONES: Sure. Well Prime Minister you're busy and we've got to take<br />
the news as we always seem to have to do when I'm talking to youbut<br />
thank you for Speaking with us this morning and good luck<br />
because I think the community is certainly prepared to support the<br />
initiatives of the government to keep the economy going and to<br />
Vage 3 </p>
<p>MINISTER ON 2UE Page<br />
JONES ( cpnt'd):<br />
see that we can compete satisfactorily int. ernaiorally and that's<br />
the objective of all Australians.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well thank you Alan. I think Australians are entitled to be<br />
proud of the Budget that Paul Keating has brought down for the<br />
government. I think it's going to be great for all Australians.<br />
JONES: Thank you Prime Minister. The Prime Minister of Australia,<br />
1dr. Bob Hawke. </p>
