SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
OPENING THE ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES CENTRE<br />
EAST PERTH COLLEGE OF TAFE<br />
PERTH WA<br />
I am very pleased to be here this morning to open the Advanced Manufacturing<br />
Technologies Centre.<br />
The objective of this Centre is to provide Western Australia with a world class<br />
vocational education and training centre one which will respond to the needs of<br />
industry and which will facilitate this State's value added export oriented<br />
industries. This is an ambitious objective.<br />
It is particularly ambitious because vocational education is still, to some extent,<br />
the " Cinderella" of the educational system, lacking the resources and prestige of<br />
the universities, and often acting as an add-on to a generalist school-level<br />
education. The roots of this neglect are deep, and go back to the nineteenth century. As<br />
one eminent person said then,<br />
universities were institutions designed * to instruct the youth of the colony in the<br />
higher branches of education" whereas technical education existed " to instruct<br />
the working classes in their particular business'.<br />
This dismissal of vocational education, which sadly persists in some quarters,<br />
has cost Australia dearly.<br />
It has caused vocational education to become a second-best option for both<br />
students and governments. </p>
<p>TEL: 11. Uct. 93 6:' J ru. UUF..)/ 1V<br />

Over the last 40 years one working lifetime the number of students at<br />
university has increased more than eighteen fold while the number of students in<br />
vocational education has risen by well under a third of that figure.<br />
As a result, the Australian vocational preparatioii system in the early 1980S was<br />
the second smallest in the OECD we had only one 16 or 17 year old in five In a<br />
program, compared with seven In ten in some ccountries, and an OECD average<br />
of one in two.<br />
Not a great performance, you will agree.<br />
And it is not as if students have been going to university instead. Less than one<br />
third of students actually go directly to universitY.<br />
The sad and alarming fact is that almost a quarler of students are seeking to go<br />
directly into work without having undertaken gn4 vocational study.<br />
It is these students who are most at risk of long.-term unemployment and who,<br />
when they get work, will be trapped in low skilled jobs.<br />
Jobs which will inevitably disappear with the inoxorable advance of technology.<br />
I think that no-one would disagree that we haVE1 an obligation through our<br />
education system to prepare young Australians for life and for the future.<br />
We must create an education system that serve~ s individual needs, and by doing<br />
so, serves the interests of Australia.<br />
In the new world that our children are now inheriting, the nation's wealth will<br />
depend more and more on the skills of our worldorce.<br />
That is -precisely why the Commonwealth Government, in partnership with State<br />
and Territory Governments, Is committed to expanding TAFE and enhancing its<br />
prestige. It is why, in July 1992, we reached an historic agreement to establish a new<br />
national vocational education and training syst!, m.<br />
And a new Australian National Training Authority ( ANTA).<br />
ANTA, which Is due to come into operation on. 1 January next year, will oversee<br />
the growth and reform of the vocational trainln!) sector, and ensure that its<br />
programs better meet the needs and priorities of industry. We will add to our<br />
current outlays $ 720 million in growth funds for this purpose. </p>

In this sense, it is a first for Australia. It will bring together government, industry<br />
and training providers to form a national vocational educational training system<br />
with agreed objectives and priorities, assured funding arrangements, and<br />
consistent national strategies.<br />
ANTA will work towards closer interaction between industry and vocational<br />
education and training providers, and will also improve the links between<br />
schools, higher education and vocationai educat~ ion and training.<br />
This is long overdue.<br />
The same can be said for centres such as these.<br />
Manufacturing Is one of the main wealth creating sectors in developed,<br />
economically vibrant economies.<br />
It is also one of the fastest growing segments of world trade, with significant<br />
growth In high value-added goods.<br />
Australia has taken the opportunity to increase Its share of this international<br />
market.<br />
There Is no doubt that we have made dramatic advances in recent years.<br />
Achievements which surprise many Australians when they become aware of<br />
them. In the last three years the volume of manufacturied exports has grown by nearly<br />
two-thirds.<br />
Exports of elaborately transformed manufactures have risen by 217 per cent<br />
over the last decade.<br />
And between 1983 and 1991 research and development personnel in Australian<br />
industry experienced the second fastest growth among industrialised countries.<br />
But there Is little scope to rest on our laurels.<br />
We need to proceed apace with the improvement of the overall competitiveness<br />
of our manufacturing sector and we can do so b~ y the development and use of<br />
advanced manufacturing technologies, or AMT.<br />
Centres such as this one will facilitate the increased adoption of AMT by<br />
ensuring a supply of well trained manufacturing ':. echnologists who have a broad<br />
range of appropriate skills rather than narrow trede-based training. </p>
<p>TEL: 11. Oct. 93 8: 29 No. 001 P. 07/ 10<br />

They can be at the cutting edge of Australia's international export strategy. And<br />
they need to be tor the Science and Engineering Council found last year that<br />
the level of adoption of AMT by Australian manufacturing industry Is uneven and<br />
generally lagging behind that in competitor nations.<br />
This Centre will make a valuable contribution to assisting Western Australian<br />
industry to take up and use advanced manufacturIng technology, and thereby<br />
enhance the competitiveness of Australian manufacturing in general.<br />
It will also raise the profile of vocational educatioin, and prove that TAFE is<br />
meeting the challenges of the 1990s.<br />
And there is no doubt that TAFE is doing so.<br />
The results of the survey of TAFE students relef ised earlier this week, which<br />
-shows that 87 per cent of students were satisfied with their courses, indicates<br />
that TAFE Is doing a good job.<br />
But we need to Improve it further, and let people know how good it really is.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure to open the Australian Manufacturing<br />
Technologies Centre. I congratulate all concerned with the building of the<br />
Centre and wish students and staff all the best for the future.<br />
