SPEECH BY THB PRBE MINISTER<br />
CONFERENCE OF CONOMISTS<br />
auF3RS PARADISE 26 AUGUST 1987<br />
John racLood, Federal PrecAdent of the<br />
Economie Soicety of Australiag<br />
Jon Stanford, Quoensland Presidcntl<br />
Ladies and goatle2en.<br />
Your invitP~ i to addross the 16th annual Conference of<br />
Economirsto ivec me ay first opportunity since the July 11<br />
election to crticulate publicly the Government's thinking on<br />
issues of oconomic management.<br />
By nominating as your conference thcmo the issue of<br />
" Economic Towards 2000", you rightly direct our attention<br />
to the long-torm challenges Australia faces.<br />
The dozen yocs which separate us from the end of the 1990s<br />
must sec fund~ mental changes in the Australian economy and<br />
society ig tc are to meet those challenges.<br />
Quite simply, if we do not make those changes we will not be<br />
a prosporous nation by the year 2000.<br />
That is why over the first two terms of my Government we<br />
have focuced our efforts on encouraging those changes<br />
through a strategy of economic reconstruction.<br />
At the outset of this speech in effect, at the outset of<br />
my third tern as Prime Minister of Australia I want to<br />
affirm in the clearest possible terms that this strategy,<br />
begun over the first two terms, will be continued in the<br />
third term.<br />
We in the Government and, I believe, the majority of<br />
economic professionals have long recognised that<br />
thorough-going economic reconstruction is the essential<br />
response to the challenges the nation faces.<br />
What is different since the election on July 11 is that our<br />
strategy hac now received a resounding confirmation from the<br />
Australian people. U00' 77?<br />
I Jle~ h </p>
<p>2.<br />
In fulfill~ rc3 our imndate we will carry through a full and<br />
tecting agonda of change &amp; n agenda which I wish to address<br />
today.<br />
And lot ne npproach that taok by saying something of the<br />
achievemeato of the two reel ' pients of your Distinguished<br />
Fellow L~ wagb( 13, Colin Clark and Trevor Swan.<br />
Colin Clark hmo attained eminence in both academia and<br />
policy maLhinS. it is no secret that he and I hava had some<br />
fairly p~~ un6 Cifferoncas, 62ating back to days at Oxford.<br />
However I . nheoitatingly pay him tribute as one whose work<br />
first el. uc-tntcd many profound questions about the<br />
Australian~ economy.<br />
Trevor wa-too, is a giant of the pxofession. His<br />
pathbreak:' sng paper on " Lon.~ er-Run Problems of the salance of<br />
Payacntr,' lr-as relavant to the economic challen es facing<br />
policy U8: zoL's in Australia today as it was when it wan first<br />
penned in 2935.<br />
We are all 3amiliar w&amp; ith the Swan diagram and ito analysis<br />
of policy 9, yescriptions needed to secure simultaneously<br />
internal 3-A extornal balance proscriptions which vary<br />
wiith tho L'titial economic conditionc.<br />
Auotralia, as you all know, has received a massive external<br />
shock. Th2-it chock coincided with a strong economic upturn,<br />
which coor z-unded the inevitable balance of payments crisis.<br />
in Swan C~ rmterms, the shock precipitated a massive<br />
external ii . balance and poli-cy makers had to find the correct<br />
adjustme.-. t path. The correct path was one which would both<br />
restore cnl2-ornal balance and c * ontinue the progress which had<br />
been mado to eliminate the internal imbalance originating In<br />
the high waga/ low growth era of our predecessors.<br />
The polic~ y choices available to the Government in such a<br />
situation are far from sinple.<br />
Some adjuzItment paths would restore external balance<br />
rapidly, ;) at at the cost of prolonged high levels of<br />
unemploymon~ t.<br />
Other patas would press on with domestic growth but at a<br />
pace which would so prolong the task of external adjustment<br />
as to pccipitate an external crisis of another kind one<br />
born of an inability to fund the current account except at<br />
ruinous interest rates, which in turn, would jeopardise the<br />
attainmunt of internal balance.<br />
The pol~ tcy choices need also to pay heed to the varying<br />
speeds wiih which policy instruments can take effect.<br />
Having freed up the exchange rate, the quickest response to<br />
the external shock was a large depreciation of the<br />
Austral~ en dollar. 0 00ii' 13 </p>
<p>That unlosNo the MOst powerful force or change known in<br />
economiCG cmassive, not a marginal, chango in relative<br />
prices. tla:: oover the deterioration in our terms of trade<br />
directly roeuced the world ptirchcsing power oZ Australians,<br />
which of itof will contribato to the rectoiration of<br />
external bnlcxace.<br />
But those CÅ' ucs were not thcsioelvoc oufficient to reduce<br />
domestic cM'. GMPtlon and r* IGU dornCi~ tiC caving to tho extent<br />
required to awer Gubstantiailly our dopeitdence on goreign<br />
saving. The magnt o! the conternal blow~-out cind the cassociated<br />

tho higher will bi Luaralia's overseas<br />
indebtedne~ c as a chore of GDPI and the more vs will hiave to<br />
export in -turo just to sustoin today's living standaxds.<br />
That fact hr'o addod an important timu dimensioa to policy<br />
choices.<br />
Labor's chal-co have struck tho balance botween promotIng<br />
steady balanoe of payments adju tment while proserving jobs<br />
growth and solliag back inE'atton.<br />
Of course 2 ha initial policy zconoes relied heavily on the<br />
most floxib of the macro instrunents, monetary policy.<br />
However, cvo-.-roliance on tljht monetary policy~ ic not a<br />
feasible unlaum-term adjustmient otrategy, not neast because<br />
of its dai-poning effects on eciployment and investment.<br />
An essentinI element of the Gtrategy, therefore, has been a<br />
medium-teria assault on fiscal policy.<br />
The externol shocks of 1985 and 1986 gave added urgency to<br />
that took.<br />
Labor began in 1983 to wind back~ the extravagant fiscal<br />
inheritanco 9! rom our predecessors. Labor inherited a<br />
prospectiva budget deficit of 5 per cent of GDP. This year<br />
it will bo lestG than 1 per cent and real outlays growth<br />
will bo snbatantially negative.<br />
We will m~ intain our efforto to contain the growth of public<br />
consumption and reduce the call on total savings for as long<br />
as economic conditions require it.<br />
There are zome in the economics profession who believe that<br />
we have adJlisted fiscal policy to Australia's external<br />
imbalance too slowly. They are advocating a balanced Budget<br />
or a surpluG in 1987-88.<br />
1 believe this view seriously misinterprets the nature of<br />
the policy choices which lie before Australia. () qU) </p>
<p>Pursuit o external balance is vital in the long run.<br />
However no country should pursue external balance to the<br />
exclusion of everything e2se. Indeed, looking around the<br />
world thiao days, one might be pardoned for believing that<br />
none of the majors takes the achievement of external balance<br />
as a serAios policy objective at alll owever that may be a<br />
subject geK another time.<br />
Recent work within the Office of BPAC nicely illustrates the<br />
policy chcices. They have extended the analysis presented<br />
in their poper entitled " Extornal Balance and Economic<br />
Growth" to show that it is possible to accelerate balance of<br />
payments adjuatment by almost 2 per cent of GDP over the<br />
next 4 yacss, compared with the adjustment paths of that<br />
paper. To do so, however, at a constant real exchange rate, would<br />
require Eh. ding GDP growth back to a rate which would be<br />
insufficen'. o to prevent significant increases in<br />
unemploynrnt unemployment which could only be avoided by<br />
furtheor ou! etantial real wage cuts. Those are not policy<br />
alternat'voc which I believe the Australian people are<br />
prepaeod to accept.<br />
That judoa'. nt was vindicated by the community's response to<br />
the May Statement the toughest expenditure cutting<br />
exercise in 30 yearc and most resoundingly, as I have<br />
already said, in its decision on July 11 to ronew our<br />
mandate to govern.<br />
As Paul scating and I have said, there will be no horror<br />
Budget in Uaptember: this year's expenditure cutting task<br />
was largely completed with the May Statement and the<br />
Premiers' Conference.<br />
We said that the 1987-88 Budget deficit would be well under<br />
$ 2 billion.<br />
We will kco? those promises, and for three reasons.<br />
First, it would be politically irresponsible to break such<br />
commitments in the absence of any intervening fundamental<br />
change in economic circumstances.<br />
Second, we : ecognise that part of the reason for the success<br />
of our econunic policy making lies in its consistency and<br />
credibility. Third, it io our judgement that the fiscal adjustment path<br />
upon which we have embarked is appropriate to our<br />
circumstances and a much faster pace would put at risk<br />
community acceptance of the broader economic reconstruction<br />
which is necessary in the longer term.<br />
The second area in which there is some disagreement in the<br />
economics profession over the appropriate pace of adjustment<br />
is in the wages area. ( OOOi3 </p>
<p>There is one certainty in the deobate over uacjeG policy and<br />
that is th&amp; A, the best way of ensuring that theze is no wage<br />
freeze is to call for one. Our political oppon3at elevated<br />
this to cn Lrt form with their incistonce on both a wnge<br />
freeze and ' ecentralised wage fixation.<br />
Trevor Swan and Colin Clark havo lived through periods In<br />
Australi&amp; 2~ ha have been eharactorisod at ono ond of tho<br />
spectrum b-7 fullty contralined w'agc fixation nnd nt the other<br />
by a compleozoaly decontrali' 3ed Gystem, &amp; a well as variouc<br />
combinatica3 through the rance.<br />
During the :, oried of my Government the wago fixing cVfotcm<br />
has evolved co-operatively to incorporate within a highl~ y<br />
centra. iatA system a cignif c. nnt dogrea of enterprise level<br />
This cvoLtittion haG been no accfldent: it has bcen in<br />
respoaso tQ tCie changing economic circumstances gocing this<br />
country. Et has the potential to become a ioajor new~<br />
instrument in our endeavours to progress towardn<br />
simultcnoctr, weotoration o2 Intornal and external balance.<br />
No Labor PLrmc Minister can take pleasure from preoidiaV<br />
over cuto . n the real wages of Auc~ tralian workern.<br />
But ouch reductions have been recognised as necessesry by<br />
both the Covernment and the union movement in creating worh<br />
opportun Ules for the unenployed and in adjusting to<br />
Austrtiia large external imbalznce.<br />
Only cno cot of statictica is needed to demolish the<br />
argument 2~ tAustralia's response to our external imbalance<br />
would be oore effective if a decentralised wage fixing<br />
system wore installed in place of the present syotem.<br />
Since 1S33 real wages in Australia have fallen by around<br />
six per cont. This was despite a period, from mid-1l982 to<br />
mid-1906, when a year of week economic growth was followed<br />
by throo Vaars of strong oenomic growth. There have been<br />
four other such occasions since 1950. only in the most<br />
recent Vcriod have real wages fallen. It is our<br />
cooperative, centralised wage fixing processes that have<br />
made thia unique outcome poesible.<br />
in setting the timetable for, and in designing the policies<br />
to achievc, external and internal balance, my Government has<br />
rejected the short-term perspective so characteristic of<br />
post-was Australian macro policy.<br />
Worldwido conditions clearly indicate that it is a forlorn<br />
hope to ortppose that anotheE: commodities boom is around the<br />
corner wiating to revive tho Australian economy.<br />
Accordingay, we have to loo. 4 to long term reforms as well as<br />
adjuotment to macro policy. These reforms, essential to<br />
provide the basis for viable long term growth, will assume<br />
greater co'gnificance in our third term. O0OW'~ 8 </p>
<p>This iG not sinply a matter of awakening a previously<br />
comatose Danufacturing sector so that it can play a pivotal<br />
role In tli reconstruction of the Australian economy. That<br />
is chali1-engo enough.<br />
But the cillenge goes deeper -and it will continue to<br />
confront uno for decado to come.<br />
AustrlinDe manufacturers workers and management alike<br />
m~ ust fri pepared to take on and beat the most nimble and<br />
most lnvciiva of our highly efficient competitors,<br />
especill those in our region.<br />
our manv ,--. turinj and our services sectors must also<br />
recognioe 1 hat It will be some time bafore Australia's<br />
depend~ ence on commodity exporto has diminished sufficiently<br />
to inaula-:, o our exchange L'Sto from fluctuations in commodity<br />
prices. in these c", rcum~ tancez, our ranageoent and work practices<br />
have to 1; o sufficiently flexiblo over time to custain our<br />
compotit~\ vonos.<br />
Our cozpol ,. tors have developed this shill. so must we.<br />
This is nV_ a now imperative for our major commcdity<br />
exporters. AG a group they tend to benefit from high<br />
commodityl L) ricOG the conveirse being that in a depressed<br />
market sucti as now exists, they too must be flexible enough<br />
to remain (, oct competitive while maximising employment.<br />
in casec ke the coal industry there is an additional<br />
danger tViaL~ inflexibility can translate temporary losses of<br />
competitivoness into permanent mine closures. This is a<br />
procpect thiat both workers and m~ anagement must recognise and<br />
seek to aivort.<br />
However ~ cneed for reform goes beyond one or two<br />
inductric30 All sectors need to be efficient and adaptable<br />
lest the imperfections in one area handicap the performance<br />
of the okhcxs. moreover, successful micro-economic reform<br />
can acce-crato the pace at which external and internal<br />
balance ccen be re-established.<br />
We havo Io extend and build upon the more general reform of<br />
the micro-economy begun during our first two terms. The<br />
objective 16 simple: to boost national productivity and to<br />
create the flexibility to respond to external shocks and<br />
opportunities both quickly and decisively. we want, through<br />
nationol reconstruction, to build a more adaptable and a<br />
more res~ tient economy.<br />
our agend~ a will undoubtedly grow as the task proceeds. But<br />
as our third term begins, I see the following broad areas<br />
deserving cur early attention: transport including<br />
aviation, communications and the information industries,<br />
government-owned business enterprises, education, industrial<br />
relationo and industry assistance. 0 0!)' 3 I </p>
<p>I<br />
Transport and aviation services account for a high<br />
proportion f costs in many Aurotralian industries. Past<br />
transport and practice have not kept costs down, and<br />
this haG outcerbated the disadvanta( 3cs of Australia's<br />
isolation nd our'disparsed population.<br />
Accordingl'y one of the major itema on the agenda of this<br />
term of govoznmont is.&amp; sweepig reform of the nation's<br />
transport iInfrSatructure.<br />

Legislation, and the dominance of Government business<br />
enterprisoo, mean that Government decisions, or the lack of<br />
them, will have a major influence on the future of this<br />
sector. 2vi question is how do we ennure that It operates<br />

This raitvna the wider issues associated with public<br />
ownership Gf business enterprises issues which were<br />
canvasse6 aa the Government's Green Paper on Statutory<br />
Authoritic3 and Government BusineCs Enterprises.<br />
We will necl to examine ways to improve the performance of<br />
these enterprises. Options include improved performance<br />
criteria, oxposure to greater competition, and the<br />
considerc~ tion of sales to the private sector.<br />
As you know; I recently called for a comprehensive debate<br />
within tLe forums of my Party on those parts of its Platform<br />
which exprcss opposition to the sale of Government business<br />
enterprirces I Guggcste6I two tests must be applied.<br />
First, doer; public ownership of a given enterprise mean that<br />
significant functions are undertaken that would not be if<br />
the privactc sector had the responsibility for funding,<br />
owning an~ d operating the enterprise?<br />
If the an-suer is then, second, what are the<br />
disadvantagjos and advantages of retaining public ownership<br />
of that enterprise, as opposed to transferring it to the<br />
private oector? 0 00! 38 </p>
<p>ThiG In oC--ect reverses t~ e onuc oZ proof: the question<br />
should bo not ' Why should we cell a given enterprioc' but<br />
' Why shoufldt we continue to tic up our resourcen in it?,<br />

of pazticzalar relevance to the broader themes I have been<br />
presontAivj today is the asosscment of whether publicly owned<br />

cervicer oy the fact of their public ownership.<br />
we must, Ãµ or example, examine whether the need to further<br />
reduce Dufget outlays and the Public Sector Borrowing<br />

Govornmenit to provide the capital which come publicly owned<br />
enterpr~ s need to perforia their tasks efficiently and<br />
effectivel~ y.<br />
Freed oP? these constraints, these enterprises may become<br />
more efP.. zient and more viablo an outcome which could only<br />
benefit consumers, taxpayers and the employees of the<br />
enterpricc itself.<br />
Turning 1b-riefly to education and training, the depth and<br />
breadth oi labour force Gskills will also have a strong<br />
bearing on our capacity to boost competitiveness and enhance<br />
the flei: ihility of the Australian economy. Indeed the, need<br />
for continuing education and retraining throughout the<br />
working life has never been greater.<br />
In Labor0I3 third term we will build upon our very<br />
considei: able achievements, which include and increase in<br />
school retention rates from around one-third to over<br />
per cent; the removal of financial disincentives to stay<br />

There iG ac'o furthar room to improve our industrial<br />
relations unv2 productivity performance although Laboz's<br />
policies have already yielded a* 6O per cent reduction in<br />
working dayis 1out through industrial disputes.<br />
A basic gactcT in this achievemenft has been the increasing ly<br />
sophistica: Q(] understanding by the trade union movement of<br />
the challenge of cosapotitiveness.<br />
The most rocent meaaure of tuis; awarenecn is the JLCTU'S<br />
report oR Alc onotructed". While I do not<br />
necesaaril~ l ondor~ e evory single proposal in that report, I<br />
welcomeo it L5i a valuable contribution to the debaf-e about<br />
the key Lis,, es tho nation must rosolve. As such I bolieve<br />
it desoe: vco-fhe very close attention of industry and of the<br />

Finally oi, this list of mnicro roforms the next three yearc<br />
will scoa L continuation of Labor's efforts to lower<br />
gradually tU. e 1lvels oO industry protection.<br />
We cannot, DG a nation, hope to ba internationally<br />

against ipurt competition.<br />
We are aski~ ng Australian industry to stand on its own two<br />
feet afteg ci period of adjustment.<br />
Sectoral plann are already in place for our most heavily<br />
Srotected J~ adustries, designed to phase down protection<br />

directly al~ lected.<br />
our R&amp; D inc3ntives and our industry extension services are<br />
designed 111f-a cilitate this Industry restructuring process.<br />
These iteno on Labor's agenda of micro-economic reform are<br />
not unre~ cited. Progress on some will make progress on<br />
others eaoicr. To take an example, if transport and<br />
communications costs are lowered and our education system<br />
better meets industry needs, the need for industry<br />
assistance will lessen.<br />
In working through this agenda, my Government will of course<br />
be seekincg to enlist the support of the States, for in many<br />
areas it is they which have the immediate regulatory or<br />
administrative responsibility. 0 0 8~ </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen.<br />
