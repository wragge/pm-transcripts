<p>E&amp;OE................................................................................................</p>
<p> LAIDLER:</p>
<p> And my pleasure to welcome to the studio, the Prime Minister</p>
<p> of Australia, John Howard. Welcome Mr Howard.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> How are you Terry? Sorry I'm late, a lethal combination</p>
<p> of road works and rain.</p>
<p> LAIDLER:</p>
<p> Yes, it's a bit grid locked around inner Melbourne</p>
<p> until that tunnel opens.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Yeah it is. Anyway.</p>
<p> LAIDLER:</p>
<p> You're off to Gallipoli?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Yes, next Friday I'm going to open the new memorial</p>
<p> on Anzac Cove, its been shifted for the very best of reasons and that</p>
<p> is that the older memorial, the area around it was getting too small for</p>
<p> the enormous number of young Australians and New Zealanders, in particular</p>
<p> but also people generally from other countries as well.</p>
<p> LAIDLER:</p>
<p> What do you reckon's turned that around because</p>
<p> I mean I think not being partisan, you would have to give some credit</p>
<p> to Con Sciacca and that Australia Remembers Campaign for doing some of</p>
<p> it but that can't explain the massive shift in young Australia's</p>
<p> minds...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Oh no. no look I mean let me say that that was a good</p>
<p> campaign and it was supported by both sides of politics. I guess the young</p>
<p> today are not as cynical about parts of their history as perhaps the young</p>
<p> of thirty years ago. There's also a feeling that we're coming</p>
<p> to the centenary of federation. There aren't too many people left</p>
<p> alive, now fewer than one hundred, who served in WWI. We've only</p>
<p> got two Gallipoli veterans left and one of them I saw at a ceremony in</p>
<p> Canberra earlier this week. There's just a greater appreciation of</p>
<p> the history of this country and there's a growing realisation that</p>
<p> the First World War with a male population of what two and a half million,</p>
<p> almost four hundred thousand volunteered. Now think what you may of the</p>
<p> reckless valour and so forth involved in that but it was a fantastic contribution</p>
<p> and of course the role that we played in WWII and subsequently... I</p>
<p> think it's a combination of reasons...</p>
<p> LAIDLER:</p>
<p> You've been to Gallipoli and Anzac Cove before haven't</p>
<p> you?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> No I haven't been to Gallipoli before but I've</p>
<p> been to the Somme on several occasions.</p>
<p> LAIDLER:</p>
<p> Nor have I. People say that the experience of being there</p>
<p> is overwhelming.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> I am looking forward to it and the New Zealand Prime</p>
<p> Minister, Helen Clarke will be going as well and it will be a very moving</p>
<p> occasion. I'm then going to France and that will include a visit</p>
<p> to the Somme battlefields and then I'm coming back through Israel.</p>
<p> LAIDLER:</p>
<p> How do you work out the right thing to say on an occasion</p>
<p> like that? I mean when you go to shift that memorial people will be looking.</p>
<p> I mean it's one of the things that the Prime Minister does in our</p>
<p> system for certain moments you stand as the national voice. I mean how</p>
<p> do you work out what the right thing to say is?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well I think about it and I think I'll do my best</p>
<p> to find the right words. I had the same experience when I opened the museum</p>
<p> at Kanchanaburi in Thailand two years ago, Anzac Day 1998 and there were</p>
<p> a lot of survivors of Hellfire Pass including three former members of</p>
<p> Parliament on both sides who came with me on that occasion and they are</p>
<p> very special occasions and you do seek on those occasions to say things</p>
<p> that people can relate to.</p>
<p> LAIDLER:</p>
<p> Can we get to some of the more mundane...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Sure.</p>
<p> LAIDLER:</p>
<p> ... domestic things because I mean I said that you're</p>
<p> coming on the program yesterday I've been inundated with letters</p>
<p> asking this, asking that... e-mails, e-mails are the bane of our life.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> They are.</p>
<p> LAIDLER:</p>
<p> A lot of the questions around, a perception perhaps that</p>
<p> the Government is a bit hard hearted, I'd have to be fair and say</p>
<p> I think that's what they're saying about issues like the stolen</p>
<p> generation and like the movement against the Kosovar refugees.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Can I just take the Kosovars for a moment? If you look</p>
<p> at our size and if you look at the distant we are from Europe, what we</p>
<p> did in relation to the Kosovars was very generous, we took four thousand.</p>
<p> When you look at our population, our distance and everything that was</p>
<p> a much better contribution I believe than a number of European countries</p>
<p> that had a far more direct involvement.</p>
<p>  It always looks difficult when people are being obliged</p>
<p> to go back but there was never any doubt that people came here on a certain</p>
<p> basis. The Minister, who would have to be one of the most decent, conscientious</p>
<p> members of Parliament you'd ever find on either side, has sat down</p>
<p> and worried about this issue, he's talked to me about it on a number</p>
<p> of occasions, he's looked at individual cases and Philip Ruddock</p>
<p> has really applied his mind in a very conscientious way and...</p>
<p> LAIDLER:</p>
<p> Strategically, why didn't you just say OK everyone</p>
<p> who wanted to go home has gone, those who don't want to go are still</p>
<p> here you can apply to the refugee tribunal and if you convince then you're</p>
<p> a refugee you're staying, if you don't you go home?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> The problem with that Terry is that if you do that it</p>
<p> would represent a very major change in the way in which we administer</p>
<p> refugee policy. It means that in future others will seek to do the same</p>
<p> thing in circumstances...</p>
<p> LAIDLER:</p>
<p> (inaudible)</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Exactly, exactly and they say well if you allowed them</p>
<p> to do it why don't you allow us to do it. I remember that when the</p>
<p> Hawke government took a decision in relation to the Chinese students after</p>
<p> Tianamen Square that generated for years afterwards precedent problems.</p>
<p> I had people in my electorate coming along and saying well I've got</p>
<p> some relatives in Laos or Cambodia, why can't I do the same thing,</p>
<p> I've got people here, etc, etc? And you've got to preserve the</p>
<p> integrity of the program and nobody likes the pictures, nobody likes the</p>
<p> trauma, the emotion of it. On the other hand if you don't do it this</p>
<p> way you create further problems with further traumatic cases and further</p>
<p> difficult individual decisions. And we are one of very few countries in</p>
<p> the world that maintain a humanitarian refugee program. There are very</p>
<p> few countries that do and I don't think Australians realise just</p>
<p> how... many Australians don't realise just how...</p>
<p> LAIDLER:</p>
<p> You can be generally generous but perhaps have been too</p>
<p> hard in this specific case.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> No, no.</p>
<p> LAIDLER:</p>
<p> Exceptions can be made.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Not without some cost in terms of subsequent generosity.</p>
<p> I mean you just can't see generosity as surrounding one or two particular</p>
<p> cases. I mean you take four thousand. Nobody - the request was made to</p>
<p> us and I don't think a lot of other countries expected that we would</p>
<p> as I say we did it a darn sight better and we were a lot more generous</p>
<p> and accommodating than many of the European countries that have perhaps</p>
<p> been louder in talking about these issues than us.</p>
<p> LAIDLER:</p>
<p> I argue with talk back callers that I assume good will</p>
<p> on the government part in relation to its dealing with Aboriginal people.</p>
<p> But it gets very hard sometimes to argue that and I have wondered for</p>
<p> a while about the timing of that submission to the Senate Committee that</p>
<p> said lets challenge the numbers and query the description of a generation.</p>
<p> I know I am using short hand. Why does that argument have to run now?</p>
<p> What purpose was served in the reconciliation process by running that</p>
<p> argument now?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well Senator Herron has pointed out that he was asked</p>
<p> to put in a submission and he chose to respond which he's meant to.</p>
<p> Governments are meant to respond to these committees and he put in a submission.</p>
<p> Now we didn't set out to offend anybody.</p>
<p> LAIDLER:</p>
<p> There was a strategy in the response. He could have said</p>
<p> the government is massively committed to the process of reconciliation,</p>
<p> understands and sympathises with the plight of those taken from their</p>
<p> families. Do you know what I mean? He...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well, well the question is whether what was in the document</p>
<p> was accurate or not and you can argue about phraseology but nobody has</p>
<p> actually pulled it apart for factual accuracy and I've heard people</p>
<p> argue well, it was a mistake to deal with facts in the submission. Now</p>
<p> I don't think. I mean people actually argued in the wake of that</p>
<p> submission going in and you may have seen some of that argument yourself,</p>
<p> you probably have that well this is one of those issues where you don't</p>
<p> really, you should really in a sense not deal with the facts. Now nobody</p>
<p> denies that people were taken, nobody denies that there were practices</p>
<p> engaged in the past that by today's standards would be quite unacceptable</p>
<p> and we feel sorry about people who suffer the injustices and we regret</p>
<p> them. But that doesn't mean that you can't deal with the scale</p>
<p> of it or you can't comment objectively on the fact that the original</p>
<p> enquiry didn't ask anybody who had been involved in the practices</p>
<p> to give their point of view.</p>
<p> LAIDLER:</p>
<p> Where is the reconciliation process now in your view?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well it's still alive and I believe going better than</p>
<p> some people are saying. I had a very good meeting during the week with</p>
<p> ATSIC. I had the entire board of ATSIC to the Lodge. That was pre-arranged</p>
<p> incidentally. I invited them several weeks ago and they were very happy</p>
<p> to pick up the invitation. I also had a meeting a couple of days ago with</p>
<p> representatives of the reconciliation council. We are talking about the</p>
<p> document. That's not the only element of reconciliation. Reconciliation</p>
<p> is an ongoing, multifaceted process meaning different things with different</p>
<p> emphasis...</p>
<p> LAIDLER:</p>
<p> Will it come to a point at some stage? With words like</p>
<p> document...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> No I don't think you ever perhaps get to a concluded</p>
<p> point. I think the process will probably go on for years and one of the</p>
<p> things that will come out of I guess the next few months will be a consideration</p>
<p> of whether there is a mechanism to carry the process forward after the</p>
<p> council winds up. Because the council runs out of legislative authority</p>
<p> and legislative remit at the end of this year and I know...</p>
<p>LAIDLER:</p>
<p>Will there be a new council?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the current council, the Chairman and Deputy Chairman had a discussion</p>
<p> with me about some alternative mechanism, not a council some call it a</p>
<p> foundation, I don't really mind what the name is that will carry</p>
<p> things forward. I don't think we would have the same Government and</p>
<p> Parliamentary imprimatur that the Reconciliation Council has but certainly</p>
<p> there is a desire on the part of a lot of people to carry the process</p>
<p> forward.</p>
<p>LAIDLER:</p>
<p>I notice you've got notes on it so you would probably know more</p>
<p> about it than me, but I saw a summary of what Mr Beazley said last night</p>
<p> about Telstra which as I saw the summary said he thought the sale had</p>
<p> enabled the repayment of $2.7 billion in debt but that in fact the sale</p>
<p> of Telstra had enabled the forgoing or led to the forgoing of $3.5 billion</p>
<p> in profits.</p>
<p>PRIME MINIISTER:</p>
<p>No, that's no . . . I'm not quite not sure what he was saying,</p>
<p> but the amount of debt that has been repaid has been a lot more than that.</p>
<p> Because we got 12, 14 billion for the first tranche and we got about the</p>
<p> same, a bit more for the second and we had some bonuses and so forth.</p>
<p> I read parts of his speech but I haven't read it all.</p>
<p>LAIDLER:</p>
<p>Basically he was saying the public didn't get value out of the sale.</p>
<p> PRIME MNISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't . . . well if you reduced the debt from the . . . I</p>
<p> do have something here. In 1997 our net debt was 82.9 billion, this current</p>
<p> financial year it is heading to about 58.9 billion, but part of that has</p>
<p> been . . . a big chunk of that has, it's been helped by Telstra but</p>
<p> also it's been helped by the fact that we got ourselves back into</p>
<p> surplus as well. There are a number of reasons why I think Telstra should</p>
<p> be fully privatised. The most important thing is you really do have a</p>
<p> sort of a camel of an arrangement at the present time and this deal that</p>
<p> Telstra has done with the Hong Kong Telco, the constraint it operates</p>
<p> under is that to finance that deal, it can't issue any shares, can't</p>
<p> raise any equity. Now for a large organisation like Telstra that is a</p>
<p> tremendous constraint. The reason we can't do it is that would dilute</p>
<p> the Government ownership. We don't intend to use tax payers money</p>
<p> to participate in a Telstra share issue, that would be crazy and I don't</p>
<p> think any tax payers would want us to do that, so there is an odd sort</p>
<p> of situation.</p>
<p>LAIDLER:</p>
<p>I have to ask you, how will you deal with the Queensland Nationals?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think you....</p>
<p>LAIDLER:</p>
<p>Who clearly indicated the other day that they expect their members to</p>
<p> oppose any further privatisation of Telstra.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well as John Anderson, the National Party Leader, pointed out in the</p>
<p> end these things will be resolved in the Party room and it is Government</p>
<p> policy. Party organisations we listen to but in the end the Party room</p>
<p> takes the decision and I have little doubt that when we come, after the</p>
<p> inquiry, if this inquiry chaired by Mr Besley gives the tick. I'm</p>
<p> sure in the end we will get strong support in our party room for the sale</p>
<p> of the rest of Telstra. This is an ongoing policy debate, I think it is</p>
<p> in the national interest for it to be fully privatised, I think Telstra</p>
<p> is entitled to operate without these sort of odd constraints and it does</p>
<p> seem to me odd that you would have $50 billion of public money invested</p>
<p> in a Telecommunications company rather than in some other form.</p>
<p>Because that is really what we are talking about, is whether you want</p>
<p> 50 billion tied up owning a telephone company or you want 50 billion put</p>
<p> to some other use.</p>
<p>LAIDLER:</p>
<p>But they don't trust other telephone companies in the bush to look</p>
<p> after them, they trust the government to look after them and they know</p>
<p> they can get at their local politician.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Terry when the Government . . .</p>
<p>LAIDLER:</p>
<p>But that is what's going on?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well can I say in respect to that, that when Telecom was fully owned</p>
<p> by the Government, the service was worse. When Mr Beazley was the Minister</p>
<p> and at a time when he was arguing eloquently in favour of the privatisation</p>
<p> of many assets. I came across a speech of his yesterday where he put a</p>
<p> terrifically good argument in favour of what the Government is now doing,</p>
<p> but when it was fully owned, the service was no better, it was worse,</p>
<p> much worse. I mean nobody in the bush will now tell you that 20 years</p>
<p> ago it was better, what they will say is that it is still not good enough</p>
<p> and they are right and our aim is to make it better and we are going to</p>
<p> do that.</p>
<p>LAIDLER:</p>
<p>Did you have a finger in the decision to let Phillip Morris sponsor a</p>
<p> lunch at the Liberal Party Convention and does it matter.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISITER:</p>
<p>Well the answer is no.</p>
<p>LAIDLER:</p>
<p>You didn't have a finger in it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And no, it's an organisational matter. Phillip Morris of course</p>
<p> sponsors things for both sides of politics, I should put that on the record.</p>
<p>LAIDLER:</p>
<p>You could both be wrong.</p>
<p>PRIME MNISTER:</p>
<p>Well of course, or we could both be correct. One of us can't be</p>
<p> wrong and the other correct on this occasion. What I would say is really</p>
<p> what Lynton Crosby said that is if a company is entitled to operate legally</p>
<p> and pay its taxes and it's otherwise a good corporate citizen, you</p>
<p> should be able to allow it to sponsor.</p>
<p>LAIDLER:</p>
<p>You can't advertise its product for example.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No it can't, but it can still sell it and . . .</p>
<p>LAIDLER:</p>
<p>But what it does instead of advertising it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well people argue that, I mean these things are never black and white.</p>
<p> I mean if they were black and white you would . . . they would be able</p>
<p> to advertise as well as operating profitably. They would be able to do</p>
<p> all of those things. But the argument that these things are shades of</p>
<p> grey...</p>
<p>LAIDLER:</p>
<p>I mean people say to me we are hypocritical about drugs, we get all upset</p>
<p> about them using ecstasy at parties and yet tobacco and alcohol are the</p>
<p> biggest killer in our communities.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well as somebody who gave up smoking 20 years ago but enjoys a drink,</p>
<p> I think if we are being objective abuse of alcohol inflicts enormous misery</p>
<p> on people, enormous misery but nobody really questions, not too hard anyway</p>
<p> the role . . .</p>
<p>LAIDLER:</p>
<p>Perhaps because there is a level of safe use of alcohol.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well some . . . these things are, they are shades of grey on occasions</p>
<p> and therefore the only rule I think you can invoke is the one that Lynton</p>
<p> invoked and that is to say that if a product is legal, the operation is</p>
<p> legal and it pays its taxes, then there is no reason why it shouldn't</p>
<p> make a . . . it shouldn't play a role. Particularly as 60 per cent</p>
<p> of its business is from non-tobacco related activities.</p>
<p>LAIDLER:</p>
<p>Prime Minister it has been good to talk to you once again.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
