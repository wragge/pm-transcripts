EMBARGO: AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
FOR PRESS 17NOVEMBER, _ 1978<br />
ADDRESS TO VICTORIAN STATE COU'NCIL<br />

2atyn.-nhbeleiR-Vcoin again showed<br />
clearly the direction in which they wanted our country<br />
to move and the Government was returned with an<br />
overwheirming majoity.-<br />
In 1975 Liberals won 19 seats in Victoria. In 1977<br />
we won 20-Only innc 1infere in olin history has the<br />
Liberal Party held as many Federal seats in this State.<br />
This was a wodafuL resiO flL W u d not have achieved<br />
it without your help and the full support of Dick Hamer<br />
who campaigned hard. for the return of the Government.'<br />
I well regmember Di~ yng-tame on election night,<br />
" People always worry about Victoria but in the end we<br />
always pull through."<br />
We pull through because of the strength and loyalty that can<br />
. be seen at this Council. We pull through because we are<br />
a Party that cares for people. We pull through because<br />
we are conmitted to effective, fair and sensible governmnent<br />
for Australia and this state.<br />
What a contrast this makes with the A. L. P. In Victoria,<br />
Labor is trying to assume a responsible pose: hoping to<br />
fool the people of Victoria; _ hopin g Victorians have<br />
forgotten t e61UTVictorian State Executive, whose memrbers<br />
ard still active in the Labor Party today; hoping<br />
* Victorians will not see the dominance and. extremism of<br />
the 16 = is. ttf 7But he A. L. P. dashes these hopes every.<br />
time it has a ' Party Conference.<br />
At last~ week!~~~ ra tt ao Conference, once again<br />
the Labor Party showed that they have not changed. Once<br />
again they showed that the only record they can run on<br />
is theirrU d-astrue longcs rgts-ding State Opposition<br />
in the Commironwealth. / 2 </p>
<p>tDlea-MAgain ha A-L2 s. PihwzeA it was committed to the<br />
dead hand of socialism. fome Labor members said-they<br />
, Only wanted to nationalise industry " where necessary".<br />
AeLting~ asn't' 2a~ dng -any of.. that i--; they<br />
insisted that the couuitsment to nationalisation of<br />
the means of production, distribution and exchange remain<br />
in Its piatin. frm~ + b esame~ form that it had<br />

oneagi th~ u' shlowed their reluctance to -criticise<br />
* the Soviet Union. Last Saturday they rejected a motion<br />
condemning the Soviet Government's persecution of those<br />
i n their conrwn ipx ua rights. The successful<br />
move to defeat t. hat motion was led by Mr. Bill Hartley.-<br />
. We all remember Mr. Hartley don't we he's the man who,<br />
we are always being to 4. has lost his influence in the<br />
A. L. P. But it was Mr. Bert Nolan, State Secretary of the<br />
Seamen's Union who convinced the A. L. P. to vote the way<br />
* tbeY did bY sying that bepP eerred to believe what<br />
unltqijJSE bad told him.<br />
The evidence of those persecuted by the Soviet regime,<br />
the-evManc Iior inniTma al observers, the<br />
mountains of evidence of the suppression of civil rights<br />
in the Soviet Union are disregarded. The Victorian Labor<br />
PIrary ouTV al tflxs-ev-1d-R-e as nothing they would<br />
rather believe the official line handed down by the<br />
Soviet Government. Labor's belief in tho'benign nature<br />
of t~ w OO1W t1Yh ha abWout the same degree of<br />
* accuracy and relevance as their socialist economic, theories.<br />
just three years, the Labor Party brought the<br />
Australian econkomy to its knees: pravoking roaring<br />
j:~ inflation, cauingM83 nempoyment. stopping<br />
invstent* eadinits tracks, and harming the -weaker'<br />
members of the community. Labor constantly pursues<br />
nl Luea--a pi for the future.<br />
We have been getting on with the job: confident in the<br />
. capaciie~ T~ heAustralian people; cxmitdoa~<br />
faith in our countxyl knowing that our policies are'<br />
working.<br />
-The Australian economy is back on * its'feet Inflation<br />
is down. Under Labor,_ inflation peaked at 19 percent<br />
at th-e-M-UMen 1tis rmnning at Ab-out 8 percent and it' 6s<br />
coming down further. Interest rates are coming down. v../ 3 </p>
<p>fortnight a o the trading banks reduced interest rates<br />
on a wide range of loans by 1/ 2 percent, particularly<br />
benefitting small businesses. Interest cuts benefit<br />
allAustralians. In the housing area they will benefit home owners and<br />
home buyers., For example, on a home loan of $ 25,000 being<br />
repaid over 25 years, a I percent reduction in interest<br />
rates means a saving in the order of $ 17 a month $ 5,000<br />
* over the period of the loan.<br />
Lower inflation and lower interest rates are making our<br />
_____ industry competitive again. A survey in September found<br />
tht l~ e'proportion. o companies reporting increased costs<br />
was the lowest since 1972.<br />
1Tnrac-Yrefs. are looking again to export markets. I know<br />
that at least one major motor vehicle manufacturer is<br />
_______ rebuilding its export organisation. Another survey found<br />
trr-UcuTr n ie b~ Teptenber Quarter Australian exporters of<br />
manufactured goods reported an increase of 5 percent in<br />
export deliveries. This was the first reported upturn<br />
Mining and oil exploration and developmient are rising<br />
-strp. Twcmpanies alone have committed themselves<br />
to spending $ 1,000 million in Bass Strait ana off<br />
Western Australia, directly because of the Government'ms<br />
re-astic-eTry and oil-pricing policy.<br />
Farmers are beginining their best year for a long time.<br />
Low-in iatio-, good seasons and improved prices will<br />
allow farmers at long last to buy new equipment and make<br />
long deferred capital improvements, boosting country towns<br />
ad Au-st~ fre14an-itstries supplying the rural communuity.<br />
These are all exciting and tangible signls of progress.<br />
hit4e-2ae'groups prepared to undermine Australia s<br />
progress in the pursuit of their own narrow self-interest.<br />
-Th Go nity-h s just been subjected to another damaging<br />
I an~ d unnecessary strike by the T. W. U. over the last two<br />
weeks:. a wasteful strike causing great inconvenience<br />
t. -ta.-l41G-ad losses in business activity. A selfish<br />
strike, niot called because of any principle, but because one<br />
C section of a union set its interests above those of the<br />
commzmty-. and--ozf-their fellow unionists. A hypocritical<br />
strike which makes a mockery of the union's professed<br />
I concern for the unemrployed. </p>
<p>4-<br />
The community utterly rejects strikes of this. nature and<br />
the policies this Government has adopted have led to A<br />
sigifiantfall in-industrial disputes.<br />
n1974 under Labor there were 6.3 million man days lost<br />
-due to strikes.-Last year*, this had faller, to I1 .6 millionL--.-<br />
Zone-quarter of the man days lost under Labor just<br />
three years earlier.____<br />
An equal threat to our economic progress is that of<br />
-unreasonable and excessive wage rises. The Government is<br />
comitted to Australian employees receiving, a fair return..-,<br />
for their efforts and to participating fully in Australia's<br />
* growth and development.<br />
-In present economic circumstances, Australia. needs wage<br />
restraint.-Otherwise our recovery will be slowed-and<br />
employment opportunities will sxf fer.. We look to the<br />
. J Arbitration Catm ission in the current six-monthly national<br />
* wage case to bring down a responsible decision. With restraint,<br />
with the community working together, Australia's economic<br />
* recovery will continue'and st-rengthen.<br />
Inote that the fdadamental principles of this Governet's----<br />
economic policies are increasingly being endorsed and<br />
adopted-overseas in the United States, Canada and even<br />
* by the British socialist government. These countries have<br />
seen the dangers of accelerating inflation.-They are<br />
taking the only responsible course -of action; ' the Very<br />
course which we have pursued for the past three years to<br />
reduce * the galloping inflation of the Laboryes.<br />
I~.~ bcaue . o the.. progress. We _-have. made. that it bas. been<br />
.4 1 possible for us to take a number of new initiatives to<br />
secreAustralia's future growth and development. In-the<br />
true spir-it of co-operative Federalism, showihg a common____<br />
commidtment and a common purpose, the . Comuonwealth and the,.--<br />
Australian States are working together in many -areas to<br />
7 realise Australiass unrivalled future.<br />
Ten days ago the Commonwealth arnd all six State Premiers<br />
agreed that for the first time State authorities can, over<br />
eight years, borrow $ 1,767 million overseas to develop such<br />
J essential facilities as railways, ports, power projects,<br />
. water supplies and pipelines'<br />
F or Victoria this will inean expansion for the crucial<br />
* Lay Yang Power Project and. a new world trade centre which<br />
will bring business and capital to the State. </p>
<p>The private investmamt 6ncouraged-b-y-' Ehdse projects<br />
going hand in hand with -the work of the Australian<br />
Governments will help us to forge ahead with the<br />
development and gruwt~ furYOUntry7<br />
The 1980' s will not be a decade of despair as M~ r. Htayden<br />
has tried to label thent. it wit Nearti-7f--5f renewed<br />
investment; a period of success for Australia and<br />
Australians. Ou= objectives for the 1980' s go far beyond economics.<br />
The Government has a clear and wide-ranging vision of<br />
where* Australia is vurg. I-t-i a v! 5ñ nwvEwill achieve.<br />
It is a vision which is based on the needs, the interests,<br />
and the hopes of the Australian peopleour<br />
vision is of an Australia of gro-wth and development;<br />
of prosperity and enlightenment; of stability and security;<br />
of compassion and effeet-; e hef)-fo r titse ilrx--reed. It<br />
rejects the sterile dogma of the Labor Party which<br />
denieaspeople their individuality, their personal hopes,<br />
their aspirations. t-i-s~ e Dfl a c, rn-for--people<br />
whatever their occupations, whatever their origins. We<br />
are determined to provide effective help to the<br />
.1 handicapped, to s ole-paro.-4t s,~-t. pf&amp; e* r--t-a<br />
veterans to all those in real need.<br />
We have made major social reforms, such as the introduction of<br />
family allowances;-the--idexeton of pensiurr, a major ct: pansion<br />
t In assistance to the handicapped and the Galbally R~ eport, which<br />
heralds a new deal for migrants. All of these have made an<br />
enormous difference to hwfdreds-thusadef ustalians.*<br />
We will continue with our social reforms. We will build on the<br />
foundation we bave-4&amp; 4a-4: jn 4_ e-pst tjv. years by'working<br />
totjether in a cormon cause as Australians. Thxouqh a unity of<br />
purpose and faith in our future, all Australians will gain fromn<br />
ou~ r achievements and -Fe-e s!-prozsperity.<br />
It is our commitment to Liberal ideals which is -reversing the<br />
disasters wrought on o-zecmom--y-t4aee-yers--of -Labor-rule.<br />
It is'our commnitment to Liberal ideals which has brought<br />
Victoria 23 years of effective, moderate and sensible government.<br />
Of course, all political parties have difficult patches in their<br />
terms in office. WThat makes the Liberal Party different is that<br />
we have always been able -to coma-thx-c-th-e-~ aited and<br />
determined to win, determined to serve this State arvl our<br />
nation to the best of our abilitias.<br />
The last twenty-three years have been enormously creative ones<br />
for this State. They have been creative because Victoria has<br />
been governed by Liberalsandj rnde nin. k 13e as Premier,<br />
Victoria has enjoyed effective and moderate government.<br />
It is time that'we all got behind Dick and on'erted ourselves<br />
to the utmost to make sure that this message gets across to<br />
the people about what the Liberal Govern-ment in Victoria hat;<br />
meant and will mean toVictoria's future. it mteans stability,<br />
progress. it means a better life for the people of Victoria. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
When the time comes I am certain that Victorians will choose<br />
. Libralism. They will not turn the poi-tieis thjoif cs8 e -ee--<br />
-sto the extremists of the La r Party. They will not hand over.:'<br />
this state to the socialist left to the Hartleys and their<br />
like to the deadening dogma and deadK31mt of--soial+ w<br />
The eighties will be exciting years for all Australia.<br />
Our country will achieve its potential through positive<br />
_ government; through a balanced and realistic assessment of<br />
Australia' s potential. unclouded by the-dfsttor<br />
socialist dogma; by encouraging Australians to use their<br />
-individual initiative and enterprise; and by restoring<br />
incentive for vork and achievement.<br />
In . the weeks and months ahead we must all work together to<br />
see that they will be exciting for Victvr-r by--seing tbat<br />
Dick EBamer and the Victorian Liberal Government is returned<br />
for another three years of sound government for Victoria.<br />
