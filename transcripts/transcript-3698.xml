PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS TO N. S. W. STATE COUNCIL<br />
OF THE SYDNEY<br />
13.4.1975 It was the Fisher Labor Government which inaugurated the<br />
East/ West Railway and yesterday I symbolically inaugurated<br />
the largest railway project in Australia since that time<br />
a railway of about 830 kilometers costing $ 100 million, and<br />
if I may respond to what John Ducker was saying by way of<br />
introduction, this weekend in South Australia we did two<br />
things which I believe indicate what could be done by<br />
co-operation between a Federal and a State Labor Government.<br />
We inaugurated the first subdivision under the Land Commission<br />
of South Australia. This is a proposal which we came out with<br />
in 1972. The Australian Government can't make laws concerning<br />
land use. Every State Government can. -But the Federal<br />
Government's'financial resources are much greater than those'<br />
of the State Governments. If you bring them together, you can<br />
see ' that by Federal finance you can acquire sufficient land<br />
for expanding urban development, and with State co-operation<br />
you can see that that land is fully serviced and is made<br />
available at cost.<br />
We did it on Friday in South Australia. Then we went on to<br />
the middle of Australia and climaxed the remarkable week<br />
in the history of railways in Australia. Because this week<br />
we tabled on Wednesday morning in the House of Representatives<br />
the Heads of Agreement by which the Australian Government will<br />
acquire the South Australian Railways. That night the Senate<br />
passed the Australian National Railways Commission Act and on<br />
Thursday we introduced the legislation for the Interstate<br />
Commission, which is mentioned in the Constitution, and which<br />
was supposed to make it possible to co-ordinate transporta<br />
modes throughout Australia, and I think I can say that by the<br />
end of June we will have oh incidentally, we will later this<br />
month be making similar arrangements with Tasmania to acquire<br />
Tasmanian Railways by the end of June we will have in operation<br />
in South Australia and Tasmania and maybe one or two other<br />
States, the free hospital services throughout Australia.<br />
I point out that these things are perfectly feasible. There<br />
is no Federal intrusion or aggrandisement. There were free<br />
hospitals throughout Australia when Labor went out of office<br />
in 1949, ' under a five year agreement which the Chifley Labor<br />
Government had made with every State Government, Labor and<br />
Liberal, and after the agreements had run their five years,<br />
the Menzies Government did not renew them, and therefore we<br />
ceased to have free hospital services in Australia except in<br />
those States which kept them on through their own resources.<br />
Of course, only one State has done it Queensland. Sure you<br />
have free hospital services there, but they're the worst<br />
anywhere in Australia. </p>
<p>And similarly the Constitution has always said that the<br />
Commonwealth can build or acquire a railway in a State with<br />
the consent of the Government of that State. Now we've done<br />
these things. We've restored free hospitals in the two Labor<br />
States, and we have acquired the railways in the two Labor<br />
S-tates. And if that were done everywhere in Australia, all<br />
this nonsense we hear about the financial burdens of the States<br />
would be ended.<br />
And I put it to you bluntly: We won't remain in power federally,<br />
and you'll not get into power in the States if you fall for<br />
this line which was around at the end of last year that the<br />
way to survive was to blast Canberra. It'll get nobody anywhere.<br />
But by co-operation between the Federal Labor Government and<br />
the two State Labor Governments we have in Australia, we will<br />
have solved the financial problems in those two States. We will<br />
have at last decent railway systems in two States and we will<br />
again have free hospital services in two States.<br />
Now. I come back to what I've said. Since I addressed you last<br />
year, our opponents have-changed leaders, both in the New South<br />
Wales Parliament and the Australian Parliament. The interesting<br />
thing is that the new Liberal leader in New South Wales played<br />
a central role in destroying the Federal Liberal leader.<br />
There are important lessons to be drawn from what was done<br />
to Mr. Snedden. There are lessons not only to be learnt by<br />
the Liberals, but by us.<br />
A basic weakness in Mr. Snedden's position was his inability<br />
to establish a sound relationship between the State non-Labor<br />
Parties and the Federal Liberal Party, particularly after the<br />
Queensland elections in December. The State non-Labor leaders<br />
thought the easy way for them, the cheap road topolitical<br />
popularity was just to knock Canberra, to be as unco-operative<br />
and as obstructive as possible. Now the fact is the St~ te<br />
Parties, whether they be Labor or Liberal, cannot live to<br />
themselves. For good or ill, the people are going to judge<br />
the Parties as one. It's true of both the great Parties, and<br />
especially true of the Labor Party. No member, no candidate,*<br />
no leader will get any kudos from the public by joining any<br />
chorus against Canberra. It is easy enough, but'it is deceptively<br />
easy because the people are not at all impressed.<br />
They know that the Labor Government in Canberra is carrying out<br />
the program of the Australian Labor Party. One program for onc<br />
party. We're all going to be judged by our success or failure<br />
with that program. We will succeed with the program to the<br />
extent that the whole Party at all levels gets behind it and<br />
goes out to sell it. There are two aspects about the program<br />
which call for a special effort by all members to promote it.<br />
It's that a great many of our programs are first designed to<br />
benefit those in the community who can't speak for themselves,<br />
or who can't make their voices heard very well. Another aspect<br />
is that some very important issues such as equal electorates and<br />
equal representation don't always make an immediate or dramatic<br />
appeal to the imagination of the general public or, it must be<br />
said, for our own members and supporters. </p>
<p>The programs most likely to be changed, the programs most<br />
likely to be reversed by our opponents, are those which benefit<br />
the inarticulate and the underprivileged. The programs marked<br />
for the axe are those which benefit those with the least<br />
political leverage. Mr. Fraser has already made it plain that<br />
he will campaign for massive cuts in Government spending.<br />
No more than his predecessor will he be very specific about<br />
the areas in which he would make those cuts. But the<br />
irresistible logic, the logic of economics, the logic of<br />
politics is that the cuts would be made in the politically<br />
expendable areas. Now who is politically expendable for<br />
Mr. Fraser? All those underprivileged groups who were entirely<br />
neglected in their 23 years in office, whose needs we have tried<br />
to identify and to meet. There is already a ready-made list of<br />
expendable programs, the programs imperilled by the High Court<br />
challenge on the constitutional validity of the Australian<br />
Assistance Plan and the Regional Employment Development Scheme.<br />
The challenge was initiated by the Victorian Government and it<br />
is su~ pported by the New South Wales Government. All these<br />
programs benefit the relatively inarticulate or underprivileged.<br />
The beneficiaries are for the most part scarcely in a position<br />
to speak up for themselves. This is why they, as our fellow<br />
citizens, are so vulnerable. This is why programs designed to<br />
benefit them are politically so vulnerable. If we don't speak<br />
up for those programs, if we don't speak up for the people who<br />
would be deprived by their abolition, then no-one else will.<br />
It's impossible to find any consistence in the approach of the<br />
New South Wales Government to our programs. It would be wrong<br />
for me to give the impression that the story has been one of<br />
total non-co-operation. There has in fact been a great deal of<br />
co-operation, although there has too often been needless delay<br />
even in areas where the New South Wales Government has ultimately<br />
decided to come to the party.<br />
It would be churlish not to acknowledge one matter in which<br />
there has been praiseworthy co-operation from the New South<br />
Wales Government, making available highly qualified people to<br />
assist in Australian Government enquiries and commissions.<br />
A great number of New South Wales judges have been made available<br />
by Sir Robert Askin to serve on our enquiries and commnissions.<br />
Let me give you one instance here, where I must say I'm<br />
disappointed by the obstruction one finds in the Labor movement,<br />
and particularly-in the Trade Union movement. It is the proposal<br />
for national compensation. True we've had for years ever since<br />
the Lang Labor Government we've had compulsory workers'<br />
compensation in New South Wales, and ever since the McKell<br />
Government we've had compulsory third party insurance for people<br />
injured on the roads.<br />
But there are still a great number of people for whom there is<br />
no cover at all, and for those where there is cover, or where<br />
there appears to be, it is quite problematical how much you'll<br />
get and how long you'll have to wait for it. Now we've come<br />
out with full proposals here, and it is amazing the link there<br />
is between some trade union people and the insurance companies<br />
in obstruction. </p>
<p>The fact is that the existing schemes leave thousands<br />
unprotected. For example, people who are injured at home,<br />
many of them women. Our scheme will compensate and<br />
rehabilitate people who are injured or become ill anywhere.<br />
It will be done automatically, and there will be a proper<br />
income until they are rehabilitated.<br />
Now this has been something which many of us have spoken about<br />
for years. It has been in the Party platform for some years.<br />
It was in the policy speech in 1972 and in 1974. 1 must say<br />
I am disappointed, and I resent it that some union secretaries<br />
make an alliance with lawyers and with insurance companies to<br />
keep the old system.<br />
That is are we to be the conservative party? Whose interests<br />
do we have in mind? Now here again the beneficiaries of a<br />
Labor reform are not well organised and they're not able to<br />
drum up pressure. By contrast the opponents, or obstructionists<br />
are well organised some unions, lawyers, insurance companieb.<br />
Someone has to speak up for those who are not in a position<br />
to make their voices heard in any powerful or well-organised<br />
way. That is a Job for all of us in the Labor Party, not just<br />
a few ministers. I do hope all of you will see what is at stake<br />
here, and will speak up for it.<br />
There is not much point in putting things in the platform and<br />
getting a Government which tries to carry out the platform and<br />
then have people, including those in the Labor Party, with very<br />
dubious allies jeopardising it and sabotaging it. Now this is<br />
not only a moral obligation for members of a Party like ourselves.<br />
It is not just an obligation we have because these programs are<br />
part of our pledges put twice to the people. Strong support for<br />
these programs makes sound political sense, at the-. State level<br />
as well as the national level. There is no dividend for state<br />
branches in downgrading national programs or trying to draqw a<br />
distinction between State and national policies.<br />
I heard on the radio that Neville Wran was making the point this<br />
morning in addressing you that the present State Government was<br />
seriously neglecting the growing areas of this State and was<br />
showing concern solely for those areas where it felt it had<br />
political obligations itself.<br />
Now I know that a very great number of people, including people<br />
in State branches and State Parliament resent it if one exposes<br />
shortcomings in the State. That is surely a false patriotism<br />
to assert that everything in the State garden is lovely. It is<br />
not. And we got into power federally because we were able to<br />
convince the people in Sydney and Melbourne in particular that<br />
there were things grievously wrong in the State backyards, that<br />
they could be cured if there was federal interest shown in them,<br />
but they would only be cured if there was a Federal Labor<br />
Government showing interest in them. </p>
<p>Now many people in the Party think well this means that we<br />
are neglecting existing areas. I'd like you to take this<br />
approach to it. If we were to find a country town grow up<br />
every year of the size of the increase in population in Sydney<br />
we'd want to see that that country town had proper schools<br />
and hospitals and transport connections and so on.<br />
But because it happens in an already large place, like Sydney<br />
or Melbourne, we're neglected. Now what we're saying what<br />
Neville Wran says this morning, what I say this afternoon is<br />
that we must look after those western and southern suburbs,<br />
we are merely acknowledging that governments have an obligation<br />
to people wherever they choose to live, and it's those suburbs<br />
that are the growing areas in this State. It's not that one is<br />
neglecting the areas which are already full, which are already<br />
supplied, which are already serviced, which are relatively<br />
static in population, it merely-is that we say that if people<br />
have to go and live or choose to go and live in those new<br />
areas then it's our obligation, as a Party seeking office to<br />
see that the Governments which we elect of which we are the<br />
supporters and members see that there are proper services<br />
in those new areas.<br />
If you have a city of 20,000 in the country you'd certainly<br />
see that it had proper services. If an equivalent population<br />
comes in some part of the metropolitan area it's no less<br />
obligatory on us to see that there are services there. Now<br />
it is true that since the War, there have been a considerable<br />
number of large country towns which have grown up. The<br />
population of Wollongong for instance has much more than doubled<br />
since the War, or of Mt. Isa, or of Gladstone, or Whyalla, and<br />
very properly governments have seen that they get services<br />
to match.<br />
In Sydney and Melbourne where an equivalent population arises,<br />
State Governments in general have neglected them, and it'gno<br />
less than the statistical truth to say that in the western<br />
suburbs of Sydney there are not the hospital facilities that<br />
there are in the areas where the population is more static as<br />
in the country or the older parts of Sydney. And there are<br />
not the facilities for teachers' colleges or technical colleges<br />
or colleges of advanced education or universities in those areas<br />
that there are in the longer-settled parts of the city.<br />
And it is a false patriotism which says that the Federal<br />
Government has no role to play in interstate highways: of<br />
course it hias. It has an obligation under the Constitution<br />
to look after trade and commerce with other countries and<br />
between the States.<br />
With the Hume Highway, the busiest road in the southern<br />
hemisphere, and one of the worst, the State Governments-. have<br />
not been able to make a decent road. Are people to complain<br />
when you have a Federal Government which will accept its<br />
obligation to see that roads like that at least are made<br />
trafficable all the year round? </p>
<p>And again, there are areas such as this port of Sydney, the<br />
busiest port in the southern hemisphere, but a grossly<br />
inefficient port. There again it deals with interstate or<br />
international trade, and it ought to be the function of a<br />
Federal Government to see that the communications with that<br />
port from other ports are made efficient.<br />
This is not an intrusion. It is a responsibility of the<br />
Australian Government under the Constitution and we ought to<br />
see that the port is improved. If you lend yourself to the<br />
argument that the Federal Government shouldn't come into the<br />
Hume Highway, or shouldn't come into the port of Sydney,<br />
you're just saying that the Hume Highway is going to continue<br />
to be inadequate and the port of Sydney is going to get less<br />
and less efficient.<br />
Now the way to win a New South Wales State election is to show<br />
that the State Labor Government will co-operate in the areas<br />
and the programs where the Lewis Government has been inactive<br />
or obstructile. When the people have to choose between solid<br />
progriams, solid benefits, and slogans or shiboleths about State<br />
rights, they will come down on the side of the genuine article.<br />
But they have to know what the choice really is. And that means<br />
all of us have to put the case as fully and as forcefully as<br />
we can.<br />
I myself earlier mentioned about the question of distribution<br />
of electorates and so on. Let me give you the figures for<br />
this State because I believe they will illustrate one of the<br />
things where one will be able to draw a very easy comparison<br />
between us and our opponents in the coming months.<br />
The population of an electorate in the House of Representatives<br />
in this state ought to be 63,000, i. e. the average of the<br />
whole State divided by the number of electorates. But tIW<br />
proportion at the moment varies grossly. There are some'I<br />
electorates which are 32% above that amount, i. e. an enrollment<br />
of 83,000 and there are some which are 26% below, namely<br />
46,600. Now if you have electorates that different 83,000 and 46<br />
thousand quite-obviously the people in those electorates are<br />
not having an equal say in electing Members of Parliament.<br />
They're not having an equal share in making the laws. They're<br />
not having equal access to the things which Governments have<br />
to provide. Theseare not exceptions. These are ones which you<br />
can see in many cases. Now I quoted one electorate which had<br />
83,000 people on the rolls at the moment: that is the electorate<br />
of Mitchell. There's another, Robertson which has 81,000.<br />
Chifley has 80,000. MacArthur has-79,000, and Macquarie, a<br />
country electorate incidentally, has 74,000. Now take the<br />
other ones. The smallest one which I have quoted 46 thousand<br />
is Darling. There is Hume which has just under 50,000. There<br />
is Sydney, obviously a metropolitan electorate which has 51,400.<br />
There is Riverina 52,000, and Wentworth, again, a city<br />
electorate, 52,000. Now this is not a fair 4o. </p>
<p>Some people might say " Oh, you mustn't touch these things.<br />
People will think there is something crook about it." The<br />
fact is it won't deter the Government from supporting an<br />
equal form of distribution. It is the fair thing. It is<br />
the just thing, and it is possible to come out with a<br />
distribution where no electorate has more than 5,000 people<br />
on the rolls than any other electorate in a State.<br />
What we've come out with the distribution which has been<br />
made, which is being proposed ensures that those with the<br />
smallest enrollment are the electorates which are growing<br />
fastest, and those with the largest are those which are growing<br />
slowest.<br />
Now I do ask you to stand on your principles in these things.<br />
You'll get no votes, you'll get no respect by departing from<br />
your principles, and if you look at the facts, you can embarrass<br />
your opponents. You will get respect and success for us.<br />
Silence, obstkuction, conservatism or timidity on such matters<br />
as the equal electorates or what I've mentioned earlier,<br />
national compensation, will not gain votes in a State election<br />
not least because the Australian Government, and I too, will<br />
not cease to advocate. We are not going to back-track on the<br />
platform, or on the undertakings given in the policy speeches.<br />
We have no alternatives. It is a commitment we cannot escape.<br />
It is a commitment for the whole Party. It is a commitment<br />
that no-one in the Party can escape.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, don't let's think that just by running<br />
dead or knocking the Government you've had, that you'll help<br />
it or you'll get a State one. The way to provail is to carry<br />
through against the attacks of our opponents, the obstruction<br />
of our opponents, the attacks, the obstruction in the Parliament,<br />
in the papers, in the courts. We won on these platforms and we<br />
will win again on these platforms. If we weaken, if we ae<br />
divided on them we won't survive ourselves and nobody else will<br />
do any better, either, in any section of the Party. </p>
