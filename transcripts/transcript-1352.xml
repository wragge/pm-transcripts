Television interview between<br />
B. B. C. Correspondent. John Osman. and<br />
the Prime I'Linister. 11r. Harold Holt 7th Julv o 1266<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, what significance do you attach to Mr.<br />
W-ilson's forthcoming visit to Moscow?<br />
1M. HOLT: Well, I hope it will do something to improve relations.<br />
I said in America earlier this week that I thought we had to<br />
try every means we could to break the impasse ahich has<br />
developed around the world. As I said there, you can't go on<br />
thinking that the world is divided into " goodies" and " baddies"<br />
and all the goodies are on your side and the baddies are all on<br />
the other, because I am sure the other fellow is thinking just<br />
that way himself. We know there are intelligent people in<br />
both sections.<br />
Q. You would welcome, wiould you, any reconvening of the<br />
Geneva Conference with Britain and Russia as co-chairrnn?<br />
11R. HOLT: In respect of Vietnam?<br />
Q. Yes.<br />
I. HOLT: I would wiant notice of that particular question but we are<br />
all working for a negotiated peace and if this is an effective<br />
way of securing it we would be glad to go along with it.<br />
Q. But you are not altogether convinced about this<br />
IllR. HOLT: Viell, I don't kno,, wt-hat is proposed. It's a long time<br />
since I looked at the details of the Geneva negotiations but<br />
effective negotiations in iihich 6. e secure a result which is<br />
not just a piece of plaster patched over the problem would be<br />
welcomed by us.<br />
Q. Can you tell me how you feel about Mr. Wilson's<br />
disassociation of Britain from the American bombing near Hanoi?<br />
! Lii. HOLT: Mr. Wilson has his problems and the view from here may<br />
be a different view from the view we see down under. But,<br />
from our point of view, 1ve regard what is happening in Vietnam<br />
as a great critical struggle for people throughout the world,<br />
eventually reaching the people throughout the world, not just<br />
confined to South Vietnam itself, and for us it is part of<br />
the future of Asia which is being resolved here and a very<br />
important part of its future progress.<br />
Q. So it would be fair to say that you are disappointed in<br />
Mr. \ ilson's disao3ociatiDn?<br />
12R. HOLT: I recognise the problems that he has, but we would, of<br />
course, have liked this to be recognised as a necessary part<br />
of the policy which I had gathered the United Kingdom<br />
Government had given its general support to. </p>
<p>Q. Do you think that these obvious divergences in policy<br />
between you and M~ r. Wi~ lson are likely to have any long<br />
term effect on Anglo-Australian relations?<br />
TM. HOLT: No, certainly not. The Anglo-Australian relationship is<br />
not only deep but abiding, and the fact that there will be<br />
differences from time to time history doesn't stand still.<br />
Events are moving fast in our part of the w.-orld. I pointed out<br />
this morning that one in four of young people in Australia are<br />
mnigrcants or people who have come there as the result of parents<br />
being migrants, and so it's not always the same Australia but<br />
always I hope there w~ ill be this warm relationship with the<br />
United Kingdom.<br />
Q. Now you have said that it is a matter for regret that<br />
Australian forces for the first time in history are not<br />
fighting in association with those of the United Kingdom.<br />
Would you like to see greater British support for the United<br />
States in Vietnam, and I mean particularly men as viell as<br />
mterials?<br />
MM. HIOLT: We would like to see a United Kingdom presence there<br />
giving moral support. I don't think anybody ;. 7i11 be looking<br />
for substantial British forces, but the United Kingdomn<br />
Government has made its oosition clear on this and we respect<br />
the fact that they will have given their own full consideration<br />
to all aspects of the matter and they have come to their<br />
decisions as wie have come to ours. I am only mentioning what<br />
we would like to see.<br />
Q. V" Rhat do you mean by a British presence there?<br />
MR2. HOLT: dell, if there were British troops, even in some limited<br />
nu~ mber, present, as there are from other friendly forces around<br />
the area. The Thais for example are contributing a military<br />
establishment of quite limited degree, but at least the<br />
Americans don't feel they are being left to carry this<br />
tremiendous burden for the world as a whole.<br />
Q. You were reported under fire in a section of the Australian<br />
press for being what they call " chillingly naive" in your<br />
endorsement of American policy. What do you have to say about<br />
-this?<br />
IR. HOLT: Well, if I cam remain chillingly naive after 30 years in<br />
public life, it just shows that one can preserve the freshness<br />
of innocence untouched, but really w-hen I think back to the<br />
time when a Labour Prime Minister declared that Australia would<br />
be behind Great Britain in the military challenge of that time<br />
to the last man and the last shilling, I don't think he was<br />
being naive or fulsome in his supoort of what he believe in at<br />
that point of time.<br />
Q. You are also accused, I must say in the same section of<br />
the Australian press, of -an abject surrender of Australian<br />
initiative in foreign policy. Have you anything to say about<br />
that?<br />
M. HOLT: 0ell, I think it's almost too stupid to requr nase<br />
and I'm glad to feel from n'y own quite intimate consultations<br />
and comm~ unications, both with the President of the United States<br />
and the Prime Minister of this country, that the views that<br />
Australia expresses on matters of consequence are noted and are<br />
not v~ ithout effect. </p>
<p>3.<br />
Q. Apart from Vietnam, the whole w-ider question of British<br />
commitment east of Suez is still the subject of speculation.<br />
Will you be seeking assurances from Mr. Wilson that Britain<br />
won't water down her commnitments too much?<br />
MR,. HOLT: No, because I've already had the assurances which related<br />
to the arrangements we discussed earlier in the year. I'm<br />
much more concerned east of Suez, in the positive developing<br />
economic sense. I don't think the United Kingdom can afford<br />
either to turn its back or remain aloof from the great developments<br />
i. 7Lich are occurring in this area which is stirring into<br />
activity to a very impressive degree.<br />
Q. I understand that discussions are continuing between<br />
British and Australian military teams about the long-term<br />
possibility of establishing bases in Australia as an alternative<br />
to Singapore. How are those talks going?<br />
EM. HOLT: W'e ll, w,-e've carried out our side of the bargain as we<br />
have discussed it w-. ith Mr. Healey earlier in the year. There<br />
have been good talks at the staff level against contingencies<br />
which could occur in the future. We feel it is desirable to<br />
maintain a British presence in the North and with us in<br />
association wuith British troops stationed there. Wle feel that<br />
not only is this defensively preferable, but it does help to<br />
provide this moderating-_, stabilising influence which is a great<br />
contribution which British character and prestige can contribute<br />
to the emergence of a more stable, more prosperous and more<br />
secure South East Asia.<br />
Q. A final question, and on another subject. You are a<br />
former Treasurer and you will be seeing the Chancellor of the<br />
Exchequer. Will you be making any protest about recent British<br />
investment restrictions on developed Commonvrealth countiies?<br />
1' 2. HOLT: No, protest is too strong a word. Whvat I w.. ould hope to be<br />
able to show,-the Chancellor is that it is in the long term<br />
interests of the United Kingdom to encourage the development of<br />
my own country. We hold our reserves principally in sterling<br />
and, as Australia becomos stronger, more densely populated and<br />
more secure, not only do our reserves increase, strengthening<br />
your owin, but we are able to play a larger part in the defence<br />
and international aid in that area of the world.<br />
Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. </p>
