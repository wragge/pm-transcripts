PRIME MRAINISTE<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH SIMON CLARKE, TODAY SHOW,<br />
19 SEPTEMBER 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
CLARKE: Well Prime Minister, I guess the thing that<br />
people will be asking, the mood was so positive before<br />
and after that presentation. What went wrong?<br />
PM: We didn't get the votes. But you put your finger on,<br />
it, Simon. What in a sense really sticks in the craw is,<br />
you know, the general rush we had to us of people after<br />
our presentation congratulating Australia on its<br />
presentation and it occurred again tonight when I went in<br />
to the Great Assembly before it was announced. One and<br />
I mean very, very prominent in the Olympic movement<br />
went out of his way to come up to me and he's a tough<br />
sort of fellow he said I want to tell you that in my<br />
whole history of association with the international<br />
Olympic movement there have been two great presentations,<br />
and he said Chirac and the French and Hawke with<br />
Australia and that was unsolicited and that was, as you<br />
know, I mean it was all around the place. I think<br />
Australians, you know, have cause to be a little bit<br />
worried when you know that your bid was so good, the<br />
presentation was well done and it's not reflected in the<br />
votes. I think that's a bit worrying.<br />
CLARKE: Are you suggesting there may have been some<br />
other motives-<br />
PM: I'm not questioning anyone's integrity. Let me make<br />
that quite clear. But one has to wonder whether<br />
financial considerations do come into it in terms of TV<br />
rights and what people are able to offer in those<br />
circumstances. It's very difficult, I think, to<br />
understand and I do want your viewers to know that this<br />
is not sour grapes, I mean I really hope we're all able<br />
to lose graciously and I hope we are. But I'm seriously<br />
concerned about the future position where North America<br />
has it in 1984 and then again in ' 96, Toronto polling<br />
very well ahead of us, North America. Are decisions, to<br />
some extent, being affected by what sort of distribution<br />
there may be able to be from television rights in a<br />
particular region rather than another? I mean if that is<br />
part of what these people because they think there's<br />
going to be more to be distributed I say it not in a<br />
venal sense but it ought to be distributed. Well what </p>
<p>2<br />
does that do for the concept of the universality of<br />
Olympism? CLARKE: So are you saying there's some kind of barrier<br />
in the minds of IOC members to allowing the Games to come<br />
to the Southern Hemisphere?<br />
PM: Well all one can say is that we were all staggered<br />
by the way in which, after our presentation, quite<br />
gratuitously delegates and officials went out of their<br />
way to praise the bid and the presentation. I mean one<br />
senior official saying the best presentation in memory.<br />
Now we're not saying those things. We think we did<br />
pretty well in the presentation but others are saying it.<br />
Now if you've got the facts, you've got the facilities,<br />
you've got the environment, you've got the sports fanatic<br />
population and you've done an historically good<br />
presentation then what are people going to say?<br />
