PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, KELMSCOTT FOOTBALL CLUB,<br />
PERTH, 25 NOVEMBER 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, it looks like the Labor<br />
Government could hang on over there, it must be a boon?<br />
S PM: I understand that the Labor Government has won. It<br />
deserved to. There's been some swing against, but it's not<br />
a massive one and very importantly there has been no joy in<br />
this for the Liberal Party. The minor parties seem to have<br />
picked up, been the major beneficiaries of the swing that<br />
there has been. But I want to say to John Bannon<br />
congratulations. He's a very, very considerable man, a good<br />
Premier. I'm glad that the Government of South Australia is<br />
going to be in his hands for the next three years.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the swing. Is that a protest<br />
against high interest rates?<br />
PM: You can't identify what the elements are, but there'd<br />
have to be some element of that in it. But it's impossible<br />
to say just precisely, you know, how that's composed. The<br />
important thing is that the Liberals are seen as lacking<br />
substance, there's no answer there. The policies that we've<br />
got we've tried to explain why they're necessary. As I keep<br />
on saying, I'm not a masochist, I'm not a sadist. We don't<br />
want to hurt the people, we don't want to hurt ourselves,<br />
but it's necessary for a while to have those rates there so<br />
that we can protect the country into the future. But the<br />
important thing about South Australia is, as I've said, the<br />
decision had to be who was going to govern South Australia<br />
for the next three years. That's the issue and I'm very,<br />
very grateful that the people of South Australia decided<br />
that it should be John. Bannon because he deserves that<br />
honour. JOURNALIST: Considering his win, when will you go to the<br />
polls, Mr Hawke? </p>
<p>PM: It's got nothing to do the outcome of the South<br />
Australian election wasn't going to determine my decision on<br />
that matter. I mean, we've got an election coming up in<br />
Queensland next week and I hope we'll get the outcome there<br />
that is proper for the people of Queensland because there,<br />
the issue is obviously one central issue. That's the<br />
question of corruption in Queensland and I believe that<br />
Wayne Goss is the man, the only man, who can provide good,<br />
clean, efficient government for Queensland. I hope that<br />
will be the outcome of next Saturday.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, a swing of five percent. Any change in<br />
policies PM: Well, there is no swing of five percent. That is not<br />
the figure.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well, any change to Federal policies<br />
PM: No, as I've said, as far as I'm concerned the question<br />
there was who was going to govern South Australia. I don't<br />
change economic policy on the basis of what I think is going<br />
to be just electorally desirable. I mean if I wanted to get<br />
some cheap short term kudos, I could just say alright, down<br />
come interest rates, but that would be irresponsible at the<br />
moment. I must insist I don't have interest rates high for<br />
fun, I don't want them to hurt anyone. I don't want to hurt<br />
myself, but I would hurt the Australian economy if I was to<br />
lower them precipitately at this time. We've just got to<br />
level of f the economy a little bit, when that happens then<br />
interest rates will come down.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what do you understand the size<br />
of the swing is in South Australia? We've just been<br />
listening to Andrew Peacock on the radio saying<br />
PM: Yes, well you ought to have learned by now this is a<br />
very desperate man. Just to look at his behaviour in the<br />
Parliament last week. I mean a pathetic performance there<br />
and what you've got now is a Liberal Party which has<br />
undertaken a very, very remarkable course. They started at<br />
the beginning of the last week by saying it was going to be<br />
a dirty campaign and then dive their hands into the bucket<br />
of grime and they've been throwing it ever since. Now if Mr<br />
Peacock wants to delude himself that that's the outcome,<br />
that the Liberal Party has been the beneficiary in South<br />
Australia, no-one will be happier than Bob Hawke that he<br />
reads it that way.<br />
( Question about George Gear's chances of a position in the<br />
ministry) PM: He's got a very, very good chance.<br />
ends </p>
