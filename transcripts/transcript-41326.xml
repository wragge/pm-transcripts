<p>Congratulations Socceroos!</p>
<p>29 months, 22 games and last night you’ve qualified and you’re on the way to Moscow and the World Cup.</p>
<p>And today is 12 years since John Aloisi scored that goal against Uruguay.</p>
<p>Mark Milligan was there, he was there, he was just a child at the time. He’s still in the team.</p>
<p>What a fantastic anniversary. What a great game.</p>
<p>Mile Jedinak, the Captain – 3 goals. That’s the captain’s knock. The captained knocked three times. Great job.</p>
<p>Great job Socceroos!</p>
<p>On to the World Cup. On to Russia. On to victory!</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
