VISIT TO C. 1' DA XiD UTT' . K<br />
LOS YIEL3S, U. S. A.<br />
ADDfLS BY THE PRIME 7 ITiER, P Ãµ R. HRPfOLD HOLT<br />
TO THiE L03 . f TLELO 1TRLD AFFI2R CTJUICIL 51ST MAY, 1967.<br />
It is a very great personal pleasure for Mrs. Holt and<br />
myself to be here in Los Angeles. I don't supnose there is an<br />
area of the United States where we have more close personal<br />
friends than we do in this city and my problem usually is to<br />
find some giod official reason for coming here and renewing my<br />
acquaintance with them. Thank you for providing at least one<br />
occasion which is a notable one even in the eyes of my own<br />
compatriots, ecause the 7orld Atfairs Council has a prestie<br />
which has reached out well eyond the shor s of your own country,<br />
and I regard it as an honour to have the opportunity of talking<br />
to this repr sentative and very distinguished gathering of citizens<br />
from the * est Coast of the United States of America.<br />
It is perharns not inannropriate that I meet you on the<br />
day following your celebration bf 1, emorial Day. e have in<br />
Australia a somewhat similar comnmemoration on what le call our<br />
Anzac Day that is the day which really marks the emergence<br />
of nationiood for my country when in 1 15, April 25, tie Australian<br />
and Nev Zealand forces landed on the shores of lallipoli and there<br />
forged, in their comradeship together, the word Anzac which has<br />
come to mean so much emotionally to us over the years, and each<br />
year, or the anniversary of that day, we hold what is the most<br />
solemn non-religious ouservance on any day of the ye'ar in our<br />
country, and so I can well appnreciate the feelings which have been<br />
passing through the minds of aillions of citizens of this great<br />
epuolic as you have commemorated American p'articioation in struggles<br />
for freedom down through the years of your history and at a time<br />
when so many of your young manood is involved in the conflict in<br />
Vietnam and in pre. erving the peace in other parts of the world.<br />
I have always an interest and almost a fascination in<br />
this city of Los Angeles and, indeed, of California -enerally<br />
because in the ministerial career to which Mr. iHodgkiss has so<br />
kindly made mention, I was for seven years Iinister of Immigration<br />
in my own country and we haive, as you probaoly know, a vast land<br />
mass approximately t; he same dimension as the United itates of<br />
America if you will allow me to exclude ' laska and Hawaii. But of<br />
metropolitan United State3 we have approximately the same dimension,<br />
but we haven't more than 190 000,000 people we are just pushing<br />
up to 12,0Q, OO000 people, Yet there was a time not so very lonT<br />
ago before . orld * r II when the population of Californiat and The<br />
population of Australia was the same we both had 7,000,000 people<br />
and I used to be told, as Minister of Immigrition, that you coul't<br />
increase the population effectively by more than aoout 2Y/ o per<br />
annum that the load on resources and the proulems, social and<br />
others created would make this impracticable for you.<br />
As I looked across the Pacific to what going on in<br />
this State of Cqlifornia I could see a very much more rapid _ rowth<br />
rate occurrin, there and of course, you have fir outstrippe us.<br />
You are now, understan approaching your 20th million in this / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
country, while we are still moving towards our 12th, having<br />
started tolether at 7 not so very long ago. But you won't mind<br />
my saying That it is a rather different pro7osition to build<br />
population when you have to draw on so many other nationalities,<br />
and there are today fourteen nationalities substantially<br />
represented in the Australian community most of whom have come<br />
to us in the post-war years. When you do not have, as you are so<br />
fortunate to have in this countr, the vast resources of capital<br />
on which to draw in order to ouil the community, and fortunately<br />
for California, fortunately for the United States and, I oelieve,<br />
fortunately for the free world, California has been able to take<br />
advantage of the movement of people from other ] arts of America<br />
and the resources of capital which you have here, the more ready<br />
assimilability of your fellow countrymen into the California<br />
environment. But having said that and acknowledied it with appreciation<br />
and deep gratification, I wouldn't want you to think that, because<br />
we are a people of less than 12 millions striving as best we can<br />
to increase by assisted migration from so many countries that we<br />
are not a significant country in the scheme oi thin's and certainly<br />
that we lack significance in an area of the world which is becoming<br />
increasingly vital for you. Let me just give you a few facts to<br />
support what I am putting to you.<br />
In the first place, we rank amongst the first twelve<br />
trading nations in the world. India is regarded very properly as<br />
a very considerable country, it has 42 times our population, but<br />
it has only twice the value of our gross national product.<br />
Indonesia is re arded as a very considerable country in our area<br />
of the world. It has a populition of more than 100 millions, more<br />
than nine times the population of Australia. It has only one-third<br />
of the value of gross national production of my country.<br />
Je have a very special relationship with the United States<br />
and with the United Kingdom which makes us a good friend and ally<br />
and a helpful friend in particular situations. You mentioned, &gt; x.<br />
Hodkiss, the fact that I had recently been to four countries in<br />
South-East Asia. One of these, Cambodia is a country which does<br />
not enjoy diplomatic relations with the United 3tates. Those<br />
relations were severed as you will know some time ago. But<br />
Australia represents the United States' interests in Cambodia and<br />
Australia represents C. mbodian interests in South Vietnam. So we<br />
are able, in our own way, to serve a useful and helpful purpose<br />
in preserving good relationships and in assisting the transactions<br />
which necessarily must occur between one country and another.<br />
I think I can fairly claim that there can be very few,<br />
if any, Heads of Government that can be found around the world<br />
today who would have been accepted in all of the four countries<br />
which I have just visited. Some could have gone to one or two or<br />
three of them but very few people who would, on the known policies<br />
of those countries, and Cambodia would probbolv be the most difficult<br />
of access, have been accepted in all four. Indeed there is a ban on<br />
Western journalists in Cambodia but a plane load of pressmen<br />
accompanied me on my journey an this ban was waived for that particular<br />
visit. So Australia, not possessing any taint in the eyes of the<br />
countries of . sia of having a colonial power nast, is accepted as a<br />
friendly country. They know that we have hid to strugrle with the<br />
problem of developing a vast continent, not all of it favoirable<br />
in either its climate nor its terrain, but which has lent itself to<br />
rich development thanks to the energy and courage of a pioneering<br />
people. They have watched this and they welcome the guidance we<br />
can jring to them. While it is fashionable in some intellectual<br />
quarters to talk about the desirability of getting, to put it in / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
the crude terms they express, white faces off tue mainland of<br />
Asia, all our experience and all the trends, or cattiinly<br />
the more significant trends of contemporary history, are moving<br />
in the other direction. -e are finding a desire t0 co-operate,<br />
a desire to team together for mutually helpful purposes. I<br />
have only to mention such recent institutions as ASPAC, the<br />
Asian Development Bank, the sort of collaboration which occurs<br />
in SEATO, the teamwork which was represented at the Summit<br />
Conference at Manila as instances of the kind of thing I mean.<br />
You have mentioned Mr. Chairman, that I shall be visiting the<br />
United Kingdom to discuss British intentions regarding their<br />
troop dispositions East of Suez, and I can assure you that,<br />
knowing fully the mind of the Governments of Malaysia and<br />
Singapore, they welcome our presence and the British military<br />
presence on their territory as a factor contriouting to stability,<br />
moderation and security in that area of the world. So you will gather<br />
from these facts that this small country, measured in terms of<br />
people but rich in potentil, with considerable agricultural<br />
production ranking us amongst one of the great exporters of the<br />
world, with fabulous mineral resources, the new discoveries of<br />
which we are finding l. imost week by week with the kind of<br />
influence we can exert through our friendship with your own<br />
country, with ! reat Britain and the countries of the Commonwealth,<br />
and the friendships we have develoned in Asia, Australia is able<br />
to play a role which is not without significance for free people<br />
and for the causes of freedom thro uhout the world today. .' e<br />
haven't asked others to do the job for us.<br />
It is true that we are linked with the United States in<br />
the AIZUS Pact under which the United States, Australia and New<br />
Zealand have agreed to come to the aid of each other in event of<br />
aggression against one or the other, but we don't feel any sense<br />
of eith: r condescension or inferiority in this because we have<br />
played our own part in two . orld 7ars. It may interest some of<br />
you of the younger generation who have perhaps not oeen made aware<br />
of the fact, that Australia actually lost more man killed in the<br />
First World Wir than did the United States. We were the first<br />
alongside you in the struggle in Korea and we have been early with<br />
you in the struggle in Vietnam, and there we are a great land<br />
mass lying on your Pacific flank.<br />
, e know that it would be against the security interests of<br />
the United States ever to have Australia in unfriendly hands. For<br />
our part, we are determined to do what we can to ensure that this<br />
will not happen. Again it may interest you to know that not only<br />
do we withhold from consumption for our own needs a higher percentage<br />
of our gross national Product than any other country, with the<br />
exception of Japan, an we need to do this for purposes of defence.<br />
7e need to do it for the needs of our growing population.<br />
You in California have had a very rapid rate of growth<br />
and, I am sure, those who are in official positions here and have<br />
to cope with the problems of rrowth know just what those stresses<br />
can mean to a country, but taking the United States as a whole,<br />
the annual growth rate in terms of population is not all that<br />
fret. It is higher than in the United Kingdom. It is considerably<br />
lower than it is in my own country and if you had to cope with t. 0<br />
rate of population growth comparable with thit in Australia you<br />
would find it necessary to construct an additional 500,000 homes<br />
for your growing population with the schools the hospitals, the<br />
trmsport ition systems, all the other capital facilities that a<br />
growing population requires.<br />
So we have on the one hand these pre.: sures on our resources / 4<br />
r </p>
<p>-4-<br />
in order that we may grow is nation, we hive the obligation<br />
which we cheerfully accepted to make a reasonaole contribution to the<br />
joint defence efforts in the area and our proportion of gross<br />
national product going into defence is greater than that of any<br />
of the Western countries, with the exception of your own country and<br />
of the United Kingdom. Je have not overlooked the obligations<br />
we have in the field of civil aid outside our country, and again<br />
it may interest you to oe told, seeing that we give our aid without<br />
any strin s attached, no loans, all in the form of rrants or<br />
technical assistance that per head of population, the civil<br />
aid flowiny from Australia ranks third amongst the countries<br />
of the world and is even higher than that pei head of the United<br />
States or of the United Kingdom.<br />
Now, let me say something about Vietnam in particular.<br />
You mentioned the Middle East, Chairman. I don t claim to<br />
be any considerable authority on that area of the world and<br />
indeed, fr-nkly although I know it is occupying a reat deal<br />
of attention and exercising a considerable amount of concern at<br />
the present time, I don't myself see it developing as seriously<br />
as some of the pundits would suggest. I don't oelieve for a<br />
moment that any of the major powers want a Third iorld ' r and<br />
it is my own celief, ner aps an optimistic one but it is a<br />
jud-ment, that this flurry in the Middle East will settle down<br />
in the course of time the ill-feeling uetween the Ara. ic<br />
countries and Israel has been chronic ever since Israel has<br />
struggled to establish a nation here under most difficult<br />
circumstances and, for my part, I don't see it as becoming a<br />
matter of glocal concern in the sense of global involvement,<br />
but we have never from the word " go" been under nmy illusion or<br />
delusion as to the . oriousness of the issue in Vietnam. Just<br />
as we were the first to declare ourselves alongside you in Korea<br />
when we saw this as a purposeful communist attempt to establish<br />
domination over that area'of the world, and felt that if this<br />
were allowed to go unchecked so this process would continue<br />
down through the rest of South-East Asia and, indeed reach out<br />
to other ' arts of Asia is well, so we hive seen the Vietnam<br />
conflict in much the same terms from the outset.<br />
This has been a much more complex and difficult business<br />
than that which we faced with aritish and other Commonwealth forces<br />
in what was then known as Mnalya, out there you had the challene<br />
of communist guerrilla activity seeking to sauotage destroy and<br />
subvert the community there, with a view to having finally communist<br />
domination in that area of the world and it took us many long<br />
years in a situation which ' as not nearly as complex as that we<br />
Tace in Vietnam, where the numbers were very much smaller, but<br />
we finally succeeded.<br />
' hen I was over here last year I did make considerable<br />
reference to the gains which had alrea y been achieved as a result<br />
of the American contribution in South-East Asia and, in particular,<br />
in Vietnam.<br />
( Remainder of the transcript incomplete in parts).<br />
There was a good deal of talk about a domino theory.....<br />
argued the premise that, thanks to the American intervention and<br />
the strength of American participation, we were seeing the domino<br />
theory operate in reverse. ' e were seeing countries that were<br />
formerly being threatened re-establish themselves social, economic<br />
and political conditions, and we saw this in such countries as<br />
Korea and Taiwan.<br />
In the course of my own most recent journey I have had<br />
an opportunity of seeing some of the. e things at first hand myself.<br />
I have seen the improvement which has occurred in Malaysia since<br />
we have overcome the communist threat there, and what h. s ooen </p>
<p>happening in Thailand. Thailand, with suostantial American<br />
assistance has set out to ouild up its strength aginst the<br />
communist threat in that country and I would only wish that<br />
the press which gives this episoaic treatment day by day of<br />
what is going on in Vietnam, would occasionally point to the<br />
substantial achievements which have resulted from your participation<br />
in the struggle there the strength thit you have given to other<br />
countries the rebuilding and the strenpthening which has gone on<br />
as a result of your participation and then, indeed, of the<br />
importance of the conflict there than is readily apprehended<br />
by some meubers of our r.: spective communities,<br />
I want to say something in very particular terms aoout<br />
one aspect of the Vietnam operation, because I have noticed with<br />
some concern that the bombing policy which has been carried out<br />
very thoroughly by the United States has come under question<br />
in various quarters. It has oven put, on the one hind, that if<br />
we were only to cease the bomoing the negotiations for peace<br />
would commence. Jell I know that your President wants peace<br />
and he hasn't spared himself in the search for peace.<br />
I can assure you that my own country is hankering for<br />
peace. . e have a vast country to develop. Quite apart from the<br />
loss to Australian life and l0b, the damige that is done, we<br />
can ill spare the resources that go into the military operations<br />
there and if a just and enduring peace could je secured by<br />
nevotiation we will support every endeivour to secure this result,<br />
but I have followed this as closely as any human being can. The<br />
messages we hive received from all the sources where these<br />
attempts have been made there hAve jeen well-meaning efforts on<br />
the part of the Secret-ry-jeneral of the United Nations, there<br />
have been well-meaning efforts on the parts of a numer of<br />
countries including Canada and Italy. But there is no substantial<br />
reason of which I am aware to believe that Hanoi is prepared to<br />
enter into negotiations and to use the pretext that this would<br />
happen if only the bombing would cease is runnin against all<br />
the evidence that comes to us. Every time there as oeen a<br />
lull in the bombin, this has been seized on with alacrity in<br />
order to build up the supplies and strength of the other side<br />
to the damage and to the detriment of our own cause. Now on<br />
this the American and the Australian positions are, I believe,<br />
identical. WSEGTIO3S liD ARS. ERS<br />
Q. Do you think an embargo would De effective ag. inst North Vietnam?<br />
Mr. Holt I think in suostance as far as we are concerned, there<br />
is a trade embargo. There are other countries, of course, supplying<br />
goods but that would involve a major decision as to either the<br />
attack on the shipping in Hai Pong or the mining of Hai Pong. I<br />
know this is a m~ tter which is exercising the minds of your own<br />
administration a good deal. I prefer, since the decision does not<br />
lie in my hands, but virtually in the hands of your own administration,<br />
not to express a view which might be an embarrassment to them but<br />
they have to allow th't in taking this action they might involve<br />
to a very much greater degree, not only China but Russia, who is,<br />
of course one of the principal suppliers of North Vietnam. Je have<br />
made it clear that it is not our purpose to destroy Vietnam nor to<br />
subjugate their country, but we do intend to press on with action<br />
which will prevent the aggression and infiltration proceeding from<br />
North Vietnam.<br />
7ould you care to make a forecast on how you think the war will<br />
end? Y'hat are the various steps involved?<br />
P. M. I wish I knew how the conflict would end. It would, I hope<br />
proceed from a will to negotiate and, apart from oeing an optimist<br />
by temperament, I don't put that beyond the ran; e of possibility / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
in the not-too-remote future. I have had some contact nd<br />
experience with the communist mentality. je hive seen this in<br />
the 3erlin airlift, in the Cuoan crisis, in many examples in<br />
contemporry history both in the internal field and certainly<br />
in some of the domestic issues which have arisen inside countries<br />
such as my own, where there has some of our<br />
industrial organisations, and you have found . hat where there<br />
seemsto be a complete impasse a brick wall created between you<br />
and the opposing side, that it some point they make up their<br />
own mind that the -ame is just not worth will<br />
decide themselves The time to call it a day and I believe that<br />
particularly over recent weeks when the gooA weather his<br />
persisted in North Vietnam, must make the leaders ponder and<br />
ask themselves where are we going to pet to if we persist<br />
with this? They can't win the war on tie ground. They can<br />
only go ahead taking punishment indefinitely. They might look<br />
to the time when as in Malaya as the thing was, they could<br />
carry on guerrilla operations, but the country as a whole would<br />
be able to carry on is : alaya carried on despite this, and with<br />
the punishment which is being inflicted industrially on the<br />
country and prospects for future economic progress, apart from<br />
the dama e which might be inflicted on the forces engaged in<br />
the field and so on, I feel that the time must come when the<br />
say this is when we negotiate. Now, for us and for you and<br />
you in narticular because you have the large share of the burden<br />
on this matter, it is not merely a matter of negotiation in order<br />
to stop the agression, the fihting. There must be a settlement<br />
which will stick. There must oe a just and enduring settlement<br />
which will enable the people of South Vietnam to decide their<br />
own destiny in their own way, and it is not to be peace at any<br />
price much as we all lon Tor peace, jut when that time comes,<br />
we will all Oe better equi-ped to know just how we should conduct<br />
our negotiations.<br />
0 .' ould you co; iment on the position of Ho Chi Min in his own<br />
country? Is he a -eorge hington or a Benedict Arnold?<br />
P. M. I think that that largely depends whether you are a communist<br />
supporter or a supporter of a different system of government.<br />
There is no doubt that he has enjoyed a strong support from those<br />
who have been politic'lly inclined md accent the communist and<br />
socialist way of life. In North Vietnam, as indeed in South Vietnam<br />
and through much of South-East Asia, the greater part of the<br />
population live off the land and do not look very far oeyond their<br />
own particular area of cultivation and they have been accustomed<br />
through the centuries to having one particular " ar Lord or one<br />
dominant regime, usually extoring from them what can be extracted<br />
and so there isn't the same individual and national conscience<br />
thit we experience in c untries such as our own which have a<br />
democratic libertarian tradition but I have seen the evidence<br />
of an opposition building up to the Ho Chi Min regime. The<br />
intelligence that we get out of North Vietnam is not very<br />
considerable, but I would think that he still does exercise a<br />
very considerable influence over his own administration and<br />
over his country. It would be difficult to appreciate the effort<br />
put into reconstruction after the damage that has occurred there<br />
if this were not so. He is now of course, a very old man in terms<br />
of normal public life. It may be that his successor will be no less<br />
determined to push on the sort of policies that he has pursued.<br />
I think it is fair to say that although there is a reat deal of<br />
Chinese communist influence in North Vietnam the NIorth Vietnamese<br />
don't want the Chinese there any more than the South Vietnamese . ant<br />
the Chinese in South Vietnam, and if a negotiation could be conducted,<br />
I think that a line of division and a course could oe established<br />
whether it involves a movement as it did previously with people from<br />
one area to another, in order thit those who wanted to live one<br />
kind of life could go to a country offering that others who / 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
v-inted the sort of life -:.-hich we hom ill develop in South<br />
Vietrnm c iuld move there, but I don t think any o us ca-n<br />
cla-im to be a-uthorities is to the thinking, or the state of public<br />
opinion in 1' jth Vie tnaim at this time. </p>
