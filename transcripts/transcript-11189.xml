<p><i>Subjects: East Timor ballot; Victorian Election</i></p>
<p>E&amp;OE…………………………………………………………………………………..</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen I wanted to make a few comments about the developments in East Timor. First and foremost I welcome the clear outcome of the ballot conducted on East Timor’s future, the overwhelming expression of support for independence, clearly and decisively tells the world that the people of East Timor want to be independent. The United Nations is to be congratulated for the conduct of the ballot. Credit is also due to the Indonesian Government for a willingness to change policy, to hold the ballot and give the people of East Timor an opportunity of expressing their will about their future. One can only be filled with a sense of respect and sensitivity and understanding as we watch the people of the territory so eagerly grab hold of the opportunity to participate in a democratic ballot. I am also very proud of the role that Australia has played in bringing about a change of policy on the part of Indonesia. There is little doubt that the views I expressed before Christmas of last year to the Indonesian Government on behalf of the Australian Government played a role along with other influences of course in bringing about a change of policy. It is now important that everyone get behind the decision, there is a period of some two months that will go by before a formal decision on separation or independence is taken by the Indonesian legislature. It is very important during that time that Indonesia discharge her responsibility to maintain law and order and to see that the militia is not in any way enabled to attempt a sabotage of the clear expression of will by the people of East Timor and in that context I very warmly welcome the statements that have already been made by the President of Indonesia, Dr Habibe to the effect that his Government will accepts fully the expression of will by the people of Timor and will give effect to that decision in a consistent and constitutional fashion so it is in every sense a very clear expression of will by the people of East Timor. It is an historic moment for them, it is a very important moment in relations between Australia and Indonesia. We of course will play our role in providing help and encouragement to the newly emerging independent nation of East Timor. It won’t be easy. It will be a very poor country with a very low standard of living and we, along with other nations in the world community will have particular responsibilities to provide assistance. Do you have any questions?</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST:</b></p>
<p>[inaudible] (Question relating to reports of Indoensian troops standing by during acts of violence.)</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>I’ve been concerned about those reports for some days, indeed some weeks, and they were raised in the discussion I had with Dr Habibe on Friday afternoon when I rang him to talk about aspects of the issue, particularly the safety of Australian personnel in East Timor. There is a particular responsibility, a total responsibility on the Indonesian authorities to maintain law and order and the fact that it has been made clear that the Indonesian Government is not willing to have foreign peacekeepers on Indonesian soil until there has been a formal separation of the territory only underscores and emphasises the ongoing responsibility of the Indonesian Government to maintain law and order.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST</b></p>
<p>Where are you standing now in terms of a peacekeeping role, Australia’s part [inaudible]?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Well we have indicated all along that if the United Nations asked us and the Indonesians agreed, they’re the necessary preconditions, Australia would play a positive and significant part. And that remains our position. But you can’t have a peacekeeping force in East Timor unless you have the United Nations asking us, and it’s under the aegis of the United Nations, and you have the Indonesians giving consent. Now the Indonesian Government’s position as of now is that it does not want foreign peacekeepers in East Timor until a formal vote on separation has been taken by the Indonesian legislature. So that remains the position.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST</b></p>
<p>If there was a peacekeeping role, there would you like to see Australia do that?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Well there can only be a peacekeeping role if those two conditions are satisfied. Australia would play a significant role, would be willing to play a significant role. The question of the leadership of the role because it would be under the authority of the United Nations would be a matter for the United Nations to determine. I don’t think it’s appropriate for me to say more than that.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST</b></p>
<p>Alexander Downer yesterday reaised the prospect of a short term Peace keeping force...[inaudible]...How seriously is that being considered by the Australian Government?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Well he made it clear though when he raised it that it was subject to the two conditions that I’ve outlined. I mean we remain ready to participate in a constructive fashion but you can’t, whether it’s Australia or any combination of nations involving Australia, you can’t go into the territory of another country without that country’s government’s approval. And East Timor remains part of Indonesia until a formal vote on separation takes place.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST</b></p>
<p>What if the violence worsens though and Australians lives are directly at risk?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Well we have made it clear all along that we would act to protect Australian lives and we have plans for that. And we would expect the cooperation of the Indonesian military, and Dr Habibe has indicated to me that that cooperation would be available. Now I hope that doesn’t occur. But that is a separate thing from providing a peacekeeping force. You can only provide a peacekeeping force with the consent of the government. When it comes to the evacuation of our own people that is a separate matter. We’ve said all along that we would act to do that.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST</b></p>
<p>If there was a peacekeeping force [inaudible] or whatever, who would you see being a part of that [inaudible]....?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Well that would be a matter for the United Nations but I imagine a number of other countries in the region would be invited. Perhaps the United States would be invited. The UN would make that decision. But I would be very surprised if it did not include, apart from Australia obviously, the forces of other nations in the region. But in the end that would be a matter for the United Nations to determine.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST</b></p>
<p>And on the current situation it would appear that it is quite volatile at the moment. In terms of your concern for Australians who are there at the moment, what’s your view on that?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Well it is volatile and I remain very concerned and that is why I rang Dr Habibe on Friday afternoon. It is why we have forces ready to be involved in an evacuation. At the moment that’s not necessary but the situation is being monitored on a daily, indeed hourly basis in my office, and Mr Downer’s office, and the Department is in constant contact with our ambassador in Indonesia and with people associated with the United Nations in Indonesia. So it is an hour to hour, day to day situation. At the moment any kind of evacuation is not necessary. I know there have been charters, and I understand people are under there own steam so to speak leaving the territory. But in so far as any kind of major evacuation is concerned there’s no need for that at present. But the situation could change. I acknowledge that. We have always expected the situation to be volatile. That is why we got ready for it. That is why we had forces stationed in northern Australia, it is why we got the catamaran and all the other preparations that have now been undertaken over a period of months by the ADF, have all been directed towards being ready in case the situation should get worse. I hope it doesn’t but it could, and I’ve always made it plain that there is a risk of that.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST</b></p>
<p>[inaudible] on the Victorian election? [inaudible] poll showing the Coalition well ahead. Do you think there’s a danger ofcomplacency creeping in….?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>There’s always a danger of that. The Kennett Government deserves to win because it’s been a good Government and there’s no serious alternative. But there’s always a danger if the polls indicate strongly in one direction the people get complacent and they feel they have the liberty of a protest vote. And along with all other Liberals I would strongly counsel against that.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST</b></p>
<p>Just on the national institute of depression Mr Kennett announced today, so what sort of funding would the Federal Government be prepared to look at for that?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Well he indicated that today, a capital contribution somewhere in the order of three or four million, and an ongoing contribution. That was indicated today. Okay. I don’t want to get…..I really wanted to talk about national affairs. Mr Kennett can handle the rest, State affairs.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST</b></p>
<p>Can I just go back [inaudible] East Timor in relation to a peacekeeping role, in terms of who would lead that. Would you be willing to see Australia head…..</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Look it’s appropriate for me to say two things. We will obviously contribute in a significant way. The question of the leadership of it is something for the United Nations to determine. I don’t want to say anymore than that but Australia naturally sees itself as being willing to contribute in a significant way. Thank you.</p>
