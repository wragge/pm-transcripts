J,,, AUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MAINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 12 DECEMBER 1976<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
One year ago the men and women of Australia gave the<br />
Liberal-National Country Party coalition the job of restoring<br />
responsible management to the nation's affairs.<br />
Australians knew then the job could not be completed overnight.<br />
Australians knew that our economic problems were deep-seated<br />
and that the return to economic strength and stability would take<br />
time. I told the nation that to start Australia back on the road to<br />
recovery would take three years. I said there were no<br />
short cuts no easy options.<br />
Today, we are on the road to completing that first task.-<br />
We are on the way to beating inflation, creating jobs on a<br />
sound, long term basis, and establishing the conditions where<br />
individuals are again in a position to make important decisions<br />
as they see fit.<br />
For twelve months, the central aim of my Government has been to<br />
fight and to beat inflation.<br />
That central aim remains. We are still absolutely and unashamedly<br />
committed to beat inflation. If we were not and if we were<br />
to turn our central thrust elsewhere we would be abandoning<br />
our promise to the Australian electorate.<br />
As I have repeatedly stated since our devaluation decision,<br />
my Government's resolve to fight inflation is stronger than ever.<br />
I want to make it clear, however, that this fight is not pursued<br />
at the total exclusion of all other policies.<br />
The Government is aware of the unfair burdens that have been<br />
placed on particular sections in the community bccaUse of the deep<br />
seated effects of run-away inflation.<br />
We recognised the seriousness of this problem immediately<br />
we took office. And we took action to overcome it. / 2 </p>
<p>Our family allowance scheme was designed specifically<br />
to protect the low income earning families against the immediate<br />
damaging effects of inflation.<br />
Our full indexation of personal income tax while it does not<br />
remove the injustices of the tax scale has prevented tax<br />
payers being further disadvantaged.<br />
These two measures alone and there are many more demonstrate<br />
that the Government's fight against inflation is not a fight that<br />
takes place to the exclusion of all else.<br />
We can and we have shown our real desire to right the many<br />
social injustices in the community. We will not lose sight of this,<br />
responsibility and obligation.<br />
The next twleve months will be critical for Australia.<br />
It will be as important a year as we have faced in Australia for a<br />
long while.<br />
All Australians have a stake in our future.<br />
We can all contribute to solving national problems and so get on<br />
with the job of rebuilding this nation.<br />
The Government will do what it can in crucial areas. We will continut<br />
with our successful anti-inflation strategies.<br />
We will continue to press strongly for wage restraint and mode-ation.<br />
We will continue our scrutiny of the services provided by -the<br />
Commonwealth. We will continue to create the kind of economic<br />
climate where real production can thrive. It is here in the<br />
manufacturing, mining and rural base that three out of every<br />
four Australian workers find jobs. It is here that our national<br />
wealth is created.<br />
The Government, however, cannot succeed without the support of the<br />
people it represents.<br />
Too often there are too many people who seek to highlight<br />
differences that exist in the community.<br />
We cannot afford this attitude in Australia at this critical time.<br />
If we are to overcome inflation and create the circumstances where<br />
families can live the lives they want, there ought to be<br />
a greater effort to define and emphasise the common ground that<br />
exists between the vast majority of Australians.<br />
I make the point here that I do not necessarily think that I as<br />
Prime Minister, or the Liberal National Country Party coalition,<br />
have adequately pursued areas of common ground. It is something we ca<br />
strive harder for it is certainly a worthwhile objective.<br />
Whether we are employers, employees, businessmen, farmers<br />
whether we vote for the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, or the<br />
National Country Party we must not lose sight of the fact that abovc<br />
all else we are Australians. / 13 </p>
<p>3.<br />
As Australians we all have an overriding common interest<br />
We can, and we should, work much harder and spend more time<br />
at seeking out those things we each have in common.<br />
Until that happens, Australia will be the loser.<br />
We do have a country that is the envy of most of the free world.<br />
We have a future that is unequaled anywhere in the world.<br />
It is with this future that we are now involved. I believe it<br />
is worth fighting for, and worth making sacrifice. </p>
