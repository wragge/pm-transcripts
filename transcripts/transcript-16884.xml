    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister Kevin Rudd today launched a new national program to help educate Australian families about organ and tissue donation, and their power to save lives.</p>
<p>The DonateLife Family public awareness program, backed up by a new workforce of medical specialists called the DonateLife Network, will encourage Australians to discover the facts about organ and tissue donation, make an informed decision and discuss their wishes with their family.</p>
<p>As many as 40% of Australians are not aware that even if they are registered as an organ donor, their family will be asked to give consent for organ donation to proceed.</p>
<p>Thirty five per cent of Australians don't discuss their wishes with their family.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister's family today became the first DonateLife Family. A DonateLife Family is a family that has had a discussion and knows each other's wishes about organ donation.</p>
<p>"We have made the decision to become a DonateLife Family because we know the importance of knowing each other's wishes about organ donation", the Prime Minister said.</p>
<p>"It is important for Australians to know that family consent is always sought before organ donation can proceed. Although there is widespread public support (90%) for organ donation, Australia's current family consent rate for donation is just 56%.</p>
<p>"We can save many more Australian lives if we make sure families talk about the decision to donate life through organ and tissue donation. That is why today I invite all Australians to discuss organ donation and become a DonateLife Family.</p>
<p>"If Australians know their loved one's wishes we would have a higher family consent rate because when families know each other's wishes, they are more likely to consent to donation", Prime Minister Rudd said.</p>
<p>Ms Karen Murphy, Chief Executive Officer of the new Australian Organ and Tissue Authority said that the need for Australian families to discuss organ donation is vital.</p>
<p>"Our organ donation rate has been static for the past decade at around 200 organ donors per year. In 2008 we saw a 30% increase in donation. Our aim is to lift the current family consent rate of 56% to 80%, thereby enabling more Australians to receive the most precious gift."</p>
<p>Dr O'Callaghan, National Medical Director of the Australian Organ and Tissue Authority said the Authority is determined to help as many people as possible.</p>
<p>"Increasing the number of organ donors will help make transplantation possible for more seriously ill Australians. This now requires a public commitment because transplantation is touching the lives of more and more Australians," he said.</p>
<p>To support Australians in having this important discussion, the new DonateLife website features a section that provides supporting materials for family discussion, including a downloadable DonateLife Family certificate.</p>
