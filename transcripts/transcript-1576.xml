STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. V97<br />
HON. HAROLD HOLT, M, P6 IN THE HOUSE OF<br />
REPRESENTATIVESE 16th MAY, 1967<br />
FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF COMONW\ EALTH WVAR<br />
GRAVES COMMISSION<br />
I wish to remind Honorable Members that 1967 marks the<br />
Fiftieth Anniversary of the establishment of the Commonwealth W/ ar Graves<br />
Commission which originally was 1known as the Imperial War Graves<br />
Commission. In a few days' time, Australia will be represented by our High<br />
1Commissioner in London at a special Fiftieth Anniversary meeting of the<br />
Commonwealth War Graves Commission presided over by His Royal Highness<br />
the Duke of Gloucester. In more than 23, 700 burial places throughout the world are the<br />
graves of nearly one and three quarter million, men and women, of<br />
the former Imperial Forces who died in the two World W~ ars. Of these,<br />
more than 100., DCwere P ustralians.<br />
All who have visited any of the war cemeteries must have been<br />
moved by their beauty and by the care with which they are tended. The<br />
efforts of many are involved, and to them I extend our thanks to the<br />
architects, engineers, builders and horticulturalists who have created these<br />
places and to the researchers who so far as is humanly practicable, have<br />
made sure that each man and woman who died in the cause of freedom in<br />
either of the two WAorld W, 7ars has been honoured by name. I am sure it is<br />
a matter of pride to us all that our honoured dead are cared for in this way.<br />
The Commission itself is a " Commonwealth" body formed by<br />
the member countries of the Commonwealth to honour their dead of the<br />
two World W1a. rs. Each war cemetery, each memorial, each individual<br />
grave is a tribute paid jointly by a united C-. ommonwealth of Nations.<br />
VWe rake pride in the fact that Australia is an active partner in this organisation.<br />
In this year of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the establishment of<br />
the Commission, we place on record our very sincere appreciation of the<br />
work that has been carried out, and still continues.<br />
I have no doubt that this statement carries the support of all<br />
Members of the House.<br />
I propose to send the President of the C"' ommonwealth W/ ar Graves<br />
Commission a message in the following terms<br />
" Cn behalf of the Parliament and people of Australia<br />
I would likL-e to express to the Commonwealth War Graves<br />
Commission our sincere appreciation for the manner in which<br />
it is carrying out the task of commemorating and honouring the<br />
dead of the two VWorld Wars and to assure you of our continuing<br />
support and confidence in the future. On this Fiftieth Anniversary,<br />
the Commission can look back with a true sense of pride at its<br />
achievements over the years." </p>
