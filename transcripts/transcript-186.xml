OFFICE OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR AUSTRALIA IN THE UNITED KINGDOM<br />
Australian News and Information Bureau, Australia House,<br />
Strand, London, W. C. 2 Telephone: TEMple Bar 2435<br />
ADDRESS BY THE RIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
THE RIGHT HON. R. G. hENZIES, M. P.,<br />
TO THE PARIEANTARY PRESS GALLERY<br />
AT THE HOUSE OF CO1MMONS<br />
Oi WEMIESDIY, 18TH MAY, 1960.<br />
Addressing a luncheon gathering of the Parliamentary Press Gallery, at<br />
which he was the guest of honour, Mr. Menzies said, in part:-<br />
" I want to say a few words to you about two matters. The first is the<br />
one that is most in our minds today. I can't help thinking, after all this<br />
bogus argument that's been going on about spies, all this humbug, this pious<br />
horrpor at the discovery of the spy over Russian soil, that I seem to remember<br />
hundreds and thousands of them from there over our soil, or on it, or in it!<br />
But when this Summit meeting had at long last been arranged, I venture to say<br />
that all of us, not being too starry-eyed, hoped for some result; not for the<br />
pacification of the world by one single stroke that is not possible, you<br />
can't reconcile the differences of a decade, or perhaps in some respects a<br />
century, by a single master stroke of statesmanship but vie did all hope in<br />
our own simple fashion that when the great leaders met, they vould earn. estly<br />
direct their attention to one or two problems, hoping that by disposing of<br />
even one, there might be a prospect held out to the world that common sense<br />
and true co-existence, tolerant co-existence, might come about.<br />
". And therefore it's been a very grievous blow to us if, as the latest<br />
nevs suggests, this Gonference has ended before it began. That I think is<br />
a shocking thing. It's useless for somebody to tell me that Khrushchev has<br />
scored a great propaganda success. I have a firm belief that most of the<br />
people in the world ordinary, sensible, honest, honourable people, regard<br />
this manoeuvre with contempt. It's a very great mistake to think that this<br />
clever stuff really lodges in the minds of millions of people in the world<br />
who honcstly want peace. This has been a shabby thing.<br />
" How mueh we expected that vhen they met they vwould be able to begin<br />
with say, a discussion about nuclear tests, a -mtter on which so much<br />
progress, not enough but so much, had been made at Geneva. This is the kind<br />
of thing about which one felt that the catalyst could be provided by a meeting<br />
at the Summit; some simple, broad direction which would at any rate have<br />
produced a moratorium in that field and perhaps a moratorium in the field of<br />
the Berlin problem.<br />
" And then the incident of the flying man in the sky occurred. It vas<br />
seized on. I repeat, one would almost have thought that there never had<br />
been a Soviet spy in the history of modern times. We've had a few in<br />
Australia. I daresay you've had hundreds here. And for a man under those<br />
circumstances to prefer a manoeuvrc of propaganda to the pacification of the<br />
world is, I think, a shocking thing. I hope that everybody, every sensible<br />
honest person around the world, will be shocked by it.<br />
" We're accustomed to the move and counter move of political tactics,<br />
but we despise them whun the issue is the issue of the safety of the nation.<br />
We have enough proportion to put aside the manoeuvres under those<br />
circumstances. There is a time for debating points. I've used a few<br />
myself in Wy time, and enjoyable enough they arc when the opportunity<br />
presents itself. But whcn the wholc world is waiting for the first breaking<br />
of the tension that has existed fur the last ten years, a debating point is<br />
a contemptible thing. </p>
<p>2<br />
" I've been asking myself why this was done. hen I first read about<br />
the alleged shooting down by a rocket of an aircraft flying at a vast height<br />
the remarkable result of the shooting down being that the pilot is held safely<br />
and that the contents appear to have come down very neatly in an ascertainable<br />
form, and in an ascertainable place I thought, ' Well, of course, Khrushchev<br />
will have a bit of fun over this; he will recognise that there were poor<br />
tactics on one side and he will respond by what he regards to be good tactics.'<br />
But little did I believe. that this would be used as a means of defeating<br />
a conference of preventing a conference from ever occurring. I'm still not<br />
without hope, I would not be surprised if I were rung up at dinnertime and<br />
told that, by some accident, they had met again. I don't know I've had no<br />
information but one always hangs on to some hope about this matter. I<br />
thought, ' Well, as a tactical-exercise this is understandable though it's<br />
silly', until I realised that on their own story the plane had travelled,<br />
before it was intercepted, for the better part of a thousand miles over Soviet<br />
territory. That perhaps is the most interesting feature of the whole thing.<br />
That, I would venture to believe, must have created great feeling in Moscow<br />
and great feeling among such people as knew of it, because, you see, if a<br />
plane capable of delivering a nuclear bomb can fly for the better part of a<br />
thousand miles over Soviet territory, then the vulnerability of Soviet<br />
territory becomes demonstrated and the efficacy of the deterrant is thereby<br />
increased. Lnd if we look at it in that way then of course we can begin to<br />
S understand why this was not perhaps just a manoeuvre but the genuine expression<br />
of a passion and perhaps of a fear. Otherwise the whole thing is beyond<br />
comprehension. " Now, going back to the propaganda aspect of this matter, I have most<br />
staunchly supported the idea of a Summit meeting. I pay grcat tribute to<br />
the Prime Minister of this country for having done so much I think more than<br />
anybody else to bring it about; and I hope that we won't fall into the error<br />
of saying ' Well, you wanted it, you made a great point of it Lnd it's<br />
failed,' and then sit back in our corners and become critical. Because it<br />
still remains true that unless these leaders meet at the Summit, and that<br />
right early, the world may pass into a more terrible phase of existence in the<br />
next ten or twenty years than it has known before. And so we must naintain<br />
hope, we must keep our ideas up, we must still be for the Sumiit, we must<br />
still be for personal contacts. And if I'm right in my own guess, the<br />
leader of the Soviet Union will very soon become aware that right around the<br />
world there is a feeling of bitter disappointment and a critical feeling about<br />
the attitude that he's taken. And, if that's so, well, we may meet again<br />
another day. And so long as the heads of the governments of the world will<br />
meet and be prepared to talk as if they were human beings, and not mere<br />
advocates hired by some established interest, then there is hope for the world.<br />
" I would like to make a comparison between these astonishing events<br />
or non-events in Paris, and the meeting of Prime Ministers of the<br />
Cor. mmonwealth. There are still people who think that a Prime &gt; inisters'<br />
Conference in the Cormonwealth is a species of committee of the United Nations;<br />
that it has the shape and character of an international conference. It has<br />
nothing of the kind. We don't meet to judge; we don't meet to have all the<br />
tiresome machinery end motions and amendmcnts and people running up and down<br />
in the lobbies. We don't go in for that kind of thing. We meet. We've<br />
had, this time, some matters to cormune about full of explosive material<br />
end we concluded our meeting with a spirit of complete good temper, with our<br />
knowledge expanded, with, I think a high degree of mutual tolerance; nobody<br />
looking for some spectacular triumph at the expense of someboOy else, but all<br />
of us looking to be able to establish that this Commonwealth of ours is one<br />
in which you're not thinking of tactics, but in which you talk quietly in a<br />
friendly way, you learn more, you're able to disagree at the table, and then<br />
go out and have a drink together afterwards. This is in the highest possible<br />
tradition. And I am delighted to say that the new members of the Conmmonwealth<br />
respond to this traditional idea as rapidly as anybody else at the table.<br />
" What a contrast that is to the other business! Taking a trick!<br />
Trying to humiliate your opponents! I little thought the day would come<br />
when, on the greatest platform in the world, with the greatest powers in the<br />
world, assembled through their ' number one' people, I would find the state<br />
of affairs in which the leader of one govcrnment accepted, what raight be<br />
thought to have been the hurmiliation of saying, ' Well, we won't do this again',<br />
and that he should then find himself led on to apologise ' Unless you </p>
<p>3<br />
apologise I can't talk to you any longer'.<br />
" Really, I think that in the place of the President, being less wise and<br />
perhaps less guarded in my remarks, I might have offered to exchange apologies<br />
' Yes, I'll apologise for this one, if you'll apologise for all yours'. And<br />
in this atmosphere of mutual apology, they 1night have got to work on the real<br />
thing. " But we must remain optimistic, we must hope; we must not allow<br />
ourselves and this is all important to become divided under the jeers of the<br />
other man who will say, ' f2a, I scored the point; I scored the point; I made<br />
you look silly. Good afternoon to you'. That's the very state of affairs in<br />
which France, the United States, Great Britain, could easily be persuaded to<br />
have a post-mortem and to say, ' Well, you shouldn't have done this, or you<br />
shoul 2n' t have said that'. Divide and conquer is just as modern now as it was<br />
in the days of the Romans.<br />
" If there's one lesson to be got from all this, it is that so far as the<br />
other three great Powers are concerned the United States, and Great Britain<br />
and France they must instantly and persistently keep together, evolve their<br />
ovl ideas, exhibit their ovnm united strength, improve their united strength;<br />
not by way of threat but in order to mlce it clear that the people who believe<br />
in a free life are not easily driven into fragments by a shabby Soviet manoeuvre." </p>
