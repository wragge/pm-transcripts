COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt. Hon. SIR ROBERT MENZIES,<br />
ON<br />
RHODESIA<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the Parliamentary Debates," 16th November, 1965]<br />
0 Sir ROBERT MENZIES ( Kooyong-<br />
Prime Minister).-by leave-Mr. Speaker, I<br />
propose to make a statement to the House.<br />
When I have finished it, I will table some<br />
relevant documents on Rhodesia. Those<br />
dcments contain a verbatim account of<br />
the communications between Mr. Ian Smith<br />
and the Prime Minister of Great Britain. I<br />
am happy to say that there will ' be enough<br />
copies of the documents for every honorable<br />
member to have a copy for his own consideration.<br />
At the conclusion of my statement,<br />
which will not be very long, I will<br />
move that the House take note, not only of<br />
the paper, hut also of the papers that I will<br />
table so that all will be available for<br />
discussion in due course.<br />
Recent events in Rhodesia, and the reactions<br />
to those events in other countries,<br />
hrave presented to all of us acutely<br />
difficult problems. It is therefore desirable<br />
that I should, on behalf of the<br />
Government, set out for the benefit<br />
of honorable members what we believe to<br />
be the facts and what views we take on the<br />
various suggested remedies. First I should<br />
point out that as Great Britain is for this<br />
purpose the colonial power, only the Parliament<br />
of Great Britain could grant independ-<br />
14540/ 65 ence to Rhodesia. The Unilateral Declaration<br />
of Independence by the Rhodesian<br />
Government was therefore illegal. The<br />
Declaration having been made, and the Governor<br />
having dismissed Mr. Smith and his<br />
government, a position arose in which the<br />
only lawful government in Rhodesia is now<br />
the Government of the United Kingdom.<br />
The executive authority is at present in<br />
the hands of the Governor, subject to any<br />
legislative or administrative steps taken by<br />
Great Britain. We accept the view that it<br />
now becomes necessary for the Governor<br />
of Rhodesia to call, if he can, a new government<br />
into existence. If he cannot do so, the<br />
responsibility for the government of<br />
Rhodesia will rest with Great Britain. It is<br />
important, I think, to remember these basic<br />
facts. Rhodesia is not now without a government<br />
at all. That is, it is not in a state<br />
of anarchy, but is subject to the direct<br />
authority and control of Great Britain. Let<br />
me emphasise this. The objective of any<br />
action now to be taken must surely be to<br />
assist the United Kingdom to bring into being<br />
a constitutional government, and to end<br />
the illegal situation in Rhodesia. The sooner<br />
this can be done, the better. If it cannot<br />
be done, or if it is not done with reasonable </p>
<p>promptness, the risks of violence, bloodshed,<br />
and extreme action, to which I will<br />
refer later, will grow, bringing grief and<br />
suffering to millions of human beings.<br />
The Rhodesian problem has twice been<br />
discussed at Prime Ministers' Conferences.<br />
On each occasion, it was unanimously-I<br />
repeat, unanimously-accepted that the<br />
authority and responsibility for leading<br />
Rhodesia to independence must continue to<br />
rest with Britain. Though this seems at present<br />
to be under some challenge in the<br />
United Nations Assembly, it still remains<br />
the central truth in the controversy. In the<br />
discharge of its responsibilities, the Government<br />
of the United Kingdom went to<br />
great pains to conduct discussions with the<br />
then Prime Minister and Government of<br />
Rhodesia. I will narrate, as objectively as<br />
possible, what the British Government did.<br />
It indicated very plainly that it was not<br />
contemplating force; that it wished to establish<br />
a basis for ultimate independence which<br />
would be fair to all the people of Rhodesia.<br />
It did not take the extreme view, now being<br />
advocated by some, that the Constitution<br />
of Rhodesia should immediately be altered<br />
so as to provide for an immediate African<br />
majority. It realised that the people were<br />
not yet ready for this, and that to act precipitately<br />
might conceivably create what<br />
might be called a " Congo situation", of<br />
unhappy memory.<br />
The Government of the United Kingdom<br />
indicated five principles as providing the<br />
basis upon which independence could be<br />
granted. These principles were-<br />
1. The principle and intention of unimpeded<br />
progress to majority rule,<br />
already enshrined in the 1961 Constitution<br />
of Rhodesia, would have to<br />
be maintained and guaranteed.<br />
2. There would also have to be guarantees<br />
against retrogressive amendment<br />
of the Constitution.<br />
3. There would have to be immediate<br />
improvement in the political status<br />
of the African population.<br />
4. There would have to be progress towards<br />
ending racial discrimination.<br />
The British Government would need<br />
to be satisfied that any basis proposed<br />
for independence was acceptable<br />
to the people of Rhodesia as a<br />
whole. As principles, these appear, as Mr. Harold<br />
Wilson has said in the House of Commonf<br />
to have been accepted by Mr. Smith. ThRW<br />
real difficulties arose as to their application.<br />
The five principles, as I took an opportunity<br />
of telling Mr. Wilson, were and are completely<br />
in line with our own thinking. Having<br />
regard to what has happened, I thi<br />
I should now tell the House that Isent*<br />
message to Mr. Smith just as he was entering<br />
upon his discussions in London. I said I<br />
had a natural understanding of the problems<br />
confronting the European settlers in<br />
Rhodesia, a country which has enjoyed its<br />
own substantially but technically incomplete<br />
form of self-government for many years,<br />
and in which the contribution of the European<br />
settlers to the economic vigour of the<br />
country has been most substantial. I repeated<br />
my own view, which I have on<br />
several occasions expressed, sometimes quilf<br />
forcibly, I hope, in Prime Ministers' CoW<br />
ferences, that two extreme views that had<br />
been put forward were not practicable.<br />
The first extreme view was that either<br />
immediately or within a few months thee<br />
should be adult suffrage with, in cons<br />
quence, an African majority. If this view<br />
were to prevail then, as I said to my friend<br />
Mr. Smith, I could see all the elements of<br />
bad, because inexperienced, government,<br />
and possible economic disaster. The other<br />
extreme view was that the achievement of<br />
an African majority should be indefinitely<br />
resisted. This view, as I have repeatedly<br />
said, and, as I said to Mr. Smith, was, in<br />
the prevailing international political climate,<br />
quite impracticable.<br />
I pointed out to Mr. Smith, as I have<br />
done in * Prime Ministers' Conferences, that<br />
in my opinion the matter was one of timetable,<br />
a matter of phasing in more and<br />
more African voters until after some<br />
reasonable period of time they found<br />
themselves in a majority. By phasing in<br />
I mean such measures as adjustments to<br />
the B roll and perhaps the creation of a<br />
blocking third in the local Parliament. After<br />
all, the 1961 Rhodesian Constitution and<br />
the discussions attending it seemed to me,<br />
as I pointed out to Mr. Smith and as I<br />
have pointed out in Prime Ministers' Conferences,<br />
to contemplate that ultimately<br />
the African voters would prevail. I told Mr. </p>
<p>Smith that the working out of such a time-<br />
Stable should provide a good basis for agreement.<br />
I told him that should agreement<br />
fail to emerge and should there then be a<br />
unilateral declaration of independence, the<br />
results, not all of which were foreseeable,<br />
could be painful and difficult. I told him,<br />
SasI have since told this House, that Commonwealth<br />
countries would not recognise<br />
an independent nationhood so achieved.<br />
It should be clearly understood that a<br />
similar line was followed with much<br />
patience and reasonableness by the British<br />
Government. Mr. Wilson himself, in his<br />
speech to the House of Commons, put it in<br />
this way-<br />
Although successive British Governments-<br />
I emphasise " successive British Governments";<br />
the Home Government and the<br />
SWilson Government have followed identical<br />
policies in this respectare<br />
deeply and irrevocably committed to guaranteed<br />
and unimpeded progress to majority rule, the<br />
British Government, who alone through the British<br />
Parliament have the legal power to grant indeendence,<br />
do not believe that in the present and<br />
ragic and divided conditions of Rhodesia, a<br />
majority can or should come today, or tomorrow.<br />
A period of time is needed, time to remove the<br />
fears and suspicions between race and race, time<br />
to show that the Constitution of Rhodesia with<br />
whatever amendments may later be made can be<br />
worked and is going to be worked and that the<br />
rule of law equally with the maintenance of<br />
essential hrman rights will be paramount and the<br />
time required-<br />
This, I think, is a very wise statementcannot<br />
be measured by clock or calendar but<br />
only by achievement.<br />
In spite of all these efforts, this illegal<br />
declaration of independence has now been<br />
made with the constitutional consequences<br />
to which I have referred. What has happened<br />
since? The British Government has done two<br />
things. First it has, through the Governor,<br />
S dismissed the Smith Government. It has prohibited<br />
exports of arms to Rhodesia. It has<br />
imposed certain exchange restrictions. It has<br />
denied Rhodesia access to the London capital<br />
market and has terminated Commonwealth<br />
preferences. Some of these clearly have more relevance<br />
to the particular position of the United Kingdom<br />
than they would have to the position of<br />
Australia. But the British Government has<br />
also imposed a ban on the import of tobacco<br />
and sugar into the United Kingdom, these two items constituting more than one-third<br />
of the total Rhodesian exports. It will be<br />
observed that the imposition of these sanctions<br />
by Great Britain has been made with<br />
what I would call constructive moderation.<br />
As I understand it, it is not aimed -at ruining<br />
the total economy of Rhodesia, for that<br />
would be to punish indiscriminately, but to<br />
provide a means of persuading the European<br />
minority and its leaders to realise -the gravity<br />
of the situation, to have second thoughts,<br />
and to approach the lawful Government<br />
with an expression of willingness to negotiate<br />
to finality on the basis of the five principles.<br />
The second action taken by the British<br />
Government was to bring the matter before<br />
the notice of the Security Council. Now this<br />
may at first sight seem to be inconsistent<br />
with the sound basic proposition that this is<br />
a matter between Great Britain and Rhodesia.<br />
But I have no doubt that the British<br />
Government felt that it was better for it to<br />
take the matter to the Security Council, to<br />
outline the steps taken by it, and endeavour<br />
to secure international support for its actions,<br />
than for the matter to go to the United<br />
Nations under the auspices of other people<br />
who might demand courses of action which<br />
did not recognise either the particular<br />
authority and responsibility of Great Britain<br />
in this matter or the present constitutional<br />
position of Rhodesia. Recent events seem<br />
to have justified this view on the part of the<br />
British Government, though they have at<br />
the same time presented us all with problems<br />
of the utmost gravity.<br />
I turn now to considering our own attitude.<br />
We have, as I have previously pointed<br />
out, refused to recognise what is now an<br />
illegal administration. We have also in this<br />
House rejected any notion of the use of<br />
armed force which would be repugnant to<br />
the people of Australia, but would also inevitably<br />
produce more ruin and disaster than<br />
any of us would be prepared to contemplate.<br />
We will not either physically or financially<br />
contribute to the use of force. Measures of<br />
enforcement-if I may use that phraseneed<br />
a good deal of thought. Are they to<br />
punish, or to persuade, or even to compel?<br />
We reject the idea of punishment, for it<br />
would be undiscriminating and, therefore unjust.<br />
The madhinery of persuasion deserves<br />
more thought. This -great problem is essen-<br />
' tially a matter to be solved by negotiation,<br />
in the light of the principles that have been </p>
<p>stated, and with the object of securing a<br />
peaceful and ultimately a democratic future<br />
for Rhodesia.<br />
The demands currently being made at the<br />
United Nations for violent repression require<br />
critical examination. Suppose the United<br />
Nations directs or proposes military sanctions.<br />
What will be the object of this exercise?<br />
If it is to defeat the European Rhodesians<br />
in the field and kill a number of<br />
them, what problem will be solved? If<br />
adopted -it would represent a violent course<br />
in which the innocent would suffer with the<br />
guilty, and would embitter racial relationships<br />
in the whole African continent for<br />
generations to come. If the object is not<br />
to be punishment but persuasion, what is it<br />
that the Rhodesians wilt -need to concede<br />
in the face of force? What new Constitution<br />
or form of Government will be demanded?<br />
it is, alas, quite clear that if the United<br />
Nations authorised armed force, the clamour<br />
would be for an immediate adult suffrage,<br />
the immediate application of which would'<br />
quite plainly have at -the best hazardous,<br />
and at the worst disastrous results. What is<br />
needed in Rhodesia is a reasonable timetable,<br />
accompanied by a special educational campaign,<br />
-to which all of us might well contribute<br />
somnething, to fit -the African voters tor<br />
their ultiimat~ e authority.<br />
What I have said emphasises the nature<br />
of the deep differences which the debates in<br />
the United Nations have already disclosed,<br />
differences which are fraught with great<br />
danger and on which we are bound to express<br />
our own views with some frankness.<br />
The first difference, and I here repeat<br />
myself, concerns the position of Great<br />
Britain as the colonial power whose legislative<br />
authority has been illegally defied by<br />
the Smith administration. That problem is<br />
one primarily for Great Britain and Rhodesia.<br />
What Great Britain is seeking at the<br />
United Nations, as we understand it, is<br />
general international support for her own<br />
measures of an economic kind. This does<br />
not satisfy what may be called the direct<br />
action or armed force views of many<br />
nations, particularly of some in the Afro-<br />
Asian group. They demand armed force,<br />
and are attacking Great Britain for not<br />
employing it. If these nations had their way,<br />
the United Nations would no doubt be<br />
called upon to establish what might be somewhat ironically called a peace-keeping<br />
force. I say ironically, because them<br />
peace to be restored or kept would haveMW<br />
been broken by the action of these nations<br />
themselves. I have already put and answered the<br />
question as to the objective of armed force<br />
which, it would appear, would be not onlo<br />
to punish but to create a new Constitution<br />
and system of government on a basis which<br />
we would not want to see established overnight,<br />
or prematurely. My colleagues and I<br />
have had very great reservations about even<br />
economic sanctions.<br />
Mr. Uren.-I thought you would have.<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES,-I am delighted<br />
to hear that the honorable member has been<br />
thinking. I will repeat the statement, having<br />
regard to this brilliant interjection. My colleagues<br />
and I have had very great reserva<br />
tions about even economic sanctions. lie<br />
we accept for ourselves some economic<br />
measure or measures, it will not be because<br />
we think them intrinsically equitable. They<br />
may bear most heavily upon the Africans<br />
themselves-which is something wort<br />
thinking about-and if strongly resisted bo<br />
the Rhodesians themselves imposing sanctions<br />
against, for example, Zambia, formerly<br />
Northern Rhodesia, that great copper<br />
producing country might well be ruined.<br />
But making allowances for these views, we<br />
have come to the conclusion, particularly<br />
having regard to the way in which Great<br />
Britain is being attacked for employing<br />
peaceful means, that we would regard<br />
economic measures as the lesser of two<br />
evils. The greater evil would be the use of<br />
force with all its bloodshed and misery.<br />
This would be aggravated if the forces were<br />
directed by racial hatreds or gave rise to<br />
political consequences of which advantage<br />
could be taken by other and more hostile<br />
nations. It might well be, and this would<br />
appear to be the judgment of the British<br />
Government, that the losses arising from<br />
the kind of economic measures they have<br />
announced will be sufficiently serious, while<br />
not involving utter disaster, to induce most<br />
Rhodesians to have second thoughts, and to<br />
come back through constitutional means to<br />
the negotiating table. We hope that this<br />
will occur, and will occur before too much<br />
damage has been inflicted on people who<br />
have, as I have pointed out, been the greatest<br />
contributors to the prosperity of Rhodesia. </p>
<p>SWe will not export arms or military equipment<br />
to Rhodesia. We do not import sugar<br />
from Rhodesia, with which we have a fairly<br />
modest trade. But we do import tobacco.<br />
On this we will follow what has been done<br />
by Britain, and put a ban on the import of<br />
Rhodesian tobacco; this, of course, will not<br />
pply to tobacco in transit. Tariff preferences<br />
to Rhodesia will be suspended. We will cooperate<br />
with the Government of Britain in<br />
two other financial respects: First, we will<br />
amend the definition of the sterling area in<br />
the Banking ( Foreign Exchange) Regulations,<br />
so as to exclude Rhodesia, or make<br />
such other amendment as is appropriate to<br />
exclude Rhodesia from the treatment<br />
accorded to sterling area countries, and,<br />
secondly, we will take such action as is<br />
open to us to prevent evasion of the British<br />
0exchange control measures. We do not have any diplomatic mission<br />
in Rhodesia. We have a trade representative,<br />
whose appointment in Rhodesia will terminate.<br />
Above all things, we hope that none<br />
of these measures will be of long duration.<br />
It would be a sad commentary on the unwisdom<br />
of mankind, if through the obstinate<br />
pursuit of an illegal course, this prosperous<br />
country should be reduced economically to<br />
ruin, to the lasting unhappiness of all of<br />
its people, voters or non-voters, white or<br />
black. I present the following papers-<br />
Rhodesia-Ministerial Statement, 16th November<br />
1965.<br />
Documents on Rhodesia, 27th October 1964-<br />
Ilth November 1965-<br />
