VISIT TO NEW GUINEA 1970<br />
RABAUL QUEEN ELIZABETH PARK<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton 9 JULY 1970<br />
There is division amongst the Tolai people.... brother's hand is raised<br />
against brother, and instead of people sitting down to try and reach friendly agreement<br />
by discussion, people are hurting and beating those who disagree with them.<br />
Peace is better than that kind of fighting, agreement by discussion is better<br />
than name-calling and hurting each other, and yet this happens today inthe Peninsula.<br />
And why? There has been some disagreement over whether there should or should not<br />
be a Multi-Racial Council or a Local Council. We have said and I have said on behalf<br />
of the Australian Government that we wish to discover what it is that most of the people<br />
in this Peninsula want by way of a Council.<br />
If most of the Tolai people on the Peninsula wish not to have a Multi-Racial<br />
Council, then we would be prepared not to have a Multi-Racial Council. If most of the<br />
Tolai people on the Peninsula want a Multi-Racial Council, then we would be prepared<br />
to have that. But we need to know what it is that most of the people want.<br />
I said that some months ago to one of the leaders of the Mataungan<br />
Association, Mr. Kaputin. I said " Let us have a referendum. Let the people vote.<br />
Let them say what they want." And I repeat that offer to all the people of this<br />
Peninsula today. But such a vcte would need to be a secret one because when people already<br />
are beating each other some may be frightened to come out openly and say what they<br />
think for fear of being hurt. So the best way is a secret vote, and is this not handing<br />
over to the Tolai people the solution of this problem? I think it is.<br />
So I would speak not only to the people gathered here but to all those through<br />
the length and breadth of this Peninsula. And I would say to each one of them: Sit<br />
down in your own house, talk to your neighbours quietly. Ask yourself Would it not<br />
be better to have unity than division? Would it not be better to have discussion than<br />
fighting? Would ic not be better to find out what most want and then agree with what<br />
most want?" I ask all those living here to do that.<br />
I have been told by some I think a minority-but by some, that what is wanted<br />
here is self-government now, but self-government for what? For New Britain? Because<br />
New Britain has many other races than the Tolai. And if not for New Britain, then for<br />
what? For the Gazelle Peninsula only? Is that asked for?<br />
If it means self-government for the Gazelle Peninsula, what will the results<br />
be for the people who live here? They will have left the Territory. They will no<br />
longer be one unit of what is to be a nation. They will not have the right to share<br />
in riches discovered in copper in Bougainville, or riches which may be discovered </p>
<p>in oil in Papua or in the industrial development of all the rest of the Territory. They<br />
would have no right because they would be gone. Do they want that?<br />
Is it not true that there ar.-many Tolai ncin who go to Papua, or to New<br />
Guine-a or to other parts of the Territory and who wiork to high positions in the<br />
Administration or in the Police Force or in industry. Surely Tolais would want<br />
that opportunity to continue, would not want to break off from) what should be a<br />
united nation. There have already. beens very great steps towards transferring more<br />
power to the people of the Territory, announced less than a week ago, and ultimately<br />
there will undoubtedly be self-government for all. But those who tell you that<br />
the Gazelle Peninsula or the Tolai people would be better se-parate are telling you<br />
untruly and would damage your opportunity for work and would damage your<br />
opportunity to shai-e in the wealth of the whole natior.<br />
And I would like all the people in the Peninsula quietly, in their own<br />
houses, talking to their relatives and their friends, again to consider on this<br />
matter whether what I tell you is riot true. And if you come to the conclusion<br />
that it is true, that it is to your advantage and] to the in.-teres-, t of all the Tolai<br />
people, then let that voice be known by casting votes for those who agree with<br />
you in the House of Assembly, by letting the wishes oZ the people be known to<br />
Councillors and tD others who will be influenced by what you say.<br />
So I have spoken to you of the Multi-Racial Council, I have spoken<br />
of why I think it would be bad for the people here to have self-government now,<br />
if indeed that meant anything for an area of this size, and I know that these are<br />
problems and that there are other problems to do with land tenure in the<br />
Peninsula. I have asked the leaders ol the Mataungan Society to come to see me, to<br />
talk about these problems, to try to solve them, to see if we can reach agreement.<br />
But they have refused to do this. They have refused to exchange ideas. I would<br />
like those Tolai who live on this Peninsula to let it be known that most of the people<br />
want these things to be discussed in a friendly way, want them to be resolved,<br />
want there to be a stop to beatings, to hurtful na me-call ings, to spitefulness and<br />
to divisions. Do not think that there would be any support from Australia fox those who<br />
have caused divisions in this country. I know another politician came here some<br />
time ago and indicated that there might be such support. This is the Leader of<br />
the Opposition. He is not in the Government he can do nothing. And this<br />
should be known to all the people in this Territory.<br />
And for the last things I Shall say to you, I say this. We must, while<br />
we are here, see that the law is observed for the protection of all people here.<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>3.<br />
We want to stay and help in the Administration and the Government and the<br />
provision of funds to the Territory including the Gazelle Peninsula, for as long as<br />
we are wante... and we will do that. When most people wish us to go, which I<br />
think would not be until we have helped to build up the inductries, to build up the<br />
economic capacity of this Peninsula and of all tne rest of the Territory, if people<br />
then wish us to go, we would be haT; pp: y to go. For we have no wish to administer<br />
or govern one minute after most of the people in the Territory want us to leave.<br />
And for the rest, I hope and I believe that the people here and in the<br />
rest of the Territory will for the years ahead want that kind of partnership Vhich<br />
has Shvwn such progress in twenty years, will want to have more and more say in<br />
the running of their government, as they will. And that when the Tolai can heal<br />
the division within themselves, then we c~ an all shak&amp;% e bands as brothers and<br />
tackle the task of construction instead of destruction which lies in front of us and<br />
which we want to do together.<br />
Thank you for listening, both townspeople who are here and the Tolai<br />
who are here. I1h ope that my words, and my suggestions and requests for<br />
peaceful co-operation, will be heard far beyond the confines of this meeting and<br />
will help for the future prosperity o! the Gazelle Peninsula if the majority of people<br />
here agree that what I have said is the best path for us all to follow.<br />
Thank you. </p>
