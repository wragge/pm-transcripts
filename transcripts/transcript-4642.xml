ADDRESS TO THE INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS<br />
M1L% BEO URNE<br />
On a relaxed occasion like this, it is not the time for talk<br />
about deflators, deficits or delineating trends, seasonally<br />
adjusted or otherwise. I would like to stand back a pace or two<br />
from day-to-day economic issues, and look at the part Government<br />
should or should not p1ay in our economy.<br />
During the nineteenth century it was gYener ally accepted that<br />
government intervention in economic life should be extremely<br />
limited. Its job was to provide the bare essentials for the<br />
conduct of commerce and industry. Some people regard this<br />
epoch as a kind of director's paradise, when the enjoyment<br />
of boardroom lunches was Mwhindored by such trivial considerations<br />
as cost. But what vast changes have taken place since that time.<br />
Even the most anti-business elements would recognise that today<br />
directorships are no longer-a sinecure. Companies and their<br />
directors now have heavy respons ibilities andoliaiosimoedo<br />
them by law. Responsible directors have overwhelmingly<br />
welcomed their increased obligations. They recognise they have<br />
responsibilities to the community as well as to their shareholders.<br />
And organisations such as this Institute have played a key role in<br />
fostering these changes.<br />
Since the heyday of laissez-faire, the role of Government in the<br />
economy has increased immensely. Governments cannot avoid<br />
involvement in the economy. Since the 1930' s it has been accepted<br />
that governments can, through their expenditure, taxation and<br />
monetary policies, man * age or guide the overall level of activity<br />
in the economy. But the nature and extent of government involvement<br />
is a matter of choice a matter of philosophy.<br />
The Depression was the great watershed. It became clear then<br />
that market forces alone were incapable of resolving the<br />
great crisis of the 1930' s, that government action was imperative<br />
if countries were to survive. Keynes' theories, formulated to<br />
cope with periods of unemployment, low interest rates, and low<br />
inflation were appropriate for that time. They helped our<br />
system to survive.<br />
It is unfortunate that since then, the theories of that great<br />
liberal economist have far too often been wrenched out of<br />
context and used as a justification for uncontrolled government<br />
expenditure. / 2 </p>
<p>Government must involve itself in the economy because there<br />
are cases in which the unfettered market fails, or does not<br />
take account of important social considerations. The most<br />
obvious case is when a monopoly exploits its position to<br />
harm other companies or the community, or where an essential<br />
community service must be provided by government as no entrepreneur<br />
w ould be prepared to fill that need.<br />
In other cases, the governmen * t's role is to make sure that in<br />
commercial arrangements, the interests of the general communit~ y<br />
and employees are adequately protected. Hence the need for<br />
industrial laws, environment and packaging laws.<br />
Beyond this, there is a vastly increased expectation of government<br />
action in all areas of social life. Politicians have themselves<br />
fostered these expectations by bidding for support through<br />
promises of greater government action. They have raised the<br />
community's expectations without always pointing out that increased<br />
activity must be paid for either in much higher taxes, or in<br />
much higher inflation, or much greater regulation and a larger<br />
and larger public sector. Of course, it's always difficult to<br />
guage opinion about the desirable size of the public sector.<br />
When people are asked they generally say they will settle for<br />
more government spending and less taxation. I was reminded<br />
of this by the recent White House conference on balanced national<br />
growth and economic development. The conference ended<br />
with a call for less government interference. At the same time<br />
however, the five hundred participants called for incentives t~ o<br />
create new jobs, total Federal financing of welfare and medic-aid,<br />
and more Federal funds for deprived areas.<br />
Clearly, it is not only politicans who have the happy knack of'<br />
holding two conflicting views at the same time. There will always<br />
be vocal groups pressing for more expenditure of other people's<br />
taxes in their own particular areas of interest. But in the<br />
last few years it has become perfectly clear that Australians<br />
have had enough of Governments that grow bigger at the public<br />
expense, and I take great heart at the general support shown for<br />
the Government's policy of overall restraint and its provision<br />
of tax cuts.<br />
The question of electoral popularity aside, I am convinced that<br />
our policies of restraint and transferring more of the nation's<br />
resources from government to people are right for Australia.<br />
Each one of you in this room knows why this Government seeks<br />
to -transfer more of our country's resources back to private enterprise<br />
You know what we stand for: the elimination of unnecessary<br />
government interference, and a creative involvement to provide:<br />
the best conditions for business profitability, employment<br />
opportunities,, job satisfaction and consumer satisfaction.<br />
It is obviously not possible tonight to discuss all the ways in<br />
which government decisions affect business. Clearly almost<br />
every government decision has its effect on the private sector,<br />
particularly decisions on such matters as interest rates,<br />
the exchange rate, taxation and so on. But the Government's<br />
specific policies for industry fall into two broad groups. .1.3 </p>
<p>There are those regulating the business community to ensure fair<br />
comp~ etition and protect the public interest, and there are<br />
those that provide incentives for industry. I am well aware<br />
that the first group of regulatory policies often cause<br />
inconvenience and irritation, and according to a recent survey,<br />
significant costs to businessmen. But, I believe that<br />
few businessmen would reject totally the need for some sort of<br />
regulation. The regulating of banking, insurance, aviation,<br />
foreign investment and unfair trade practices are all essential<br />
to protect businessmen, employees, consumers and the general public.<br />
In the same way, I firmly believe that a comprehensive cooperative<br />
scheme with the States to regulate company law and the<br />
securities industry, and which is uniform throughout Australia,<br />
must have a high priority.<br />
The impartial regulation of business activities need not be seen<br />
as purely restrictive. On the contrary, properly devised<br />
-regulation expands areas of freedom. By establishing rules<br />
of fair behaviour, the strongest are deb. arred from abusing their<br />
position in an anti-social fashion, harmful to other businessmen<br />
and to the community at large. I do not suggest that all<br />
Commonwealth regulatory procedures measure up to this ideal.<br />
I do not imagine many here would think so either, but it is<br />
the Government's objective to make them measure up.<br />
Since coming to office, we have been undertaking a systematic<br />
review of such procedures, and in many cases unwarranted and<br />
harmful restrictions have been lifted. The Trade Practices<br />
legislation has been simplified to reduce business uncertainty<br />
and to streamline its operations. We have limited the number of<br />
businesses covered by the Prices Justification Tribunal,<br />
provided wider grounds for exemptions, and have markedly<br />
reduced the emphasis on compulsory prices justification.<br />
The emphasis is now on selective prices surveillance in areas<br />
of apparent monopoly, and in particular industries where consumers<br />
or producers claim to suffer under inequitable pricing practices.<br />
The role of the PJT continues to be under review.<br />
We are also studying, as a matter of urgency, all those matters<br />
which might inhibit foreign investment in Australia.<br />
The other side of the coin is the Government's many incentives<br />
to industry. In the past such assistance has overwhelmingly<br />
comprised tariffs and other trade protection devices. This form<br />
of assistance is inevitable in Australia with its small<br />
domestic market and great distance from export markets.<br />
There are definit&amp; limitationis on the rate at which changes<br />
in this area can be effected, particularly during periods of<br />
economic difficulty and unemployment, and governments must<br />
help formulate a coordinated approach for longer-term development<br />
of industry.<br />
Apart from tariffs and bounties, the government provides<br />
incentives to a wide range of activities which it believes must<br />
be encouraged in the national interest. We provide, for example,<br />
an investment allowance, tax incentives for oil and mineral<br />
exploration to protect our energy supplies, and assistance<br />
to encourage decentralisation. / 4 </p>
<p>4.<br />
These policies also are continually under review to ensure<br />
that they are justified and cost effective. For example,<br />
legislation will be introduced to promote exports by establishing<br />
an effective export incentive scheme, and an Australian<br />
Overseas Projects Corporation to help Australiani exporters<br />
compete for large scale development projects overseas.<br />
Incentives to promote industrial research and development are<br />
also under urgent review. '[' his is a field of vital importance<br />
to our long-term future. Australia has the potential<br />
to be the technological leader and supplier for our entire region.<br />
But for this potential to be realised, more emphasis must be<br />
given to developing more original and innovative technology of our<br />
own. These two groups of policies for industry regulation and<br />
incentives are complementary, and are both equally essential<br />
for the health and vigour of our economy. I should say that<br />
from time to time I receive unkind remarks about our<br />
regulatory policies. But businessmen are even handed in these<br />
matters they rarely say no to our incenitives.<br />
Our policies on the role of government in the economy and the<br />
relationship between government and the private sector stem<br />
from the strongest possible philosophical commitment to the<br />
fundamental role of private enterprise in our society.<br />
In all these policy areas, the government seeks the fullest<br />
consultation with industry leaders, and in this respect we<br />
receive most practical and useful views from this Institute.<br />
Governments of themselves can only strive to create the conditions<br />
in which the creative energies of the private sector can find<br />
their fullest expression. It is only if the private sector<br />
recognises and takes these opportunities that we can confidently<br />
look forward to a return to full economic health. </p>
