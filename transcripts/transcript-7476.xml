TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP HOTEL SHILLA SEOUL<br />
1 FEBRUARY 1989<br />
E EO PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister Hawke, the Koreans set a very<br />
high standard with their Olympics, can Australia match<br />
it or do even better?<br />
OPM: I believe we can. Its certainly true that our friends<br />
here have, as you correctly say, set a standard of excellence.<br />
We can learn from that and I am very pleased to say that<br />
President Roh has indicated that anything he can do to<br />
help us, if we are successful and perhaps in becoming<br />
successful he will do.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, are you concerned that Mr Greiner has<br />
already set his face against the Housing Conference?<br />
PM: Mr Greiner has got enough problems in his own state<br />
with the decay of his own administration. I think he<br />
ought to concentrate fully on that.<br />
