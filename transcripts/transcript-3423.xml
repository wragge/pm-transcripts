SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
TO THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL OF SALARIED<br />
AND PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, CANBERRA, MONDAY 21 OCTOBER<br />
1974<br />
MY MEETING WITH ACSPA TODAY IS PART OF A CONTINUING PROGRAM<br />
OF VISITS BY MINISTERS AND LABOR MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT TO TRADE<br />
UNION FORUMS&gt;, WITH MY COLLEAGUES I WELCOME EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO<br />
TELL UNIONISTS, EMPLOYEES, WORKERS OF ALL KINDS WHITE COLLAR,<br />
BLUE COLLAR, MEN AND WOMEN ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S ACHIEVEMENTS,<br />
ITS PLANS, AND ITS PROBLEMSY WE ARE READY TO DISCUSS FRANKLY<br />
WITH YOU THE ECONOMIC QUESTIONS THAT FACE US AND FACE THE<br />
GOVERNMENTS OF MOST OTHER COMPARABLE COUNTRIES5
AND SENATOR WRIEDT HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THE BUDGET TO THE TRADES<br />
AND LABOR COUNCILS OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA AND TASMANIAV SIMILAR<br />
VISITS BY MINISTERS ARE BEING MADE TO THE NEW SOUTH WALES AND<br />
VICTORIAN COUNCILSx AFTER DISCUSSIONS WITH EMPLOYEE<br />
JF3ANISATIONS WE HAVE AGREED THAT MINISTERS WILL ATTEND A<br />
VARI-TY OF'UNION CONFERENCES, TRADES AND LABOR COUNCIL MEETINGS,<br />
FEDERAL STATE EXECUTIVE MEETINGS AND GATHERINGS OF RANK AND<br />
FILE UNION MEMSERSX A HOPE-YOU WILL REGARD MY VISIT TODAY<br />
PLEASURABLE AS IT IS FOR ITS OWN SAKE AS PART OF A BROAD<br />
PROCESS OF DISCUSSION AND CONSULTATION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT<br />
AND THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENTA </p>
<p>-2-<br />
SUCH A PROCESS IS VALUABLE TO BOTH OF USX I DOUBT IF<br />
ANY PRIME MINISTER, HOWEVER ELSE HE MAY BE CRITICISED FOR THE<br />
WAY HE SPENDS HIS TIME, GIVES MORE OF IT TO PUBLIC SPEAKING,<br />
TO PRESS CONFERENCES, TO EXPLAINING AND CLARIFYING, I HOPE WITH<br />
SOME SUCCESS, THE POLICIES AND PHILOSOPHIES OF THE GOVERNMENTX<br />
THE SAME IS TRUE OF MY SENIOR MINISTERSX WE ARE COMMITTED TO<br />
OPEN GOVERNMENT, BUT WE RECOGNISE THAT THE SUCCESS OF OUR<br />
POLICIES DEPENDS ON THE FULLEST UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE ARE<br />
DOING. JUST AS IMPORTANT, WE NEED THE VIEWS, THE ADVICE, THE<br />
OPINIONS OF UNIONS AND EMPLOYEES AND THEIR ORGANISATIONS)<br />
WE HAVE YOUR INTERESTS AT HEART AND WE HAVE GREAT INTERESTS<br />
IN COMMONX OUR OBJECTIVES WILL BE ACHIEVED ONLY WITH THE<br />
FULL CO-OPERATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE WHOLE LABOR MOVEMENT-
LET ME AT ONCE ACKNOWLEDGE THE VALUABLE SUPPORT THAT MANY WHITE<br />
COLLAR UNIONS'GAVE THE GOVERNMENT AT THE LAST ELECTIONSX FOR<br />
THE FIRST TIME THEY GAVE OPEN SUPPORT TO A POLITICAL PARTY<br />
THE A. L. Px I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR YOUR JUDGMENT AND GOOD<br />
SENSE IN THESE MATTER.
</p><p>-3-<br />
BEFORE THE ELECTIONS I TOLD THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE<br />
FRANKLY THAT WE FACED SEVERE ECONOMIC PROBLEMSK I HAVE<br />
NEVER CONCEALED FROM THE PEOPLE THE NATURE OF THOSE PROBLEMS<br />
OR THE NEED FOR TOUGH MEASURES TO DEAL WITH THEMK IT IS TOO<br />
EARLY TO RELAX OUR EFFORTS. IN THE COMING YEAR WE WILL NEED<br />
e ALL THE VIGILANCE AND DETERMINATION WE CAN SUMMON TO OVERCOME<br />
THOSE PROBLEMS,) WE WILL NEED A GOVERNMENT THAT IS STRONG,<br />
RESOURCEFUL AND HUMANE
GOODWILL OF ALL SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY, AND ESPECIALLY<br />
OUR OWN SUPPORTERS, THE WORKING PEOPLE WHOSE INTERESTS AND<br />
WELFARE WE HAVE AT HEART: ONLY A LABOR GOVERNMENT A GOVERNMENT<br />
TWICE ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE, A GOVERNMENT THAT POSSESSES THE<br />
DEMONSTRATED CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE, A GOVERNMENT THAT PUTS<br />
THE WELFARE OF THE PEOPLE ABOVE VESTED INTERESTS AND SECTIONAL<br />
GROUPS CAN LEAD THIS COUNTRY THROUGH A PERIOD OF ECONOMIC<br />
DIFFICULTY THAT AFFLICTS ALL THE WORLD'S DEVELOPED INDUSTRIAL<br />
NATIONS( </p>
<p>JUST AS WE HAVE NEVER CONCEALED THE PROBLEMS, SO WE<br />
HAVE NEVER EXAGGERATED OR DISTORTED THEMK I HAVE FULL<br />
CONFIDENCE IN THE BASIC STRENGTH OF THE ECONOMYK WE HAVE<br />
ONLY TO REMEMBER THE FOUNDATIONS OF THAT STRENGTH RICH<br />
NATURAL RESOURCES, VIGOROUS TRADE, HEALTHY OVERSEAS RESERVES,<br />
A MATURE AND INDUSTRIOUS PEOPLE, A SECURE DEMOCRACY.,-IT IS<br />
TRUE THAT ALL THESE ASSETS CAN BE DEPLETED OR SQUANDERED OR ABUSEDOUR<br />
OPPONENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND IN DIFFERENT WAYS HAVE DONE<br />
JUST THAT. K MY GOVERNMENT WILL PRESERVE AND SAFEGUARD THESE BASIC<br />
ASSETS.
RESOURCES FROM FOREIGN EXPLOITATION?( WE ARE' GIVING BETTER AND<br />
BRIGHTER OPPORTUNITIES TO OUR PEOPLE FOR HEALTH, EDUCATION<br />
AND SOCIAL SECURITYe, WE ARE RESISTING THE ATTACKS ON DEMOCRACY<br />
AND IN THE LAST WEEK OR SO YOU HAVE HEARD THESE THREATS'<br />
RAISED YET AGAIN BY RUTHLESS AND EMBITTERED SENATORS AND<br />
AN OPPOSITION DETERMINED TO RUSTRATE THE PECF'.-' S WL..,<br />
SO I REJECT THE HYSTERIA AND DESPAIR OF THE OPFOSIT! ON,,<br />
I ACKNOWLEDGE THE .: FRIOUSNESS OF OUR PROLEMS. AND T4-NEED<br />
S. TESTING AND DIFFICULT SOLUTIONS, UNLIKE OUR OPPO-NTS.<br />
I ,. IEVE OUR PROBLEMS CAN BE LICKED AND WIL: BE LICKEDe<br />
YOU u, HAVE FROM ME OR ANY OF MY MINISTERS A MESSAGE OF<br />
PESSIMISM OR -EFEATK YOU WON T GET PANIC TALK OR DOUB31E TLk,,<br />
YOU'LL GET REALISM, HONic-vAND WHENEVER ACTION IS N EDED,<br />
YOU'LL GET PROM" F AND POSITIVE ACT. Y" K
</p><p>AS EMPLOYEES THE ISSUE THAT PARTICULARLY CONCERNS YOU IS<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT) THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES YOUR CONCERN AND SHARES<br />
YOUR CONCERN, ON THIS ISSUE I GIVE YOU THREE FIRM AND UNEQUIVOCAL<br />
ASSURANCESK FIRST, WE ADHERE FIRMLY TO OUR GOAL OF FULL EMPLOYMENT<br />
A JOB FOR EVERY AUSTRALIAN MAN'AND WOMAN WHO IS ABLE AND WILLING<br />
TO WORK-SECONDLY, AND FLOWING FROM THAT GOAL, WE WILL NEVER<br />
RESORT TO THE DELIBERATE CREATION OF MASS UNEMPLOYMENT AS A<br />
MEANS OF CHECKING INFLATIONk-THIRDLY, IF UNEMPLYMENT DOES OCCUR<br />
IN THE COMMUNITY DESPITE OUT EFFORTS AND INTENTIONS WE STAND<br />
READY TO CUSHION ITS EFFECTS, TO PROTECT THOSE AFFECTED, TO CARE<br />
FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES, TO ASSIST THEM IN FINDING NEW JOBS<br />
AND IF NECESSARY TRAIN THEM IN NEW JOBSv SO THERE YOU HAVE A<br />
THREE-FOLD COMMITMENT TO THE EMPLOYEES OF THIS COUNTRY </p>
<p>-6-<br />
WHEN EMPLOYEES ARE TEMPTED TO ASK, " WOULD UNEMPLOYMENT<br />
BE LESS UNDER THE LIBERALS?" JUST REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED WHEN<br />
THE LIBERALS WERE IN POWERY UNEMPLOYMENT WAS THEIR PRIME<br />
WEAPON, THEIR CHOSEN INSTRUMENT FOR CHECKING INFLATION AND<br />
INTIMIDATING THE UNION MOVEMENTA. IT WAS THE ONLY WEAPON THEY<br />
UNDERSTOODX THEY CALCULATED THAT THE VICTIMS OF UNEMPLOYMENT<br />
WERE MOST LIKELY TO BE LABOR VOTERS WHO HAD NEVER SUPPORTED A<br />
LIBERAL GOVERNMENT AND WERE THEREFORE UNABLE TO WITHDRAW THEIR<br />
SUPPORTK THEY MADE lEi CALLOUS AND CYNICAL ASSUMPTION THAT<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT WOULDN'T HURT THEMK THEY WERE WRONG IN 1961 AND<br />
THEY WERE WRONG IN 1972k YET THAT WAS THEIR ASSUMPTION ON<br />
EVERY OCCASION WHEN SIGNS OF INFLATION APPEARED THEY ACCEPTED<br />
WITHOUT QUESTION OR HESITATION THE ADVICE THAT MEN BE PUT OUT<br />
OF WORKK YET THE LIBERALS WERE TOTALLY INDIFFERENT TO THE<br />
EFFECTS OF UNEMPLOYMENT ON THE WORKING MAN AND HIS FAMILY AND<br />
ON THE WHOLE-COMMUNITY5 THEY HAD NO PLANS TO ALLEV! ATE UNEMPLOYMENT,<br />
TO PROTECT ITS VICTIMS, TO CREATE NEW JOB OPPr! Ti) NTUN" T-! T'T EJ. UI!<br />
MEN FOR OTHER WORK. WHEN YOU HEAR THE PIOUS CRIES O THE nPPOSITION<br />
ABOUT UNEMPLOYMEi,' TODAY REMEMBER rHOM'U CH WORSE iT :' OULD 3E IF<br />
THEY WERE IN POWER, HOW OFTEN THEY CREA'TD DELIBERATE UNEMPLOVMENT<br />
THElELVES, AND HOW UTTERLY INSENSITIVE THEY ': iRE TC THE PLIGHT<br />
OF IT " TrTIMS. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
IN OUR ECONOMIC POLICIES WE HAVE SHOWN OURSELVES READY<br />
TO TAKE ANY ACTION NEEDED TO MAINTAIN EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIESA<br />
AS THE TREASURER SAID WHEN PRESENTING THE BUDGET: " SHOULD THE<br />
NEED ARISE WE STAND READY DURING THE YEAR TO TAKE ACTION ON THE<br />
EXPENDITURE OR REVENUE SIDE OF THE BUDGET TO GIVE A QUICK<br />
STIMULUS TO DEMAND AND EMPLOYMENTk I E HAVE ALREADY DONE SO.<br />
WE HAVE GIVEN EVIDENCE OF THIS READINESSk<br />
THE DEYALUATION OF 25 SEPTEMBER WAS INTENDED TO GIVE<br />
A BOOST TO GENERAL BUSINESS CONFIDENCE AND STIMULATE THE ECONOMYV<br />
OUR GRADUAL EASING OF CREDIT, OUR MEASURES TO BOOST HOUSE<br />
BUILDING, OUR SELECTIVE RESPONSE TO DIFFICULTIES IN THE FOOTWEAR<br />
INDUSTRY ARE ALL EXAMPLES OF FLEXIBLE GOVERNMENT ACTION WITHIN<br />
THE CONTEXT OF AN OVERALL POLICY TO RESTRAIN THE RE-EMERGENCE<br />
OF SPENDINGk THE REGIONAL EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT SCHEME IS<br />
DESIGNED TO IMPROVE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN CERTAIN AREAS<br />
BY ENCOURAGING LOCAL INITIATIVES AND ENLISTING THE SUPPORT OF<br />
RELEVANT LOCAL AUTHORITIES3, THE NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT AND<br />
TRAINING SYSTEM IS PROVIDING COMPREHENSIVE JOB TRAINING AND<br />
RETRAINING SCHEMES FOR THOSE AFFECTED BY TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE<br />
OR GOVERNMENT POLICIESK NOTHING OF THIS SORT WAS EVEN CONTEMPLATED<br />
BY OUR PREDECESSORS, DESPITE A CLEAR NEED FOR ITX MANPOWER<br />
POLICIES ARE NOT SOMETHING NEEDED MERELY TO RELIEVE UNEMPLOYMENT*<br />
THEY ARE BASIC TO THE CREATION OF A MORE MODERN, EFFICIENT AND<br />
RESILIENT INDUSTRIAL ECONOMYX </p>
<p>OUR MEASURES CANNOT CURE OUR PROBLEM OVERNIGHT,. IT<br />
WILL TAKE TIME FOR THEIR EFFECTS TO BECOME APPARENT+ PITH<br />
EVERY ECONOMIC DECISION'THERE IS A LAG BETWEEN IMPLEMENTATION,<br />
AND RESULTSk THAT IS WHY I APPEAL TO YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING<br />
AND CO-OPERATIONk REMEMBER THAT NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS<br />
FOUND A QUICK, EASY SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF MAINTAINING<br />
PROSPERITY WITH FULL EMPLOYMENT AND A LOW LEVEL OF<br />
WE ARE DOING AS WELL AS MANY COUNTRIES IN COPING WITH INFLATION<br />
AND BETTER THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN MAINTAINING EMPLOYMENT. I<br />
DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK WE ARE COMPLACENT ON THAT SCORE PIE<br />
DON'T REGARD-ANY INCREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT AS ACCEPTABLE FOR A<br />
MOMENTA ONE MAN NEEDLESSLY UNEMPLOYED IS ONE MAN TOO MANYk LAST<br />
YEAR WE CLEANED UP THE MESS OF LIBERAL UNEMPLOYMENT. ' E ARE<br />
STILL COPING . WITH THE INFLATIONARY PRESSURES THEY LEFT BEHINDX<br />
IN THEIR LAST YEAR OF OFFICE THEY SCATTERED THE SEEDS OF INFLATION<br />
FAR AND WIDE OVERHEATING THE ECONOMY, FLOODING US WITH HOT<br />
MONEY IN A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO BUT OFF ELECTORAL DEFEATX </p>
<p>-9-<br />
TODAY THE FIGURES FOR THE SEPTEMBER CONSUMER PRICE<br />
INDEX WERE RELEASED THEY SHOW AN INCREASE IN THE SEPTEMBER<br />
QUARTER OF 5.4% k SUCH A DISTURBINGLY HIGH RATE OF INFLATION<br />
CANNOT CONTINUE WITHOUT PERMANENT DAMAGE TO OUR ECONOMIC<br />
AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBT THAT THIS<br />
SEVERE INFLATION WILL CONTINUE IF THERE ARE EXCESSIVE WAGE<br />
CLAIMSk IT IS IN THE INTERESTS OF ALL WORKERS TO RElfRAIN<br />
FROM MAKING UNREASONABLE WAGE DEMANDS, BECAUSE LET ME BE<br />
FRANK, INFLATION COSTS JOBS. INDUSTRIES WHICH MUST COMPETE<br />
WITH IMPORTS WILL BE PRICED OUT OF THE MARKET AND ALL INDUSTRIES<br />
CANNOT PLAN AND INVEST FOR THE FUTURE IN THE UNCERTAIN CLIMATE<br />
WHICH ACCOMPANIES INFLATION OF THIS MAGNITUDEk<br />
THE GOVERNMENT HAS SHOWN THROUGH ITS TAXATION<br />
POLICIES; ITS EXPENDITURE POLICIES AND ITS LEG VLATION ON<br />
PRICES JUSTIFICATION AND RESTRICTIVE TRADE PRACTICES THAT IT<br />
EXPECTS THE PRINCIPAL BURDEN OF RESTRAINT TO FALL ON THOSE<br />
BEST ABLE TO THE LOAD, THAT RESTRAINT IS ALREADY IN<br />
EFFECT AND WE NOW EXPECT THE LABOR MOVEMENT IN ITS IND! JSTRIAL<br />
ING TO RESPOND TO THE GOVERNMENT S CALL aW COOPERATE IN; A<br />
" TY WIDE EFFORT TO STOP INFLATIONk </p>
<p>As THE TREASURER STATED IN HIS BUDGET SPEECH,<br />
THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN EXPLORING A TAX PENALTY MECHANISM<br />
BY WHICH WAGE AND SALARY INCREASES BEYOND AN ESTABLISHED<br />
NORM MIGHT BE EXCLUDED FROM ASSESSABLE COSTS FOR THE<br />
ASSESSMENT OF COMPANY INCOME TAX. I HAVE RELEASED TODAY<br />
A COPY OF A REPORT OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY<br />
THE CABINET TO INVESTIGATE THIS MATTERA SUCH A TAX WOULD<br />
CREATE ANOMALIES AND DISTORT MANY ECONOMIC PROCESSES THE<br />
GOVERNMENT WOULD PREFER NOT TO BE FORCED INTO INTRODUCING<br />
SUCH A MEASURE EVEN ON A TEMPORARY BASISA HOWEVER, IF WAGE<br />
SETTLEMENTS CONTINUE AT THE RATE THEY HAVE* IN RECENT MONTHS,<br />
THEN WE HAVE TO FACE THE FACT THAT WHAT IS NOW MERELY AN<br />
OPTION MAY BECOME AN OBLIGATION.<br />
THE PRICE INCREASES REFLECTED IN THE SEPTEMBER<br />
QUARTER FIGURES ARE A REFLECTION OF WAGE INCREASES SOME<br />
MONTHS* AGOV THERE IS STILL A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF COST INFLATION<br />
IN THE ECONOMIC PIPELINEX WAGE CLAIMS IN THE COMING MONTHS<br />
WILL DETERMINE WHETHER THE RATE OF INFLATION WILL BE REDUCEDx.<br />
WE LOOK TO THE COOPERATION OF EMPLOYEES AND THEIR<br />
ORGANISATION IN THIS OBJECTIVEA WE DO SO WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO<br />
ALLOCATE BLAME FOR THAT IS A FRUITLESS EXERCI-SE5( THE QUESTION<br />
OF WHAT COMES FIRST, WAGE INCREASES OR PRICE INCREASES IS A<br />
CHICKEN AND EGG QUESTIONA WHAT WE MUST DO ISTO BREAK THE<br />
SPIRAL OF INTERACTION BETWEEN WAGES AND PRICESA THE GOVERNMENT<br />
HAS SET THE PRE-CONDITIONS, WITHIN THE LIMITS* OF ITS OWN<br />
CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY, FOR A COMMUNITY EFFORT TO BREAK<br />
THAT SPIRAL, WE MUST NOW PROCEED TO DO SO </p>
<p>i<br />
WE SHALL PRESS FORWARD WITH OUR PROGRAMl IF THERE IS<br />
ONE THING OUR OPPONENTS WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT IS THE ABANDONMENT<br />
OF OUR PROGRAMX IT IS OUR PROGRAM, ABOVE ALL, THAT GIVES MEANING<br />
AND PURPOSE TO THE LABOR GOVERNMENT AND EXPOSES THE COMPLACENCY<br />
AND EMPTINESS OF THE OPPOSITION, WE DON'T ADHERE TO OUR PROGRAM<br />
OUT OF STUBBORNNESS OR SENTIMENTX WE DON'T REGARD IT FOR A<br />
MOMENT AS INCOMPATIBLE WITH A DETERMINED AND RESOURCEFUL<br />
ANTI-INFLATIONARY PROGRAM FAR FROM BEING HOSTILE TO OUR<br />
ANTI-INFLATIONARY POLICIES, OUR PROGRAM IS INTEGRAL TO THEM,<br />
AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE BATTLE TO RESTRAIN INFLATION, TO REMOVE<br />
ITS CAUSES AND PROTECT ITS VICTIMSk YOU, . MR PRESIDENT, HAVE BEEN<br />
GOOD ENOUGH TO ACKNOWLEDGE IN YOUR ADDRESS THE MANY ACHIEVEMENTS<br />
IN THE GOVERNMENT'S RECORD TO DATEk I TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN THEM<br />
BUT WHAT IS THE POINT OF THEM? WHAT IS THE POINT OF BETTER<br />
EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES, BETTER HEALTH SERVICES, BETTER SOCIAL<br />
SECURITY, BETTER CHILD CARE, BETTER CITIES, BETTER TRANSPORT,<br />
BETTER ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS, BETTER MANPOWER POLICIES, BETTER<br />
AND MORE EFFICIENT METHODS OF ASSISTING OUR RURAL AND MANUFACTURING<br />
INDUSTRIES? </p>
<p>12<br />
CLEARLY ALL THESE ARE GOOD THINGS IN THEMSELVES XTHEY<br />
ARE DESIRABLE FOR THEIR OWN SAKE5TOGETHER, HOWEVER, THEY HELP<br />
CREATE A MORE EFFICIENT, MORE RATIONAL, MORE ORDERLY SOCIETY.<br />
THEY RAISE OUR STANDARD OF LIVING OUR CHANCES OF ENJOYING LIFE<br />
IN WAYS THAT ARE QUITE INDEPENDENT OF OUR INDIVIDUAL INCOMES,<br />
INDEED IN WAYS THAT INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE INCOMES, HOWEVER GREAT<br />
THEY MAY BE, CANNOT OF THEMSELVES ACHIEVEk THEY HELP REDUCE WASTE<br />
AND CUT DOWN COSTS,( THEY HELP SOCIETY MAKE THE MOST OF ITS<br />
AVAILABLE TALENTS AND RESOURCESX THESE THINGS, THEN, ARE PART<br />
OF A TRUE ANTI-INFLATIONARY POLICY BECAUSE THEY GO TO THE ROOTS<br />
OF OUR DIFFICULTIES NO COUNTRY, BECAUSE OF THE REALITIES OF<br />
WORLD TRADE AND CURRENCY MOVEMENTS, CAN ESCAPE INFLATION ALTOGETHER<br />
IF, HOWEVER, WE LOOK AT THE COUNTRIES WHERE INFLATION IS LOWEST,<br />
WE FIND THEY ARE THOSE WITH THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF INDUSTRIAL<br />
EFFICIENCY, THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF SOCIAL SECURITY, THE MOST MODERN<br />
INSTITUTIONS, WHERE EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS AND OTHER SERVICES ARE<br />
NOT BLIGHTED BY CLASS DISTINCTION, SOCIAL UNREST OR GROSS<br />
INEQUALITIES OF INCOMEX a/ 13 </p>
<p>13<br />
I DO NOT WANT TO OVERSIMPLIFY THIS PROBLEM UNLIKE<br />
MR SNEDDEN I CANNOT CLAIM TO HAVE A MAGIC CURES I SUGGEST, HOWEVER,<br />
THAT IN THE LONG RUN THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF APPROACHING THE PROBLEM<br />
OF INFLATIONX ONE IS TO BLUDGEON THE ECONOMY INTO SUBMISSION;<br />
TAKE IT OUT ON THE WORKERS THAT IS THE LIBERAL APPROACHV THE<br />
OTHER IS TO REFORM THE BASIC INSTITUTIONS OF A MIXED ECONOMY, TO<br />
MAKE OUR FACTORIES AND SERVICES MORE MODERN AND EFFICIENT, OUR ROADS<br />
AND TRANSPORT SYSTEMS MORE UP-TO-DATE AND BETTER CO-ORDINATED, TO<br />
IMPROVE OUR EDUCATIONAL SERVICES FROM PRE-SCHOOLS TO TECHNICAL<br />
COLLEGES TO UNIVERSITIES, TO MAKE OUR CITI-ES LESS CONGESTED AND<br />
POLLUTED, TO ENSURE FAIR AND HEALTHY COMPETITION IN THE PRIVATE<br />
SECTOR, TO CUT OUT WASTEFUL RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES AND PROTECT THE<br />
CONSUMER, TO REMOVE THE CAUSES OF FEAR AND INSECURITY AND NEEDLESS<br />
INDUSTRIAL UNREST BY GIVING EMPLOYEES A FAIR SHARE OF THE NATION'S<br />
PROSPERITY' THAT IS OUR APPROACHK THAT IS WHAT OUR POLICIES<br />
AIM TO DOK THEY ARE NOT JUST A COLLECTION OF ATTRACTIVE PARTSy<br />
THEIR UNIFYING AND CONSISTENT PRINCIPLE IS SOCIAL REFORM AND<br />
REGENERATION ,/ 14 </p>
<p>11-<br />
OUR PROGRAM IS RAISING THE LIVING STANDARDS AND THE<br />
SECURITY OF EVERY AUSTRALIAN..
TO THE WORKERS'I WELFARE AS HIS AGITATION FOR MORE PAYK<br />
THE BUDGET FOR 1974/ 75 ANNOUNCED AN EXPENDITURE ON EDUCATION<br />
OF $ 1,535 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF 78 PER CENT ON THE PREVIOUS<br />
YEARtC, WE ARE SPENDING SEVEN TIMES MORE THAN OUR PREDECESSORS<br />
ON SCHOOLS AND FOUR TIMES MORE ON THE WHOLE FIELD OF EDUCATION
HEALTH EXPENDITURE ROSE By 21 PER CENT IN-1973/ 74 AND WILL RISE<br />
BY 30 PER CENT THIS YEARK OUR EXPENDITURE ON SOCIAL SECURITY<br />
AND lWE.-LFARErc AMOUNTS TO NEARLY A QUARTER OF BUDGET OUTLAYS AND<br />
iS EXPECTED FO REACH $ 3,441 MILLION THIS YEAR, AN INCREASE OF<br />
38.3 PER CENT OVER LAST YEAR,
REACH A RECORD $ 1401 MILLION THIS YEAR, COMPARED WITH $ 77 MILLION<br />
SPENT BY OUR PREDECESSORS IN THEIR LAST YEAR OF OFF ICE#'<br />
EXPENDITURE ON URBAN IMPROVEMENTS AND THE ENVIRONMENT WILL<br />
AL. MOST REACH $ 1400 MILLION, A THREE-FOLD INCREASE ON LAST YEAR<br />
AND EIGHT TIMES THE AMOUNT SPENT BY OUR PREDECESSORS IN 1972/ 73
WE HAVE ALSO TAKEN IMPORTANT STEPS IN IMPROVING PUBLIC TRANSPORT,<br />
WATER SUPPLY AND ELECTRICITY, RETRAINING, REGIONAL EMPLOYMENT<br />
AND IN NATIONAL COMPENSATION AND REHABILITATION SCHEMESo( </p>
<p>I DO NOT MEAN BY THIS THAT HIGHER WAGES ARE UNIMPORTANT,<br />
REAL PURCHASING POWER FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF AUSTRALIANS HAS<br />
IMPROVED UNDER A LABOR GOVERNMENT AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SOK<br />
TO THE EXTENT THAT HIGHER INCOMES REPRESENT A REAL GAIN IN<br />
LIVING STANDARDS WE WELCOME EVERY ADVANCE THAT EMPLOYEES CAN<br />
ACHIEVE,( WHAT IS FUTILE, AND WHAT WE MUST CURTAIL, IS THE<br />
EXCESSIVE AND SELF-DEFEATING ESCALATION OF MONEY INCOMES THAT<br />
BRINGS NO IMPROVEMENT IN LIVING STANDARDSX THIS IS WHAT WE<br />
MEAN BY WAGE RESTRAINTA( NATURALLY, WHILE INFLATION PERSISTS<br />
AS A RESULT OF PAST LIBERAL NEGLECT AND IRRESPONSIBILITY AS<br />
WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF WORLDWIDE INFLATION,. WE WANT TO ENSURE<br />
THAT EMPLOYEES' WAGES ARE ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY,( THE CONCILIATION<br />
AND ARBITRATION COMMISSION WILL NOW DECIDE THE MATTER OF WAGE<br />
INDEXATIONK ( MAY I SAY IN PASSING THAT WE TAKE GREAT<br />
SATISFACTION, AS YOU MUST DO, FROM THE APPOINTMENT OF MR.<br />
BARNEY WILLIAMS, THE SECRETARY OF ACSPA, AS A DEPUTY PRESIDENT<br />
OF THE COMMISSIONX) </p>
<p>-16-<br />
THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECLARED ITS SUPPORT FOR QUARTERLY<br />
., COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS IN THE BELIEF THAT THEY WILL HELP<br />
RESTRAIN A WORTHLESS GROWTH IN MONEY WAGESWITHOUT DEPRIVING<br />
EMPLOYEES OF THE PROGRESSIVE IMPROVEMENT OF REAL EARNINGS MADE<br />
POSSIBLE BY RISING PRODUCTIVITYX WE AGREE WITH ACSPA THAT WAGE<br />
INDEXATION ON ITS OWN CAN NEVER BE SUFFICIENT AS A TOTAL WAGES<br />
POLICY OR AS A GOAL FOR THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT5 WE SEE IT<br />
SOLELY AS A COUNTER TO THE EFFECTS OF INFLATIONARY PRESSURES ON<br />
INCOMES; WE DO NOT SEE IT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE BROADER AND<br />
MORE FUNDAMENTAL REVIEW OF WAGES AND SALARIES BASED ON WORK<br />
VALUES, CHANGING CONDITIONS OR PRODUCTIVITYk FOR THAT REASON<br />
WE DO NOT INTEND TO APPLY A PERCENTAGE INDEX TO ALL WAGES AND<br />
SALARIESK WE WILL DO THAT FOR LOWER PAID WORKERS AND MAKE A<br />
FLAT INCREASE FOR THOSE RECEIVING MORE THAN AVERAGE WEEKLY<br />
EARNINGS. IN THIS, QUITE FRANKLY, WE DIFFER FROM THE POLICY OF<br />
ACSPA, WHICH FAVOURS A PERCENTAGE ADJUSTMENT FOR ALL WORKERSX<br />
BECAUSE THE PRINCIPLE AT ISSUE IS IMPORTANT TO BOTH OF US I<br />
SHALL TRY TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY WE BELIEVE OUR APPROACH IS THE<br />
FAIRESTI IN THE FIRST PLACE IT CONFORMS WITH ALL HISTORICAL<br />
PRECEDENTSX WHEN QUARTERLY COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENTS WERE MADE<br />
IN THE PAST, THE INDEX APPLIED ONLY TO THE BASIC WAGE COMPONENT<br />
OF A WORKER'S PAY, NEVER TO HIS MARGIN, PERCENTAGE RISES ACROSS<br />
THE BOARD WERE NEVER MADE, AND IT IS WORTH RECALLING THAT WHEN<br />
EMPLOYEE ORGANISATIONS INCLUDING ACSPA 5' CsSOUGHT RESTORATION<br />
OF CO( ST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENTS IN THE MID-" ft IT WAS THE FLAT<br />
RATE INCREASE WHICH THEY SUPPORTED </p>
<p>PART OF THE LABOR GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY IS TO<br />
REDISTRIBUTE INCOMES IN FAVOUR OF THE LEAST FORTUNATE AND LOWEST<br />
PAID MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITYW THIS HAS BEEN A CONSISTENT<br />
l THEME OF THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICIESX WE RAISED THE BASIC PENSION<br />
LAST AUGUST BY $ 5 A WEEKX IT WAS THE BIGGEST SINGLE INCREASE EVER.<br />
MADE IN THE PENSION 1E RESTRUCTURED TAX SCALES IN THE BUDGET<br />
IN FAVOUR OF LOWER AND MIDDLE INCOME EARNERSX AS A RESULT, THE<br />
MAJORITY OF LOWER PAID AUSTRALIANS WILL PAY LESS TAXy OUR HOME<br />
MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTIBILITY SCHEME WILL BENEFIT THE LOWER<br />
PAID WORKER MORE THAN THOSE ON HIGHER PAYj IN THESE SITUATIONS,<br />
TO GIVE THE SAME BENEFITS TO EVERYONE IS NOT TO" TREAT ALL PEOPLE.<br />
EQUALLY BUT TO TREAT THE FORTUNATE MORE GENEROUSLY THAN THE RESTk<br />
CONVERSELY, IF WE TRULY BELIEVE IN SOCIAL EQUALITY WE MUST TREAT<br />
THE POOR A GOOD DEAL BETTER THAN THE RESTx THE DEPRIVED IN OUR<br />
SOCIETY ARE NOT DEPRIVED MERELY BY COMPARISON WITH SPECULATORS,<br />
STOCKBROKERS AND BUSINESSMEN4 THEY ARE DEPRIVED BY COMPARISON<br />
WITH OTHER WAGE AND SALARY EARNERS, AND THIS IS A MUCH MORE<br />
IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF THEIR UNRESTX / 18<br />
a </p>
<p>-18-<br />
IPUT IT TO YOU THAT THE HIGHEST PAID WORKERS IN THE<br />
COMMUNITY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WELFARE OF THEIR<br />
LESS FORTUNATE FELLOWS. OUR POLICY ON INDEXATION, LIKE<br />
OUR CAPITAL GAINS TAX AND OUR SURCHARGE ON UNEARNED INCOME.-<br />
IS AN ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH GREATER EQUITY IN THE TAXATION<br />
AND INCOME SCALES. EQUITY IS WHAT THIS GOVERNMENT IS ALL<br />
ABOUT. IN FIELDS OTHER THAN WAGES THE GoVERNMEN" T HAS ACTED<br />
WHEREVER POSSIBLE TO RAISE STANDARDS AND CONDITIONS OFEMPLOYEES.<br />
FOR THOSE OF YOUR MEMBERS IN THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
PUBLIC SERVICE WE HAVE INTRODUCED A WHOLE RANGE OF NEW<br />
BENEFITS WHICH IN TIME.-WE BELIEVE, WILL* BENEFIT EVERYONE#<br />
WE INTRODUCED FOUR WEEKS' ANNUAL LEAVE, AN ANNUAL LEAVE<br />
LOADING5o MATERNITY AND PATERNITY LEAVE. WE HAVE * EXTENDED'<br />
CAREER OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO EMPLOYEES WITH THE SERVICE<br />
AND REDUCED THE QUALIFYING PERIOD FOR LONG-SERVICE LEAVE<br />
FROM 15 TO 10 YEARS. WE HAVE ENCOURAGED MORE FLEXIBLE WORKING.<br />
HOURS, REMOVED AGE LIMITS ON ENTRY AND BANNED DISCRIMINATION<br />
AGAIN'ST WOMEN. WE HAVE LIFTED RESTRICTIONS ON FREE SPEECH<br />
AND ABOLISHED THE BONDING SYSTEM. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED EQUAL<br />
PAY FOR WOMEN A PRINCIPLE. WE SUPPORTED FOR-ALL WOMEN IN THE<br />
WORK FORCE IN ONE OF THE VERY FIRST ACTIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT, </p>
<p>-19.<br />
I COMMEND THE BROAD POLICY OBJECTIVES OF ACSPA. YOUR<br />
PRE--BUDGET SUBMISSIONS TO THE GOVERNMENT AND YOUR SUBMISSION<br />
TO [ IR JUSTICE MOORE'S CONFERENCE WERE WELCOME AND IMPORTANT<br />
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF CURRENT ECONOMIC ISSUES.<br />
YOU HAVE DONE MUCH TO INVOLVE WHITE COLLAR', WORKERS IN THE REALITIES<br />
OF INDUSTRIAL NEGOTIATION, TO ADVANEC E THEIR WELFARE AND IMPROVE<br />
THE STATUS OF EMPLOYEES OF ALL KINDS, I VALUE THE SUPPORT AND<br />
CO-OPERATION YOU HAVE SHOWN TO THE GOVERNMENT. WHILE I CAN<br />
UNDERSTAND THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED, I HOPE THE<br />
CURRENT RENEWED-INITIATIVES TOWARDS THE AFFILIATION OF ACSPA<br />
AND THE ACTU WILL LEAD TO POSITIVE RESULTS. ONE OF THE CONSTANT<br />
OBJECTIVES OF THE LABOR GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN TO BRING ABOUT<br />
THE AMALGAMATION OF UNIONS INTO MORE VIABLE AND EFFICIENT<br />
GROUPINGS. THIS OBJECTIVE; CENTRAL TO OUR AIM OF GREATER<br />
INDUSTRIAL STABILITY AND HARMONY, HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY<br />
FRUSTRATED BY OUR OPPONENTS. I BELIEVE THE PRINCIPLE OF<br />
AMALGAMATION APPLIES WITH EQUAL VALIDITY TO UNION COUNCILS<br />
THE CLOSEST POSSIBLE INSTITUTIONAL LINKS BETWEEN WHITE AND<br />
BLUE COLLAR UNIONS WILL HELP BRING US CLOSER TO THE ACHIEVEMENT<br />
OF OUR COMMON GOALS AND THE CREATION OF A MORE JUST AND<br />
PROSPEROUS SOCIETY FOR ALL AUSTRALIANs, </p>
