FOR MEDIA 12 MARCH 1990<br />
As members of the Commonwealth all around the world<br />
celebrate Commonwealth Day 1990, the Commonwealth has<br />
cause to be exceptionally proud of its role,<br />
particularly in helping to bring change to southern<br />
Africa. Australia was actively involved in Namibia's transition<br />
to democracy and we look forward to welcoming Namibia as<br />
the Commonwealth's fiftieth member on its Independence<br />
Day on 21 March.<br />
All Commonwealth members have also welcomed Nelson<br />
Mandela's release and the recent reforms announced by<br />
the de Klerk Government.<br />
This year will also mark the first time that Pakistan<br />
celebrates Commonwealth Day since its return to the<br />
Commonwealth under the leadership of democratically<br />
elected Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.<br />
Pakistan's entry to the Commonwealth, brought to fortynine<br />
the number of countries that will be celebrating<br />
the achievements of this remarkable grouping of<br />
countries. The environment, an issue of growing global concern, was<br />
a major topic for discussion at the October<br />
anniversary meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of<br />
Government in Kuala Lumpur. The Langkawi Declaration<br />
provides a clear-sighted program of action for dealing<br />
with international environmental problems.<br />
The Commonwealth welcomed Australia's initiative to<br />
develop a vital program to provide training for<br />
assessing the effects of climate change on rural land<br />
productivity. The achievements of this past year are a clear<br />
sign that the Commonwealth will respond positively and<br />
creatively to the challenges of the 1990s. </p>
