RESIGNATION FROM4 PARLIAMHENT OF SIR PHILLIP LYNCH<br />
I wish to express my personal regret at the circumstances.<br />
which have led to the resignation of Sir Phillip Lynch<br />
from the Parliament.<br />
Sir Phillip had been chosen by the electors of Flinders as<br />
their member on six occasions since his first election in<br />
1966. During his record term of 16 years as Member for Flinders<br />
Sir Phillip had made an exceptionally distinguished contribution<br />
to the Liberal Party, to the Government and to the country.<br />
He had been first appointed to the Army Ministry in 1968 and<br />
had subsequently held the portfolios of Iimmigration, Labour<br />
and National Service, Treasury, Finance and Industry and<br />
Commerce. Sir Phillip's special understandin g of economic and industry<br />
matters had brought a valuable perspective to Cabinet's<br />
consideration of these matters. His chairmanship of significant<br />
Cabinet Committees, particularly the Cabinet Budact Committee,<br />
was especially important in this context. Sir Phillip also<br />
played a key role as Chairman of the Review of Commonwealth<br />
Functions. Sir Phillip's service to the Liberal Party was unique.<br />
In his record term of 10 years as Deputy Leader of. the<br />
Parliamentary Liberal Party, Sir Phillip had performed a critical<br />
role in organisational and liaison matters. I am particularl1y<br />
grateful for Sir Phillip's support over that period.<br />
I fully respect'and understand the reasons for Sir Phillip's.<br />
decision to resign at this time. I am also sure that. I am<br />
expressing the feelings of all my colleagues in wishing Sir<br />
Phillip and Lady Lynch every success and good health for the<br />
future. 0000O0000 </p>
