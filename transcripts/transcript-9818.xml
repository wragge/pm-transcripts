PRIME MINISTER 122/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
PREMIER COURTS THREAT: A STATE INCOME TAX AND<br />
CONSUMPTION TAX OR SECESSION<br />
West Australian Premier Richard Court has made it clear where he stands on<br />
State Income Tax and State Consumption Tax he wants both.<br />
And while he was telling us he wants both, John Howard was slipping and<br />
sliding on radio in Perth pretending it wasn't his policy.<br />
I bet he wished Mr Court had a case of lockjaw. The Premier has confirmed<br />
the Coalition's taxation policy.<br />
The Shadow Treasurer, Peter Costello, let the cat out of the bag with his<br />
interview with Business Review Weekly saying he would fix the so-called<br />
" vertical fiscal imbalance" which is econo-speak for state taxes. Mr Howard<br />
and Mr Costello have been denying it since.<br />
But Mr Howard's difficulty is that Mr Costello was quoted directly in Business<br />
Review Weekly.<br />
Mr Costello said he had consulted with the conservative states and he had.<br />
The product of this consultation was published by the Treasurer Mr Willis on<br />
Sunday a 45-page plan by Access Economics commissioned by Richard<br />
Court and the other conservative States and Territories for a State income tax<br />
and a State GST.<br />
Mr Howard is entirely conscientious at muckraking and smearing he is not at<br />
all conscientious at producing policies.<br />
Richard Court is so desperate to levy a State Income Tax and a State GST<br />
that he will even use the outrageous threat of secession to get his way. And<br />
Mr Howard is happy to oblige him. But not yet. He wants to win the election<br />
and then introduce State taxes on the sly. Mr Costello has said as much. </p>
<p>This Government will do all in its power to stop the fracturing of the uniform<br />
income taxing power of the Commonwealth.<br />
Mr Howard wants to introduce what he couldn't at the last election a GST.<br />
Access Economics did the work for the Liberal Party in 1993 with<br />
" Fightback!", and they are back again.<br />
This time it's the same proposal, but levied by the States.<br />
When Mr Howard says that as Prime Minister, he wouldn't permit State taxes<br />
to be levied don't believe him.<br />
His statements on this have about as much integrity as his muckraking efforts<br />
of the last few weeks.<br />
