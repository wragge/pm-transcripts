</tr></tbody></table><p><br />The Prime Minister's XI match has become an important event on the cricket calendar and I have great pleasure in continuing the tradition.</p>
<p>Thc annual match is a great opportunity for young players to gain valuable international experience and for more established players to display their renowned and spectacular talents. The match will also allow team members to 'get their eye in' for the season against the West Indies and Pakistan and stake their claims for national selection.</p>
<p>So, once again, the PM's XJ side contains a blend of some of Australia's most promising young cricketers Michael Bevan, Adam Gilchrist, Justin Langer, Paul Reiffel and Peter McPhee and some of the most accomplished and exciting players in Australian and World cricket.</p>
<p>Graduates of the AIS Commonwealth Bank Cricket Academy have, in recent years, also featured in the team, and that tradition also continues, with the selection of Michael Bevan, Justin Langer and Adam Gilchrist, the wicketkeeper.</p>
<p>This gamc provides particular pleasure to a lot of people and I am sure that this year's team, and its opponents, will put on a particularly skilful and entertaining display.</p>
