TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, BOB HAWKE COMMUNITY CENTRE,<br />
MELBOURNE 23 JANUARY 1988<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke what was the message from the<br />
pensioners this morning?<br />
PM: Well it seemed to be a particular interest in the area<br />
of the threshold for tax and I'm told by my members of the<br />
Task Force that that's an issue which has come up in theiLr<br />
various meetings around Australia so it's obviously<br />
something that we are going to have to look at. Some of<br />
their areas of concern are outside our constitutional power<br />
as you would appreciate. They were looking for greater<br />
concessions in the area of transport. One suggestion, for<br />
instance, was made that there ought to be free transport on<br />
public transport between the hours of nine and three. Well<br />
that's something obviously within the area of State<br />
Governments and some of their concerns were local<br />
Governments like concessions, further concessions on rates,<br />
water rates and that type of thing. So what is useful is<br />
that we are now, as a result of this process which will be<br />
continued right around Australia, by the end of this process<br />
we'll have a very clear view of sorts of issues which are of<br />
major concern to the elderly citizens. We will feed those<br />
concerns into our decision making process.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are the pensioners likely to get more money in<br />
real terms in the next Budget?<br />
PM4: I can't lay down now what will happen in the Budget.<br />
All I can say is that in our six years of Government we have<br />
significantly increased the real value of the pension some<br />
eight percent real increase in pension and that of course is<br />
against the significant real reduction under John Howard.<br />
So we have shown in the six years in Government that we are<br />
about increasing the real value of pensions. And certainly<br />
against the pathetic record of the conservatives who prattle<br />
and make all the noise and talk about their concern for the<br />
family and the elderly, what was the record? They cut the<br />
real value of the pensions. we increase it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are Australian pensioners relatively well off<br />
or how would you describe the state that they are in? </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM: Well, no it would be unkind, indecent to say relatively<br />
well off. You've got to say relatively to whom? I mean, if<br />
you said relatively to the poor of India, they are well off,<br />
but that's not a relevant comparison. If you asked<br />
relevant to the wealthy in this country, no they are not<br />
well off. What we've tried to do is to gradually increase<br />
the relationship of the pension to the earnings of the<br />
community generally. That's the sort of relationship which<br />
they have regarded as important. Now when we came to office<br />
the pension as a proportion of average weekly earnings was<br />
22.7 percent. Now we said we would try and get it up to<br />
We've done that. It's virtually at 25 percent now, so<br />
that's the sort of relative comparison. What's the average<br />
community wage, average weekly earnings and what's the<br />
pension as a proportion of that. As I say, since we've been<br />
in office from the legacy that we inherited from the<br />
conservatives, the noise makers but the do nothing<br />
merchants, I mean they are marvellous at saying ' this is our<br />
concern, we love the elderly, we'll look after them'. Well<br />
they walked out of office having reduced the real value of<br />
pension, having left it at 22.7 percent of average weekly<br />
earnings. We've put it up to 25 percent. That's the<br />
relativity that matters and that's our relative performance<br />
compared to the conservatives.<br />
ends </p>
