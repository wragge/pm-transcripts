    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.............................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much Mr Dalton. To my colleague Wilson Tuckey, to Mr</p>
<p> Ken Wilkie the Federal Member for Swan representing the Leader of</p>
<p> the Federal Opposition, to Mike Board representing the Premier, to</p>
<p> (inaudible) and Andrew who have given such moving speeches on the</p>
<p> ongoing significance of the contribution and the sacrifice of the</p>
<p> men that we honour today. I particularly thank you for your very thoughtful</p>
<p> and sensitive remarks. But most importantly to 800 years of accumulated</p>
<p> wisdom, experience, and commitment to Australia. These magnificent</p>
<p> men. These true national treasures of Australia. To them we particularly</p>
<p> honour and dedicate this occasion.</p>
<p>Many things have been said about the ANZAC tradition. Many things</p>
<p> have been said about the sacrifice of Australians who have died to</p>
<p> give us the freedom that we enjoy in this freest of all countries</p>
<p> in the world. When ever I've visited a war cemetery, particularly</p>
<p> the cemeteries of France, I'm struck by one overwhelming impression,</p>
<p> an overwhelming reaction, and that is that they were all so young.</p>
<p> As you read each headstone and see the age: 17, 18, 19, in their early</p>
<p> 20s. You think of the fearful slaughter and you think of the incredible</p>
<p> waste of humanity that occurred on both sides of that conflict, and</p>
<p> indeed of all conflicts.</p>
<p>We should never forget that in 1914 the male population of Australia</p>
<p> was in the order of two-and-a-half to three million, and yet almost</p>
<p> 400,000 of those volunteered to fight in World War I. And 60,000 of</p>
<p> those who volunteered never came back, and tens of thousands more</p>
<p> were wounded, many very seriously. And it is an astonishing tribute</p>
<p> to the resilience of that generation that these eight wonderful men</p>
<p> are with us today. And I can't find the words, politicians are</p>
<p> meant always to have words to talk about and describe things, I can't</p>
<p> find words to adequately express the admiration that I feel for that</p>
<p> heroic generation that did so much. And I want to say that as Prime</p>
<p> Minister that I hope that this country forever studies and seeks to</p>
<p> better and further understand World War I, to understand the influence</p>
<p> that it had on the history of the world, to understand the social</p>
<p> impact of World War I on the Australian nation, the sense of nationhood</p>
<p> and the sense of even greater resilience and independence that the</p>
<p> experience of World War I gave to our nation.</p>
<p>And in studying that let us honour these remarkable people. Let us</p>
<p> also honour the contribution of those in the nursing corps who worked</p>
<p> so very hard to care for the wounded at the front. Let us honour and</p>
<p> remember the pain and the anguish and the agony of the mothers and</p>
<p> the wives and the sisters who received those awful telegrams notifying</p>
<p> death, or notifying severe wounding.</p>
<p>So today is an occasion to do that and that is because of that feeling</p>
<p> that we decided on Armistice Day last year that for the first time</p>
<p> under the Australian honours system we strike a commemorative medal.</p>
<p> And that commemorative medal was to be given to every survivor or</p>
<p> World War I alive on Armistice Day last year which was the 80th</p>
<p> anniversary of the cessation of hostilities in November 1918. And</p>
<p> the medal is a wonderful representation of what it honours. On one</p>
<p> side it has the replica of the Digger statue that was unveiled at</p>
<p> Bullecourt last year. On the other side is the Federation Star and</p>
<p> the wattle of Australia. The ribbon is the colour of the Flanders</p>
<p> poppy and it is joined by the crown because all the soldiers who went</p>
<p> to World War I were soldiers of the King.</p>
<p>And I think in every way it captures the occasion, it brings together</p>
<p> the various elements that were relevant at that time and continue</p>
<p> to be relevant. But most importantly ladies and gentleman it's</p>
<p> a symbolic expression of the respect and gratitude and honour that</p>
<p> we all feel is due to that generation and most particularly to the</p>
<p> survivors of that generation. And it really is one of those great</p>
<p> privileges as Prime Minister of our country that I can come here today</p>
<p> on the first occasion, on the eve of ANZAC Day 1999 and present the</p>
<p> medals, 11 of them, to recipients and to the families. And in doing</p>
<p> that could I just say one or two things particularly about some of</p>
<p> the recipients.</p>
<p>There are many images of individuals that come out of World War I.</p>
<p> None of course in a sense has become more famous than the image of</p>
<p> Simpson and his donkey. But just as children of Australian schools</p>
<p> learnt of Simpson and his donkey, perhaps in years ahead children</p>
<p> could be told of Private Peter Casserly who is here today, who lied</p>
<p> about his age to enlist in the AIF. Let them here how he wrote to</p>
<p> his mother, a message in a bottle and threw it over the side of a</p>
<p> ship as he departed his homeland. And may they learn how the message</p>
<p> reached his mother and how Peter reached action on the Western Front.</p>
<p>Let children be told of Private Cecil McFee who saw a great number</p>
<p> of battles on the Western Front and whose service continues even beyond</p>
<p> the end of World War II when he served in Japan as a member of the</p>
<p> British Commonwealth ccupation force.</p>
<p>May they hear about the service of Private George Podmore who was</p>
<p> wounded in action at Villiers Bretonneux in April 1918. And Private</p>
<p> Hubert Walton, the youngest of 11 children who enlisted at the age</p>
<p> of 17 to fight in many actions on the Western Front.</p>
<p>Let children hear of others hear of others who survived to the 80th</p>
<p> anniversary of the Armistice but did not live until today. Like Gallipoli</p>
<p> veteran Lance Corporal Leonard Hall who left to fight to join the</p>
<p> Light Horse when he was 16, and who had his age put up because he</p>
<p> was a bugler that the regiment so dearly wanted. Let them be taught</p>
<p> that he was only to survive the blast of an aerial torpedo because</p>
<p> his horse was to take the brunt of the explosion.</p>
<p>May children learn about others recognised by this medal who were</p>
<p> not to survive until today like Gallipoli veteran Private Francis</p>
<p> Isaacs who fought in many battles on the Western Front such as at</p>
<p> Pozieres where the AIF lost 23,000 men, who, like himself was twice</p>
<p> wounded and twice returned to the front to continue his service.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentleman, we've had today two very fine and moving</p>
<p> contributions from two young Australians. Young Australians born into</p>
<p> a free country, born into a country that has almost unparalleled opportunities,</p>
<p> a country which is as free as any in the world, a country that offers</p>
<p> hope and security and opportunity for its young. But in their words</p>
<p> they displayed a respect and an understanding and a reverence for</p>
<p> the contribution of earlier generations. And there is a continuity.</p>
<p> There is something very special about the Australian identity, there's</p>
<p> something very special about the ANZAC tradition. And I don't</p>
<p> think that the ANZAC tradition has been better described than in the</p>
<p> words of that great World War I historian Charles Bean who wrote of</p>
<p> the ANZAC spirit as follows: "In the end ANZAC stood and still</p>
<p> stands for reckless valour in a good cause, for enterprise, resourcefulness,</p>
<p> fidelity, comradeship and endurance that will never admit defeat".</p>
<p>I can't think, although those words were written many many years</p>
<p> ago, I can't think of a more beautifully, evocative description</p>
<p> of what I always thought the Australian spirit to be. Those words</p>
<p> call to mind comradeship, they call to mind mateship, they call to</p>
<p> mind the commitment of Australians to good causes, they call to mind</p>
<p> the skepticism about too much authority which has always been an endearing</p>
<p> Australian characteristic, and they call to mind the sense of adventure,</p>
<p> and they call to mind the optimism of the Australian people and the</p>
<p> Australian nation. And those words have been, are as valid and as</p>
<p> enduring, and as evocative today as they were when they were written.</p>
<p> And they beautifully encapsulate to me, and I believe to many other</p>
<p> Australians, what these men went to war to defend, what they went</p>
<p> to war to demonstrate, and how they demonstrated to the world what</p>
<p> a remarkable, particular and special place Australia really was.</p>
<p>Can I say to all of you wonderful Australians collectively from the</p>
<p> bottom of a grateful nation's heart, thank you for what you have</p>
<p> done for us. Thank you for the land you fought to protect. Thank you</p>
<p> for the way of life that you helped bequeath to all of us. And thank</p>
<p> you for the quality of that life that we in the present generations</p>
<p> of Australians so richly enjoy and are so deeply grateful that you</p>
<p> have given to us. Thank you.</p>
