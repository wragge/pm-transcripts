    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am delighted to announce that the long awaited Scoresby Freeway in Melbourne's eastern suburbs will be designated a Road of National Importance and allocated $220 million in federal funding to allow a speedy start to construction.</p>
<p>The government's decision is the result of strong and consistent advocacy from federal members representing electorates in the Scoresby corridor.</p>
<p>This massive project will be the catalyst for investment and urban renewal in one of Melbourne's major growth areas. </p>
<p>The Scoresby corridor is home to one million people, more than 40 percent of Melbourne's manufacturing and production activity and almost one third of Melbourne's jobs. </p>
<p>Construction of the 34 km Scoresby Freeway from Ringwood to Frankston will deliver significant economic benefits to Melbourne and to the nation by removing severe traffic congestion and reducing travel times for as many as 100,000 vehicles per day.</p>
<p>With matching funding from the Victorian Government and in partnership with the private sector, the $220 million contribution from Commonwealth should also ensure there is no need for tolls to be levied on Scoresby Freeway users.<br />
 Our aim is for this major transport corridor to be toll free and we will be negotiating financing arrangements with the Victorian Government and the private sector on that basis. The Commonwealth funding is subject to satisfactory negotiations with the Victorian Government, including on a range of matters under discussion between the Deputy Prime Minister Mr John Anderson and his Victorian counterpart.</p>
<p>The designation of the Scoresby Freeway a Road of National Importance is a reflection of the priority the government is placing on this project. Most of the $220 million funding will come from the additional $1.6 billion road funding package that I announced jointly with Mr Anderson last year.</p>
<p>When completed, the Scoresby Freeway will mean a 20 minute saving for motorists travelling between Ringwood and Frankston, and a 15 minute saving between Frankston and Melbourne Airport, along with considerable improvements in road safety and reduced accidents.</p>
