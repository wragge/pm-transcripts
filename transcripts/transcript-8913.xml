STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
The Leadcr of the opposition, Dr Hecwson, refused today to distance himself from the<br />
statements of Mr Hug Morgan.<br />
When pressed by Mr Brian Bury on radio station 2UE about whether he agreed with the<br />
sentiments expressed by Mr Morgan, Dr Hewson refused to say that he could not abide<br />
with Mr Morgan's sentiments. He referred instead to what he called the indecision<br />
surrounding the Mabo decision saying that he thought the Mabo decision ' may prove to be<br />
unworkable' an unhelpful observation.<br />
Dr Hcwson said it was wrong to see Mabo in terms of reconciliation with the Aboriginal<br />
community and wrong that the issues of Mabo and reconciliation should be joined. He<br />
apparently has not read the very explicit references in the High Court decision to<br />
Aboriginal dispossession and the shame this dispossession has laid upon the nation.<br />
Dr Hewson claimed the Oovernment had adopted a fundamentally divisive position on<br />
Mabo, despite the fact that his own statements of last week treated the High Court<br />
decision only in terms of benefits it could bestow on mining companies and pastoralists.<br />
Dr Hcwson was roundly criticised by the Aboriginal community for the callousness of his<br />
position. If Dr Hcwson wants to shoot his mouth off on radio be should at least have the courage to<br />
say that Mr Hugh Morgan's remarks are extremist and that he will not have a bar of them.<br />
He is always talking about leadership. Now is the time for him as the leader of the<br />
conservative forces of Australia to nall these extremist sentiments as alien to the Liberal<br />
Party's philosophy<br />
