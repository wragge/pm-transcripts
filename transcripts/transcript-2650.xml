OILI. INIDUSTRY STRIKE<br />
Stateirent by the Prime ?-Tinister, the Rt.<br />
Bon. William McAahon, CH, MP<br />
Today I calle, 2. a meeting of seniJor Ministers to<br />
consider the critical situation caused~ by the oil industry<br />
strike. The strike is a challenge by about 1,000 union m-embers<br />
to the whole structure of conciliation and arbiAtration which we<br />
are d; etermined to maintain.<br />
It threatens to disrupt industry , cause unemployment<br />
and slow down com~ mercial and industrial activity in Australia<br />
affecting the life of every citizen.<br />
Let us look,-at the facts.<br />
Early this year a log of claims was served by the<br />
unions upon the oil comnanies.<br />
A numnber of strikes and stoppoages occurred and after<br />
patient and painstaking effort, a Deputy Prcsident of the<br />
Conciliation and ArbiLration Comm~ is~ ion, M~ r. Justice Voorre on<br />
union assurances that the strikers had returned to work qave an<br />
interim decision which granted wage incrciscs of $ 4.3oner week for<br />
trad--: smcn and S3.60 for tradcF, assistants. He made these increases<br />
retrospective to 5 June.<br />
Mr Justice M~ oore granted these incrcases on. assurances<br />
that the men had genuinely r= eturned to work<br />
And t'h. e employers had already statc-d that as soon as the<br />
strike ended they were ready to contcinue wi th the hearing of 1<br />
the union's claims in full by the Com~ mission.<br />
Desnite this, the strike w as resumed and has continued<br />
in defiance of th. e-decision of Pflr. Jnstice PMoore. On Friday night<br />
last, it became obvious that the ACTU was powerless to get the ment<br />
back to work. The Governm--. nt obiectives are twofold. The first is to<br />
ensure--that the men return to work, that tihe renfineries opera-te,<br />
that supplies of patrol and oil are available and that a situati-on<br />
in which services vital to the community are grinding to a h-alt<br />
should end. </p>
<p>The Government also believes that it must uohold the<br />
svstem of arbitration.<br />
In the interests of the whole cormmunity I asked the Minister<br />
for Labor and National Service, the Minister for Shipping and<br />
Transport and the Attorney General to have immediate discussions<br />
with the oil industry employers and with the ACTU.<br />
Discussions took olace with the employers this evening<br />
and arrangements are being made to have discussions in Melbourne<br />
with the ACTU tomorrow morning.<br />
The Ministers will renort to Cabinet which will meet<br />
tomorrow, Thursday afternoon.<br />
CANBERRA, 26 July, 1972. </p>
