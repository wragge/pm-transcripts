<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The tax package, is it an election winner?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The tax plan is good for Australia. That's our goal, to give</p>
<p>   Australia a stronger, more secure, more optimistic move into the</p>
<p>   21st Century. This is generational tax reform. It will</p>
<p>   boost the growth and the strength of the Australian economy. It</p>
<p>   will generate more jobs. It will historically reform Commonwealth/State</p>
<p>   financial relations. And it will be widely applauded by fair-minded</p>
<p>   Australians. It is, above all, a great investment of faith and hope</p>
<p>   in the future of our country.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And were you buoyed by the response yesterday by your backbench?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The backbench was very strongly in favour of the plan. They see</p>
<p>   that it represents a powerful and unambiguous vision about the future</p>
<p>   economic direction of Australia.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What about people like Bob Katter?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Everybody will love this plan.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>He says that the Party Room was only shown half of the plan.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I don't comment on comments.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What do you think the public reaction will be like later in the</p>
<p>   day, Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm very optimistic because it is a comprehensive plan. It's</p>
<p>   not a grab bag of isolated tax changes. It is a coherent, integrated</p>
<p>   plan which looks to the future. It is, above everything else, good</p>
<p>   for Australia's future. Australians are altruistic, fair-minded,</p>
<p>   decent people. If they see that something is good for their country</p>
<p>   and that it is fair to the underprivileged in the community, they'll</p>
<p>   back it. And on both of those tests, this plan will pass with flying</p>
<p>   colours.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So how important a day is today for your Government?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's a very important day for Australia. This is a national</p>
<p>   interest issue. This is about Australia's future.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will provisional taxpayers be happy?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There are lots of things, some you've not dreamt of.</p>
