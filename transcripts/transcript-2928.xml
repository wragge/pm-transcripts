SPEECH BY THE BRINE MINISTER<br />
MR. E. G. WHITLAM, AT A VICTORIAN<br />
STATE ELECTION MEETING ST. KILDA<br />
TOWN HALL, MELBOURNE, 16 MAY 1973<br />
When I asked the people of Australia to elect a Labor<br />
Government on 2 December I said that we would need the help of all<br />
Australians the best Australians in carrying out our mandate.<br />
I still need that help. A vote for Labor a vote for<br />
Clyde Holding on Saturday is one way of giving that help, that<br />
support, We need that support.<br />
We have to realise that we can never take anything for<br />
granted: we have to realise that our opponents are bitterly<br />
resentful about what happened last December0<br />
The Liberal Party today is just the party of revenge0<br />
They will miss no opportunity to take that revenge to take it<br />
on the Labor Party, to take it on the Australian people0<br />
It's incredible but true that this rabble, this mish-mash<br />
of vested interests, factions, bitter old men and frustrated young<br />
ones, this motley crew of incompetents still believe themselves to<br />
be our natural heaven-born rulers0<br />
They regard the verdict of 2 December as an aberration0 They<br />
like to think that the Labor Government is only an interregnum.<br />
Because of this attitude they will use every available<br />
source of power to break the will of the Government and frustrate<br />
the will of the people, to dilute the mandate you gave us0 They<br />
must not succeed0 They hold power in the Senate and in the three<br />
eastern States. The reactionary majority in the Senate will be looking to<br />
Victoria next Saturday for encouragement for their disruption and<br />
obstruction0 The Senate reflects the state of public opinion of three<br />
and six years ago but that means nothing to these arrogant, fearful<br />
men, It does not matter to them that they are flying in the face<br />
of the clear and fresh expression of the will of the people: their<br />
Withers are unrung.<br />
The Senate is not being asked to ratify anything that was<br />
not clearly spelled out in the Policy Speech. It was a clear precise<br />
document0 We received a clear, precise mandate.<br />
The House of Representatives this session will be putting<br />
through 120 Bills all of them the legislative expression of the<br />
Policy Speech0 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Unless our opponents in the Senate come to their senses,<br />
unless they recognise what democracy is all about they will reduce<br />
our legislative program to ruins.<br />
Who will suffer thereby? It won't just be me, it won't just<br />
be the Labor Party√∏ The main victims will be the people of Australia,<br />
the parliamentary system.<br />
Not the least important aspect of our victory was to restore<br />
faith in the parliamentary system to restore faith in the possibility<br />
of change through Parliament.<br />
Are those hopes, the hopes particularly of the new generation,<br />
to be shattered on the rock of the wilfulness and bitterness of a<br />
handful of Senators? We won't have a bar of it. The business of<br />
Government can go on.<br />
A great number of things can be done outside Parliament.<br />
Indeed we showed that, in the early days of our Government. But we<br />
were scrupulous to do nothing by extra parliamentary means for which<br />
we did not have a clear and commanding instruction from the people.<br />
But when a Government is forced, deeply against its own will<br />
and inclination, to carry on the people's business by by-passing<br />
Parliament, it's unhealthy for the Government, for the Parliament and<br />
for the nation. We are not going to be forced into that position.<br />
This country is still paying a heavy price for the opportunism<br />
of Sir Robert Menzies in throwing the two Houses of Parliament out of<br />
kilter in 1962.<br />
As a result, since I became Deputy Leader just 13 years ago<br />
I have had-to fight 8 national campaigns. But I don't suppose we can<br />
blame Sir Robert Menzies for taking his chance when he saw it in 1963.<br />
Nothing would give me greater pleasure personally and politically<br />
to end this situation where the Government of Australia is to be<br />
conducted in an atmosphere of perpetual electioneering.<br />
I hope on Saturday the people of Australia will recall<br />
recalcitrant, reacitionary Senators to their duty and call them to their<br />
senses, I hope they will say on Saturday that they were deadly<br />
serious about what they did last December and that they will insist<br />
that the program of which we were elected is pushed through.<br />
And it is not only the Senators: every vested interest who<br />
feels in some way endangered or disadvantaged by our drive towards a<br />
decent Australia is sweating on these elections. o / 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
I won't say anything here about the strutting, stunting<br />
Premier of Queensland Mr. 19%. ( 1 am referring to his electoral<br />
support, not any other condition, not his dividends,,) All I can say<br />
is I wish he would give Queensland and Australia a chance.<br />
These are the people who rant and posture about our<br />
electoral reforms0 Yet the Country Party Premier of Queensland has the<br />
nerve to claim a popular mandate with 19% of the vote in that State.<br />
The parties that tolerate that sort of electoral monstrosity<br />
have the gall to preach to the Australian people about electoral<br />
gerrymanders. The only electoral gerrymanders that survive in this country<br />
were engineered by Labor's opponents.<br />
They kept Labor out of office in South Australia for years<br />
despite the will of the people. They still keep Labor out of office<br />
in Queensland. They won't be allowed to deny Labor voters a fair and equal<br />
chance in the national elections0<br />
Our electoral reforms will ensure that no one group of the<br />
population has an electoral advantage over any other. We dont believe<br />
that country votes should be worth more than city votes or vice versa.<br />
We are not going to allow privilege and social discrimination<br />
to be permanently enshrined on our electoral laws.<br />
Our electoral bill goes to the root of our parliamentary<br />
democracy. Our electoral bill will bring nearer the only fair and<br />
just basis for a voting system the principle of one vote, one value0<br />
Who can trust the Liberals and their friends when it comes to<br />
electoral reforms? They talked for years about votes for 18 year olds.<br />
Mr. Gorton promised votes for 18 year olds at the last elections.<br />
The Liberals broke that promise0 They were frightened of the<br />
young people's vote.<br />
Labor has legislated to give 18 year olds the vote. It was<br />
left to my Government to carry through the reform promised by our<br />
predecessors. 0<br />
Our opponents are frightened of what' Labor can do with the<br />
people's support. We have this extraordinary spectacle of the A. M. A. so-called<br />
" fighting fund" a million and a half dollars to fight against our<br />
health program0 A million and a half dollars five or six times the amount<br />
spent by any of the parties in the last campaign. And for what?<br />
V c*/ </p>
<p>-4-<br />
To propagandise against a program which was at the very<br />
heart of our policy in three national elections.<br />
If any one issue was responsible for the tremendous gains<br />
we made in 1969 the election which laid the foundations for victory<br />
in 1972 it was our health program.<br />
Nor all the misrepresentation of the not all their<br />
millions, not all their false and misleading propaganda is going to<br />
prevent us implementing our pledge to the people and is going to<br />
prevent the Australian people from having a decent, efficient, just<br />
health scheme. These are principally Federal issues but politics in<br />
Australia is indivisible, certainly as far as the Australian Labor<br />
Party is concerned. This is the third great meeting I have addressed in this<br />
campaign in Victoria.<br />
I know Mr. Snedden is much too busy to campaign in his home<br />
State. But I have been glad to support Clyde Holding. I have b Tf<br />
glad to indicate by my presence and by my wife's presence here<br />
tonight the indivisibility of the Labor Party and the Labor program.<br />
This is the first State election in this State since the<br />
Victorian branch of our party was reconstructed and reformed in 1970.<br />
Great progress has been made by our party in Victoria and<br />
Clyde Holding has been in the forefront of that progress.<br />
Victoria needs a young, contemporary and progressive leader.<br />
Clyde Holding is such a leader.<br />
Clyde Holding's actions in 1970 were as significant as those<br />
of anyone in making Victoria the most successful branch of the Labor<br />
Party in this country.<br />
You have seen what our reforms achieved last December. The<br />
biggest improvement in Laborts vote in any State occurred in Victoria.<br />
The same progress can be achieved in the elections next Saturday..<br />
I ask your support for Clyde Holding and the Labor Party<br />
on Saturday, not just because they offer a better way for Victoria<br />
but because I want a demonstration here in Victoria that the<br />
irresponsibility and selfishness of our opponents in Canberra will<br />
not go unheeded or unpunished.<br />
A strong Labor showing on Saturday will give them the<br />
warning they need. 0 0 000 0O * 0 a 0 0 0 e 0 0a 0 </p>
