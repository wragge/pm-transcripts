FOR PRESS PIvM. No. 82/ 1965<br />
PRINCE OF WALES TO ATTEND AUSTRALIAN SCHOOL<br />
St-itement by the Priwe Minister, Sir Rooert Menzies<br />
It has been announced in London today that The Queen<br />
and the Duke nf Edinburgh have agreed that Prince Charles should<br />
spend a term at Geelong Church of Ernland Gr-immar Schiool,<br />
beginning on the 1st of February next year.<br />
I am confident that I speak for all Au-; tralians when<br />
I say how delighted I that, fnr the first time, a Prince of<br />
W: iles is to go to school in Australia.<br />
This is a very tangible demonstration of the close<br />
ties between Australia and the Royal Family. The idea of the<br />
young Prince ' f WVles living and studying here in his formative<br />
years is, I . m sure, a prospect that will give widespread satisfaction.<br />
It is an imaginative and practical step. Getting to<br />
know Australia through young Australians should prnve of<br />
inestimable value for a Prince whnse future duties will require<br />
a comprehensive knowledge of the countries and peoples of the<br />
Commonwealth. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh raised this<br />
question with me while I was in Britain earlier this year and,<br />
needless to say, I was very pleased when they asked me to initiate<br />
arrangements with the Headmaster of Geelong Grammar, Mr. T. R.<br />
G-rnett. Mr. Gurett is at present visiting Englund, and recently<br />
met The Queen and the Duke to discuss the details.<br />
CANBERRA, 18th October, 1965. </p>
