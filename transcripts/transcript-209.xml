SPEECH i3Y ' THE PRIME MINIS-TER AND 1INISTE'i<br />
FOII EIr'ERNAL AFFIRS, THE RT. HON. R. G.<br />
MENZIES IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
ON THURFDAY THE 8TH SEPTE MBEl<br />
Oddly enough, I had decided to accept that invitation<br />
before I heard it. Beore proceeding to deal with some of the<br />
statements made by the honorable member w; ho has just sat down<br />
some of the things said from Yarra and some of the things sail<br />
from East Sydney, I want to mention two or three particular<br />
points that have been raised with a rare sense of relevance by<br />
one or two honorable members, particularly my friend, the<br />
honorable member for Lilley ( Mr. light), who inquired about the<br />
discrepancies to be seen in the charges in the accounts for<br />
postage, telegrams -and telephones, and in the following item<br />
relating to courier service and diplomatic mails. it is<br />
purely a matter of transferring dertain amounts from one head to<br />
the other. If thle honorable member looks at the totals, he<br />
will see that the total of thie two is substantially the same as<br />
thne total of the two -for last year.<br />
The honorable member for Lilley also said something<br />
with which, if he will allow me to say so, I warmly agree. That<br />
was that technical assistance is a side of the Colombo Plan<br />
scheme which deserves increasing emphasis. I do agree with<br />
that. I think that we must devote more and more time to w~ hat<br />
I will call this increase in personal skill, the development of<br />
the capacity of the receiving countries.<br />
Somebody else I have forgotten who it was nowreferred<br />
to the allegation that has appeared that the Netherlands<br />
had adopted a new policy in relation to Netherlands New<br />
Guinea. 4e made an inquiry about that, and we have been<br />
specifically and officially informed that there is no change<br />
in the Netherlands position; that, in point of fact, this<br />
last statement that has had some publicity does not vary from<br />
the position taken by Mr. Luns, the Foreign Secretary, in<br />
February of this year, and which was at that time widely<br />
reported. Having said t1~ at, I want to come back, not in<br />
chronological order, but as I recall them, to three remarkable<br />
speeches that have been made from the Opposition side of the<br />
committee. I will begin, wiith proper courtesy, with the<br />
honorable member for v4ills ( Mr. Bryant), who has just sat down.<br />
He always fascinates me because, when he makes two speeches, I<br />
am never quite sure whether he remembers, when making the<br />
second speech, what he said in the first. His second speech<br />
was one in which he went to some pains to establish that you<br />
could be interested in a problem without knowing the answer, and<br />
he did not profess to know the answer. I think that is a very<br />
admirable attitude. But in his earlier speech, he knew the<br />
answers to the problems of South Africa! What hie knows about<br />
the internal problems of South Africa could be written on a<br />
postage stamp, but there he is not troubled by those philosophic<br />
doubts that assailed him in his second edition. At<br />
that time he said: " The policies of South Africa are monstrous.<br />
We all 3 now how wrong they are." He did not give us thne<br />
benefit of his opinion as to how they ought to be changed, in<br />
what way they ought to be changed, or what oughit to be done<br />
about them. Obviously and I thinkc this does him no injustice<br />
he thought the problem singularly easy to solve, I do not<br />
think I am unfair in saying that because, if it were not<br />
singularly easy to solve, he would not be comfortably solving<br />
it from a green cushioned seat in Canberra thousands of miles<br />
a~ ray. Therefore, I take it that in his first edition, in what<br />
one might call the authorized edition, he found South Africa's<br />
problem very easy to solve. The honorable member perhaps<br />
might be invited to ponder over a few questions. Does he<br />
believe in our immigration policy? </p>
<p>Mr. Bryant -do<br />
MR. ME~ NZIES -The honorable member for -dlls. I am not<br />
expecting him to answer now because these are questions on<br />
which he will need to take advice, if he is wise, before he<br />
gives the answers. Does he believe in Australia's immigration<br />
policy? If he does not, he is oddly placed in the Labour<br />
Party. If he does, why does he? Does he believe in it<br />
because he does not want to have created in Australia multiracial<br />
problems? is that the reason? It must be the reason.<br />
He does not want to have set up in Australia the kind of<br />
problem which could arise if we-bir oke down our immigration<br />
policy, and which has existed, and in fact now exists, in the<br />
Union of South Africa. Yet, if he is right, that is not a<br />
difficult problem! Why believe in our immigration policy if<br />
it could not matter less if we had a problem of mixed races<br />
and of large communities of people of different basic races in<br />
Australia? The honorable member says: " That is quite easy. I<br />
know what I would do." I wonder whelther he does? I wonder<br />
whether he knows what the answer is? I wonder whether he<br />
realizes what an impertinence it is for people with no<br />
experience of these problems or of the misery of these problems<br />
to be getting up, blowing out their chests and telling another<br />
country in the Commonwealth how it ought to manage its own<br />
affairs? I want to say no more about that. It is a matter<br />
that hie can chew over to his heart's content.<br />
But I want to come back to a couple of speeches that<br />
have been made in the course of these discussions, and which<br />
really do deserve some attention. The honorable member for<br />
Hume ( Mr. Anderson) made, as always, a speech in which he<br />
valiantly expressed w-hat he had in his mind, and he was<br />
attacked subsequently for what he had said. The honorable<br />
member for Hume said that the U2 incident was not a failure and<br />
that Khrushchev had net gained any propaganda value from it.<br />
He was scoffed at later on by the honorable member for Yarra<br />
( Mr. (; Cairns) who, though no doubt he is tho-most ardent of<br />
Labour men, has a singular spiritual consanguinity with the<br />
people who dictate the policy of the Kremlin. He never fails to<br />
deliver that particular line, and he made a speech in which he<br />
was prepared to say that the U2 incident was a co2. az 21 crash<br />
in public relations for the i4estern world. In fact, he<br />
appeared to me to take some pleasure out of his belief that it<br />
was such a crash in public relations.<br />
What effect the U2 incident has in terms of<br />
propaganda depends on what side you are en. I am g; oing to say<br />
something about it, because I was in London when this occurred<br />
and I was able to discuss it both there and in the United<br />
States of America,, Anybody who knows anything about these<br />
things knows that it was Khrushcheov who wanted to have a<br />
Summit Conference. It was he who put himself in the position<br />
of the advocate and inviter.<br />
1vir. Reynolds -What about Macmillan?<br />
kv1R. MENZIES -He was keen on it: but after some to and fro and<br />
some hesitation, an agreement was secured by do Gaulle and<br />
Eisenhower that they would attend a Summit Conference in Paris..<br />
As sensible men, they got together. They threshed out their<br />
general problems and arrived at what I shall call a broad<br />
community of mind on the matters that had to be considered. At<br />
that moment it appeared that Khrushchev, the great advocate of<br />
a summit meeting, was determined to frustrate it. There was no<br />
profit in it for him. He was going to meet three people whom he<br />
could not divide and conquer. He was g oing to meet three<br />
people again ' st whom the characteristic Commuunist technique of<br />
theo past ten years would fail; and he must have been the most </p>
<p>3.<br />
delighted fellow in the world I have always believed it<br />
when they said, A U2 aircraft has come down. ' e have<br />
captured the pilot. We now have evidence that the United<br />
States of America is spying on us." I am perfectly certain<br />
that Khrushchev was very pleased.<br />
Mr. Clyde Cameron Why?<br />
MR. MENZIES Because this gave him the excuse he was looking<br />
for not to go on with that Summit Conference. I am not defending<br />
the timing of that particular U2 flight for a moment.<br />
Mr. Cairns Ah<br />
MR. MENZIES You need not worry. I have told that to better.<br />
men than you in the United States of America. I am not<br />
defending the time of the flight, but what I am saying is<br />
that this came to Khrushchev as glad tidings in the first<br />
place until, of cours; he realized and was reminded by his<br />
assistants that after all the thing had come down over 1,000<br />
miles inside the frontiers of the Soviet Union, and therefore<br />
the nuclear deterrent delivered by aircraft was more effective<br />
against his country than he had ever conceded. Therefore, his<br />
momentary joy was succeeded by a genuine passion, and that<br />
genuine passion wras expressed when he spoke at his famous press<br />
conference in Paris.<br />
The honorable member for Yarra has said that this was<br />
great propaganda for Khrushchev. Before anybody settles down<br />
to that idea, let me put this to him: Nobody with his five<br />
wits would believe that the Soviet Union does not engage in<br />
espionage. Of course it does; it has the master spies of our<br />
time. Does anybody believe that you can make a nuclear weapon<br />
a deterrent unless you know at what target to fire? You don't<br />
poop off to use that expression a missile at the map of<br />
Russia. You have to aim it at a target, and it is one of the<br />
oddities of the world today that on our side because after all<br />
the United States of America is on our side anybody in the<br />
United States of America may discover where all the installatiors<br />
are and where the various firing points are, within pretty<br />
narrow limits, by subscribing to the illustrated papers. As a<br />
matter of fact Khrushchev pointed that out to a very<br />
distinguished American last year a man who happens to be a<br />
close friend of mine. Khrushchev said, " You ta~ k about open<br />
skies! I do not need them. I have only to subscribe to your<br />
journals. Do you think I am going to give away the advantage<br />
I have by the secrecy of my installations? You must take me<br />
for a simpleton." Therefore, of course I would have been<br />
bitterly disappointed if aircraft had not beeoon spotting these<br />
places and giving the rest of us in the world a chance of<br />
survival in a global contest.<br />
One aircraft was apprehended, and of course the<br />
friends of the Soviet Union seized on that. they said,<br />
" this is terrible stuff." Only those who arc instinctively<br />
predisposed to accept Soviet propaganda will fail to understand<br />
the basic truth that on this occasion Khrushchev preferred to<br />
score his debating point and frustrate the meeooting at the<br />
Summit. He preferred that to the interests of ordinary men and<br />
women all over the world who had hoped that out of the Summit<br />
Conference there might come something at any rate some little<br />
point settled, some gloam of hope, even some agreement about<br />
nuclear experiments or a moratorium on Berlin. These are the<br />
most tremendous issues in the world and these are things,<br />
whether Khrushchev knows it or not, that sound in the ears, the<br />
minds and the hearts of ordinary men and women all over the<br />
world; and ordinary men and women all over the world will not<br />
forgive him for taking his debating point and scattering a<br />
meeting of the heads of governments to the wind. </p>
<p>4,<br />
That is the first thing I want to say. The second is<br />
this: The honorable member for Hume made some reference to the<br />
cold war. He said we should try to win the cold war. By a<br />
monstrous perversion of the words of a gallant and respected<br />
gentleman in this House, the honorable member for Yarra said<br />
that this meant that the honorable member for Hume anted to<br />
convert the cold war into a hot war, Those wore the very<br />
words of the honorable member for Yarra. I wrote them down at<br />
the time. He said the honorable member for Hume wanted to<br />
convert the cold war into a hot war. That was a diabolical<br />
statement to make. If it had been made about a gentleman with<br />
a career less clear and distinguished than that of the<br />
honorable member for Humo it might have been a hurtful remark.<br />
The honorable member for Hunc, of course, meant what we all<br />
mean. je did not start the cold war. we are not responsible<br />
for the preservation of tension in the world. There is not<br />
one single cause of tension in the world that does not lie<br />
squarely at the door of the Communist powers. : oI did not begin<br />
the cold war, but, since it has been commenced, we must win it.<br />
You win a cold war by maintaining every effort to remove<br />
tension and by maintaining every effort to confer and to discuss<br />
at any time. You win a cold war by maintaining every<br />
effort to keep up your defences and your strength and by<br />
maintaining every effort to keep your world friendships green.<br />
That is what is meant by winning a cold war, The honorable<br />
member for Yarra, by his contemptible perversion of what the<br />
honorable member for Hume said, alleged that we want to win<br />
the cold war by having a hot war presuimably a deterrent war.<br />
Tlhere is another aspect of the speech made by the<br />
honorable member for Yarra. He can always be relied on to put<br />
the case of the free world in the worst possible way and the<br />
case of the Communist powers in the best way. He is quite<br />
famous for that. Consistent with that attitude of mind, he<br />
said that the Comm: unist powers have taken the lead in<br />
disarmament talks and in talks on the suspension of nuclear<br />
tests.<br />
Mr. Cairns That is right.<br />
MR. MENZIES Of course, the honorable member continues to say<br />
that. All Communist propaganda is repeated again and again and<br />
the honorable member can be relied on to repeat it in this<br />
place. His statement is utterly untrue. One has only to refer<br />
to the l.. st meeting of the Disarmamont Commission at Geneva to<br />
discover that at a time when the two sides, particularly in<br />
relation to nuclear tests, were by no moans 100 miles apart a<br />
good deal had been agreed upon and, with a little exercise of<br />
control, other matters might have been agreed upon the<br />
representatives of the Soviet Union walked out. They did that<br />
because th. y know that on the next morning constructive<br />
proposals by the estern powers were to be placed on the table<br />
of the conference. These are the people who are honoured in<br />
this place by the gentleman from Yarra as having taken the<br />
lead in disarmament talks. I received a letter from Khrushchev<br />
himself about this natter and I replied to hin. I was not<br />
specially favoured in receiving the lettor, because I think<br />
similar letters were sent to all other leaders of governoment.<br />
No doubt my reply was frightfully old-fashioned, I am sure<br />
that it would not get the slightest acco: mmodation in the mind<br />
and judgeont of the honorable gentleman from Yarra. However,<br />
I propose to read a paragraph or two. I said<br />
" I deeply regret, howover, that the five Eastern<br />
European countries represented at the ten-nation Disarmament<br />
Committoe, led by the Soviet Union, have seen fit to walk out<br />
of the Committee's meetings without waiting even to ho: r, let<br />
alone discuss, the ! estern powers' considered views of your<br />
proposals and the new proposals of their own, which it was </p>
<p>known were being prepared for early submission to the<br />
Committee. I cannot see that the delegates' action will<br />
help to further the general cause of disarmament,<br />
I regret the latest development all the more because I<br />
had been glad to note your assurance that your new proposals<br />
had taken into consideration some of the views of other<br />
Governments participating in the Disarmament Committee's work.<br />
It had been our hope that careful study in the Disarmament<br />
Committee would have justified the expectations raised by<br />
news of your approach. We had hoped particularly that the<br />
proposals would be followed by the elaboration of concrete<br />
measures for control related to each stage of the<br />
disarmament prograrme and effective from the very beginning<br />
of the disarmament process, so that disarimament and its<br />
control would proceed hand-in-hand.<br />
That is not an unconstructive statement of our<br />
policy. I continued<br />
All these hopes have now been dashed.<br />
It was with concern that I noted in your letter the<br />
statement that the Soviet Government doubts whether the<br />
Western Powers represented in the Disarmament Committee<br />
really want disarmament; and I see that similar statements<br />
have been made even more forcibly recently by the Soviet<br />
delegate in Geneva. The policies followed by the Western<br />
Powers since 1946, including their record in the many<br />
disarmament conferences held over that period, are, however,<br />
sufficient to dispel any such doubts. For my own part, I<br />
am convinced from my experience and contact with Iestern<br />
Leaders over the years that these doubts are entirely<br />
misplaced. I am certain that the Western Powers, no less<br />
than Australia, stand ready to work out measures leading<br />
toward general and complete disarmament under effective<br />
international control, which was the aim of the unanimous<br />
resolution of the United Nations General Assembly last year."<br />
I venture to suggest that my reply represents the honest view<br />
of Australians on this matter. The other view is the view of<br />
Khrushchev. I now propose to say a word or two about the views<br />
of the honorable member for East Sydney ( Mr. ! Ward). He is<br />
firmly of the opinion that Cormunist China should be<br />
recognized. He believes that recognition of Communist China<br />
would go a long way towards solving the problems of Asia. I<br />
wonder what reason he has for that belief. Oddly enough his<br />
attitude on this matter is completely academic because, in<br />
effect, he is saying that here is a country that has a<br />
settled government a government in authority. He says that<br />
the country has all the earmarks of one that is entitled first<br />
to recognition do facto and secondly to recognition de juro.<br />
Ho asks why we do not recognize Communist China. W1ll, if<br />
the matter were as simple as would indeed be simple.<br />
But the honorable member must know that you , will get nowhere<br />
with Cormunist China by recognizing it unless you recognize<br />
also Communist China's control over Formosa. That is the<br />
simple truth of the matter. The United Kingdom Government<br />
years ago, when my friend Lord Attlee held the reins of office,<br />
recognized Communist China and has had some kind of diplomatic<br />
post there, but that has not had the slightest effect. That<br />
recognition has not made the slightest difference to United<br />
Kingdom relations with Communist China because Cormunist China,<br />
being a Communist power, being devoted to an expansion of its<br />
jurisdiction and being, as all Communist powers . re,<br />
imperialist in its quality, must have Formosa. I have heard.<br />
people say that Communist China should have Formosa. I do </p>
<p>not want honorable members opposite to tell no that Chiang<br />
Kai-Shek says that mainland China and Formosa are one<br />
country. I am not interested in that. What I am interested<br />
in is the fact that 10,000,000 people live on Formosa. A<br />
groat many of them live there because they object to living<br />
under Communist rule. The simple truth of the proposal that<br />
we recognize Communist China is that we must also advocate a<br />
course of policy that will hand over those 10 million people<br />
now free into Communist control. I invite honorable members<br />
to consider what that would mean. Nothing short of that<br />
would be of any interest to Communist China. What would it<br />
mean? First, it would mean, of course, the complete destruction<br />
of Seato. There are some people people who did not<br />
have the responsibility for negotiating the South-East Asian<br />
Treaty who think nothing of that organization. ' o think<br />
something of it. Je think something of a treaty which results<br />
in the United States of Amer' Great Britain, France,<br />
Pakistan, New Zealand and Australia, the Philippines and<br />
Thailand, standing side by side. But if, cynically, we wore<br />
prepared to hand over Formosa to the Communists in China, what<br />
effect would that have on the protocol countries Laos,<br />
Canbodia, Thailand, South Vietnam and Malaya? They would say,<br />
" Woll, if you can give away 10,000,000 people in Formosa, you<br />
can give away 10,000,000 people somewhere clse". It would<br />
utterly destroy the whole basis of confidence on . which Seato<br />
rests. I said so at the ministorial conference of Soato in<br />
Washington, with the unanimous approval of all -he ministors<br />
there present. There would be another effect of saying to Commuunist<br />
China, " You may have Fornosa", quite apart from its effect on<br />
the general defensive structure of the Pacific. Such a move<br />
would represent the greatest diplomatic triu ph, produced by<br />
voluntary concession, in the post-war history of communism.<br />
What its effect would be i. any of the Asian and South-East<br />
Asian countries I leave to anybody's imagination.<br />
When people venture into the field of foreign affairs<br />
I suggest to them that they should take a vow that before<br />
going to bed each night they will have a good, long, thoughtful<br />
look at the map and try to real izo whe-ro we live and whore our<br />
friends live. I have spoken at rather greater length than I<br />
intended, and I daresay that most of what i have said and what<br />
I have been answering is completely out of order. After all,<br />
as honorable mmnbor for Coranga:. te ( Mr. Mackinnon) reminded<br />
us yesterday, we are debating the Estimates. But since these<br />
matters have been raised, and since there is a chronic<br />
disposition on the part of honorable members opposite to<br />
believe that the Governmont has no point of view, I have stated<br />
the Government's point of viewnl hope, most unambiguous<br />
terns. </p>
