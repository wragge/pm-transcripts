TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE MON P J KEATING MP,<br />
DOORSTOP, SOUTHERN CROSS HOTEL, SYDNEY 29 MAY 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF ONLY<br />
J: Mr Keating, two and a half years jail for Alan Bond<br />
any sympathy for him?<br />
PM; I'm not here to comment about Mr Bond, that's for<br />
the appropriate authorities to make 8 judgemnent<br />
about.<br />
J; Do you have any concerns, as Treasurer, about the<br />
closeness to the Prime Minister at the time to Mr<br />
Bond?<br />
PM: I've got no discussion. Mr Bond Ã± 81 obviously<br />
subject to these proceedings in We~ tern Australia<br />
and that's a matter for the authdrities involved.<br />
J; Could you elaborate a bit more on the pamphlet<br />
released by the Coalition?<br />
PM:, I think this pamphlet shows just how desperate John<br />
Hewson is and it will also reveal to the Australian<br />
people that while he's pretended he's been thinking<br />
about thoughtfu' policy, that when it gets down to<br />
the bottom line it is just 8 bit of shabby politics<br />
that he's on about. The notion that he's going to<br />
first of all ascribe to the Commonwealth Labor Party<br />
the violence in AuStralia and the Australian states<br />
since 1983 and say this has happened under Labor,<br />
and then to make the unbelievable leap and<br />
distortion that a consumption tax can do any-thing<br />
about it, must reveal to all Australians that this<br />
man is bereft of any decent strands of serious<br />
policy and he ought to be dismissed by serious<br />
people of having any answers to Australia. This is<br />
a very shabby piece of politico.<br />

<p>J: Mr Keating, what are you going to do about the NSW<br />
factional fight that's going on at the moment?<br />
Pm: we've just been watching the Liberal Party factional<br />
fight last week. Mr Fife, the Leader of opposition<br />
business in the House of Representatives was in a<br />
position of being defeated in his seat and he's had<br />
to stand down as had Senator Durack in Western<br />
Australia, the Shadow Attorney-General. Dr Hewson<br />
has had to replace both of them in the last week.<br />
obviously pre-selection battles are not something<br />
which the Labor Party alone has a problem with, so<br />
does the Coalition. For my part, the best thing my<br />
party can do is resolve these quickly.<br />
J; Is it about time the Labor Party in fact changed the<br />
nature of its factional politics?<br />
PM; You may as easily direct the question to the Liberal<br />
Party, why is the Leader of Opposition business in<br />
the House of Representatives now required to stand<br />
down and not contest his seat? Mr Fife, who was a<br />
serious and senior person, Is now obviously on the<br />
back bench. Senator Durack will be a Senator for<br />
not much longer. There are factions he was a<br />
victim of the Crichton-Browne faction of the Western<br />
Australia Liberal Party. There are points of view<br />
in all parties and one of the healthy things about<br />
Australian-democracy and Australian politics is<br />
there are such views and that people can actually<br />
get their opinion heard and can secure public office<br />
as a result. The important thinq I think for us as<br />
a Party, for the Labor Party as a party, is to get<br />
these selections over with.<br />
J: Are you going to stand by and watch Mr West go, when<br />
he says he has worked very hard for your party?<br />
PM. it's not a matter of me Standing by any one person.<br />
The best thing in all of this for us is to have them<br />
resolved quickly. But I just make the paint to you<br />
that pre-selection battles are obviously always a<br />
matter for both major parties whenever an election<br />
is within some proximity.<br />
J; Could his boycott undermine the ' One Nation'<br />
Statement?<br />
PM: Come on now, don't be absurd.<br />
J: It's being claimed it can.<br />
PM; Oh well yes, yes. </p>
<p>I juÃ± iHu uu-r~ v)<br />
J; What about the question of Ministerial<br />
responsibilities Mr Keating. What are you going to<br />
do about, in particular, Roo Kelly?<br />
PM: It's a matter of the orders and gravity of things,<br />
that's the thing that matters. These are the sorts<br />
of things which hardly get a line some weeks, but in<br />
other weeks do. I've spent my week on the big<br />
issues including, as I've just come from the tourism<br />
industry looking at, at the Cabinet level, a<br />
national strategy for touriam. So the Government<br />
was in its Cabinet room looking at serious policy<br />
while the opposition was throwing silly questions in<br />
the Senate.<br />
