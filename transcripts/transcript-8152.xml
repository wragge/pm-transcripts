SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNING DESIGN FOR<br />
1MEMORIAL TO AUSTRALIAN VIETNAM FORCES<br />
CANBERRA, 3 OCTOBER 1990<br />
Today is the third anniversary of the welcome home parade of<br />
Vietnam veterans in Sydney when we recalled the commitment<br />
and sacrifices of all those who took part in that conflict.<br />
So today is an appropriate time for me to announce that the<br />
Canberra National Memorials Committee, which I chair, has<br />
agreed on a design for the National Memorial to Australian<br />
Vietnam Forces.<br />
Before announcing the winning design, I want to take this<br />
opportunity to congratulate the Australian Vietnam Forces<br />
National Memorial Committee, under the Chairmanship of<br />
Peter Poulton, for its initiative and determination to<br />
establish a permanent memorial.<br />
And I thank all those throughout Australia who have<br />
contributed to the Committee's fund raising appeal.<br />
The Committee has been closely involved with the planning<br />
for the memorial and the assessment of the designs submitted<br />
in the competition.<br />
And it has worked closely with the Federal Government in<br />
this endeavour. For our part, the Government has provided<br />
significant financial assistance and administrative support<br />
for the project and will continue to provide the necessary<br />
support to ensure the memorial can be formally dedicated in<br />
1992.<br />
We have of course also provided the land on which the<br />
memorial wil. l be sited. As is proper for a national<br />
memorial of this character, the Vietnam memorial will be<br />
sited in AnZac Parade where, alongside other memorials to<br />
Australia's armed forces, it will add to the already<br />
impressive approach to the Australian War Memorial.<br />
The Governmebnt is more than pleased to have been able to<br />
provide, in accordance with the wishes of the Vietnam<br />
veterans themselves, the particular site chosen. Placing<br />
this memorial next to the Australian Light Horse memorial<br />
puts the Vietnam experience firmly in the Anzac tradition<br />
where it should be. </p>
<p>And now to the memorial itself. After an extensive<br />
nationwide design competition, the winning design for the<br />
national memorial to Australian Vietnam Forces has been<br />
submitted by Tonkin Zulaikha Architects, of Sydney, working<br />
in association with the distinguished Australian sculptor,<br />
Ken Unsworth.<br />
The Committee believes the triangular design provides for a<br />
simple yet dignified memorial, open in concept and providing<br />
an inner area for contemplation and reflection.<br />
The badges of the three armed services will be located in<br />
the centre of the memorial and the inner chamber will also<br />
record the names of those Australians who gave their lives<br />
in Vietnam.<br />
Those who have seen or heard of the Vietnam memorial in<br />
Washington will appreciate the enormously significant role<br />
it plays in alleviating the trauma of the Vietnam experience<br />
and honouring the sacrifice of those Americans who gave<br />
their lives in this conflict.<br />
I am confident this Australian design will be a fitting and<br />
lasting commemoration to those of our armed services who<br />
took part and suffered in the Vietnam conflict.<br />
It will be welcomed, I am sure, not only by those present<br />
here today, but by all Australians who now increasingly<br />
recognise the difficulties borne by those who fought in<br />
Vietnam. In conclusion, let me announce that the Government has<br />
agreed to extend the period of eligible tax deductibility<br />
for donations to the memorial appeal up to 31 December this<br />
year to enable the financial target for this fine project to<br />
be reached.<br />
I commend the project to all Australians and hope they will<br />
continue to contribute to the appeal in recognition of all<br />
those who served their country so faithfully in Vietnam. </p>
