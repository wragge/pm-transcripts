STATKMNT BY THE PRIME ) 4INISTEM, THE RON. P. J. KRATING<br />
COMMOONWE. ALTH RESPONSE TO HIGH COURT MABO JUDGMENIT<br />
The Cabinet tonight finalised the Commonwealth<br />
Governmnent's response to the High Court's decision on<br />
Native Title.<br />
The decision is the culmination of a lengthy process of<br />
discussion and negotiation with a wide range of interests<br />
including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people,<br />
States and Territories, mining, pastoral. and other<br />
industry groups.<br />
The Government's aim has been twofold: t~ o preserve the<br />
integrity and certainty of Australia's :: Wand management<br />
system and so ensure continuing economic development; and<br />
to provide a measure of justice for Abo:--iginal and Torres<br />
Strait Islander people.<br />
As Mabo was an historic judgment this is historic<br />
legislation, recognising in law the fiction of terra<br />
nullius and the fact of native title. W4ith that alone<br />
the foundation of reconciliation is laid because after<br />
200 years, we will at last be building on the truth.<br />
In striving to meet these twin gjoals WE. have progressed<br />
from a series of questions and uncertainties to a<br />
detailed blueprint for Commonwealth legrislation.<br />
The key points decided by Cabinet are:<br />
the Commonwealth legislation will give full effect<br />
to the High Court decision withoul. affecting the<br />
existing rights-of any property holder.<br />
the legislation, taken as a whole, will constitute a<br />
special measure for the protection and advancement<br />
of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people<br />
under section 8 of the Racial Discrimination Act.<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will be<br />
abl~ e to choose the Federal Court or a recognised<br />
State body ( suich as a State Supreme Court) to pursue<br />
a claim for native title. </p>
<p>2<br />
States which comply with the spirit and principles<br />
of the Commonwealth legislation will retain their<br />
traditional and paramount role in determining the<br />
economic use of land within their borders.<br />
The legislation will also:<br />
allow States to validate grants affected by the<br />
existence of native title on a basis that<br />
provides certainty and accords with the RDA and<br />
Australia's international obligations.<br />
extend the cut-off date for validation of past<br />
grants to 31 December 1993, thus providing<br />
ample notice of the new rules which will apply<br />
in future.<br />
allow States to propose State cir Territory<br />
tribunals or courts for the determination of<br />
native title claims.<br />
accept that normal State/ Territ. ory regimes<br />
should determine compensation f~ or the<br />
impairment of native title. This generally<br />
relates to the surface disturbance caused by<br />
mining, and is paid by the mink'ng company as<br />
is the normal procedure. " Just. terms, will<br />
govern compensation for extinguishment.<br />
there will be further discussions wiLth States and<br />
Territories on cost-sharing arrangemnents between the<br />
Commonwealth and complying States.<br />
the Bill will not jeopardise Australians, right to<br />
enjoy beaches and other recreation a~ reas, including<br />
-national parks.<br />
industry will be a major beneficiary of the<br />
legislation which will provide:<br />
validation of existing grants, with governments<br />
to pick up any compensation costs. There will<br />
be no qualification whatsoever on the rights of<br />
the grant-holder, which have primacy over the<br />
native title and will indeed, in some cases,<br />
extinguish it.<br />
a clear, timely process for determining native<br />
title funded by the government.<br />
native title holders will not have a veto on<br />
development, which could lock up native title<br />
land, but will have a right to negotiation.<br />
protection against the ' double jeopardy, of<br />
consideration of exploration and, later, mining<br />
grants. </p>
<p>so far as it affects pastoral leases at all the<br />
proposed legiislation will only affect inaid<br />
leases. there are a few pastoral leasegs which have been<br />
issued since 1975 which could conceivably be<br />
invalid hecause the req'uirements of the RDA<br />
were not met when the leases were issued.<br />
there may also be leases issued before 1975<br />
which are invalid on grounds unconnected with<br />
the RDA but connected to some other rights, as<br />
yet unidentified in law, flowing from the<br />
existence of native title.<br />
The Commonwealth has been advii; ed that the<br />
chances of such rights existingi and leading to<br />
the invalidity of leases is smatll, but the<br />
possibility remains. To remove~ this<br />
uncertainty, the Cabinet has decided that the<br />
Bill will provide that any lea, 3es which might<br />
be found to be invalid in any circumstances<br />
connected with native title can be validated by<br />
the Government that issued themn.<br />
In other words, these leases will be made<br />
totally valid and all rights connected with<br />
them will be totally valid and will always take<br />
precedence over native title.<br />
the validation of pastoral leases will extinguish<br />
native title, as provided for in the September 2<br />
outline, however;<br />
where Aboriginal people who own or acquire a<br />
oastoral lease, and who the tribunal determines<br />
would satisfy the criteria for native title,<br />
but for the existence of the pastoral lease,<br />
wish to convert their holding to the equivalent<br />
of native title, they may do so.<br />
the tribunal will decide what native title<br />
rights are in the particular case.<br />
the owners would get the native title<br />
benefits and protections under the<br />
Commonwealth Bill.<br />
the Commonwealth novernment wculd press for the<br />
development of Codes of Conduct where there are<br />
reservation rights, recognising though that, in<br />
the final analysis, this depends on the<br />
willingness of the pastoralists, Aboriginal<br />
people and probably the States to come<br />
together. </p>
<p>-' I 4 the Bill will enhance the right of native title<br />
holders to negotiate on proposed actions which<br />
affect their land:<br />
time limits for negotiation and arbitration<br />
will be extended beyond those proposed in the<br />
September 2 outline. Four months will be<br />
allowed for negotiation and another four for<br />
arbitration in the case of exploration<br />
licences, and six months for both in relation<br />
to mining leases.<br />
before a government compulsorily acquires any<br />
native title land to grant to a third party,<br />
negotiations must take place.<br />
there will be greater recognition given to the<br />
Potential value of regional and local negotiation so<br />
that nothing in the Bill prevents agreements or<br />
settlements at a regional or local level between<br />
governments, Aboriginal people and others with<br />
interests.<br />
while details will await further legislation next<br />
year, the Bill will make provision for a land<br />
acquisition fund to address the land needs of those<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people whose<br />
dispossession from their land means they will be<br />
unlikely to benefit from the Mabo decision.<br />
