SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
PARLIAMENTARY DINNER IN HONOUR OF CHANCELLOR KOHL<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
CANBERRA 4 OCTOBER 1988<br />
Federal Chancellor,<br />
Distinguished guests,<br />
Ladies and gentlemen.<br />
it is a great pleasure to welcome you and Mrs Kohl and the<br />
members of your distinguished party to dinner in the<br />
Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia.<br />
I know this is not your first visit to Australia. In 1972<br />
you visited us in your capacity as Premier of the State of<br />
Rhineland Palatinate. But because you are the first<br />
Chancellor to visit Australia, your visit and our welcome to<br />
you take on a very special significance and a very special<br />
warmth. I extend to you our deep regret at the sudden death of your<br />
coalition partner, Dr Strauss, and we fully understand that<br />
In these unfortunate circumstances you have been forced to<br />
cut your visit short. But you and your distinguished party<br />
are very welcome among us.<br />
Mr Chancellor,<br />
This visit, in the year in which Australians celebrate the<br />
Bicentenary of European settlement, takes on special meaning<br />
when we recall the long links between Germany and Australia.<br />
These links predate 1788. Captain Cook, for example, was<br />
accompanied on his second world voyage by a Prussian<br />
scientist Johann Forster, one of whose noteworthy<br />
contributions was this prediction about the future of<br />
Australia which he made in 1787: " New Holland, an island of<br />
immense size, or, if you like, a third terra firma, is the<br />
future dwelling place of a new society which, insignificant<br />
though its beginnings nay seem, promises to be very<br />
important very soon." ; 113 17 </p>
<p>We may say with pride: they were indeed words of<br />
prescience. For what we are celebrating in this<br />
Bicentennial is the creation by Australians over two<br />
centuries of a great society of freedom and prosperity. We<br />
celebrate in particular the immeasurable enrichment of our<br />
society not only by the Aboriginal people who settled this<br />
land for more than 40,000 years but also by the wave after<br />
wave of immigrant people who came, and who still come, from<br />
all corners of the globe to find a new home here.<br />
Among these immigrant peoples, the contribution of the<br />
Germans is impossible to overlook.<br />
Germans were among the initial shiploads of people who<br />
arrived in Australia some of them free settlers and some<br />
convicts. The very man selected to lead the First Fleet to Australia<br />
and to be the first governor of the new colony, Captain<br />
Arthur Phillip, was himself of German ancestry; his father<br />
Jakob was born in Frankfurt. Phillip was a fluent German<br />
speaker and was deeply influenced by the ideas of the German<br />
Enlightenment.<br />
And among the first settlers of South Australia were Germans<br />
who arrived near Port Adelaide in 1838 150 years ago to<br />
live in religious freedom in a new land.<br />
I am delighted that you will still be able to spend some<br />
time in South Australia tomorrow.<br />
More immediately, you can experience one of the great<br />
achievements of the Germans in South Australia tonight.<br />
Some of the wine being served here is South Australian and<br />
therefore very much the fruit of our proud German-Australian<br />
heritage. Mr Chancellor,<br />
The development of Australia economic, cultural,<br />
scientific, spiritual and in many other ways owes a great<br />
deal to the achievements of energetic, dedicated settlers<br />
from Germany who made their home here.<br />
indeed the richness of this heritage has greatly enhanced<br />
our appreciation of the Federal Republic's contributions to<br />
the Australian Bicentenary. I am thinking of the generous<br />
grant which has made possible the Australian opera's highly<br />
acclaimed performance of Richard Wagner's " Die<br />
Meistersinger". I recall too the splendid spectacle of the<br />
German naval training vessel " Gorch Fock" among the Tall<br />
Ships in Sydney Harbour in January this year, and of course<br />
your magnificent pavilion at Expo in Brisbane.<br />
of course the links between Australia and the Federal<br />
Republic of Germany do not all reflect the past: on the<br />
contrary they are diverse, dynamic and forward looking.<br />

<p>Here let me make a relevant but more gqneral observation<br />
about Australian foreign and economic policy.<br />
It is, these days, a commonplace that Australia is part of<br />
Asia and the Pacific. That represents a relatively recent<br />
and historically important change in Australia's thinking<br />
about its place in the world. It is an accurate description<br />
not just of our geography but, to a significant extent, of<br />
our security and of our economy.<br />
But let there be no misapprehension about what Australia's<br />
enmeshment into the Asia-Pacific region means for our<br />
relations with the countries of Europe.<br />
Western Europe matters to us-greatly as a centre of free<br />
democratic values, as a vital hub of commerce and of<br />
finance, and as a cornerstone of the Western security system<br />
and I mean all of Western Europe. Notwithstanding our<br />
historical ties to Britain, we are not inhibited in adapting<br />
our foreign and economic policies to new realities.<br />
Moreover, far from weakening our ties with Europe,<br />
Australia's increasing integration into the Asia-Pacific<br />
region creates unique opportunities for our economic<br />
co-operation with countries like Germany.<br />
Australia has a heritage of European parliamentary<br />
democracy, institutions, law and culture. We are<br />
politically stable.<br />
Australia is not only a modern diverse economy in its own<br />
right, it is a stable platform to the fastest growing region<br />
in the world. we are part of that region, yet our kinship<br />
with Europe provides the familiarity and ease of doing<br />
business so important to establishing a sound commercial<br />
base in the region.<br />
This, in a sense, affords Germany and other European<br />
countries the best of all possible worlds as far as<br />
investment in the Asia/ Pacific region is concerned.<br />
So we welcome German investment in Australia, and we assert<br />
with conviction, Mr Chancellor, that our unique position in<br />
the region makes us a very attractive place for investment<br />
from your country and the other countries-of Europe.<br />
it is in this context, Mr Chancellor, that I stress the very<br />
great importance we attach to your visit as a symbol of the<br />
vital and growing links between Australia and the Federal<br />
Republic of Germany.<br />
The Federal Republic has firmly anchored itself in the<br />
Western Alliance. we share your convictions and values in<br />
that respect absolutely.<br />
You supply an increasing number of tourists to Australia<br />
some 60,000 this year. We welcome them warmly. </p>
<p>You are about to send an investment mission from the Federal I II<br />
Association of German Industry later this month. We look I.<br />
forward to that visit with confidence. if<br />
And you are one of our major trading partners, ranking third6<br />
as a source of Australia's imports, and ninth as a market M<br />
for our exports. We value that relationship deeply. A<br />
Mr Chancellor, il<br />
d<br />
For all these reasons I was gratified to hear you speak S<br />
today in our talks of opening a new chapter in relations<br />
between our two countries. I welcome that hope and place I<br />
great value in it. c<br />
y<br />
decades have given it an important leadership role both in<br />

external imbalances in major countries, a C<br />
Such imbalances will be corrected: it is a question of how, a<br />
Does the correction come through deflation in the deficit a<br />
countries or some ' shock' to the international system, or IS<br />
through complementary policy change in a number of<br />
countries? It<br />
While the Federal Republic's leadership role is in evidence<br />
through its anti-inflationary policies, the very success of n<br />
these policies and its large external surplus means that thef<br />
world community expects the Federal Republic to shoulder a<br />
more of the burden of contributing to world growth. f<br />
The Federal Republic of Germany will also continue to have a<br />
vital role to play in bringing about greater security and<br />
confidence at the global level and within Europe.<br />
We observe with interest the development of your<br />
relationship with your European neighbours East and West. e<br />
And we recognise and applaud your notable contribution to<br />
the conclusion of the treaty on the elimination of<br />
intermediate-range nuclear weapons.<br />
I believe that we are witnessing a time of enduring progress<br />
in arms control. The INF Treaty established a climate of<br />
practical co-operation between the super-powers which I<br />
strongly hope and expect will yield further practical<br />
results, not only in nuclear disarmament.<br />
Australia is also profoundly interested in the progressive<br />
development of policies in the European Community.<br />
We congratulate you on the highly successful German<br />
Presidency of the European community in the first six months<br />
of this year.<br />
24 UO </p>
<p>The development of a stingle market with 320 million<br />
inhabitants constituting a market larger than any other<br />
industrialised market, including the United States will<br />
surely have a profound impact on global economic and trading<br />
relationships, and the Federal Republic will surely exert a<br />
major influence in the events leading to 1992.<br />
Australia views the emergence of such a market positively,<br />
in the expectation that we will be able to continue the<br />
dynamic relationship we have currently with the EC member<br />
States. I was heartened this morning that you understood the<br />
concerns of many about a " Fortress Europe" and that you said<br />
your aspirations for Europe would be thwarted if the new<br />
single market was built on protectionism.<br />
The Australian Government's interest in achieving reform in<br />
agricultural trade will be well known to you. We<br />
acknowledge that the Brussels Summit Meeting under your<br />
chairmanship saw a significant first step towards bringing<br />
an end to the extravagant excesses of production of<br />
agricultural commodities that have so distorted market<br />
mechanisms. I know your Government sees special problems in winding back<br />
the financial and other arrangements underpinning the Common<br />
Agricultural Policy as quickly as we and other Cairns Group<br />
nations would like. I can only emphasise that we see<br />
further reform of the CAP, with a view to the elimination of<br />
agricultural subsidies, as vital, both to the efficient and<br />
fair operation of world agricultural markets and for the<br />
health of the world trading system more generally. The<br />
United States has just in the last day or so pledged its<br />
support for a down-payment on the winding back of subsidies,<br />
conditioned on their elimination in the long term. We are<br />
therefore all looking to the mid-term review of the Uruguay<br />
round of trade negotiations as an important opportunity to<br />
embark on real reform. I was glad to hear this morning that<br />
you also wanted a satisfactory result to the mid-term<br />
review.<br />
Mr Chancellor,<br />
Our two countries share very many common ideals and values.<br />
There are bonds of kinship between our peoples which we<br />
continue to value highly. And there is scope for our two<br />
countries to work more closely in the future.<br />
Your visit has served to remind us of important past<br />
associations and to awaken the prospect of a more active and<br />
visible German presence in the Asia and Pacific region and<br />
in Australia itself. we welcome that prospect and look<br />
forward to an intensification of contacts at all levels in<br />
the future. 2 11() I </p>

In particular, Mr Chancellor, I look forward to taking up<br />
your invitation to visit the Federal Republic of Germany in<br />
the middle of next year.<br />
With that visit I hope to build further upon the impetus to<br />
strengthen relations between our two countries provided by<br />
your visit to us. We thank you for coming, we welcome you<br />
and we wish you a safe return home.<br />
