I will visit Washington DC from 8 to 13 June 2002.<br />
I will participate, along with President Bush, in a meeting of the International Democratic Union (IDU).  The meeting is a major gathering of senior political party leaders from more than 35 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas.<br />
During my visit, I will address a Joint Meeting of the United States Congress, the first time since 1988 that Australia has been so honoured.  My address to the Congress scheduled for my visit to Washington last year had to be postponed due to the tragic terrorist attacks of September 11.<br />
I will also hold talks with key figures in the US administration and on Capitol Hill on a wide range of economic and security issues.<br />
The United States is Australia';s largest foreign investor, our second largest trading partner and our closest ally.  The ANZUS security alliance between Australia and the United States was invoked for the first time following the attacks of 11 September.  Australian forces are engaged in and around Afghanistan with US and other coalition partners.<br />
I look forward to this visit and the opportunity to strengthen further a long-standing and warm bilateral relationship.</p>
