    <content><![CDATA[<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>John Howard, how do you think people should judge your backbench</p>
<p>   MP, Don Randall, for his attack of Cheryl Kernot?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well on this issue, poorly. It was quite unacceptable. I made that</p>
<p>   very clear when I heard about it. He has unreservedly apologised.</p>
<p>   He acted alone. He was not encouraged to do it by me nor to my knowledge</p>
<p>   by anybody else and the contemptible claim by Cheryl Kernot that</p>
<p>   I put him up to it is something that I reject completely.</p>
<p>I have never, in my 24 years in politics, favoured or supported</p>
<p>   or condoned the attacks on private lives of members of parliament.</p>
<p>   I have a strong view that private lives are the business of members</p>
<p>   of parliament and frankly I don't want any of this type of behaviour</p>
<p>   in parliament and whenever it occurs on my side I will see that</p>
<p>   it is reprimanded as I did very swiftly today. But the man has apologised,</p>
<p>   unreservedly and as far as I am concerned my publicly stated views</p>
<p>   about Cheryl Kernot's attitudes and policies are all that matter.</p>
<p>I am not the least bit interested in her private life. I don't</p>
<p>   comment on it and I don't want any of my colleagues commenting</p>
<p>   on it and I don't want anybody else doing so. I am not interested</p>
<p>   in it and I don't think the public is either.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Don Randall, his comments did appear to be quite premeditated.</p>
<p>   He actually read the worst of those comments from notes, how seriously</p>
<p>   can we take such an apology under pressure when he has done it in</p>
<p>   such a premeditated way.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Kerry, I can not answer that, I'll answer for my own</p>
<p>   actions. I knew nothing about the speech until this morning. I took</p>
<p>   action and frankly that as far as I can take it. If you want to</p>
<p>   pursue it further with Mr Randall, go ahead and do so.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>What sense of personal outrage did you feel when you absorbed the</p>
<p>   full import of those sorts of words. Words like: "the morals</p>
<p>   of an alley cat on heat"?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Kerry, I totally disapprove of that sort of language but let's</p>
<p>   get a sense of proportion. I have reprimanded the man, he has given</p>
<p>   an unreserved apology, I've explained the circumstances of</p>
<p>   it and I don't intend to spend the next 15 minutes talking</p>
<p>   about. I can't take the matter any further.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>And there is also the issue of Senator Parer and his coal interests</p>
<p>   because these two separate issues, quite distinctly separate issues,</p>
<p>   nontheless each in their own way go to the issue of parliamentary</p>
<p>   standards. And you made a very big issue in the last federal election</p>
<p>   and beforehand about your desire and your promise to raise the standards</p>
<p>   the ethics of parliament and public trust in the parliament. It's</p>
<p>   your very own ministerial guideline that says Ministers should divest</p>
<p>   themselves of all shares and similar interests in any business involved</p>
<p>   in areas of their portfolio responsibilities. Why is Senator Parer</p>
<p>   still in the Ministry?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, if I can take that very long question in parts. I have dramatically</p>
<p>   changed the standards of accountability of parliament. To start</p>
<p>   with, I go to every Question Time, my predecessor went to half the</p>
<p>   Question Times. Secondly, I have almost doubled the number of questions</p>
<p>   that the Opposition can ask and if you are talking about accountability,</p>
<p>   having Ministers and the Prime Minister under question every day</p>
<p>   in parliament for a much longer period of time, has dramatically</p>
<p>   increased accountability. </p>
<p>Now as far as the Ministerial guidelines are concerned, what happened</p>
<p>   was that in accordance with the practice I established, Warwick</p>
<p>   Parer made a full disclosure to me as he was required to do. He</p>
<p>   sought to comply with the guidelines and to act in good faith.</p>
<p>   The disclosure he made to me was given to me for careful perusal</p>
<p>   and checking by the head of my department who advised me in writing,</p>
<p>   that in his opinion, Senator Parer had complied with the guidelines.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that Senator Parer has been dishonest. Kim</p>
<p>   Beazley has admitted today that there is no evidence that Senator</p>
<p>   Parer took any action as Minister to directly advantage any company</p>
<p>   in which he had a direct or an indirect interest. There has been</p>
<p>   no evidence produced of a conflict of interest and in those circumstances</p>
<p>   I do not believe there is a case for his resignation and I do not</p>
<p>   intend to ask it and I do not expect him to tender it.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>In an interview on October 15 1996, you said precisely these words:</p>
<p>   "The guidelines say that you can't have interests in companies</p>
<p>   which operate in your area of portfolio responsibility". Senator</p>
<p>   Parer is the Minister for coal. His family trust has holdings in</p>
<p>   a coal company. That family trust, as we understand it, has stood</p>
<p>   to benefit from that interest. Why is he still in the job?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well he hasn't received any dividends himself, so I am advised,</p>
<p>   from those particular interests since he has been a Minister. And</p>
<p>   it is no good saying he stands to benefit, the fact is he has not</p>
<p>   benefited as a result of any decision that he has taken as a Minister</p>
<p>   responsible in that area over the last two years. And that is why,</p>
<p>   and added to the fact that he sought in good faith, at all times</p>
<p>   to comply with the guidelines, so far as disclosure to me was concerned,</p>
<p>   it is for those reasons that I do not intend to require his resignation.</p>
<p>He has not behaved improperly. Nobody is suggesting that he is</p>
<p>   a dishonest man. Nobody has produced any evidence of an actual conflict</p>
<p>   of interest and it would therefore, in my view, be inappropriate</p>
<p>   to require his resignation and I do not intend to do so.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>The guidelines say, very clearly, you can't have interest</p>
<p>   in companies which operate in your area of portfolio responsibility.</p>
<p>   Is Senator Parer, the Minister for coal, responsible for coal, does</p>
<p>   his family trust have a direct interest in coal?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Kerry, you have asked me that question in different ways before</p>
<p>   and I am indicating to you firstly, that Senator Parer has not done</p>
<p>   anything dishonest. He has not benefited through any particular</p>
<p>   decision he has taken as Minister, in relation to his own company.</p>
<p>   He has sought at all times to make full disclosure. He was told</p>
<p>   by the Secretary of my department and I was advised by the Secretary</p>
<p>   of my department, that on examination of his return that he complied</p>
<p>   with the guidelines.</p>
<p>Now in those circumstances I do not intend to require his resignation.</p>
<p>   We can sit here all night and you can ask me the same question in</p>
<p>   different forms but I do not intend to alter my view.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>But I would suggest, with respect, that you still haven't</p>
<p>   explained how he somehow or other avoids your own definition of</p>
<p>   what the guidelines are. Very simply does Senator Parer share in</p>
<p>   an asset in the coal industry, which has increased in value or is</p>
<p>   increasing in value, while he is the Minister responsible for policy</p>
<p>   on coal?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Kerry, those words that you have just used don't appear</p>
<p>   in my guidelines. But look you can spend the whole night, we can</p>
<p>   waste the remaining 10 minutes, or whatever you have allocated for</p>
<p>   this interview, on this issue. I have made my position clear. You</p>
<p>   have got to look at the totality of a man's conduct. He has</p>
<p>   not been dishonest. He has not taken the decision to directly advantage</p>
<p>   a company to which he is connected. There is no suggestion of personal</p>
<p>   enrichment, as a result of his Ministerial holding. He has not received,</p>
<p>   so I am told by his financial advisers, he has not received any</p>
<p>   dividend from any coal interests during the time that he has been</p>
<p>   a Minister.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>But what if the value of the asset rose?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>If it were the direct result of a decision that he had taken specifically</p>
<p>   to benefit that company that would be another matter.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Has the coal industry benefited from your decision on greenhouse?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Kerry, you could equally say that Peter Costello ought to</p>
<p>   resign as Treasurer because the interest rate on the mortgage he</p>
<p>   has on his Melbourne home has gone down by 2.5 per cent as a consequence</p>
<p>   of his economic policies. What you are really arguing is akin to</p>
<p>   saying that a farmer can never be the Minister for Primary Industry.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>No sorry Mr Howard but the guidelines specifically exclude farmers.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You weren't asking me about guidelines, you are putting a</p>
<p>   proposition that because, even if it had nothing to do with what</p>
<p>   Warwick Parer had done himself, specifically as a Minister, in relation</p>
<p>   to a particular company if the value of a coal interest had risen</p>
<p>   over a particular time, then he is responsible. You have got to</p>
<p>   look a the totality of a man's behaviour and you have got to</p>
<p>   go to motive. And at all times his behaviour, honestly, at all times</p>
<p>   he has sought to make full disclosure to me. I was advised in good</p>
<p>   faith, after an assessment in good faith by the Secretary of my</p>
<p>   department that he had complied with the guidelines.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>But isn't it true that you are also talking, not just about</p>
<p>   real conflict of interest, you are talking about potential conflict</p>
<p>   of interest and you are talking about perception of conflict of</p>
<p>   interest in the public eye.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I am talking about what my attitude is to what Senator Parer</p>
<p>   has done. I have given you my answer and you are frankly wasting</p>
<p>   my time and that of the viewers by pursuing it.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Well I am sorry Mr Howard, but you are the person who first put</p>
<p>   great importance in the issue of propriety, of parliamentary ethics</p>
<p>   and of public trust in politicians. As any lawyer who deals with</p>
<p>   family trusts knows, if Senator Parer is an object of that trust,</p>
<p>   then at some time he stands to benefit from the appreciating assets</p>
<p>   and or dividends of that trust. Isn't that a potential conflict</p>
<p>   of interest? if he doesn't get money in his hand now, if at</p>
<p>   some point in the future he stands to benefit financially.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Kerry you are talking about ethics. He has not behaved unethically.</p>
<p>   I am interested in actual conflict of interest. There has not been</p>
<p>   an actual conflict of interest and frankly I have got nothing further</p>
<p>   to add to that.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Today's newspaper editorials disagree quite clearly, The</p>
<p>   Australian, the head of its editorial: Government tries to fool</p>
<p>   the people, The Sydney Morning Herald: Parer caught in the</p>
<p>   mess, The Age: Why Senator Parer must stand down, The</p>
<p>   Adelaide Advertiser, The Courier Mail and so on. I mean</p>
<p>   politically, where does that leave you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Most editorials in the country are critical on my stance on native</p>
<p>   title. Editorials are frequently critical. Commentators frequently</p>
<p>   say that politicians shouldn't do what the press tells them</p>
<p>   to do, they should make up their own mind on what they intend to</p>
<p>   do. Now I have reflected on this, I have discussed it with my senior</p>
<p>   colleagues. I have taken a stance. I don't agree with you.</p>
<p>   I don't agree with the editorials. I am standing by Senator</p>
<p>   Parer. He has not behaved dishonourably or improperly. He has been</p>
<p>   a very good Minister for Resources and I don't believe there</p>
<p>   has been any actual conflict of interest. </p>
<p>I was told after an examination, in good faith by the head of my</p>
<p>   department, that his return fully complied with my guidelines and</p>
<p>   in those circumstances I just don't intend to take action against</p>
<p>   him.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>To what extent, if any at all, have you been influenced by the</p>
<p>   fact that you have already lost seven frontbenchers, either sacked</p>
<p>   or resigned, over problems with shareholdings or travel allowance</p>
<p>   claims that an eighth Minister in an election year would be disastrous?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Kerry I have looked at the merits of this particular issue and</p>
<p>   that is the basis of the decision.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>If we can move on to the issue of health. You have copped a caning</p>
<p>   this week from state health ministers and some state premiers over</p>
<p>   the fact that you are refusing to budge, that is your Government</p>
<p>   is refusing to budge, go any further, in terms of the new Medicare</p>
<p>   arrangement. Is that your line going into the Premiers Conference,</p>
<p>   Peter Costello was very strong on that today, you are not going</p>
<p>   to go any further than you have already established?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Kerry, we have put out a very fair offer to the states. They always</p>
<p>   complain, in relation to health, that the Commonwealth hasn't</p>
<p>   given them enough money. We have made a real increase of three per</p>
<p>   cent to the states. It is a very fair offer and we think they ought</p>
<p>   to accept it.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>They are saying that your proposal will unacceptably lower the</p>
<p>   quality of health care, they want $5.5 billion, $3 billion of which</p>
<p>   they say would just compensate them for the cost of public health</p>
<p>   of the alarming decline in private health insurance.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Kerry, states always say that. They always ask for more money</p>
<p>   and what is happening in this country is that health has become</p>
<p>   a political football between State Governments and State Oppositions</p>
<p>   and State and Federal Governments. Despite the criticisms of it,</p>
<p>   this country does have a much better health system than most countries</p>
<p>   in the world. There is some strain on private health insurance and</p>
<p>   the main reason for that is that the former government ran it down</p>
<p>   from a 61 per cent community coverage to a 34 per cent community</p>
<p>   coverage when we came to office.</p>
<p>Now our private health incentives which Mr Lee and Mr Beazley would</p>
<p>   presumably abolish because they are always attacking, and would</p>
<p>   therefore make private health insurance $450 a year dearer for each</p>
<p>   family, our private health insurance incentives have helped. But</p>
<p>   as far as the states are concerned we have made an offer which is</p>
<p>   a 3 per cent real increase on the existing Medicare arrangements.</p>
<p>The states themselves, in the early to mid 1990s cut their own</p>
<p>   direct spending on their hospitals at the same time as the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   was increasing its commitment to that very same area of public health.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Are you saying that they are exaggerating the impact of the drain</p>
<p>   from private health cover on public hospitals?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I am not only saying that, I am also saying that over the past</p>
<p>   few years, going back to the early 1990s, the states themselves</p>
<p>   have been collectively guilty of cutting direct public spending</p>
<p>   on hospitals. And you have to look at the total picture. Every time</p>
<p>   something goes wrong they blame the Federal Government, particularly</p>
<p>   Andrew Refshauge in NSW. The reality is you look at the graph of</p>
<p>   Commonwealth and State spending in this area you will see that in</p>
<p>   the early 1990s there were significant cuts in public spending by</p>
<p>   states on hospitals at the very same time that the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   was increasing its contribution.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>But you did promise to solve that problem of declining private</p>
<p>   health funds before the last election, do you accept, are you prepared</p>
<p>   to acknowledge yet that your $600 million dollar subsidy for the</p>
<p>   private health funds, via tax rebates, simply hasn't done what</p>
<p>   you expected it to do.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Kerry I would like there to be more people in private health insurance.</p>
<p>   We have tried. I think it is too early to make a final judgement</p>
<p>   on the impact of those tax incentives. Unfortunately, Graham Richardson's</p>
<p>   advice a few years ago to the former government that they should</p>
<p>   have taken action to stabilise private health insurance at about</p>
<p>   38 or 39 per cent membership, that advice wasn't taken and</p>
<p>   of course, lower it has got the harder it has become to reverse</p>
<p>   the trend.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>But I presume you took that into account when you made the election</p>
<p>   promise though.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. And the advice that we had at the time was accepted in good</p>
<p>   faith. We have certainly slowed the haemorrhaging or we have certainly</p>
<p>   had an impact on it and I hope over the months ahead we will have</p>
<p>   a further impact. And it is an area, of course, that always remains</p>
<p>   under constant review but the Labor Party alternative is presumably</p>
<p>   to abolish the tax subsidy. I mean they are always attacking it</p>
<p>   and saying it is a waste of money, so I can only assume that Mr</p>
<p>   Beazley's policy is if he wins the next election, to wipe out</p>
<p>   the tax subsidy, and through that he will make private health insurance</p>
<p>   $450 a year dearer for each Australian family that has it.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Very briefly another issue that is bubbling away there with the</p>
<p>   states is gun laws. Various states seem to be planning to soften</p>
<p>   the gun laws of 1996, what will you do about that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I have asked that it be put on the agenda of the Premiers</p>
<p>   Conference. The buy back has been hugely successful. We have recovered</p>
<p>   about 600,000 - 700,000 semi-automatic and other prohibited weapons.</p>
<p>   And by and large the uniform agreement has been observed. I think</p>
<p>   the danger in the discussion that has occurred publicly about possible</p>
<p>   changes at the edges is that the impression is wrongly created that</p>
<p>   in some way the agreement hasn't worked. It has overwhelmingly</p>
<p>   worked very effectively. </p>
<p>We have put on the agenda and I want to make certain that the hopes</p>
<p>   of all Australians that that agreement be honoured in full, 100</p>
<p>   per cent are realised and that is why I have put it on the agenda.</p>
<p>   The Australian public wants that agreement honoured in full and</p>
<p>   I will do all in my power to achieve that.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Ok I am conscious of the time ticking away. Very quickly, is this</p>
<p>   a line in the sand for you? No weakening on the gun laws.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look Kerry, I want the agreement that was made two years ago honoured.</p>
<p>   That's my position, it has always been my position. I understand</p>
<p>   it to still be the position of the Premiers, that's what they</p>
<p>   say, and it is certainly the position of the overwhelming majority</p>
<p>   of the Australian community, might I say particularly Australian</p>
<p>   women who saw that uniform gun prohibition as a huge blow for a</p>
<p>   safer Australia.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>John Howard thanks for talking with us.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Pleasure.</p>
