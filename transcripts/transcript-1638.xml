PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE,<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE,<br />
CANBERRA. 3rd August, 1967.<br />
PM's VISIT TO THE WEST PRESS ARRANGEMENTS<br />
In order that I can assess requirements, I would<br />
like to know how many news organisations would be interested in<br />
sending representatives to cover the Prime Minister's West Australian<br />
tour in September, including the opening of North-West Cape.<br />
As I see it at this stage, transport arrangements<br />
will probably be similar to Mr Holt's recent Asian visits, with the<br />
participating media contributing to the cost of a special press aircraft.<br />
Cost per seat would probably work out at much the same rate as<br />
commercial fares for the routes to be flown.<br />
I would like to know as soon as possible how many<br />
newsmen would be wishing to cover the tour on this basis.<br />
A. EGGLETON<br />
Press Secretary to the Prime Minister </p>
