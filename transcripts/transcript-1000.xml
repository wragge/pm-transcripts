    <content><![CDATA[<p>FOR PRESS P. M. 68/ 1964</p>
<p>I offer my good wishes to the Victorian Government for Saturday's Legislative Council by-election.</p>
<p>Whatever differences of opinion may exist on particular matters and there always will be differences the dominant issue on Saturday is whether Mr. Boltets government is to retain a majority in both Houses, or go back to a position where any government policy may be frustrated by an adverse vote in the Upper House. Similar questions will arise at the next Senate Election. The record of the Bol-e Government is a very fine and progressive one. The electors of Victoria recently gave it tneir warm and clear approval, I am sure that they will affirm their decision on Saturday,</p>
<p>CANBERRA<br />8th October, 1964.</p>
