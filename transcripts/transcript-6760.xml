E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH LAURIE OAKES 11 OCTOBER 1985<br />
OAKES: Prime Minister, how badly do you believe you have<br />
been damaged by the Bicentennial row?<br />
PM: Not at all. I believe the explanations I have given in<br />
the Parliament show that I have acted honourably and appropriately.<br />
And I always make the judgement about politics, Laurie, that the<br />
Australian people have a much greater capacity to get their<br />
priorities and their perspectives in order than does a<br />
bedraggled and increasingly incompetent opposition.<br />
OAKES: But don't you think some people might have had their<br />
illusions about you shattered a bit. I mean you haven't come out<br />
of this as the world's greatest administrator.<br />
PM: I conceded openly when I first spoke to the Parliament that'<br />
it may have been wiser if I had looked at the composition of the<br />
settlement earlier than the 10th of September. But I have said<br />
that if I made a mistake there it was a mistake of trusting what<br />
I had been told by the Chairman of the Authority.<br />
OAKES: Do you concede that you should have made more checks and<br />
sought more advice?<br />
PM: With the benefit of hindsight, which unfortunately none of<br />
us have by definition at the time, then we may be able to have<br />
done something. But, of course, what you have got to remember<br />
is that by the time I received the letter on the 28th of August<br />
seeking approval, which under law I couldn't give, the deed<br />
of settlement had already been signed five days earlier. A<br />
remarkable situation.<br />
OAKES: But the truth is that if you had acted earlier you could<br />
have stopped this payment and the subsequent row wouldn't have<br />
occurred, there wouldn't recover the money.<br />
PM: You say if, if, if. I would have had to have adopted a<br />
different judgement about bhe previous Chairman than the one<br />
I did. The judgement I adopted was that what I was being told<br />
reprebented the position as it was. That there was essentially<br />
a contract to be bought out which would involve an amount of the<br />
order that emerged. It turns out that that wasn't the case.<br />
Now, of course, if one had known the position as it was put<br />
to me was not accurate one would have done different things. / 2 </p>
<p>OAKES: But it is not just the Chairman. It is also your own<br />
Department that you say misled you?<br />
PM: Well what has emerged in regard to the Department j,. g that they<br />
became aware, I think they are now saying, on the first of October,<br />
the file on which this existed, not the file by the way, which said<br />
in Senate Committe report that had been attached, said was attached<br />
to the minutes of the first Board. They are saying it wasn't. They<br />
found it subsequently in another file. But they found it on the first<br />
of October apparently.<br />
OAKES: And what do you think of your Department after that?<br />
PM: It is not a question of what I think. I think I have conveyed<br />
to them that I agree with their assessment that they were considerably<br />
less than ept.<br />
OAKES: Whether it is the fault of the former Chairman or the<br />
Department, you are the responsible Minister and you have got to carry<br />
the can. Has your image suffered?<br />
PM: I don't think so. You have got the position where when you<br />
are told that a contract is not available, and it is not availab&amp;<br />
because they have been given the impression from the Authority that<br />
it is not available on the grounds that this is a personal document<br />
between the Authority and the person. And that is what they tell<br />
you. I don't suppose it would be regarded as a sensible use of Prime<br />
Ministerial time to go over and try and comb through 800 files.<br />
OAKES: No, I concede that. But are you aware of the criticism<br />
around the corridors, including among Caucus members, that this has<br />
shown up a flaw in your make-up as Prime Minister, if you like, that<br />
you are not an administrator.<br />
PM: No, I am not aware of that. And very importantly, I have been<br />
going around this country as you know quite extensively in the<br />
last few weeks. And I have not had one question about it.<br />
OAKES: It has been said to me and perhaps you haven't heard that<br />
Bob Hawke has always been a front man, good at shaking hands, kissing<br />
babies, appearing on television. But has never come out tops in<br />
administration? There is talk about ACTU Solo and ACTU Bourkes<br />
PM: Well, let's talk about ACTU Solo and ACTU Bourkes. It is this<br />
Bob Hawke who asked the previous government to abolish resale price<br />
maintenance which was costing the citizens of this country millions<br />
of dollars a year. The government of my predecessors wouldn't do<br />
that. So this Bob Hawke set up ACTU Bourkes and we smashed resale<br />
price maintenance. And we saved the citizens of this country hundreds<br />
of millions of dollars, now much more than that. The same fellow<br />
who set up ACTU Solo, which brought in very considerable savings to<br />
the people of this country. So, not only do I repudiate the<br />
proposition of not being effective in terms of making decisions and<br />
carrying them through. The opposite is true.<br />
OAKES: Bob Hawke is a good administrator in your view? </p>
<p>PM: Yes. I am not saying that I am the most brilliant administrator<br />
in the world. I am an effective administrator. And most importantly<br />
I produce the results in the area of conception and ideas and then<br />
the carrying through of that in the policy which has turned this<br />
economy around from its worst recession in 50 years to the point,<br />
where, as you know, on the most recent statistics we are well ahead<br />
of my promise I made to the Australian people of giving them 500,000<br />
new jobs in 3 years. We are well ahead of that target. Now, that<br />
didn't happen by accident. It happened because I had a view about<br />
how this economy should be run. I not only had the view, the<br />
conception, I worked it out. And then with my MInisters I applied<br />
that. So, I won't cop this nonsense about not being able to conceive<br />
the right policies nor being able to apply them.<br />
OAKES: ARe you too busy?<br />
PM: Well, I think any Prime Minister is always too busy. I work,<br />
as you know, extraordinarily long hours. And I guess, if you could<br />
reach into the impossible you would like to be able to put out more<br />
hours in the day. And if you had more hours you could do more<br />
things, or some of the things that you do you might be able to give<br />
even more attention to. But, I am not only stand them, I feel<br />
extraordinarily proud of my record as Prime Minister which has<br />
produced an economy in this country which is recognised as the best<br />
performing economy in the world, which is producing the highest rate<br />
of employment growth in the world, the highest rate of employment<br />
growth that this country has ever witnessed. And I have been directly<br />
and intimately associated not only with the conceptions that led to<br />
that result but the application '~ the<br />
policies that have produced those results.<br />
OAKES: Can we tu rn from your performance to that of your opponent?<br />
Before John ward was Oppo, iti on Leader you publicly and privately<br />
expressed some admiration fr hi m. What is your view now that you<br />
have been up against him for a month?<br />
PM: I haven't been given the benefit of having put in front of me<br />
the markings of his performance by his<br />
' friend and colleague, MichaelHodgman. He is the:" who has actually bz~<br />
day by day marking the performance.<br />
OAKES: How would you mark it?<br />
PM: Well, from what I hear I would agree with Michael Hodgman's<br />
marking. I think John Howard's performance on a daily basis hasn't<br />
got over 4 out of 10. I think that is a fairly generous assessment<br />
by his own colleague.<br />
OAKES: What do you base that on, or what does Michael Hodgman base<br />
that on?<br />
PM: You would have to ask Michael. But he obviously, in the first<br />
instance, his argument against Andrew Peacock was that Peacock didn't<br />
have policies. That Peacock just sto-6d back and waited for things<br />
to happen and thought perhaps some day when we got up towards an<br />
election, produce a policy. But of course, we have seen more backing<br />
and shcijing and sideways stepping by Mr Howard in every area of policy<br />
than ever occurred under Mr Peacock. I mean you look at the areas.<br />
Privatisation. At the first stage he was going to privatise the </p>
<p>lot. Now perhaps this on, no not that, or a bit of that one, a bit<br />
of this one. In the area wages and industrial relations policy.<br />
Now how many have we had there. He makes the Kharma Sutra look<br />
positively meagre. I mean, he has got that many positions you can't<br />
keep up with him. We don't know what they are going to be tomorrow.<br />
It doesn't matter what area. Tax, let us look at tax. He was the<br />
man of principle on tax and the assets test. The man of principle.<br />
He has just jumped away from every position of principle and is<br />
becoming the supreme opportunist.<br />
OAKES: But isn't he tougher in the House than Mr Peacock was?<br />
PM: Well he has, and this is the judgment of others.,~ C has not<br />
performed well as leader. He has caused no problem to the Government<br />
whatsoever. It is very interesting sitting there as Prime Minister.<br />
You watch the Leader of the Opposition and you watch those behind<br />
him. And they are singularly unimpressed. I mean the rumblings are<br />
already starting. I mean there is-* uarantee that I will be having<br />
John Howard as the Leader of the Opposition when we come to the next<br />
election. OAKES: Who is the alternative? Michael Hodgman?<br />
PM: Well he has declared himself publicly as coveting the position<br />
and going for it if Mr Howard doesn't perform. And according to<br />
Michael Hodgman' s own calculations, Mr Howard hasn't performed.<br />
OAKES: But seriously?<br />
PM: I am not going to be party to some defamatory comment. I mean<br />
if you are saying that Mr Hodgman is not worthy of being Leader of<br />
the Opposition. I mean I think the way the Oppostion is going, he<br />
is a worthy Leader of that Oppostion.<br />
OAKES: As Prime Minister, you have to worry about your Party, the<br />
Labor Party, nationally. The Party seems to be in trouble in<br />
Victoria? Is that your perception?<br />
PM: No, I don't think it is in trouble. It looks as though something<br />
quite unwise has been done by some people in the Party.<br />
OAKES: It is the Nunawading dirty trick?<br />
PM: Well, on what has been said, it is my judgment that something<br />
unwise seems to have been done. As it has been said by Mr Batchelor,<br />
nothing illegal. And indeed, in the past the conservative parties<br />
have played their dirty tricks, if you want to call it that way,<br />
complaints have been made to the Electoral Office about both the DLP<br />
and the Liberal Party. The fact that they have played those sort<br />
of tricks I don't think justifies this one.<br />
OAKES: But should Mr Batchelor get the chop as State Secretary?<br />
PM: I don't believe so. But I am not going to intrude into their<br />
internal affairs in that way. They will sort that one out.<br />
OAKES: But don't you think you could make a judgement. for example,<br />
the Victorian Governor was effectively sacked because he did something<br />
unwise. Don't you think the same rule should apply to the Party<br />
Secretary? </p>
<p>PM: I don't think there is an analogy there. And I am not going<br />
into the question of the Victorian Governorship and what happened<br />
there. And so I look at this other issue by itself. I don't think<br />
you can expect me to say more than I have and that is that I think<br />
something unwise occurred. And in politics people do unwise things<br />
at times. But I, on what I know of it, I don't think that the lack<br />
of wisdom that was displayed warrants the resignation of the Secretary<br />
PM: Do you think that Mr Cain is in trouble, the Victorian Premier.<br />
The reason I ask that is that an interview th; 3t Mr Bill Hartley<br />
gave on Monday, I have got a transcript here, radio interview, Mr<br />
Bill Hartley is<br />
PM: If he is criticising Mr Cain that is prima facie evidence that<br />
Mr Cain is going well.<br />
OAKES: Well Mr Hartley refers to two significant job vacancies in<br />
Victoria at the moment, one for Premier and one for State Governor.<br />
What is your reaction to that?<br />
PM: I would think that Mr Hartley ought to look at his position<br />
within the Labor Party. But that is something not new for me to say.<br />
I have been saying that for a long time.<br />
OAKES: So you are backing Mr Cain?<br />
PM: Of course, I back Mr Cain. And if you are putting it in terms<br />
of a choice between Mr Cain and Mr Hartley it is no race is it.<br />
OAKES: Is it just Mr Hartley?<br />
PM: Well I have only heard of Mr Hartley declaring a vacancy.<br />
OAKES: Mr Hawke, you are heading off on Sunday for the Commonwealth<br />
Heads of Government meeting, CHOGM.<br />
MI be leve you are coming with me, Laurie?<br />
NKES. esI am.<br />
PM: I am looking forward to you coming.<br />
OAKES: It seems that CHOGM stands for chaps holidaying on government<br />
money. Do you think anything<br />
PM: What about journalists who go with them?<br />
OAKES: That is an unfair question?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
OAKES: Do you think these meetings achieve anything?<br />
PM: Yes I think they do. I think for instance if you look back to<br />
the time of my predecessor I think the Commonwealth there was able<br />
to play a very significant role in the emergence of an independent S<br />
Zimbabwe in circumstances less bloody and less difficult than would<br />
have been the case without the existence of the Commonwealth. And<br />
I pay tribute to the role that way played by Mr Fraser, my<br />
predecessor in that exercise. The last CHOOM was my first CHOGM,<br />
in ' 83 as you will recall. And there again I think that the </p>
<p>Commonwealth was able to play a very useful role in regard to Grenada.<br />
So I always operate on the basis of not trying to overstate the<br />
significance of the institution or of16ountry with which you are<br />
associated. I mean, as far as Australia is concerned, no-one has<br />
got greater pride in this country than I. But where we take our place<br />
in international events, I try to have a perspective that with a<br />
country of 16 million people, I don't try to overstate who we are<br />
or what we can do. And again with the Commonwealth. A big<br />
institution within the world, community of nations. We can't<br />
determine what the rest of the world is going to do. And I believe<br />
that because of the affinities that we have with one another, becaus-V,<br />
of the fact that we represent black and white and other colours,<br />
because of the fact that we represent so many different races, because<br />
we represent the most developed countries and the least developed<br />
countries. Because we represent very large, physically large<br />
countries, down to the smallest island states, that gives us a<br />
capacity, a knowledge and an experience to bring to bear upon<br />
international issues a perspective, an understanding whictkis unique.<br />
OAKES: At the meeting next week, you will be putting forward an<br />
initiative for an international group of respected personalities to<br />
investigate the South African situation. And I think a plan to<br />
achieve majority rule? How do you think that committee would operate.<br />
What can it achieve?<br />
PM: Well, I of course, want to finalise our thinking about this<br />
before we get there and I am in the process of doing that.<br />
consultation with my people. And so I don't now definitively put<br />
the details of what we will be doing. But you are right in<br />
saying that I intend that Australia shall take a leading role in<br />
addressing itself to the abhorrence of apartheid. And really there<br />
are a number of elements of that. You mention one, as to whether<br />
it is possible to get a group of people who would be able to bring<br />
prestige and a capacity to bear upon this situation. That is one<br />
element of what we will be talking about.<br />
oakes; And I gather our diplomats who are already lobbying for this,<br />
are suggesting Julius Nyere from Tanzania as the possible chairman<br />
of that committee. Ts that your suggestion?<br />
PM: Well, I don't want at this stage to go into that detail Laurie.<br />
But let me say this. Julius Nyere has a standing not only in AFrica<br />
through his long tenure of leadership, but also I believe a respect<br />
outside of AFrica which would make Julius an appropriate person to<br />
be involved in this concept.<br />
OAKES: I am also told we are also floating as possible Australian<br />
members of the Committee, Malcolim Fraser and Gough Whitlam?<br />
PM: Well, let me say their names have been mentioned. And they aretwo<br />
citizens of the world, if may say that in this sense, who would be<br />
appropriate to be considered. As you know I have consistently both<br />
publicly and privately acknowledged the consistent integrity and<br />
commitment of Malcolm Fraser in this area. And of course it goes<br />
with Gough without saying. It is more appropriate that I should<br />
mention Malcolm Fraser.<br />
OAKES: It would be unusual for a Labor Government to appoint a former<br />
Liberal Prime Minister to that kind of job.<br />
PM: Well, it wouldn't be our function to appoint anyone. I mean<br />
Australia won't be making appointments to bodies embraced by the<br />
Commonweal th. </p>
<p>OAKES: But you will be recommending<br />
PM: Well, I don't develop that point now. But I simply want to make<br />
this point and it gives me pleasure to make it. I have nothing but<br />
admiration for Malcolm Fraser on the issue of colour and race. He<br />
has throughout his public career been impeccable on this issue. And<br />
now at a time where his own party in this country has been, if I can<br />
put it as gently as possible, has been ambivalent on this question,<br />
he has been even fiercer if you like in his determination and<br />
commitment to see that he could do whatever he can to focus the<br />
world's attention upon the abhorrence of apartheid. </p>
<p>OAKES: Would you see the committee that you have got in mind<br />
visiting South Africa?<br />
PM: I have said before I don't want to develop more details than<br />
this. I don't think it is fair that I should do that at this stage.<br />
I will be more than happy to talk to you about it later on.<br />
OAKES: Allright. On a more general subject, what do you see CHOGM<br />
doing about sanctions against South Africa?<br />
PM: Well, again I want to hear what my colleagues there have to<br />
say. I think we will all be concerned to see if some concept of<br />
effective sanctions can be applied. But I want to make the point to<br />
your viewers that I would infinitely prefer a situation in which<br />
sanctions were not necessary. And at the same time if one in maybe<br />
talking about seeing what you can do about effective santions.<br />
Contemporaneously with that we should be addressing our minds to<br />
how we can persuade the South African regime itself to understand<br />
that the world can no longer tolerate the abhorrence of apartheid.<br />
And to get the South African regime to understand that in its own<br />
interests as well as the interest of the 18 million black South<br />
Africans that there should be moves init'iated by the South African<br />
Government to move towards a situation where there is a universal<br />
suffrage and we do have a free living society within that currently<br />
tragic State. And~ a State which is facing the prospect of appalling<br />
bloodshed good sense does not prevail.<br />
OAKES: Nevertheless you will be discussing sanctions?<br />
PM: I will be discussing them obviously.<br />
OAKES: Do you expect a clash with Britain's Prime Minister<br />
Margaret Thatcher on that?<br />
PM: Well I am not looking for one.<br />
OAKES: But you got on quite well at the last CHOGM?<br />
PM: At New Delhi we got on very well and I have no desire to clash<br />
with Margaret Thatcher. No desire at all.<br />
OAKES: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well I don't know. I don't know what position she will have<br />
there. I mean I must say that I agree with you that one would think<br />
on the basis of what the British Government has said to this point,<br />
there will be a clear difference of opinion. If they adhere to their<br />
position there would be a clear difference of opinion not just<br />
between myself and Margaret Thatcher but I would think between<br />
Margaret Thatcher and about virtually every other representative<br />
there. But I don't go there looking for a clash.<br />
OAKES: Does it matter if she refuses to go along with your ideas<br />
on sanctions or with the Commonwealth's ideas on sanctions?<br />
PM: Well obviously a less than desirable situation. If what<br />
emerges is the position of" est on one side and Britain on the other<br />
and that is not a position that I would be seeking to create, I<br />
would hope that the British Government would recognise the strength<br />
of feeling within the Commonwealth. </p>
<p>OAKES: Mr Hawke, is it true that you have got in mind a training<br />
plan for young black South Africans that you will be presenting<br />
to CHOGM?<br />
PM: We have already, in Government, made contributions to the<br />
training of young blacks and we will be talking about things we<br />
have done. We may be able to think of measures that will take<br />
it even further.<br />
OAKES: Similar to the scholarship program that used to exist for<br />
young black Rhodesians before independence?<br />
PM: Similar sort of concept but it goes from the point that if<br />
there is going to be a move towards universal suffrage in which the<br />
blacks are going to have the opportunity ofo~ ajority say in the<br />
running of their own country then it is very important that there<br />
be as many trained blacks as there can be. Not merely in the area<br />
of government and administration but also ineconomic management.<br />
Let me say in going to that point that I think as essentially<br />
important an issue in talking constructively about the future<br />
of South Africa is that we address ourselves to the way in which<br />
the capital, the experience and the expertise of white South<br />
Africans shpuld not be dissipated. I mean the great tragedy<br />
would be if got political suffrage, universal suffrage, independence<br />
in that sense and the country were to fall back into economic<br />
stagnation and recession because of the withdrawal or the driving<br />
away of all the accumulated experience and capital of white<br />
South Africa. So I think what men and women of goodwill should be<br />
trying to address themselves to is to give some sort of assurance<br />
to white South Africans that in a new free and liberal society,<br />
in political terms, that there should be an understanding of the<br />
legitimate place there for them.<br />
OAKES: I am wondering if you see a risk that on this issue you<br />
win the Commonwealth but not win the Australian electorate. There<br />
seems to have been a backlash against the Government's decision,<br />
for example, to keep out the Rotary golfers?<br />
PM: Well I don't know about a backlash. I haven't had any such<br />
backlash brought to my attention. But thereIcertain issues of<br />
principle, I believe, that are non-negotiable and I have said<br />
before earlier in this program that that's the position I would<br />
share with Malcolm Fraser.<br />
OAKES: But how is it though that these three Rotarians were able<br />
to play in gold in Scotland last year? One has actually played<br />
at Gleneagles. Why were they allowed to play there but not in<br />
Australia? PM: Well we believe that the:', presence here would not be<br />
consistent with the Gleneagles Agreement. But let me say this further,<br />
that I believe that the attitude of the world today is different<br />
to what it was twelve months ago. You only have to look at the<br />
hardening of the attitudes, for instance, in the United States.<br />
If I had said to you twelve months ago the United States would be<br />
talking economic action against South Africa you probably would<br />
have been sceptical. But they have. </p>
