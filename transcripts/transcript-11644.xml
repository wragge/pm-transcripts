    <content><![CDATA[<p>Subjects: Women in Parliament; Role of Wom</p>
<p>E&amp;OE...............................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much Deirdre, to you Dennis, to Senator Jocelyn Newman,</p>
<p>   the Minister for Families and Community Services and also the Minister</p>
<p>   assisting me in relation to the Status of Women, my other parliamentary</p>
<p>   colleagues and fellow Liberals, and ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>This is fourth opportunity I have had as Prime Minister to address</p>
<p>   a gathering such as this and in a sense as you might expect it is a</p>
<p>   little bit different each year, because as each year goes by there is</p>
<p>   a proper questioning of the relationship between a section of the government,</p>
<p>   or a section of a political party devoted exclusively to issues of concern</p>
<p>   to women. And also the steady progress which is being made in providing</p>
<p>   full equality of opportunity for women within our party and within society.</p>
<p>The antecedants of the Liberal Party, were not quite as far sighted</p>
<p>   as Dame Elizabeth Couchman and Sir Robert Menzies when they struck that</p>
<p>   deal of which Dennis spoke so effectively. And one of the givens about</p>
<p>   the Liberal Party since its formation and certainly not least of all</p>
<p>   here in the state of Victoria, has been the role of women within the</p>
<p>   party. </p>
<p>And that role has inevitably changed as the role of women within our</p>
<p>   community has changed and one of the things that the Government has</p>
<p>   sought to do in the four years it has been in office has been to attack</p>
<p>   in a practical way areas of continuing discrimination against women</p>
<p>   within our community, but increasingly to recognise that the right solutions</p>
<p>   for the community as a whole are the solutions that women generally</p>
<p>   want.</p>
<p>I could go through a long list of statistics of percentage improvements.</p>
<p>   I could remind you for example that 35% of all small business operators</p>
<p>   in Australia in the present time are women Â a significant change</p>
<p>   on what the position would have been twenty years ago. I could remind</p>
<p>   you that in 1996 we saw the biggest single flood of new women members</p>
<p>   into Federal Parliament that we've seen as a result of the 1996</p>
<p>   election. And increasingly, as Dennis has pointed out, what he now</p>
<p>   quite rightly doesn't call safe seats but seats that occasionally</p>
<p>   record higher Liberal votes than others. Just there are women increasingly</p>
<p>   occupying those sorts of seats in Victoria, so it is the case in the</p>
<p>   Federal Parliament.</p>
<p>And if I may say so that one of the distinguishing characteristics</p>
<p>   of the women members of the Coalition in both the Senate and the House</p>
<p>   of Representatives are their remarkable campaign skills. And any person</p>
<p>   who critically examined the 1998 election campaign would have to conclude</p>
<p>   that one of the reasons why the Coalition was returned with a comfortable</p>
<p>   majority were the remarkable campaign skills of many of our female members</p>
<p>   in many of our marginal seats. </p>
<p>But today's conference, and indeed the conference over the weekend,</p>
<p>   the convention itself, will focus very heavily on social policy. Social</p>
<p>   policy of course is of equal concern to men and women. The notion</p>
<p>   that in same way, social policy is predominantly the concern of women</p>
<p>   is as wrong and as outdated as the notion that economic and business</p>
<p>   policy is predominantly the concern of men. Just as male politicians</p>
<p>   should have the same level of empathy with social challenges and social</p>
<p>   issues as female politicians, so it is within our community that men</p>
<p>   should carry an equal burden of the social responsibilities and family</p>
<p>   responsibilities that are carried by women.</p>
<p>The notion that parents have unequal levels of responsibility in relation</p>
<p>   to the raising of children and their responsibility for their upbringing</p>
<p>   is of course a now greatly discredited proposition. And the growing</p>
<p>   belief in modern society that children need adequate role models, both</p>
<p>   male and female if they are to enjoy the full benefit of their family</p>
<p>   upbringing [inaudible] widely share. </p>
<p>Our society is a society which gives to all much greater choice than</p>
<p>   was the case twenty or thirty years ago. The debate about what is the</p>
<p>   right role for women in relation to the caring of their children and</p>
<p>   whether it should be caring by one or other parent at home for a period</p>
<p>   of time, or through care or some other child care arrangement. That</p>
<p>   debate has now moved and I think very refreshingly from arguments as</p>
<p>   to who is right or what is the right arrangement to a robust recognition,</p>
<p>   but what we ought to be doing is providing as many parents as possible</p>
<p>   with the option of making the decision that they think best suits their</p>
<p>   particular family circumstances. Balancing work and family responsibilities</p>
<p>   is very much the preoccupation of parents in the twenty first century.</p>
<p>Of course the aspiration of women to maintain careers, the aspiration</p>
<p>   of women to not only maintain careers for the satisfaction that they</p>
<p>   give, but also for the social interaction that they entail is widely</p>
<p>   understood and is part and parcel of our modern life. But equally as</p>
<p>   we enter the early years of the twenty first century, there is a recognition</p>
<p>   that the quality of the upbringing provided by parents to their children</p>
<p>   still remains far and away the most formative influence on the development</p>
<p>   of young lives. And all of our preoccupation as politicians, as members</p>
<p>   of a political party, all of preoccupation with strong economies, with</p>
<p>   balancing the budget, with reforming the taxation system, with delivering</p>
<p>   greater international competitiveness to the Australian economy, all</p>
<p>   of those pale into relative insignificance compared with the quality</p>
<p>   of life that we create for our young and the opportunities that they</p>
<p>   give to them. And the responsibility of parenthood on both men and women</p>
<p>   remains the most important responsibility that most of us experience</p>
<p>   during our lives.</p>
<p>We are very much a party of choice. We are a party that does not try</p>
<p>   and dictate stereotypes. We are a party that doesn't believe in</p>
<p>   quotas. We are a party that believes that people should aspire to achieve</p>
<p>   to the full according to their aspirations, according to their abilities</p>
<p>   and to their contribution and their performance. And the contribution</p>
<p>   that women have made to successive Coalition governments and the number</p>
<p>   of firsts that have been recorded by women on our side of politics is</p>
<p>   well understood, not only in the Liberal Party but in the broader political</p>
<p>   community. I want to pay tribute to the women of the Coalition Government</p>
<p>   elected in March of 1996, they have played major roles in shaping the</p>
<p>   direction of many areas of policy. And I particularly want to thank</p>
<p>   Jocelyn Newman for the work that she has done. She has a very important</p>
<p>   and much broadened policy responsibility as a result of the 1998 election.</p>
<p>   And the focus of this weekend's convention on social policy is</p>
<p>   in so small measure due to the way in which she has been able to shape</p>
<p>   the direction of that social policy. The way in which she has been</p>
<p>   able to bring an objective judgement and to set a good balance between</p>
<p>   encouraging the individual and community sector contributions to the</p>
<p>   development of social policy underpinned by the proper role of government</p>
<p>   within our community.</p>
<p>You've heard me speak very often and I'll speak again during</p>
<p>   this weekend, particularly when I address the Convention on Sunday morning,</p>
<p>   about the importance of the social coalition within our society. Of</p>
<p>   the fact that we appear, I think, at the beginning of this century to</p>
<p>   have achieved a better balance in relation to the respective roles of</p>
<p>   the Government and the rest of the community than we have had for thirty</p>
<p>   of forty years. We no longer believe that every solution can be provided</p>
<p>   by the government. We equally have rejected the rather naive notion</p>
<p>   that if you had an unrestrained market approach to everything, that</p>
<p>   through some kind of miracle of trickle down economics every problem</p>
<p>   would be solved. What you need is an appropriate recognition that the</p>
<p>   government has a limited but strategic role in our community. That</p>
<p>   we need a coalition of the government providing the social security</p>
<p>   safety net, that government acting as a facilitator but drawing together</p>
<p>   to contributions of the welfare sector, of business and of individuals.</p>
<p>   And much of the work that Jocelyn has done has been contributing in</p>
<p>   that area and giving effect to those kind of policy directions.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have the opportunity, again,</p>
<p>   of opening this conference. Of thanking all of the women of the Liberal</p>
<p>   Party over the years for their contribution, of recording the scale</p>
<p>   of that contribution and to remark that perhaps the end goal of all</p>
<p>   of our efforts will be as each year goes by the continuing questioning</p>
<p>   of the issue of whether or not you need to have a separate dedicated</p>
<p>   segment of a convention such as this dealing with women's affairs.</p>
<p>   I suspect for many years to come we will, but I regard it as a wholly</p>
<p>   healthy thing that that question might be asked because it is an indication</p>
<p>   that as the years go by greater equality of opportunity is being achieved,</p>
<p>   more barriers are being removed and greater recognition is being afforded</p>
<p>   to the capacity and the willingness of women to contribute across all</p>
<p>   sections of society and to play an equal partnership role with men in</p>
<p>   the development of the Australian community.</p>
<p>I thank all of you for your attendance. I wish the conference well,</p>
<p>   and I look forward to seeing a lot of all of you over the next two to</p>
<p>   three days. Thank you.</p>
