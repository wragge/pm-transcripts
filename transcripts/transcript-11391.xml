    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.............................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much Peter for those very warm and kind words of introduction.</p>
<p> To the Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, to the President of the</p>
<p> Victorian Division, Joy Howley, to my many federal and state parliamentary</p>
<p> colleagues, and fellow liberals from Victoria.</p>
<p>This is certainly a very large gathering and I thank all of you for</p>
<p> coming along in such large numbers to hear my speech. Or perhaps I'm</p>
<p> wrong. Richard Alston said you were all on the way to the football.</p>
<p> But whatever it be, it's always great to address hundreds of</p>
<p> members of the rank and file of the Liberal Party and it's appropriate</p>
<p> that I do so this weekend because it is almost to the day six months</p>
<p> since the government was re-elected in October of last year.</p>
<p>And it is therefore an opportunity to do both a stocktaking of that</p>
<p> six months and also to throw forward to the next two and a half years,</p>
<p> because immediately after its re-election, the government did set</p>
<p> about keeping faith in a most emphatic way with the commitments that</p>
<p> we made to the Australian people in the lead up to the last election.</p>
<p>I said when I spoke to this Council only a few weeks after the October</p>
<p> election that I believed that in many ways the victory in 1998 was</p>
<p> greater and more meritorious than the victory in 1996, because in</p>
<p> 1996 we were campaigning against a tired government that had become</p>
<p> lazy, arrogant and out of touch and led by somebody who imagined that</p>
<p> his judgement was always superior to that of the mainstream of the</p>
<p> Australian community.</p>
<p>And we won very emphatically in 1996 but in 1998 we were seeking an</p>
<p> explicit mandate to implement one of the most courageous blueprints</p>
<p> for economic reform that any western country has seen in the last</p>
<p> thirty or forty years.</p>
<p>It is the reality, ladies and gentlemen, that no federal government</p>
<p> in Australian political history has gone to the people with such a</p>
<p> comprehensive, open, transparent blueprint for economic reform than</p>
<p> the government I led to the last federal election. We've had</p>
<p> governments in the past that have talked generally about reform, we've</p>
<p> had governments in the past that have laid out general scenarios of</p>
<p> what they would do, but I defy anyone to name a government in Australian</p>
<p> political history that actually took a detailed reform plan to the</p>
<p> Australian economy in a fundamental area such as taxation, to the</p>
<p> Australian people, laid it all out in detail and said vote for us</p>
<p> or against us, on the basis of this plan.</p>
<p>Now I say that very deliberately because in the weeks ahead the Australian</p>
<p> Senate will have to make a decision in relation to that plan. And</p>
<p> I want to say to you with all of the conviction that I can muster,</p>
<p> that the government has absolutely no intention of retreating from</p>
<p> the responsibility to implement that plan that was given to us by</p>
<p> the Australian people in October of last year.</p>
<p>We haven't put our political bodies on the line, survived to</p>
<p> tell the story, but to walk away because of the desire of those who</p>
<p> hold the balance of power but more particularly, the negative approach</p>
<p> of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats, to frustrate</p>
<p> the will of the Australian people.</p>
<p>We embarked upon a programme of further economic reform and change</p>
<p> immediately we were re-elected. We put the taxation legislation into</p>
<p> the Parliament, we set about our plans to privatise the remaining</p>
<p> elements of Telstra and thus make Australia not the second largest</p>
<p> share owning democracy in the world, but indeed the largest share</p>
<p> owning democracy in the world. And not only as Peter says, can we</p>
<p> by selling the rest of Telstra, remove for ever federal government</p>
<p> debt, a remarkable legacy to bequeath to our children and grandchildren,</p>
<p> but also if we can sell the remaining elements of Telstra, Australia</p>
<p> will boast the highest percentage of share owners of any democracy</p>
<p> in the western world.</p>
<p>But an even more important thing has occurred over the last six months.</p>
<p> And that is that I believe that over the last six months the Australian</p>
<p> community and importantly the world community, has begun to realise</p>
<p> the full extent to which Australia was able to stare down the worst</p>
<p> of the Asian economic downturn.</p>
<p>There was a sense of it before the election, there was a growing confidence</p>
<p> that maybe the impact of the Asian downturn would not be nearly as</p>
<p> great as we had suspected, but I don't believe it was until after</p>
<p> the election and through the Christmas and New Year period that the</p>
<p> full realisation came to the Australian public that not only had we</p>
<p> stared down the Asian economic downturn, but we had in fact demonstrated</p>
<p> a capacity for economic performance that was beyond the wildest expectations</p>
<p> of even some of our most enthusiastic supporters.</p>
<p>We have been able to deliver the lowest interest rates, the lowest</p>
<p> inflation figures for 30 years, the best unemployment level for almost</p>
<p> ten years, levels of business investment that make us very proud and</p>
<p> very optimistic about the future and we are increasingly attracting</p>
<p> the attention of the rest of the world. There was a sense, as Peter</p>
<p> alluded to, when we came into office that Australia was the anxious</p>
<p> outsider knocking on the door of the Asian club seeking admission.</p>
<p> Now all of that has been significantly changed and we have demonstrated</p>
<p> that we are an economic strongman in this particular part of the world.</p>
<p>And that was overwhelmingly due to the measures that we took when</p>
<p> we came to office.</p>
<p>If we had not cut the budget deficit that we inherited, if we had</p>
<p> not taken some of those decisions that caused some unease and criticism</p>
<p> in the community because of their impact on particular groups, .........making</p>
<p> a contribution to repairing the fiscal position, we would not now</p>
<p> be in the situation that we are. And it took a great deal of skill</p>
<p> and a great deal of economic and political courage to do it. And I</p>
<p> do want to pay a special tribute to the work that Peter Costello did</p>
<p> in that task as the Federal Treasurer, because unless you have a committed</p>
<p> Federal Treasurer who has the national interest uppermost in his mind,</p>
<p> you will never get long-term economic benefit and long-term economic</p>
<p> results.</p>
<p>So my message to our supporters and our foes alike, is that we were</p>
<p> not re-elected to sit on our laurels. We were re-elected to implement</p>
<p> the promises we took to the Australian people and we were re-elected</p>
<p> to renew our commitment to an even more vigorous reform agenda. There</p>
<p> is never such a thing as there being no further need of economic and</p>
<p> social reform. There is always a need for change and reform </p>
<p> not change in the name of change for its own sake  but change</p>
<p> because society always requires that that what is no longer working,</p>
<p> should be swept away and replaced by something that will work.</p>
<p>And the challenge of economic reform is still very real in this country</p>
<p> and the benefits of economic reform are so apparent at both a national</p>
<p> and a State level. Ask any fair minded Victorian where this State</p>
<p> would be had it not been for the courageous economic and other reforms</p>
<p> of the Kennett government over the last seven years.</p>
<p>And it is because of that courageous reform agenda that of all the</p>
<p> State governments of Australia none is in a stronger economic and</p>
<p> political position, none deservedly enjoy such a high level of public</p>
<p> respect than does the Coalition government here in Victoria, led by</p>
<p> the Premier Jeff Kennett.</p>
<p>We're not only going to implement the things we said we would</p>
<p> do before the election, but we also intend to go further in areas</p>
<p> that we began work on in our first term. We have succeeded in reducing</p>
<p> unemployment. Unemployment now is lower than it has been at any time</p>
<p> since the early 1990s. But it is still too high and it could go lower</p>
<p> if we could make further reforms. It could go lower if we could get</p>
<p> rid of the unfair burden of the unfair dismissal laws on small business.</p>
<p> It could go lower if we could entrench junior wages in the Australian</p>
<p> industrial relations system. We have tried to do that. I mean there</p>
<p> is not a man or woman in this audience who has employed anybody who</p>
<p> doesn't know the simple reality that if you force employers to</p>
<p> pay higher wages for inexperienced, young employees, what they will</p>
<p> do is employ less of them. And you don't need a degree in industrial</p>
<p> relations, you don't need to have anything other than a bit of</p>
<p> experience of life to understand that that is a reality. But while</p>
<p> you have an Opposition overrulingly dominated by former trade union</p>
<p> officials  I mean one of the extraordinary things about the</p>
<p> modern Australian Labor Party is that as the influence of unionism</p>
<p> in the community falls, the influence of trade union officials in</p>
<p> the Labor Party rises. They have more influence now in their parliamentary</p>
<p> party than what I think they had twenty five years ago. At least 25</p>
<p> years ago they had one or two people who occasionally invested some</p>
<p> money.</p>
<p>In all sorts of things.</p>
<p>But ladies and gentlemen, we are determined to do more on the industrial</p>
<p> relations front. We are determined to continue the process of industrial</p>
<p> relations reform begun in the early 1980s by many people who believed</p>
<p> that the old centralised industrialised relations system was no longer</p>
<p> serving the interests of the Australian community.</p>
<p>But it is not only on the economic front that this government has</p>
<p> seized the agenda and has laid out an action agenda for the next two</p>
<p> and a half years.</p>
<p>We are a party which is willing to embrace the social agenda. We are</p>
<p> a party that does not believe that good government is about good economics</p>
<p> alone, important though that is. We are also a government that believes</p>
<p> a modern compassionate society does have to provide a proper social</p>
<p> security safety net and one of the proudest boasts that the Coalition</p>
<p> Government can make is that we have done exactly that.</p>
<p>Contrary to what our critics said three years ago we haven't</p>
<p> reduced the real value of the pension but actually increased it. Contrary</p>
<p> to what our critics said three years ago, we haven't reduced</p>
<p> workers wages, we've increased them. The workers of Australia</p>
<p> now are infinitely better off than they were under Bob Hawke or Paul</p>
<p> Keating. Real wages are higher, interest rates are lower, take home</p>
<p> pay is therefore greater and spending power of the average family</p>
<p> is therefore greater. I mean that is why there is a sense of economic</p>
<p> stability, an economic strength within the Australian community that</p>
<p> we haven't seen for a while.</p>
<p>We are also keen to add value to the existing structures of our society</p>
<p> that look after the less privileged. And last night I had the opportunity</p>
<p> here in Melbourne to outline in more detail our government's</p>
<p> ideas for building what I call a new social coalition in Australia,</p>
<p> where you get the government, the welfare sector, the business community</p>
<p> and the volunteer efforts of individual Australians working together</p>
<p> in an effective coalition to look after the disadvantaged in the most</p>
<p> effective manner.</p>
<p>I have never made any apologies since I've been Prime Minister</p>
<p> in seeking the advice from those who know best about the way to best</p>
<p> assist the less privileged in our community. And much and all as I</p>
<p> respect the work they do you don't get that advice from a bureaucracy.</p>
<p> You get it from those great coalface organisations like the city missions,</p>
<p> and the Salvation Army and the Society of St Vincent de Paul, who</p>
<p> daily deal with these difficulties and understand them in a way that</p>
<p> surpasses any understanding that most others can have. And I deliberately</p>
<p> involve those organisations in providing advice and in helping to</p>
<p> make the decisions that we've made in that area.</p>
<p>And last night I announced a major series of taxation concessions</p>
<p> involving a cost to the revenue of over $50 million a year. It will</p>
<p> provide more incentives for generous benefactors in Australia to give</p>
<p> more to help those in the Australian community who need assistance.</p>
<p> And in making those announcements I acknowledged the fact that there</p>
<p> are at present many Australian companies and many Australian businesses</p>
<p> that have a rich tradition of giving generously and giving unstintingly</p>
<p> to those causes within our community which deserve assistance.</p>
<p>We've also articulated quite unashamedly the principle of mutual</p>
<p> obligation. And that is a principle that says that a compassionate</p>
<p> society should look after those in society who need help, but in return</p>
<p> those who are helped should be willing, in an appropriate way, to</p>
<p> give something back to the community in return. And that is the basis</p>
<p> of our work for the dole approach. And that is the basis of our approach</p>
<p> in a number of other welfare areas. When it was first announced it</p>
<p> was derided, it was attacked as being heartless and insensitive. But</p>
<p> once the Labor Party realised that the majority of the Australian</p>
<p> community understood both the fairness and the decency and the common</p>
<p> sense of such an approach, it began to change its tune.</p>
<p>So ladies and gentlemen, I'm very pleased, indeed proud to report,</p>
<p> six months into our second term that not only have we rapidly begun</p>
<p> to implement the policies we took to the electorate in 1998, but we</p>
<p> have also begun to set a new agenda in a number of important social</p>
<p> areas.</p>
<p>And having reported on that what do we see on the other side of Australian</p>
<p> politics? We see the Australian Labor Party still bereft of policies,</p>
<p> and still bereft of any sense of real political direction. There are</p>
<p> many of us in this room who've had a lot of experience in politics.</p>
<p> We've had experience in both Opposition and in Government. And</p>
<p> it's very instructive to have experience in Opposition, very</p>
<p> instructive indeed. You learn a lot and you don't forget any</p>
<p> of it if you're sensible. And one of the things you learn is</p>
<p> that when you're in Opposition you will never win the respect</p>
<p> of the Australian community or the Victorian community, or indeed</p>
<p> any other community, unless you are prepared to undertake hard policy</p>
<p> work.</p>
<p>Unless the public knows what you believe in and what you stand for</p>
<p> you are never going to become a decent government. And the great problem</p>
<p> with the Opposition in Australia at the present time is that nobody</p>
<p> has the faintest idea of what it stands for other than the desire</p>
<p> to replace the Government.</p>
<p>I have no idea what the Labor Party's long term policy is on</p>
<p> taxation. I don't know whether the Labor Party is going back</p>
<p> to the old pre Hawke/Keating interventionist approach to industry</p>
<p> policy, or whether they're going to return to the Hawke/Keating</p>
<p> approach. I don't know what their policy is on something like,</p>
<p> let's take something like youth wages. Mr Beazley's party</p>
<p> voted against the maintenance of youth wages, yet he said in an interview</p>
<p> in the papers last week, the Melbourne Age nonetheless, he said that</p>
<p> he was really in favour of keeping youth wages. He says he's</p>
<p> in favour of removing the power of the Senate to obstruct legislation.</p>
<p> And yet as Peter Costello says he's running the greatest bit</p>
<p> of Senate interference that we've seen for decades.</p>
<p>The Labor Party unfortunately has lapsed into the greatest mistake</p>
<p> that any Opposition can make and that is opposition for its own sake.</p>
<p> And it doesn't matter whether the Labor Party is dealing with</p>
<p> an issue that the public voted for, or the public voted against, or</p>
<p> that the public has never heard about before, or the public likes</p>
<p> or the public dislikes, they have a simple rule of thumb: if Howard</p>
<p> and the Liberals are for it, we're against it. Now that may make</p>
<p> for easy decision making because you don't have to give it any</p>
<p> thought. You just automatically oppose it. But it doesn't in</p>
<p> the long term build community respect. And I found in my years in</p>
<p> Opposition, and there are a lot of them, and I shared them with quite</p>
<p> a number of people in this hall, and I'm sure Jeff found the</p>
<p> same thing, that if you just automatically oppose what the other crowd</p>
<p> is doing irrespective of its merits, in the end you pay a very heavy</p>
<p> price. And I think the Australian population is growing increasingly</p>
<p> weary of it. And I think the Australian population believes that if</p>
<p> a government has the courage to lay out in painfully explicit detail</p>
<p> how it intends to change the Australian taxation system, take the</p>
<p> political risk of putting that forward as its policy for an election</p>
<p> and wins that election, I think the Australian public deep down think</p>
<p> they ought to be given a fair go and they ought to be able to implement</p>
<p> it.</p>
<p>There are just two other things I'd like to touch on my friends,</p>
<p> and that is to say a few words about the very difficult circumstances</p>
<p> that are unfolding in what was the old Yugoslavia. All of us I know</p>
<p> regret, and feel a sense of a heavy heart, and a sense of disturbance,</p>
<p> when weapons of great destruction are launched against any country.</p>
<p> But as history has told us repeatedly if intransigence, if the brutal</p>
<p> repression of minorities, if a denial of the human rights of minorities</p>
<p> is tolerated indefinitely without reprise and without retaliation,</p>
<p> a much heavier price is paid further down in time.</p>
<p>And the stubborn intransigence of the Milosovic regime in Belgrade,</p>
<p> their unwillingness to reach a negotiated understanding with the Ethnic</p>
<p> Albanians in Kosovo, the appalling human rights record of that regime,</p>
<p> the atrocities that have been practiced upon the people of Kosovo</p>
<p> so vividly displayed on our television screens, have really left the</p>
<p> NATO countries no alternative. And whilst there is no, and it is of</p>
<p> course not at all likely that there will be, involvement of any Australian</p>
<p> military personnel in the NATO action, let me say that that action</p>
<p> does have the understanding and the support of the Australian Government.</p>
<p> We believe that the NATO members have tried hard and long to reach</p>
<p> an accommodation and a fair outcome, and they have been driven to</p>
<p> the use of force and the use of military weaponry through the intransigence</p>
<p> of the Milosovic Government in Belgrade.</p>
<p>The final thing I would like to say because this is the occasion of</p>
<p> your annual meeting, and that is this: that I do appreciate in a very</p>
<p> real sense the support and co-operation that I have received from</p>
<p> the Victorian Division over the last 12 months. I have frequently</p>
<p> said, and I say it again today because it is true, that there is no</p>
<p> more professional, no better organised Liberal Party Division anywhere</p>
<p> in Australia than the Victorian Division. And that has been true for</p>
<p> a long time. It was true when Michael Kroger was your President, It</p>
<p> was true when Ted Baillieu was your president, and it remains true</p>
<p> today with Joy Howley as your President. And the standards set by</p>
<p> the Victorian Division could be well emulated by a number of divisions</p>
<p> in other parts of the country. I don't say that critically, I</p>
<p> say it in praise of the high degree of professionalism that you have</p>
<p> demonstrated at both a State and a Federal level over a long period</p>
<p> of time. You have been great friends, you've been great supporters,</p>
<p> you have been a wonderful part of a great party. We have achieved</p>
<p> an enormous amount, and the years ahead give us an opportunity to</p>
<p> build for future generations a Liberal achievement and a Liberal inheritance</p>
<p> which will make them immensely proud. Thank you.</p>
