PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF DEPARTURE COMMENTS, AMMAN AIRPORT. JORDAN<br />
26' JANUARY 1987--<br />
E &amp; O0E PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: I would-like in the presence of my friend the Prime Minister.<br />
to say these things. Firstly, to thank the Prime Minister and<br />
His Majesty and the Government and the people of Jordan for the<br />
the great warmth of the welcome that they have extended me and<br />
to my party. Secondly, to thank them for the frankness of the<br />
discussions. I couldn't have asked for a more detailed exposition<br />
of the view of the Jordanian Government on the important issues<br />
of the region the Israeli/ Arab dispute bilateral discussions<br />
between our two countries, again they were marked by frankness,<br />
directness and a clear hope that we can increase the already<br />
significant relationship that exists between us. I had the<br />
opportunity of coming to Jordan twice before in 1978 and 1980<br />
and on that occasion formed the impression that this was a country<br />
of people with whom I could feel very close. Having come here<br />
in the capacity of Prime Minister of my country I have had the<br />
opportunity of having those feelings confirmed. I am impressed<br />
-the characteristics of -friendliness, integrity and co-uragewwh ich<br />
which I believe typify the leadership o. F-Wthis country. And certainly<br />
I am convinced that they are totally committed to finding a just<br />
and reasonable and durable solution to the problems of this region.<br />
And I certainly will do whatever I can having listened carefully<br />
to the sorts of things that they have been saying to, in whatever<br />
small way it is, to help advance that cause to peace to which<br />
I know they are so committed. I will certainly leave this country<br />
with the warmest of feelings to His Majesty, the Prime Minister<br />
and the people of Jordan. May I say finally that I hope very<br />
much in the not too distant future His Majesty and the Prime Minister<br />
will be able to accept the invitation that I have extended to<br />
them to visit Australia.<br />
ENDS </p>
