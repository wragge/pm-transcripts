FOR PRESS PM. No. 39/ 1 971<br />
RECONSIDERATION OF AMA FEE INCREASES<br />
Statement-by the Prime Minister, Mr William McMahon<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr William McMahon, with the Minister<br />
for Health, Senator 1. 1. Greenwood, and the Director -General of Healt h,<br />
Sir William Refshauge, today met Dr R. H. Macdonald, the President<br />
of the AMA and Dr E. G. Thomson, the Federal Secretary -General of<br />
the AMA. Dr Macdonald explained the background to the problem of thie<br />
recent '! ecision by the AMA to an across-the-board increase in fees'<br />
and sought to ascertain whether it was now open to the meeting of th<br />
Assembly of 17 April to reconsider its position in the light of the new~<br />
and more complete figures submitted by the Department of Health.,<br />
The Prime Minister said that the Government reaffirmed its<br />
belief that there was no justification for the across-the-board increases<br />
previously submitted and that the existing Government decision still<br />
stood that unless there was agreement between the Government and the<br />
AMA, there should be recourse to arbitration. However, the Prime<br />
Minister said that it was still open for the AM1to reconsider its<br />
recommendations and put them before the Gob'err-Irent.<br />
The Prime Minister suggested that one possibility which the<br />
AMA might explore was a variation of its fee recommendation proposals<br />
announced earlier, so as to limit the increases in common fees to<br />
general practitioner surgery consultations and home visits as from<br />
1 July 1971, leaving unaltered for the time being the present common<br />
fees for all other services such as radiology, pathology, anaesthesia,<br />
operations and specialist consultations. These would be considered<br />
later in light of all new information available.<br />
Should the AMA wish to advance any further proposals, they<br />
could be submitted to the Minister for Health to explore in detail with<br />
the AMA.<br />
