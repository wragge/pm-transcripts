    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia's success in reducing access to firearms is a far reaching achievement in producing a safer society.</p>
<p>A study released today says that the total number of gun deaths fell from 521 in 1996 to 289 in 2003.</p>
<p> The study by Professors Simon Chapman and Philip Alpers and colleagues from the School of Public Health at the University of Sydney has found that the Government's 1996 gun law reforms were followed by more than a decade free of fatal mass shootings.</p>
<p>The authors of the study concluded that removing large numbers of firearms from the community was associated with a sudden and on-going decline in mass shootings and also contributed to accelerated declines in total firearm related deaths.</p>
<p> In other words, the Government's gun buyback scheme and quick response to the Port Arthur massacre has been successful.</p>
<p>The authors of the study have stated that this was a milestone public health and safety issue, driven by an overwhelming swing in public opinion and promptly delivered by governments.</p>
<p>  The decision taken by this Government, supported by the state and territory governments, to remove around 700,000 weapons from Australia has brought about a safer community for all Australians..</p>
<p>  I congratulate the authors of the study on their work.  Gun related deaths in Australia are still too high but this study shows that governments and the community can make a difference.  </p>
