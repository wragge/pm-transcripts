VICTORIAI FARIERS UNION I<br />
Spepch ro~-tvc ( 7Y I / P,<br />
IN SEVEN WEEKS' TIME WE SHALL BRING DOWN MY GOVERNMENT'S<br />
THIRD BUDGET. CLEARLY IT MUST BE REGARDED AS ONE<br />
OF THE MOST CRUCIAL BUDGETS OF MODERi TIMES, FRAMED<br />
AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF EXTRAORDINARY COMPLEXITY AT<br />
HOME AND ABROAD, LET ME ACKNOWLEDGE AT THE OUTSET<br />
THE GOVERNMENT'S RECOGNITION OF THE HIGH STAKES THAT<br />
AUSTRALIAN AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY HA\ E, NOT JUST IN<br />
THE BUDGET ITSELF, BUT IN THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WHICH<br />
IT PARTLY CREATES. I SAY " PARTLY" BECAUSE IT SHOULD<br />
BE RECOGNISED THAT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT POLICIES,<br />
MUCH LESS A SINGLE BUDGET, ARE NOT THE SOLE DETERMINING<br />
FACTOR IN THE NATION'S ECONOMY.<br />
THERE ARE FEW NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS WHOSE ECONOMIC POWERS<br />
ARE MORE CIRCUMSCRIBED BY THE CONSTITUTION, BY THE<br />
FEDERAL SYSTEM, BY THE NATURE OF THE ECONOMICS SYSTEM<br />
OF A MIXED ECONOMY. AND BY INTERNATIONAL CONDITIONS<br />
RESULTING FROM OUR POSITION AS ONE OF THE GREAT TRADING<br />
NATIONS. I SAY THIS ONLY TO PUT MATTERS IN PERSPECTIVE,<br />
NOT BY ANY MEANS TO DOWNGRADE OUR PRIMARY AND INESCAPABLE<br />
RESPONSIBILITY AS THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT.<br />
6~ </p>
<p>WHILE ACKNOWLEGING YOUR SPECIAL INTEREST IN THE BUDGET,<br />
YOU WILL UNDERSTAND HOWEVER THE CONSIDERABLE RESTRAINT<br />
I AM UNDER AT A STAGE WHEN WE ARE STILL HAVING THE<br />
PRELIMINARY DISCUSSIONS WITH INDUSTRY AND WHEN<br />
THE CABINET DISCUSSIONS ARE ABOUT TO BEGIN.<br />
THE SPECIAL INTEREST FARMERS NATURALLY HAVE IN THE<br />
BUDGET AND ITS OUTCOME SPRINGS FROM TWO SOURCES, ONE<br />
PARTICULAR,. ONE GENERAL. FIRST THERE IS THE<br />
SPECIFIC BUDGETARY MATTER OF GOVERNMENT OUTLAYS TO AND<br />
RECEIPTS FROM AGRICULTURE. THESE ARE A VERY GREAT<br />
AND GROWING FACTOR IN THE BUDGET NOW GREAT ENOUGH<br />
TO BE A VERY SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THE OVERALL STRATEGY<br />
OF THE BUDGET ITSELF.<br />
BUDGET OUTLAYS FOR ALL AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY WERE<br />
$ 329 MILLION IN 1972/ 73, $ 303 MILLION IN 1973/ 74<br />
AND AN ESTIMATED $ 727 MILLION IN 1974/ 75 AN INCREASE<br />
ON 1973/ 74 OF $ 424 MILLION. RECEIPTS IN THE SAME YEARS<br />
WERE $ 45.6 MILLION, $ 82 MILLION AND $ 178 MILLION.<br />
SO NET GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE WAS $ 283 MILLION IN 1972/ 73,<br />
$ 221 MILLION IN 1973/ 74, AND $ 548 MILLION ESTIMATED IN<br />
1974/ 75. THAT IS, AN INCREASE OF $ 327 MILLION IN 1974/ 75<br />
OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR. </p>
<p>THE BIG INCREASE IN OUTLAYS CAME OF COURSE THROUGH<br />
woo/<br />
LOANS TO THE AUSTRALIAN taft CORPORATION TO OPERATE<br />
THE FLOOR PRICE PLAN. IT'S NOT MY INTENTION IN<br />
GIVING THESE FIGURES TO SUGGEST THAT FARMERS ARE THE<br />
* RECIPIENTS OF HUGE AMOUNTS OF GOVERN4MENT LARGESSE,<br />
YOUR PRESIDENT, iR HEFFERNAN, RECENTLY EXPRESSED CONCERN<br />
THAT THE AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC WAS BEING MISLED INTO<br />
BELIEVIN'G THAT PRIMARY INDUSTRY WAS RECEIVING MASSIVE<br />
HANDOUTS AT THE TAXPAYERS IEXPENSE AND HE RIGHTLY SAID<br />
THAT IN THIS REGARD, THE DISTINCTION SHOULD BE MADE<br />
BETWEEN LOANS AND DIRECT SUBSIDIES. THE POINT I WISH<br />
TO MAKE HOWEVER, IS THAT IN A BUDGET CONTEXT, THE<br />
OUTLAYS AND RECEIPTS ARE OF A MAGNITUDE TO BE A<br />
SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN OVERALL PLANNING.<br />
iHE SECOND, MORE GENERAL INTEREST TO FARMERS, LIES AT<br />
THE VERY HEART OF THE NATURE OF OUR CURRENT ECONOMIC<br />
PROBLEMS. WE ARE ALL DAMAGED BY INFLATION NONE MORE<br />
THAN FARMERS. AND OF COURSE THE INTER-REACTION BETWEEN<br />
COSTS AND PRICES IS MOST ACUTE IN THE CASE OF FARM<br />
PROiJUCI'S PARTICULARLY PRICES FOR FOOD.<br />
IN THE PAST EIGHTEEN MON'THS THE rI: AJOR ECONOMIES OF THE<br />
WOtkLD SEVERELY AFFECT11) BY 14W. OIL P'RICE RISE AND THE<br />
DESTA31LISIN1G L! FFECTS OF THAT ON WORLD TRADE HAV/ E BFEN<br />
STRUGGLING WITH. THE TWIN PROBLEMS OF RISING UNEMPLOYMENT<br />
AND RISING INFLATION. AUSTRALIA HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO<br />
INSULATE ITSELF FROM THAT WORLD SITUATIONS </p>
<p>BUT IN AUSTRALIA AS IN OTHER COUNTRIES THE BATTLE IS<br />
NOW ON TO RESTORE A MORE BALANCED ECONOMIC ORDER.<br />
WE ARE SEEING ECONOMIC GROWTH BEGINNING AGAIN.<br />
THE RISE IN UNEMPLOYMENT SEEMS TO HAVE COME TO AN END<br />
AND 1975/ 76 PROMISES TO SEE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES<br />
ON THE INCREASE AGAIN. BUT INFLATION REMAINS DEEP-SEATED.<br />
FIRM AND RESPONSIBLE POLICIES WILL HAVE TO BE FOLLOWED<br />
IF IT IS TO BE BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL.<br />
SOME OF THE UNCERTAINTIES THAT SURROUNDED THE OUTLOOK<br />
FOR INFLATION EARLIER THIS YEAR HAVE BEEN CLEARED BY THE<br />
DECISIONS OF THE CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION COMMISSION<br />
IN THE NATIONAL WAGE AND METAL INDUSTRIES CASES.<br />
THOSE WERE RESPONSIBLE DECISIONS, GOVERNMENTS MUST ALSO<br />
DO ALL THEY CAN TO CREATE AN ECONOMIC CLIMATE IN WHICH<br />
THE SUGGESTED WAGE DETERMINATION GUIDELINES HAVE THE<br />
PROSPECT OF BEING ADHERED TO.<br />
WE AIM TO ENSURE THAT THE RECOVERY IN THE ECONOMY<br />
STRENGTHENS AND CONTINUES BUT DOES NOT REACH A PACE THAT<br />
ONCE AGAIN LEADS TO A SCRAMBLE FOR RESOURCES.<br />
AN ORDERLY RECOVERY WILL HELP ACHIEVE A CLIMATE CONDUCIVE<br />
TO THE EXPANSION OF INVESTMENT THAT IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE<br />
CONTINUED PROSPERITY AND GROWTH OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES,<br />
ONE THING IS CLEAR THEE HAS * i OI L. E ABATcET THE<br />
RATE OF INCREASE ? iJ GOV! ER:. T sPENDING IF WE ARE TO GET OULi<br />
OF OUR PRESENT TROUBLES.<br />
r P 2 </p>
<p>BUT IT IS A GROSS OVERSIMPLIFICATION TO IMAGINE THAT<br />
THE WHOLE SOLUTION TO THOSE TROUBLES LIES IN THAT<br />
ONE AREA ALONE. GOVERNMENT SPENDING IS JUST ONE<br />
OF THE THREE MAJOR INTERNAL FACTORS DETERMINING THE<br />
PRESSURE ON RESOURCES AND INFLATION WHICH MAY RESULT<br />
FROM IT. THE OTHER FACTORS ARE INCOMES AND CREDIT<br />
WHICH ARE NOT DIRECTLY DETERMINED BY THE BUDGET.<br />
IN THE BUDGET WE WILL BE STRIVING TO CREATE THE<br />
CONDITIONS WHERE THE WAGE INDEXATION PROPOSALS CAN<br />
HAVE A CHANCE TO WORK<br />
IN PREVIOUS ADDRESSES TO FARM ORGANISATIONS I HAVE<br />
ALWAYS STRESSED THE INTERDEPENDENCE BETWEEN THE RURAL<br />
SECTOR AND THE REST OF THE ECONOMY. I HAVE NEVER<br />
ACCEPTED THE FALSE DIVISION BETWEEN COUNTRY AND CITY.<br />
IT IS A FALSE DISTINCTION ECONOMICALLY, SOCIALLY AND<br />
POLITICALLY. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A TIME WHEN THE<br />
INTERDEPENDENCE WAS MADE MORE MANIFEST BY THE INTER-REACTION<br />
OF ONE SECTION OF THE ECONOMY ON ANOTHER, WHEN THE<br />
PROBLEMS OF ONE SECTION AFFECTED THE PROBLEMS OF EVERY<br />
OTHER SO CLOSELY AND QUICKLY. WE ARE ALL AFFECTED BY<br />
OUR DEPENDENCE ON EACH OTHER AND WE ARE ALL AFFECTED BY<br />
OUR INTERDEPENDENCE WITH OUR TRADING PARTNERS.<br />
INFLATION DEMONSTRATES THIS VERY CLEARLY, OFTEN VERY<br />
IHAkSHLY. v. I.<br />

<p>WE HAVE SEEN HOW EASY IT IS FOR EMPLOYEES TO PRICE<br />
THEMSELVES OR THEIR FELLOWS OUT OF A JOB EQUALLY,<br />
IT IS VERY EASY TO PRICE OURSELVES OUT OF MARKETS,<br />
PARTICULARLY FOR A GREAT TRADING NATION LIKE AUSTRALIA<br />
AND PRIMARY PRODUCTION STILL ACCOUNTS FOR THE<br />
MAJOR PART OF OUR EXPORTS IN4FLATION IS THE COMMON<br />
ENEMY WHATEVER SECTOR OF THE ECONO0MY 1~__ WE ARE<br />
A<br />
INVOLVED.<br />
ONE OF THE MOST CONSIDERABLE PROBLEMS OF COMMUNICATION<br />
AT THE POLITICAL LEVEL IS TO GET ACROSS THE CONSEQUENCES<br />
OF OUR ROLE AS A TRADING NATION, ON THE SURFACE IT<br />
SEEMS SIMPLE ENOUGH. IT IS EASY ENOUGH TO SAY<br />
" AUSTRALIA IS ONE OF THE WIORLD'S GREAT TRADIN4G NATIONS".<br />
THE PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONJS ARE NOT SO EASILY, GRASPED OR<br />
APPRECIATED. THERE ARE VERY VOCAL ELEME14TS IN THE<br />
COMMUNITY WHO WOULD PRESSURE OOVERNMENTS VIRTUALLY TO<br />
CUT OFF ALL IMPORTS, OR AT LEAST THOSE IMPORTS WHICH<br />
AFFECT THEIR INDUSTRY. LESS BLATANTLY, IT TAKES THE<br />
FORM OF DEMANDS FOR ALL SORTS OF TARIFFS AND QUOTAS<br />
AND RESTRICTIONS, BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK BEYOND THE DEMANDS<br />
OF ANY PARTICULAR INDUSTRY TO THE EFFECT OF A DECISION<br />
ON THE ECONOMY A WHOLE AND IN PARTICULAR OF OUR OVERALL<br />
POSITION AS A TRAD) ING NATION. </p>
<p>THE BASIS OF UNLIMITED PRODU. CTIOi.. O INDUSTRY CAN<br />
THOSEP EOPLE WHO WANT UI N ASU STRALIA TO CUT OFF IMPORTSNMENT<br />
HAS CAUSTRALIA SHOULD REMEMBER THAT WHEN WE DOCTUHET SF ACT<br />
AND TO THE EXTENT WE DO IT WAE GSRPEOAITL THE CASE WE CAN<br />
PRESENT TO COUNTRIES WHICH CUT OFF IMPORTS FROM AUSTRALIA.<br />
THIS BIS VERY RELEVANT TO PRIMARY INDUSTRY. 0 INDUSTRY CAN<br />
ASSUME IT HAS A RIGHT TO SURVIVE, NOBEEN MORE DIFFICULT<br />
INFFOR ME TO ARGUE FORCEFULLY WITH THE COUTRIES MOAFT ESTERN<br />
HOW COSTLY, SIMPLY BECAUSE IT EXISTS.<br />
THOSE PEOPL WHO EW ANT US IN ABOUT THE STLOA SCHUINTG OFF IMPORTS<br />
TBEE IMPORTS FROM AUSTRALIA, BECAUSE WE IN AUSTRALIA<br />
HAVE HAD THEE XTENT WE IM PFORROTMS THOSE COUNTRIES. CAINWE<br />

INDUSTRY, IF TRADE OVER-ACEFULL STAGNATES OR DIES OF ESTERN<br />
EUROPE OR JAPAN OR AMERICA ABOUT THE SLASHING OF THEIR<br />
BEEF IMPORTS FROM AUSTRALIA, BECAUSE WE IN AUSTRALIA<br />
HAVE HAD TO REDUCE IMPORTS FROM THOSE COUNTRIES, IF<br />
WE CUT OFF IMPORTS AND IF OTHER COUNTRIES CUT OFF OUR EXPORTS,<br />
EVERY ONE OF US IS POORER, WHETHER WE LIVE IN CITIES OR<br />
IN THE COUNTRY. INI0 REGION CAN LIVE ON ANY PARTICULAR<br />
INDUSTRY, IF TRADE OVER-ALL STAGNATES OR DIES. </p>
<p>' o<br />
IN PURSUIT OF THE FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTIVE OF TRADE<br />
PROMOTION;, MY GOVERNMENT HAS MADE MORE TRADE TREATIES<br />
WITH OTHER COUNTRIES THAN ANY PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT.<br />
WE HAVE RE-NEGOTIATED MANY OF THOSE WHICH EXISTED.<br />
WE HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY ACTIVE IN OUR OWN REGION$<br />
FOR IT IS CLEAR THAT INDUSTRIES WHICH USED TO DEPEND<br />
SOLELY ON THE MARKETS OF WESTERN EUROPE AND BRITAIN,<br />
HAVE NOT AS GOOD A FUTURE AS THOSE INDUSTRIES<br />
WHICH HAVE PROSPECTS IN THE MARKET IN OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD. </p>
<p>IN THE C. O. N EXT OF THES~ E GENEIRAL REMARK(<br />
INOW ADDRESS MYSELF TO SOME QUESTIONS WHICH<br />
YOUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ' IR FORSTER, HAS<br />
INDICATED YOU WOULD LIK'E ME TO ANSWER.<br />
I MUST SAY( THE QUESTION4S TEJD TO BE SHORT ON<br />
SPECIFICS AND LON~ G 0: 1 ARGUMENT SO0 YOU W1LL<br />
FORGIVE ME IF I TEND TO RESPOND IN KIND. </p>
<p>" QUESTION: As IT IS LIKELY THAT THE SECOND ALLOCATION OF<br />
CARRY-ON FINANCE FROM THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT FOR THE<br />
BEEF INDUSTRY WILL BE INSUFFICIENT TO MEET THE DEMAND<br />
FROM ELIGIBLE PRODUCERS, WOULD THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
CONSIDER MAKING THE BALANCE OF THE ORIGINAL ALLOCATION<br />
AVAILABLE AT THE CONCESSIONAL INTEREST RATE OF 4% o AND<br />
ADJUST THE LOANS OF THOSE PRODUCERS WHO HAVE ALREADY<br />
BORROWED AT 11.5%?<br />
THERE HAVE BEEN TWO SCHEMES ANNOUNCED BY THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT FOR THE PROVISION OF CARRY ON FINANCE FOR<br />
BEEF PRODUCERS. THE FIRST SCHEME, ANNOUNCED LATE LAST YEAR,<br />
INVOLVED AN ALLOCATION OF $ 20 MILLION FOR LOANS THROUGH<br />
THE COMMONWEALTH DEVELOPMENT BANK AT COMMERCIAL RATES<br />
OF INTEREST THEN 11., BUT LATER CUT TO 11% IN LINE<br />
WITH A GENERAL REDUCTION IN BANK RATES. AT THAT TIME<br />
THE GOVERNMENT WAS RESPONDING TO A REQUEST BY THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN I'IATIONAL CATTLEMEN'S COUNCIL FOR SPECIAL FUNDS<br />
AT COMMERCIAL RATES. THE COUNCIL DID NOT SEEK CONCESSIONAL<br />
INTEREST RATES. I UNDERSTAND THAT AT LEAST $ 13 MILLION<br />
OF THE $ 20 MILLION ALLOCATION HAS BEEN LENT ALREADY AT<br />
COMMERCIAL RATES OF INTEREST. , A2 </p>
<p>fl~<br />
ON APRIL 23 THIS YEAR, SENATOR I'RIEDT ANNOUNCED THAT<br />
THE GOVERNMENT WOULD MATCH A $ 19.6 MILLION OFFER BY THE<br />
STATES FOR CARRY-ON FINANCE FOR BEEF PRODUCERS.<br />
LOANS ARE AT 11 WITH NO INTEREST OR CAPITAL REPAYMENTS<br />
IN THE FIRST 12 MONTHS. IT IS STILL TOO EARLY<br />
TO. KNOW IF IT WILL BE SUFFICIENT. IUCH WILL DEPEND<br />
ON THE BEEF MARKET AND HOW QUICKLY IT RECOVERS.<br />
THE MOST HOPEFUL SIGN IS LAST WEEK S ANNOUNCEMENT BY<br />
JAPAN THAT IT IS RE-OPENING ITS MARKET FOR AUSTRALIAN<br />
BEEF. FURTHER, AS AT 31 SARCTHH, E AUSTRALIAN HERD<br />
IS SMALLER BY ABOUT 1 MILLION HEAD. THAN HAD BEEN EXPECTED<br />
ON THE BASIS OF PAST GROWTH.<br />
ON APRIL 23 '. RIEDT SAID THAT THE PROGRESS OF THE SCHEME<br />
WOULD BE REVIEWED AT THE END OF THREE MONTHS.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONSIDER THE RESULTS OF THAT REVIEW<br />
AND ANY REQUESTS FOR CHANGES IN THE SCHEME OR<br />
ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT MAY EMERGE. </p>
<p>QUESTION: DOES THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WISH THE DAIRY FARMERS<br />
OF AUSTRALIA TO PRODUCE FOR THE EXPORT MARKET AT THE<br />
SAME TIME ENSURING BY SUCH PRODUCTION THAT THERE WILL BE<br />
SUFFICIENT SUPPLIES OF DAIRY PRODUCTS PRODUCED IN<br />
AUSTRALIA TO MEET AUSTRALIA'S DOMESTIC NEEDS?<br />
IF SO, WILL THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT PAY A BOUNTY ON<br />
ALL EXPORTS OF DAIRY PRODUCTS EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE<br />
BETWEEN THE ACTUAL EXPORT PRICE AND AN UNDERWRITTEN<br />
PRICE WHICH WOULD APPROXIMATE THE HOME PRICE NOW<br />
BEING FIXED BY THE PRICES JUSTIFICATION TRIBUNAL?<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S WISH IS THAT AGRICULTURAL<br />
PRODUCTION, INCLUDING DAIRYING, BE GEARED TO MARKET DEMANDS,<br />
IT DOES NOT MAKE COMMERCIAL GOOD SENSE TO PRODUCE WITHOUT<br />
REGARD TO MARKET TRENDS AND PRICES. ' IE WANT OUR POLICIES<br />
TO BE FAIR TO PRODUCERS, CONSUIMERS AND TAXPAYERS.<br />
BOUNTY PAYMENTS CAN ONLY BE PROVIDED BY TAXPAYERS INCLUDING<br />
THOSE WHO, AS CONSUMERS, ALREADY PROVIDE FOR SOME<br />
PRODUCTS HIGHER DOMESTIC PRICES THAN ARE AVAILABLE OVERSEAS,<br />
EXPERIENCE HAS SHOW: I THAT BOUNTY PAYMENTS RELATED TO<br />
PRODUCTION LEAD TO PROBLEMS OF DISPOSAL ON WORLD MARKETS<br />
AT UNECONOMIC PRICES. A BOUNTY ON EXPORTS WOULD HAVE<br />
A SIMILAR EFFECT IF THERE IS NO INCENTIVE TO RELATE<br />
PRODUCTION TO AVAILABLE ECONOMIC IMARKETS THE REAL<br />
OBJECTIVE THW IINDUSTRY SdOULD SET FOR ITSELF, Ig uaI<br />
CI~-C-r 4-</p>
<p>OWING TO THE ENORMOUS. AND CONTINUING INCREASE IN THE COST<br />
OF TRANSPORT, SUPERPHOSPHATE AND OTHER FARM REQUIREMEjNTS<br />
NARROWING THE GAP BETW.-EEJ. FARN COSTS AND INCOME, CAN<br />
YOU GIVE FARMERS ANY INSURANCE AT ALL OR EVEN HOPETHAT<br />
THEIR INVESTMENTS IN PRODUCTION WILL YIELD A RETURN?<br />
FARMING IS3 A BUSINESS AI1D PREDOMINANTLY IT IS UP TO<br />
THE FARMER TO ESTIMATE WHETHER A DECISIONJ TO PRODUCE<br />
A CERTAIN COMHODITY WI1LL YI'ELD A RETURNE i N T<br />
THE 6OVERNMENT HAS SUPPORTED THE RECONSTRUCTION SCHEME<br />
AIND IHAS INTRODUCED SPECIAL INDUSTRY SCHEMES TO HELP<br />
IN THE PROCESS. IT' S NOT POSSIB3LE OR DESIRABLE FOR ANY<br />
oOVER~ IIHEN'T TO GUARAI T'LE A RETURN IF THIS FLIES IiN THE<br />
FACE OF MARKET FORCES. IN SO FAR AS PEOPLE MUST EAT<br />
AND BE CLOTHED THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A RETURN ON INVESTME11T<br />
IN AN EFFICIENT AND SELF RELIA* JT AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY.<br />
