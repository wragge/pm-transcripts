FOR PRESS 10 APRIL 1978<br />
ALFALFA APHID CONTROL<br />
The Government has decided to make $ 450,000 available to the<br />
South Australian Government over the next three years for its<br />
blue and spotted lucerne aphid control and research program.<br />
This includes $ 185,000 in aid this financial year.<br />
The assistance was recommended by the Australian Agricultural<br />
Council at its last meeting when it discussed the serious<br />
nature of the threat posed by the aphids to our lucerne and<br />
medic pastures.<br />
The Commonwealth is also contributing to the overall program<br />
of research and development of control measures through the<br />
provision of funds to the CSIRO. The CSIRO is working on<br />
control through plant breeding of resistant varieties of<br />
lucerne and by the introduction and distribution of<br />
parasites which are hosted by the lucerne. </p>
