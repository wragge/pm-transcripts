    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Turnbull Government will protect thousands of jobs, improve water quality, tackle coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish and implement scientific reef restoration on the Great Barrier Reef.</p>
<p>The Reef is a critical national asset providing $6.4 billion a year to the Queensland and Australian economies.</p>
<p>The Turnbull Government will invest more than $500 million - the largest ever single investment - to protect the reef, secure its viability and the 64,000 jobs that rely on the Reef.</p>
<p>The Turnbull Government will partner with the Great Barrier Reef Foundation through a ground-breaking $444 million agreement to tackle crown-of-thorns starfish, reduce pollution into the Reef and mitigate the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>We want to ensure the Reef’s future for the benefit of all Australians, particularly those whose livelihood depends on the Reef.</p>
<p>The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority the Department of the Environment and Energy will also be boosted with $56 million to expand environmental management and compliance operations on the Reef and to support this significant additional investment in the Reef.</p>
<p>The Authority’s future funding has also been secured with an additional $10 million each year from 2022-23 to continue and expand essential work across the World Heritage Area.</p>
<p>The investment, made in this International Year of the Reef, will also go towards inspiring Australians, philanthropists and companies to co-invest in a united effort to protect the Reef, the planet’s greatest living wonder.</p>
<p>It is an investment not only in the future of the Great Barrier Reef, but also in Australian jobs and our economy through the tourists the Reef attracts every year.</p>
<p>Like reefs all over the world, the Great Barrier Reef is under pressure. A big challenge demands a big investment – and this investment gives our Reef the best chance.</p>
<p>It builds on and directly supports the intensive work already underway through the joint $2 billion Australian and Queensland Governments’ Reef 2050 Plan.</p>
<p>Our reef restoration science and expertise will be shared internationally to help with reef protection around the world, particularly with our Pacific neighbours.</p>
<p>As a highly respected philanthropic organisation, the Great Barrier Reef Foundation has a strong fundraising track record, and will seek corporate contributions to further enhance this work.</p>
<p>This Great Barrier Reef Foundation partnership includes:</p>
<ul><li>$201 million further improving water quality with changed farming practices such as reduced fertiliser use, and adopting new technologies and land management practices.</li>
<li>$100 million harnessing the best science to implement reef restoration and funding science that supports Reef resilience and adaptation.</li>
<li>$58 million expanding the fight against the coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish.</li>
<li>$45 million supporting other work, particularly increasing community engagement such as Indigenous traditional knowledge for sea country management, coastal clean-up days and awareness raising activities.</li>
<li>$40 million enhancing Reef health monitoring and reporting to track progress and inform better management.</li>
</ul><p>This unprecedented investment reinforces the environmental, economic, social and cultural importance of the Great Barrier Reef, and that there is a role for everyone in protecting it for generations to come.</p>
