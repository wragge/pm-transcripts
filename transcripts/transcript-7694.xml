Asfe<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 2 AUGUST 1989<br />
I have sent the following message to Allan Border:<br />
Congratulations on your historic Ashes victory. The<br />
1989 side has performed magnificently as individuals, as<br />
a team and as representatives of Australia.<br />
Your own leadership has been superb. I know of no<br />
Australian sportsman who has fought more courageously<br />
for his country or more richly deserved this ultimate<br />
achievement for an Australian Test captain.<br />
Bob Hawke </p>
