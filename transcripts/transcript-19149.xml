    <content><![CDATA[<p>Federation Mall, Canberra</p>
<p>Today we gather to celebrate this city ordained by our Constitution to be the heart of our nation's democracy.</p>
<p>At a time when Britain was still Home, the ‘federal generation' was astute enough to give this place an Aboriginal name,a wise and evocative choice.</p>
<p>Though “Canberra” has several meanings, the one we settle upon is “meeting place”  -  as if the meeting place of the new Australia could only recognise and rest upon the old.</p>
<p>So it was on this hill one hundred years ago that Lady Denman drew a card from her gold cigarette case and named this city “Canberra”, the world's newest capital on the world's oldest continent.</p>
<p>The naming of Canberra completed a remarkable quartet of events: the idea, the site, the plan, the name.</p>
<p>The idea owed its debt to Washington DC  -  and so this is a day to honour our abiding friendship with the United States.</p>
<p>Like its elder sister, Canberra was a neat solution to a federal dilemma, placing the capital outside any one state and thus belonging to every state.</p>
<p>The site was chosen in a process that was complex, yet the result was sublime.</p>
<p>Nestled within a bowl of hills.</p>
<p>The Brindabellas majestic in the west.</p>
<p>The Molonglo valley forming a natural amphitheatre for the great institutions to come.</p>
<p>And the plan  -  this was a work of rare and timely genius.</p>
<p>Walter Burley Griffin perhaps saw us better than we saw ourselves, seeing this landscape with fresh and open eyes from half a world away.</p>
<p>His vision was superbly realised by his partner in life and work, Marion Mahony Griffin, whose drawings form a national treasure in their own right.</p>
<p>It was a plan created by two Americans and yet so distinctively Australian.</p>
<p>A plan that honoured and embossed this landscape, embracing its contours, working along its ancient grain.</p>
<p>But friends, the process of selecting and naming this city was only a beginning.</p>
<p>From the start of Canberra's construction to the opening of new Parliament House took three-quarters of a century.</p>
<p>At every stage, it was the work of human hands.</p>
<p>Hands that graded the roads and laid the bricks and planted the trees.</p>
<p>We honour also those who now govern this city and tend it.</p>
<p>We honour those who give their best to our national institutions and to the ideal of an impartial public service.</p>
<p>And we honour those who have come here through the years to make a life in Canberra's suburbs and in the hamlets beyond.</p>
<p>So for the nation, Canberra is our enduring capital.</p>
<p>For the world, it is a model of urban design.</p>
<p>And for locals, it is simply our much-loved home.</p>
<p>Canberra is all these things.</p>
<p>A city whose promise was a long time in gestation and which, at its hundredth birthday, has finally attained a mature grace.</p>
<p>Yet it is a capital whose history has barely begun.</p>
<p>Because today we do more than mark the centenary of Canberra's founding.</p>
<p>Today we mark the beginning of Canberra's second century, and so dedicate ourselves to all the future achievements of city and nation.</p>
<p>Across these ten decades, we have made here a fine and decent city  -  a city invested with a certain grandeur.</p>
<p>A city that has become a place of learning and culture  -  the memory-house of a new nation slowly growing old.</p>
<p>A city that is “a focal point for national pride and sentiment”.</p>
<p>A capital which truly merits our affection and esteem.</p>
