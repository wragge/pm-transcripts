COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt. Hon. HAROLD HOLT, M. P.,<br />
ON<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S VISIT TO ASIA<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
.[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 12 April 1967]<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT ( Higgins-Prime<br />
Minister)-by leave-Mr Speaker, this Australia<br />
of ours is a vast island continent<br />
inhabited largely by people of British or<br />
other European stock and with a heritage<br />
of national freedom, personal liberty and<br />
the institutions of a British parliamentary<br />
democracy. But geographically we are part<br />
of Asia, and increasingly we have become<br />
aware of our involvement in the affairs of<br />
Asia. Our greatest dangers and our highest<br />
hopes are centred in Asia's tomorrows.<br />
Already one Asian country has become<br />
established as the largest purchaser, in terms<br />
of money value, of Australian exports. The<br />
only military operations in which we are<br />
-now engaged or in which we have been<br />
engaged since the Second World War are<br />
located in Asia.<br />
It is a basic tenet of our national policy<br />
to live in friendship and understanding with<br />
our Asian neighbours, but the very word<br />
' Asia', while a convenient general description,<br />
is itself misleading. There are greater<br />
diversities of race, religion, tradition,<br />
appearance and national economic development<br />
to be found in Asia than in any other<br />
region on earth. These differences establish<br />
the importance of better knowledge of those<br />
amongst whom we live and the value of<br />
our friendship with them.<br />
5037/ 67 It was with these thoughts in mind that<br />
I set out recently to see at first hand more<br />
of the friendly nations I had not visited<br />
before, to meet their leaders and their<br />
people, to . remind them where Australia<br />
stood in her friendships and to learn<br />
something of their own attitudes. I visited,<br />
in that order, Cambodia, Laos, Taiwan and<br />
South Korea in the course of a thirteen<br />
days tour. The circumstances of -travel<br />
enabled me to have useful talks also in<br />
Singhpore, Hong Kong and Manila, and at<br />
a fuelling stop-over in Okinawa, an island<br />
of strategic importance in the Second World<br />
War, I was able to see the considerable<br />
defence base which is still maintained there.<br />
I returned heartened by the reception which<br />
1 and my official party received. I was<br />
greatly encouraged by the warmi and kindly<br />
spirit in which Australia has been accepted<br />
as a good neighbour and a good frienid.<br />
Our place in Asia is no new discovery,<br />
but its significance has become ' heightened<br />
for us over recent years. The nations which<br />
I visited are ancient lands with rich and<br />
colourful histories. Some of them trace their<br />
histories back 4,000 to 5,000 years. For<br />
some time I have felt that great benefits<br />
were to ' be won by a ' more personal<br />
demonstration of our nearness and our<br />
interest. In recent months my colleague, the </p>
<p>Minister for External Affairs ( Mr Hasluck),<br />
has visited -the same countries. In -the last<br />
two years joint parliamentary delegations<br />
also have travelled to them. The sum of our<br />
knowledge as a people is growing and is<br />
assisted by the reporting in the Australian<br />
Press and on radio and television around<br />
visits such as that which I have just accomplished.<br />
So is our knowledge as members<br />
of this Parliament. My own visit was part<br />
of the pattern we are developing and as<br />
head of the Australian Government I sought<br />
to underline the warm and genuine interest<br />
we have in the security, progress and prosperity<br />
of the countries of the Asian and<br />
Pacific area.<br />
It was, incidentally, the first visit of an<br />
Australian Prime Minister to each of these<br />
four countries and my third journey as<br />
Prime Minister to the area. I hope that<br />
there can be two-way traffic in personal<br />
exchanges, and my Government will welcome<br />
visits to Australia, as opportunity<br />
offers, of leading public personalities from<br />
these and other countries of the region. Our<br />
interest in Asia is deep. It must be developed<br />
and it must be permanent, for my Governmrent<br />
and I believe that Asia is now the<br />
crucial area of the struggle to preserve the<br />
values of independence, liberty and social<br />
justice for which we have previously fought<br />
in two global wars. I believe also that it<br />
offers bright prospects, if peace can be<br />
secured and maintained, for spectacular<br />
economic progress.<br />
. I believe that for all the shift and change<br />
in the world, none is more important to<br />
us in Australia than the shift of international<br />
tensions from Europe to Asia. We<br />
have to be active on several fronts-on<br />
the armed frontiers where we stand in support<br />
of a small country and with a great<br />
ally and other friendly forces against<br />
aggression; on the frontiers of progress to<br />
a better life for the emerging nations of<br />
Asia; and on the frontiers of our culture<br />
and theirs-for it is by these things, too,<br />
that we know each other better and learn,<br />
as different people with diverse interests,<br />
to live peacefully together.<br />
There is, of course, a continuing preoccupation<br />
with the course of the war in<br />
Vietnam. This was a central point in most<br />
of the talks I had with the statesmen of<br />
these Asian nations. My first person-toperson<br />
talks were in neutral Cambodia with Prince Sihanouk, leader of 61 million<br />
people, whose country is bordered by<br />
Thailand, Vietnam and Laos. The long<br />
history of the nations of Indo-China has<br />
been beset with difficulties. This helps us,<br />
I think, to understand Cambodia's determined<br />
neutrality. There has been the long<br />
struggle to preserve the Khmer race with<br />
its own traditions and cultures. The North<br />
Vietnamese and the Vietcong at times<br />
transgress Cambodian borders for military<br />
purposes-to move men and supplies to<br />
their forces and, at other times, when they<br />
are driven back by the fighting in South<br />
Vietnam. But Prince Sihanouk asserts that<br />
he resents the intrusion of any foreigners<br />
and he insists that he would resist and use<br />
force to remove any alien force which continued<br />
to occupy Cambodian soil.<br />
Australia and Cambodia, to quote Prince<br />
Sihanouk, exercise different options in their<br />
foreign policies. His friendly attitude to ' us<br />
is clearly not based on an identity of views<br />
on political and other questions. Because . he<br />
opposes any foreign intervention in the<br />
affairs of Cambodia., he opposes any foreign<br />
intervention in the affairs of Vietnam or,<br />
for that matter, anywhere else. He feels<br />
that the people of Vietnam as a whole<br />
should resolve their differences, however<br />
tragic and bloody the process might be.<br />
We differ on these points. We joined with<br />
others in resisting aggression in two world<br />
wars. We have long been committed to an<br />
intervention in response to an appeal for<br />
help against Communist aggression, and we<br />
believe also that the Vietnamese should<br />
choose in a democratic way how they should<br />
live and who their leader should be. We<br />
nominate nobody in advance of the event.<br />
But these differences, I am happy to say,<br />
and as I found, are differences, although<br />
important differences, among friends. In<br />
simple terms the Prince says that he has had<br />
friendship from Australia and he gives<br />
friendship in return. This is why he accepted<br />
Australia as the channel between Cambodia<br />
and the United States of America when<br />
diplomatic relations between -those two<br />
countries were severed, and why we act in<br />
the same way for him in South Vietnam.<br />
Prince Sihanouk is a popular leader and<br />
takes an enlightened view of Cambodia's<br />
domestic needs. He has a vigorous programme<br />
of economic development, and his </p>
<p>administration has happily married the practical<br />
and the aesthetic with modern buildings<br />
having imaginative aspects. At<br />
Sihanoukville a modern port and town,<br />
largely created as a product of his own<br />
inspiration, have been hewn out of the seaboard<br />
jungle in a few years and ha e given<br />
Cambodia a strategic water supply route<br />
formerly confined to the Mekong, which<br />
passes through territory he would regard as<br />
hostile with its unsettled surroundings.<br />
I mention these things in passing as a<br />
reminder that though this neutral country<br />
lives uneasily in the shadow of war, it is<br />
concerned, as we are, with programmes to<br />
improve the lot of its people. We found<br />
there a lively enthusiasm to make a better<br />
life. There lie opportunities for Australia to<br />
continue to express her friendship in practical<br />
ways. It was perhaps significant that,<br />
, although Cambodia retains a ban on the<br />
journalists of many countries, this was<br />
waived in the case of the large party of<br />
Australian journalists which accompanied<br />
me. They, too, found the reception cordial,<br />
and said so, through the president of the<br />
Press Gallery, Mr John Bennetts, in a<br />
special message of thanks to Prince<br />
Sihanouk. Each gesture like this adds something<br />
to the mainstream of our effort. I<br />
carried no brief for other nations in Cambodia,<br />
or the other countries I visited, and<br />
I hope the sum of all I said in many frank<br />
and friendly talks helped to underwrite the<br />
independence of our thinking and our<br />
policy-making.<br />
In Laos, also neutral and also well<br />
disposed, I had significant discussions with<br />
the Prime Minister, Prince Souvanna<br />
Phouma, and King Sri Savang Vatthana, and<br />
other Ministers. I learned that, as on my<br />
last visit to Thailand, I was the first Prime<br />
Minister or Minister from any country to<br />
be invited to attend a meeting of the<br />
Cabinet. This small, land-locked country is<br />
struggling to preserve its neutrality. This is<br />
threatened only by North Vietnam which<br />
maintains more than 20,000 regular combat<br />
troops on Laotian soil to guard the supply<br />
route to the battle areas in South Vietnam.<br />
As Prince Souvanna Phouma himself said<br />
at the General Assembly of the United<br />
Nations in October 1966: ' It is no longer a secret to anyone that entire North Vietnamese<br />
battalions are operating in our<br />
country'. He also said: ' The Ho Chi Minh<br />
trail over which foreign troops and weapons<br />
pass is in our territory'. The Prince claims<br />
that the Pathet Lao has no base of popular<br />
support, is not prominent in military operations,<br />
and has no substantial political significance.<br />
I quote a passage from his talk with<br />
me. He said: ' If we kill an enemy soldier,<br />
we find he is a North Vietnamese; if we<br />
wound one, he is a North Vietnamese; if we<br />
take one prisoner, he is a North Vietnamese.<br />
But if the North Vietnamese make some<br />
military gains, then the Pathet Lao move in<br />
like a lot of crows.'<br />
Laos, due not to lack of enlightenment<br />
but largely to the aggression it has ' had to<br />
withstand, is poor and underdeveloped. With<br />
peace, I am sure Laos could make substantial<br />
progress. I assured its leaders that Australia<br />
will continue to make its contribution<br />
to the economic development of Laos and<br />
the stability of its currency through our contribution<br />
to the Foreign Exchange Operations<br />
Fund. I was assured, not only by the<br />
Laotians but by our Ambassador there, that<br />
this is the most valuable way in which we<br />
can give practical help at present-by helping<br />
to stabilise and strengthen the currency.<br />
I also assured the Laotian Government that<br />
it had our sympathy and support in its<br />
resistance to attacks on its sovereignty, its<br />
territorial integrity and its neutrality.<br />
This completed the first'half of my tour<br />
which embraced the non-aligned countries.<br />
I went then to Taiwan and South Korea,<br />
both aligned with the United States in relation<br />
to events in Vietnam<br />
In the Republic of China I had frank discussions<br />
with President Chiang Kai-shek, as<br />
well as with the Vice-President, Prime<br />
Minister Yen and other Chinese Government<br />
leaders. The island under its present<br />
Government is stable and prosperous. There<br />
is an air of vitality in what is being done<br />
and obvious evidence of economic progress.<br />
It is a going concern and is no longer receiving<br />
American aid. I was also glad to find<br />
the Republic of China strengthening its<br />
position internationally by its active participation<br />
in the Economic Commission for<br />
Asia and the Far East, -the Asian Development<br />
Bank and the Asian and Pacific Council.<br />
Members of the Government see good<br />
prospects of a substantial growth in trade </p>
<p>between our two countries. President Chiang<br />
expressed his admiration and that of his<br />
Government and people for the stand we<br />
had taken over Vietnam and for the significant<br />
military aid we were giving.<br />
I was impressed by the lead the Republic<br />
of China is giving in the field of overseas<br />
aid, especially in a number of African<br />
countries. Technical advisers as well as<br />
persons to work in the fields with the<br />
Africans have been successful in a number<br />
of African countries in demonstrating how<br />
agricultural productivity, particularly in rice<br />
growing, can be increased. I was told that<br />
in some instances production had actually<br />
increased tenfold as a result of this technical<br />
assistance.<br />
I also had opportunities for frank and<br />
informative discussion on internal developments<br />
on the mainland of China. Living so<br />
close to mainland China, receiving refugees<br />
and defectors from the mainland, the<br />
Government on Taiwan has access to useful<br />
information and intelligence on the<br />
present complex situation on the mainland.<br />
The establishment of an Australian mission<br />
in Taipei last September, which was warmly<br />
welcomed by the Republic of China, should<br />
help the Government in its quest to acquire<br />
more information about developments in<br />
mainland China.<br />
Despite some predictions to the contrary,<br />
neither our trade with mainland China nor<br />
our recent decision to accord diplomatic<br />
recognition to Outer Mongolia were raised<br />
in official discussions. I did, however, have<br />
occasion to refer to the latter question when<br />
asked at a Press conference in Taipei. I<br />
explained at that Press conference that this<br />
was an Australian decision and that it was<br />
of value to the Republic of China to have<br />
a country like Australia, making its own<br />
decisions on the merits it saw in particular<br />
circumstances, generally supporting the<br />
position of the Republic of China in other<br />
areas. In Korea there was much I found<br />
impressive. The Republic has strength, is<br />
democratic, stable and going ahead. It has<br />
made a good recovery from the ravages of<br />
war in the early 1950s when it was a<br />
victim of Communist aggression. Australian<br />
assistance in resisting that aggression is<br />
gratefully remembered and has laid an<br />
enduring foundation for the warm friendship which undoubtedly exists between our two<br />
countries. On the evening I arrived in<br />
Seoul I drove through what was estimated<br />
as half a million welcoming and obviously<br />
friendly people lining the streets. The size<br />
and warmth of the welcome were exemplified<br />
by one Australian flag I saw which hung<br />
the full length of seven storeys on one<br />
building. This amazing welcome was a<br />
measure of the regard in which Australia<br />
is held in Korea. When I visited the industrial<br />
centres of Pusan and Ulsan in the south<br />
it was moving to see thousands of people<br />
in total standing in heavy rain in small<br />
groups in the villages en route to wave a<br />
friendly welcome as our party passed.<br />
At the United Nations cemetery at Pusan<br />
where one grave in six is that of an Australian<br />
the thought was deeply with me<br />
that those who had given their lives in this<br />
country had done so for a good cause. The<br />
present free and progressive society in South<br />
Korea is the outcome of that sacrifice.<br />
Members from this Parliament who have<br />
been to this country, no matter on what<br />
side of this House they sit, will confirm<br />
the friendliness of the people and the progress<br />
that they are making. A<br />
helicopter flight from Seoul took me to<br />
an observation post on the border of the<br />
Han River where the demilitarised zone<br />
begins. -Across the river literally a few minutes<br />
jet flying time from Seoul, the capital of<br />
the country, Communist strongpoints were<br />
established and could be seen. The people<br />
of the Republic of Korea have this everpresent<br />
reminder of the continuing Communist<br />
threat to their national independence<br />
and their separation from a significant part<br />
of their former territory and their kinsmen.<br />
It is not surprising in the circumstances that<br />
their armed forces totalling more than<br />
600,000 should rank amongst the bravest,<br />
the toughest and the best trained in the<br />
world. On this border a marine group gave<br />
a demonstration of their methods of<br />
unarmed combat. Tae kwon do they call<br />
it. It is * the forerunner of karate adopted<br />
in Japan. I saw men with their bare hands<br />
smash building bricks and thick wooden<br />
pieces. I tested the objects myself and there<br />
was no doubt that they were genuine. They<br />
were able to achieve these feats with their<br />
bare hands. One fellow did it with his forehead;<br />
others did it with their elbows. </p>
<p>Mr Whitlam-The Prime Minister should<br />
have tried his forehead.<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT-I think that the<br />
thickest heads in the Parliament are on<br />
the Opposition side, but even they would<br />
have had some difficulty in accomplishing<br />
this feat of toughness and endurance.<br />
While in Korea I had profitable exchanges<br />
with President Park and Prime Minister<br />
Chung. As comrades in arms in Vietnam<br />
we reaffirmed our resolve, proclaimed at<br />
the Manila Summit Conference in October<br />
1966, to continue our efforts until aggression<br />
ceased and an enduring settlement had<br />
been reached which respected the wishes<br />
and aspirations of the Vietnamese people.<br />
We agreed that the Vietnamese Government<br />
should be a full participant in any<br />
negotiations to end the conflict and that<br />
the nations which have contributed to the<br />
defence of Vietnam should also participate.<br />
We cannot, of course, lay down in advance<br />
what form this might take.<br />
I believe the remarkable progress evident<br />
in Korea is of relevance to Vietnam and<br />
gives us hope, by its example, that beyond<br />
the clouds of war there is a horizon of<br />
peace, political stability, social justice and<br />
economic advancement.<br />
I comment now briefly on the attitudes<br />
to our position -in Vietnam as they were<br />
given to me at various points in my tour.<br />
In both Taiwan and Korea there was strong<br />
support of the stand we have taken in<br />
Vietnam. In Laos, there was understanding<br />
of our action and in Cambodia, which has<br />
publicly expressed its opposition to United<br />
States policy in Vietnam, I was able to<br />
confirm that our own policy towards<br />
Vietnam and our actions in that country<br />
have not damaged the good relations which<br />
exist between Australia and Cambodia. As<br />
I said earlier, Cambodia bases its attitude<br />
to us on a principle of reciprocity: if we<br />
are friendly to it and behave as a good<br />
friend to it Cambodia is friendly and<br />
behaves as a good friend to us.<br />
Generally, I am reinforced in my judgment<br />
that Australia is not-as is sometimes<br />
alleged by critics of my Governmentdamaging<br />
its image in Asia because of<br />
our action in respect of Vietnam. Many<br />
countries in the region publicly support our<br />
position. Others have expressed, in private, understanding of our reasons for our participation<br />
in Vietnam. To speak of Asian<br />
opinion in this context as though there was<br />
a general view prevailing throughout Asia<br />
is totally misleading. As I have said earlier,<br />
Asia, except as a geographical description,<br />
is a practically meaningless term. Each<br />
country in Asia has its own identity, its<br />
own policies, and its own views on Australia's<br />
actions in Vietnam or, for that<br />
matter, anywhere else.<br />
One of the things which impressed me<br />
on this visit is the degree to which national<br />
identities and national cultures are flowering<br />
and being rediscovered, following the end<br />
of the colonial era. I have now visited<br />
Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos. Each of the<br />
countries visited has its own quite different<br />
language, its own national culture, and its<br />
own identity. It is not very long ago that<br />
Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos were all<br />
grouped together by their colonial administrators<br />
as Indo-China. We must, while the<br />
war drags on, be vigorous in our planning<br />
for peace. We put roots down a long, long<br />
time ago with the Colombo Plan, and as I<br />
moved from country to country I saw<br />
something of what we were doing.<br />
In Cambodia, Government leaders spoke<br />
highly of the value and effectiveness of<br />
Australian aid. Prince Sihanouk personally<br />
gave to the hydrographic survey vessel we<br />
presented, which is doing such valuable<br />
work in the harbour of Sihanoukville, the<br />
name Khmer-Australie Amitie'-or, in our<br />
language, ' Cambodian-Australian Friendship'.<br />
In Laos, Prince Souvanna Phouma<br />
expressed his profound gratitude for what<br />
he referred to as ' the positive and<br />
constructive' aid given by Australia.<br />
In South Korea, I saw the contribution<br />
which we were making to Korean technical<br />
progress through the supply of machine<br />
tools and other equipment to Yong San<br />
Technical School.<br />
Generally, I formed the impression that<br />
our aid programmes in these countries,<br />
though modest, have proved valuable and<br />
effective. One of the reasons for this is that<br />
our aid is all in the form of grants. It is<br />
given without strings-with no conditions.<br />
It usually takes a highly practical form of<br />
identifiable items or of the technical<br />
assistance given by Australian personnel. </p>
<p>Aid-receiving countries accept that we see<br />
the raising of Asian living standards as a<br />
desirable end in itself, and not simply a<br />
means of making gains in the cold war.<br />
Communist countries which attack the giving<br />
of aid by Western nations as a form ot<br />
neo-colonialism are themselves seeking to<br />
deny these countries the assistance which<br />
the countries need to progress and develop.<br />
By their attacks they would perpetuate an<br />
economic and social backwardness from<br />
which those in need of aid hunger to free<br />
themselves. We should not be deceived by Communist<br />
jargon. So when they talk of neocolonialism<br />
they tend to mask their own<br />
efforts to bring newly independent countries<br />
under their own direct sphere of influence.<br />
When they talk of wars of national liberation,<br />
they abuse -the English language in<br />
that the wars they have in mind are in<br />
essence both anti-national and opposed to<br />
genuine liberation. Again, they seek the<br />
establishment of docile Communist regimes<br />
under this slogan.<br />
We are not opposed to the social revolution<br />
which has been taking place and is<br />
continuing in South East Asia. This social<br />
revolution reflects long suppressed yearnings<br />
for national identity, social betterment and<br />
economic progress. We seek these things<br />
for ourselves. What we are opposed to is<br />
the perversion of the forces of social revolution<br />
in Asia to establish through indirect<br />
pressures, through subversion, through<br />
insurgency, through terrorism and aggression,<br />
Communist regimes which are neither<br />
sought nor wanted by the majority of the<br />
people in the countries concerned.<br />
What results can fairly be claimed from<br />
this journey? I believe my visit has contributed<br />
to the consolidation of our relationships<br />
with each of the four countries<br />
concerned. I believe it has strengthened our<br />
stature and influence with the four Governments<br />
with whose leaders I conferred.<br />
Moreover, it has given added backing<br />
to our diplomatic effort in Phnom<br />
Penh, Vientiane, Taipei and Seoul.<br />
I believe the visit was of value -to me<br />
personally in an educational sense. I feel<br />
I now have a greater understanding in<br />
depth of the problems which affect us in each of the four countries, just as I feel<br />
that they now have a greater understanding<br />
of us. Knowledge strengthens understanding<br />
and understanding strengthens friendship. I<br />
believe that -thanks to an excellent coverage<br />
by Press, radio and television, these countries<br />
and their problems and potentialities<br />
have become better known to the Australian<br />
people. I believe that, through my visit,<br />
further progress has been made along our<br />
chosen path of securing the acceptance of<br />
Australia by the countries of the Asian and<br />
Pacific region as a co-operative and useful<br />
member of the region.<br />
I visited two countries which are closely<br />
allied, like ourselves, with the Uniled States<br />
of America, and two countries which seek<br />
to preserve a status of neutrality. Our<br />
relationships with other countries are not<br />
determined solely on the basis of whether<br />
they are allied with us. We accept diversity.<br />
In our search for a stable, secure Asian<br />
region, growing in economic prosperity, we<br />
promote the closest relations with Asian<br />
allies in collective defence organisations.<br />
But we also seek to promote the best<br />
possible relations with countries which have<br />
chosen the path of neutrality. We support<br />
and seek to uphold the national integrity<br />
of all countries in the region. And beyond<br />
this, we look to a future settlement with<br />
mainland China, without which there can be<br />
no lasting peace in Asia.<br />
The success of my visit to these four<br />
countries, the warmth of my reception in<br />
each one of them, and the genuinely<br />
friendly attitude towards Australia which I<br />
discovered, are due in some measure to<br />
the years of patient effort put into developing<br />
personal contacts with these countries<br />
through the efforts of the Department of<br />
External Affairs and our diplomatic representatives<br />
in the area. I cannot speak too<br />
highly of those who, sometimes under<br />
arduous conditions and et times conditions<br />
of danger, represent Australia in such a<br />
dedicated manner in these countries. It is<br />
a matter of some pride to me, and a measure<br />
of the focus of our interest in the Asian<br />
region, that with the establishment of our<br />
embassy in Taiwan last year, we are now<br />
represented in every independent country<br />
in the Asian and Pacific region which we<br />
recognise, except Mongolia, which we have<br />
only recently recognised. </p>
<p>There has been silly comment in some<br />
quarters to the effect that. in undertaking<br />
journeys of this kind I am, in some way,<br />
usurping the role or functions of the Minister<br />
for External Affairs. This is nonsense.<br />
' the Prime Minister as head of his Cabinet<br />
has an important responsibility for the<br />
foreign policies of his Government and its<br />
relations with other countries and the view<br />
held of his own country by them. A government's<br />
foreign policy is no more divisible<br />
from the central problems of government<br />
policy-making than its domestic policies.<br />
In some countries, the Prime Minister<br />
holds the portfolio of foreign affairs; in<br />
others, the Minister for Foreign Affairs<br />
tends to be not much more than an echo<br />
of the views of his head of state or Prime<br />
Minister. In Australia, the position is much<br />
more closely identifiable with that of the<br />
United Kingdom where it is customary to<br />
find a strong personality holding the foreign<br />
affairs portfolio, capable of interpreting<br />
articulately the foreign policies of his<br />
Government, negotiating for it, and holding<br />
meetings at the highest level. This situation<br />
has never excluded journeys or attendances<br />
by the Prime Minister on occasion, sometimes<br />
accompanied . by his Foreign Minister,<br />
sometimes not. My own overseas journeys<br />
during my term of office have principally<br />
been of an educational kind, with the added<br />
objective of establishing personal relations<br />
with heads of government in other countries.<br />
On the only two occasions when I have<br />
attended conferences, both conducted at a<br />
level of heads of government-the Prime<br />
Ministers Conference in London and the<br />
Manila Summit Conference-I arranged for<br />
the Minister for External Affa-irs to accompany<br />
me.<br />
In the modern world where international<br />
contacts tend to proliferate, a Foreign<br />
Minister is busily occupied throughout the<br />
year. Our own Minister for External Affairs<br />
has personally represented us at meetings of<br />
the United Nations, of SEATO, of A'NZUS,<br />
of ECAFE and of ASPAC, and at the conference<br />
establishing the Asian Development<br />
Bank, as well as accompanying me to the<br />
conferences I have mentioned and conducting<br />
many discussions on visits to many countries<br />
in Asia, Europe and North America<br />
at Foreign Minister and, indeed, -higher<br />
levels. I believe that our activities have<br />
usefuly supplemented those of each other<br />
in our respective. spheres. There has been another purpose in my<br />
own journeyings, and that is to focus public<br />
attention in the countries visited on Australia's<br />
viewpoints, and also to build a better<br />
informed Australian knowledge and opinion<br />
about countries-some of them little known<br />
of special importance and interest to us.<br />
As the size of the Press parties accompanying<br />
me on my own tours would confirm,<br />
there is, by virtue of the office of Prime<br />
Minister, a more concentrated and wider<br />
public notice taken of a visit by a head<br />
of government than by -any of its other<br />
members. We know from our own<br />
experience that delighted as we are to<br />
receive a visit from a Foreign Minister, or a<br />
Finance Minister or a Trade Minister, there<br />
is an even greater interest in the visit of a<br />
head of government or head of state. This<br />
is one of the well recognised facts of political<br />
life. Undoubtedly, my own visits have<br />
brought Australia more prominently under<br />
notice in each of the countries I have visited<br />
and have helped to make those countries<br />
better known here at home.<br />
We Australians can count ourselves fortunate<br />
to have a Foreign Minister of the<br />
experience, intellectual quality and sagacity<br />
of our present Minister. He not only enjoys<br />
the full confidence and respect of his colleagues<br />
of the Government and of the<br />
Government Parties, but I can vouch from<br />
personal knowledge that he is held in the<br />
highest regard by his opposite numbers<br />
wherever he moves. His job is made no<br />
easier nor are Australia's interests abroad<br />
advanced by stupid comment of the kind<br />
to which I have referred.<br />
No account of this journey would be<br />
complete without my thanks to the very<br />
able team of officials who accompanied me,<br />
to our medical adviser, who so promptly<br />
attended to the minor disorders which<br />
affected most of us in what was a very<br />
strenuous tour through a variety of climatic<br />
conditions, to the aircrews whose skill<br />
invariably brought us to a happy landing,<br />
and to the large Press party which assisted<br />
our general purposes by a coverage that<br />
was, generally speaking, fair, factual and<br />
comprehensive. I publicly say my thanks,<br />
also, to my wife, who made her own<br />
distinctive contribution to the succes:; of the<br />
tour. There must be thanks, also, to all<br />
our hosts, whose hospitality we shall always </p>
<p>remember with appreciation, and which we milestone in the history of the relationship<br />
shall find it difficult to emulate, between our two countries. I believe that<br />
There is no shadow of doubt in my mind can be said of all the four countries<br />
that this was a valuable journey for Aus-visited, and I hope . this will be the judgtralia.<br />
The Prime Minister of South Korea ment, also, of this Parliament and the Aussummed<br />
up the visit as an important tralian people.<br />
