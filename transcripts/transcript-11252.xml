    <content><![CDATA[<p> Today the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, Mr</p>
<p> Hockey, and I are announcing details of the Government's strategy</p>
<p> to promote Australia as a centre for global financial services (CGFS).</p>
<p>Australia has the potential to develop further as a CGFS and to gain</p>
<p> a greater share of world financial services business. That potential</p>
<p> rests on a number of Australia's advantages including an open</p>
<p> and stable financial system; a highly skilled workforce; cost-competitive</p>
<p> business conditions; sound macroeconomic fundamentals and a time zone</p>
<p> advantage over other major regional markets which flows from Australia's</p>
<p> earlier market opening time. The intense international competition</p>
<p> for financial services business means, however, that Australia needs</p>
<p> to pursue more actively its role as a CGFS.</p>
<p>The Government's key role in promoting Australia as a CGFS is</p>
<p> to ensure that the overall economic and regulatory framework continues</p>
<p> to be of international best practice. The implementation of the A</p>
<p> New Tax System reform proposals, the progression of business tax</p>
<p> reform in the context of the Ralph Review of Business Taxation, and</p>
<p> the maintenance of sound macroeconomic policy settings are crucial</p>
<p> elements in that framework.</p>
<p>There is also an important role for the Government in facilitating</p>
<p> more effective and coordinated promotion of Australia as a CGFS. In</p>
<p> recognition of this, the 1999-00 Budget provided $7 million over the</p>
<p> next two years to fund this promotional strategy. Today's announcement</p>
<p> provides further details on this strategy.</p>
<p>International Financial Centre Task Force</p>
<p>An International Financial Centre Task Force will be established within</p>
<p> the Department of the Treasury and located in Sydney to develop and</p>
<p> implement a coordinated CGFS promotional campaign. It will also provide</p>
<p> policy advice on this issue to the Government.</p>
<p>The Task Force will become operational on 1 July 1999, be staffed</p>
<p> with professionals from both the private and public sectors and will</p>
<p> be headed by a senior financial sector executive, with considerable</p>
<p> industry experience and marketing expertise. The Task Force will have</p>
<p> a two year life span after which it is envisaged that the CGFS promotional</p>
<p> strategy will be taken over by the private sector.</p>
<p>The Task Force will report to the Minister for Financial Services</p>
<p> and Regulation, Mr Hockey, who will lead the campaign to promote</p>
<p> Australia as a CGFS.</p>
<p>To assist the work of the Task Force, the Government will also establish</p>
<p> a CGFS Committee of Regulators, chaired by the Treasury and including</p>
<p> the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Australian Prudential Regulation</p>
<p> Authority, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the</p>
<p> Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian</p>
<p> Taxation Office.</p>
<p>The Committee of Regulators will meet regularly to consider CGFS regulatory</p>
<p> and promotional issues and will report to the Treasurer and Minister</p>
<p> for Financial Services and Regulation.</p>
<p>Other elements of the strategy</p>
<p>Other elements of the strategy which will complement the promotional</p>
<p> campaign include:</p>
<p>   * improved data collection to benchmark Australia's performance</p>
<p> and assist the long term development of policy options to promote</p>
<p> Australia as a CGFS;</p>
<p>   * a range of education and training initiatives to help Australia</p>
<p> become a key training ground for the financial sector; and</p>
<p>   * the re-opening of Treasury's regional office in Singapore</p>
<p> as part of Australia's High Commission to improve the quality</p>
<p> of advice to the Government on regional economic and financial</p>
<p> developments.</p>
<p>This initiative will enhance Australia's capacity to participate</p>
<p> fully in the strong global growth in the financial services industry</p>
<p> to the benefit of all Australians.</p>
<p> 17 May 1999</p>
