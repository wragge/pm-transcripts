    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..........................................</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>The Prime Minister, John Howard, has had a pretty big year, as</p>
<p>   with any PM, with highs and lows because, simply, that goes with</p>
<p>   the territory but his eyes light up every time he talks about sport</p>
<p>   and that is exactly what we will chat about today and nothing else.</p>
<p>   Well thanks for your time and a merry Christmas Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you very much David and to you as well, it is very nice to</p>
<p>   talk to you.</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>Thank you, I appreciate that. Well, would it be accurate to say</p>
<p>   your sporting pecking order would be cricket number one and rugby</p>
<p>   league number two with one red eye and one white?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's pretty accurate although when it comes to football,</p>
<p>   I played more rugby union and soccer than I did rugby league. I</p>
<p>   played both league and union at school and then soccer for several</p>
<p>   years after I left school, but I guess I have followed league more</p>
<p>   closely over the last few years. But, like all people who grow up</p>
<p>   in Sydney, unless you are absolutely fanatical you tend to follow</p>
<p>   a range of football codes.</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>Well that is very true. Well let's get to the league in a</p>
<p>   minute because cricket is your agreed number one. Now on your recent</p>
<p>   visit to Lords, was that the first time that you have seen the baggy</p>
<p>   green caps in action at the home of cricket.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes it was....no, no, no, I'm sorry. It wasn't - I correct</p>
<p>   myself - I saw them in l993. I actually saw Michael Slater get his</p>
<p>   inaugural ton against the Englishmen in 1993, that was the Test</p>
<p>   in which Warne bowled Gatting with that extraordinary leg break</p>
<p>   that seemed to break about 10 yards, much to the surprise of the</p>
<p>   batsman. And my wife and I were in London and we saw it then. Then</p>
<p>   we were able to see the Lords Test in 1997. Now that was the first</p>
<p>   time I have done so as Prime Minister, of course. It is quite an</p>
<p>   experience to see a Test match at Lords.</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>Yes there is something rather special about Lords isn't it.</p>
<p>   It is a bit like Twickenham for Rugby and it is a bit like....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It does have an atmosphere but something that I have remarked to</p>
<p>   a lot of my friends about is that when I was overseas in the middle</p>
<p>   of this year I went to the Lords Cricket Ground and to Yankee Stadium</p>
<p>   in New York, which, of course, is the headquarters of baseball and</p>
<p>   whilst it was a great experience going to each, particularly Lords,</p>
<p>   neither of those grounds compares in size and conception to say</p>
<p>   the Melbourne Cricket Ground. And it reminds you of just how good</p>
<p>   the major sporting fields in Australia really are.</p>
<p>The facilities at the Lords Cricket Ground have been improved a</p>
<p>   lot in recent years. I thought Yankee Stadium was a bit colourless.</p>
<p>   It didn't seem to have a lot of atmosphere, the facilities</p>
<p>   were fine but I was a little bit disappointed, having as a child</p>
<p>   thought of sporting arenas in America as comprising Yankee Stadium</p>
<p>   and Madison Square Garden - both in New York - I was just a little</p>
<p>   bit, sort of, let down.</p>
<p>But, it does drive home to you how good are our high quality playing</p>
<p>   fields in Australia. We have good surfaces, good facilities. Our</p>
<p>   cricket and football grounds, by and large, are much bigger, so</p>
<p>   we really do extraordinarily well given our size.</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>And after the Olympic Games it is going to be better in Sydney</p>
<p>   as well.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's going to be even better.</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>It is going to be fantastic isn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it will just, sort of, make a very good situation even better.</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>Well you mentioned there about your boyhood dreams. Did you ever</p>
<p>   have a boyhood dream of wearing a green, baggy green cap?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>For a fairly short period of time. Really, the men overtook me,</p>
<p>   David, and I realised that wasn't going to be achievable but</p>
<p>   I continue to have an enormous affection for the game. I was a very</p>
<p>   average cricketer. I enjoyed it and I continued to play it well</p>
<p>   into my thirties. I stopped playing regularly when I entered Parliament</p>
<p>   at the age of 34. I still have two or three social games a year</p>
<p>   but I was never a great chop at it, but I enjoyed it immensely.</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>I thought you might have donned the creams for your 11 against</p>
<p>   South Africa at Manuka?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, that's become of course, and very understandably, quite</p>
<p>   a serious encounter. And it is an opportunity for a lot of players</p>
<p>   to show how good they are and it does remind people of the depth</p>
<p>   of cricket in Australia.</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>Well how do you rate the current Australian team in history then,</p>
<p>   Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I would rate it highly. I don't think one could rate it quite as</p>
<p>   highly as the 1948 team or indeed the team at various stages when</p>
<p>   Ian Chappell was the captain. And I thought there were times when</p>
<p>   Allan Border was captain, when particularly 1993 we were doing very</p>
<p>   well. But, it is capable of great heights and the victory over the</p>
<p>   West Indies, a couple of years ago, was quite extraordinary.</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>Back-to-back, there and here which made it even better.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Quite extraordinary. Now it is true that the West Indies has hit</p>
<p>   a period in its own cricket cycle which is not as strong as it was</p>
<p>   but it doesn't alter the fact that that back-to-back achievement</p>
<p>   was quite remarkable.</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>Well you are very keen on history and the way things happen. Now</p>
<p>   history has been made with two Aussie skippers this season, with</p>
<p>   Mark Taylor for the Tests and Steve Waugh for the white ball game.</p>
<p>   Were you a bit surprised with that decision in breaking with tradition?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it seemed as though it was being hinted at. I know it is very</p>
<p>   easy for people to criticise the selectors when they do things like</p>
<p>   that. I am a great Mark Taylor fan, as you all know, but the idea</p>
<p>   of trying a separate captaincy is defensible and it ought to be</p>
<p>   given a bit of time to work and I don't think people should</p>
<p>   rush to judgement and say because we have lost a couple of one dayers</p>
<p>   that means the whole idea is a failure. I don't think that</p>
<p>   is fair.</p>
<p>They are different games although they are manifestations of the</p>
<p>   same game, the qualities required or the emphasis in the games are</p>
<p>   different and each contributes to the other. There is no doubt that</p>
<p>   the quality of fielding, overall, in Test cricket now is much higher</p>
<p>   than it was. It was always quite high with some teams. But I think,</p>
<p>   for example, without sounding patronising, Englishmen field better</p>
<p>   in Test matches now than they used to and part of that is due to</p>
<p>   one day cricket.</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>Very good point, now you mentioned, Mark Taylor, that was a very</p>
<p>   moving fax you sent to him after he had broken that run of outs</p>
<p>   with a century in the first Test of the last Ashes tour, you obviously</p>
<p>   have a lot of admiration for him?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I do, I thought he took over the captaincy and was instantaneously</p>
<p>   easy in the job. His leadership skills were very good and the achievement</p>
<p>   in relation to the West Indies, that we have just canvassed, was</p>
<p>   marvellous and I just know what it is like from one's own experience.</p>
<p>   You can go through a very difficult period of time and everything</p>
<p>   would seem to go wrong and I just felt a certain degree of understanding</p>
<p>   and I am just glad he stuck to it. He is such an even sort of person.</p>
<p>   He wasn't somebody who was blaming this or that circumstance</p>
<p>   or this or that person. I found him incredibly even tempered and</p>
<p>   whatever with the constant questions about his run getting performance</p>
<p>   by the media. Now, fair enough the media ask those questions, not</p>
<p>   blaming them, but he displayed an evenness and a lack of bad temper</p>
<p>   that is, I guess, an example to a lot of people.</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>No, fair comment, in fact anyone that can survive the brutal British</p>
<p>   press can survive anything.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Survive, indeed anything.</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>Now what about rugby league, the ARL/Super League war, has that</p>
<p>   dented your love of the game a bit?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Everybody got disappointed with that. I thought Rugby League from</p>
<p>   about the middle of the early part of the 1980s through to a couple</p>
<p>   of years ago had transformed itself. It had become a game that all</p>
<p>   sections of the community began to follow and not just a particular</p>
<p>   section of the community. And those who were leading the game and</p>
<p>   promoting it had done a first class job then along came the Super</p>
<p>   League development.</p>
<p>The public is always turned away by division and if you look a</p>
<p>   divided sport, a divided code, you turn people off. You'd threaten</p>
<p>   the locality base of the game which is always a threat to any kind</p>
<p>   of football and of course it set off - with the high salaries and</p>
<p>   pay - it set off a chain reaction amongst all highly paid professional</p>
<p>   sportsmen and women which still hasn't worked itself right</p>
<p>   through the system. So, of course it was bad and I am pleased that</p>
<p>   it looks as though it has been finalised. There are still a few</p>
<p>   loose ends about sponsorship to be tied up but it does look as though</p>
<p>   it is finalised.</p>
<p>It was always going to be the case that the size of the competition</p>
<p>   had to be worked down but I hope it doesn't occur in a way</p>
<p>   that you destroy the locality base. That is one of the great strengths</p>
<p>   of football - any code - it has of course always been the great</p>
<p>   strength of AFL, the VFL originally, that tremendous locality base</p>
<p>   that it has got and still has.</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>Well the Kerry Packer inspired World Series split, 20 years ago,</p>
<p>   vastly improved the game of cricket. Can you see the league war</p>
<p>   achieving the same result?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Different situation David, because what World Series Cricket produced</p>
<p>   was a different type of game. That hasn't happened with Super</p>
<p>   League, has it?</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There have been some marginal changes in the rules, very marginal.</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>Well I must think Prime Minister, along the lines of the World</p>
<p>   Club challenge - I thought the concept of that was great.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The concept was great but the way, I have got to say, in common</p>
<p>   with a lot of other sports followers, I have found the frustration</p>
<p>   of not being able to see the first session of that Cricket Test</p>
<p>   while I had to watch a fairly low grade club game between an English</p>
<p>   club and the Sydney club which was not even a proper contest, a</p>
<p>   bit annoying.</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>Yes true. But you wouldn't expect though, the Northern Hemisphere</p>
<p>   clubs to be so inferior to the Southern Hemisphere, that came as</p>
<p>   a bit of a shock.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Although the quality of English rugby league compared to Australian</p>
<p>   rugby league has declined enormously or our's has got a lot</p>
<p>   better - I think probably the latter - over the last 20 years. I</p>
<p>   can remember when, 30 years ago, a Test match between Great Britain</p>
<p>   and Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground was a real contest and</p>
<p>   a great Rugby League encounter but I don't think it has been</p>
<p>   since 1970 that the Englishmen have been a real threat to Australian</p>
<p>   Rugby League.</p>
<p>The quality of our game has improved enormously, our coaching techniques</p>
<p>   are much better and I think, overall, it is a much better game here</p>
<p>   than it is in England. Whereas 30 or 40 years ago, it was very much</p>
<p>   an even contest.</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>Well St George is your Rugby League team, why the Dragons Prime</p>
<p>   Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I grew up in Earlwood, which is in what I might call the top end</p>
<p>   of the St George area, if you grew up in Earlwood you either followed</p>
<p>   St George or Canterbury and I followed St George and that's</p>
<p>   a loyalty that I have retained even though I haven't lived</p>
<p>   in that part of Sydney for the last 30 odd years, or 26 years since</p>
<p>   I have been married. But, I came from that part of the world and</p>
<p>   of course, in those days, St George was a very powerful club. It</p>
<p>   had worked its way through that great series of - what was it -</p>
<p>   11-13...</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>11.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>11 consecutive premiership victories.</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>Yes you were certainly with the strength.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah. But I did have a geographical connection too.</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>Now, Prime Minister, what about other sports, because you are a</p>
<p>   sports lover. Do any others really tickle your fancy?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>When I was very young I must confess I used to follow boxing very</p>
<p>   closely. I could recite all the heavy-weight champions of the world</p>
<p>   from Bob Fitzsimmons right down to the then...the ones around then,</p>
<p>   which were people like Louis and Marciano and Walcott. But I must</p>
<p>   say as the time went by I lost interest in that and I play golf</p>
<p>   regularly when I am on holidays. I quite like golf. I play tennis.</p>
<p>   I follow the golf and the tennis. I follow soccer, my two sons have</p>
<p>   played soccer regularly. Like probably 2 or 3 million other Australians</p>
<p>   I felt very let down when we lost that game in Melbourne against</p>
<p>   the Iranians. It demonstrated what an arbitrary game soccer can</p>
<p>   be. You can get a result utterly against the flow of play and that</p>
<p>   certainly was the case with that particular game. I try to follow</p>
<p>   all of the other sports. You naturally have your own interests but</p>
<p>   the ones that I have mentioned are the ones that I follow most keenly.</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>Well every sports lover has heroes and heroines, who are yours?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Certainly in cricket, although I only saw him play once, everybody</p>
<p>   of course worships Don Bradman. I guess of the people that I saw</p>
<p>   a lot of in the earlier period amongst the Australians, Keith Miller</p>
<p>   and Ray Lindwall and later on the Chappell's and Marsh and</p>
<p>   also Allan Border. They were people who I think have - just leaving</p>
<p>   aside the current ones just thinking of those who are no longer</p>
<p>   playing Test cricket - they are the ones that made the most vivid</p>
<p>   impression on me.</p>
<p>And of non-Australians, Sobers, is certainly the greatest player</p>
<p>   I saw over an extended period of time. He was absolutely fantastic,</p>
<p>   one of the most, natural athletes I have ever seen play any kind</p>
<p>   of sport, whether it be cricket, or football, or sprinting, or long</p>
<p>   distance running, or swimming or anything I thought he was just</p>
<p>   absolutely extraordinary. He had a natural ability and a hand-eye</p>
<p>   coordination that I have not seen the like of from anybody.</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>What about the ladies. Any of the ladies over the years that have</p>
<p>   really, you admired, from their sporting prowess?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh I thought, I think over the years, certainly in tennis, Evonne</p>
<p>   Goolagong-Cawley and before her Margaret Smith or Margaret Court,</p>
<p>   as she later became. They were the two that stood out in tennis.</p>
<p>I think in swimming you couldn't go past Dawn Fraser although</p>
<p>   I thought, in more recent years, people like Tracey Wickham and</p>
<p>   before her Shane Gould, also two great ornaments of swimming.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well how important then Prime Minister, is sport to the Australian</p>
<p>   psyche, the Australian way of life?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is one of the pillars of the Australian way of life. There is</p>
<p>   a very special place in the Australian psyche for sport. You don't</p>
<p>   really understand what makes the Australian nation tick unless you</p>
<p>   understand the great affection Australians have for sport. We are</p>
<p>   remarkably successful and very competitive, given our size. I mean,</p>
<p>   our performance at the Atlanta Games given that we had only 18.5</p>
<p>   million people was just amazing.</p>
<p>Our dominance for a long time of various competitive sports is</p>
<p>   terrific. Now, none of this is to deny the importance in Australia's</p>
<p>   life of culture and the Arts. In fact one of the very pleasing things</p>
<p>   about Australian life in the last 20 years has been the way in which</p>
<p>   we have become broader in our interests and as well as continuing</p>
<p>   a very strong, indeed fanatical commitment to sport, we have become</p>
<p>   a nation of museum visitors and theatre goers in a way that earlier</p>
<p>   generations may have not thought likely.</p>
<p>And the other very pleasing thing is the way in which sport has</p>
<p>   become, particularly football, has become a lot more national. If</p>
<p>   you grew up in Sydney years ago you tended to follow cricket and</p>
<p>   rugby league, a few people followed union and a few have still followed</p>
<p>   soccer. Now you will follow rugby league and you will find out what</p>
<p>   is happening in rugby union, or you will follow union and ditto</p>
<p>   with league but you will also follow Australian rules. You'll</p>
<p>   know what is happening.</p>
<p>Television of course is responsible for this but also the greater</p>
<p>   sense of nationalism that Australians have now and they don't</p>
<p>   see their sport in quite the provincial terms that used to be the</p>
<p>   case in the 1940s and 50s.</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>Well fascinating stuff. Many thanks for your time Prime Minister</p>
<p>   and I hope you have enjoyed the change of pace.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>Have a merry Christmas, you and your family and a great 1998.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you very much and you haven't bowled me many bumpers.</p>
<p>LORD:</p>
<p>I didn't intend to.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good on you.</p>
