kUNCHIING OF * HELP POLAND JVV APPEAL<br />
MELBOURN13 11.: 11-1 1111 I<br />
We are here today_ to extend the helping hand of * the People-Of<br />
Australia to the people ofPland in ihej-riour of-nee&amp;.<br />
-The causes of that need are complex. They-have their roots in<br />
the economics and politics of post-war Poland. But whatever.<br />
* the causes may be, the situation in Poland today is that -the<br />
* essentials of life are in desperately short supply.<br />
At a time when the northern winter i-s about to begin, many of<br />
thxe mrost b iasic human ne-eds for food, medicines and clothing<br />
simply cannot-i----it. Old people arnd children are particlarly<br />
* at risk. So the appeal that is being launched herTe today to<br />
" Help Poland Live" t strikes a chord at the very heart of our<br />
qoncern for people.<br />
This appeal is not the begim-uing of the Australian communitysattempts<br />
. to help the people of Poland. Right from the beginning<br />
of the present-cirisis, Polish Australians have been sending an<br />
ever inureasing volume of assistance. in the last twelve months<br />
8lorq, over $ 5 mi11oAVworth of aid has. been--ent.---M4uch of this<br />
support has taken the form of food parcerls and money sent to<br />
-friends and family.<br />
de-Polish Australians, the suffering is not something affecting<br />
Aiastant-strangers. It is about close family anid friends; it iWs<br />
happening irri places they -know intimately; it reaches them<br />
through letters and phone calls, and through conversations<br />
with-recently arrived refugees.<br />
',? oland has not had an easy or peaceful history. Repeatedly over<br />
-the past two orenturies, Poland has come unider pressure froui<br />
owefulneighbou. rs to the West and to the East. The Polish<br />
people have had1 t-o struj~ glb for their righnt--Ã± e-e~ ist. azs an<br />
independent state. Through all the years of their history, the<br />
courage of the Polish people has been remArkable by any standaxds.<br />
-The -olitical iinplication of the present crisis in Poland are<br />
known to ever'yone here, In the past year the rAustralian GoverniTervF<br />
has onsstetly Called for Poland to be left free to solve its<br />
-ifficultiesa in its own way. This call has been widely echoed<br />
internationa1-y,-a-4 1 want to take this opportwdity to recall<br />
what 41 Comonwealth leaders had to say in i4: eourne lrast month. i </p>
<p>Pdilish A~ ppeal. -2<br />
T. he Communique from the meeting reacr6as follows: " lieads of<br />
Government discussed the situation in Poland. They were<br />
i. oncerned that it covld have serious implications for the<br />
-i-Au4. rnatiornai community as-a--whole. . They considered that the<br />
people of Poland should be left to determine their own destiny<br />
free from foreign interference."<br />
Poland needs time to sort out its -problems so that it can once<br />
again stand on its own feet economically and iznternatit~ n-a. aid<br />
is required to give it that breathing space.<br />
Many countries, including the Unitcd States, Canada and those in<br />
th~_ 7uroPed'an Economic* Comimunry, havealready given Goveriweent<br />
and noa-Government assistance, and the Australian Government is<br />
g-uaranteeing commercial. trade credits to Poland. We need to be<br />
perfectly clear, however, that what community aid. to Poland is<br />
all about, what this appeal is all about, is the basic welfaie<br />
Wof mill'ions of ordinary people who are faciag the threat of<br />
extreme hardship.<br />
I~ ame no. Aoubt that this apgaal will--how that Australians are not<br />
indifferent to the fate of people in Poland, just as earlier<br />
* appeals have shcm that Australians will contribute magnificently<br />
to help alleviate suifering in other parts of the world,, The<br />
Government also will not be inactive and I shall an-nounce at the<br />
end of this-spech { 1econtribution that-7the GoVernjnent is<br />
prepared to make.<br />
The Federal Council of Polish Organisations; in Australia I. s rnowtiflg<br />
-this-appeal to collect money for the purchase of food, medicines<br />
and other essential supplies. These goods will Ibe forwarded<br />
toPoland for distz-ibution by the Catholic Church andl Solidarity,<br />
the indep'endent trade unioa movement, and the Government will allo make<br />
available any-neacessary assistance fromthe Australian Embassy<br />
in Warsaw. The goods will go to the people m~ ost in need.<br />
The appeal. is being conducted by. the haustraliani N'ational Committee<br />
f. or Relief to Poland under the Chairmanship of Kr. Prank Galbally.<br />
The membership of this Committee is draw-n from different pollrttal<br />
persuasions, religious cornuitments and * walks of life. The appeal<br />
* is, in the full meaning of the word, national. I am honotired to<br />
* have been invited to be its patron. Volunteers are coming forward<br />
* i-A all Stateziv--A numbe'r of them are herv--today. Already a head<br />
o ffice in. Melbourne is being rn. n by volurnteers, with premises and<br />
support services provided by the generosity of one of the<br />
national Committee members. We are gratQful for your time and<br />
energy. ' Thanks to you, the volunteers, thc administrative cots<br />
will be kept to a bare minimum.<br />
The funds raised will be used for the maximum possible benefit<br />
of the Polishpgple. _. Au ; tralials links withi Poland go back a<br />
century and a half, and a common con~ cern with freedom is a<br />
recurring theme in that history. ribno th the 1rt-h and 20th Century<br />
Australia haB offered a refuge for Poles fleeing oppression ir,<br />
their native land. In the 1860s and daring the two World Wars<br />
Auatralians organiised rfelief funds to help'ID. land while she fought:<br />
for her liberty. in the Scond World War~ oox soldiers fought<br />
tyranny side by side on the b attlefield of Tobr'uk. Hiow appropriat~ e<br />
it is that the pioneer ex plorer Strzelccki named oux highest<br />
peak after the great Polish fighter for freedom, Xoscius2Yo. 4 </p>
<p>Pclish Appeal 3<br />
Today, the numnber of Australians who have come from, or have<br />
personal ties with Poland exceeds 100O, 000 peep! e. Their skills<br />
and efforts have made a significant contribution to Australia's<br />
post war development and prosperity. Many were involved in the<br />
construction of some of our largest public works projects, such<br />
as the Snowy Mountains Hydro-ElectrincSchemg.. Their talents<br />
have enriched us in many other fields, among them education,<br />
science and the arts. These are all special reasons why we can<br />
expect a strong public response to this appeal.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, Australians whose fanmilies have origins<br />
in, or links with, Poland have earned a respected place, both<br />
Sas-individuals and as a community. They form an integral part<br />
of Australia. In a time of distress, they turn for assistance<br />
to all their fellow Australians. 1amunch the appeal with fuul--<br />
confidence that Australians will indeed meet the call to<br />
" Help Poland Live".<br />
I ai -very pleased-indeed to anroune that the Commonwealth Government,<br />
to give practical expression to its concern for the people of<br />
Poland, has decided to make a cash grant to the appeal of<br />
one million dollars.<br />
Mr. Chairman, I have much pleasure in presenting this -cheque<br />
to the Appeal. 000--</p>
