TRANSCRIPT OF QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION, NATIONAL PRESS<br />
CLUB, 19 JULY 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: One particularly topical area of differing<br />
regulations is non-bank financial institutions. What is<br />
your reaction to recent calls for uniform regulations and<br />
do you think the recent troubles in Victoria are<br />
attributable, at least in part, to inadequate regulations<br />
there? PM: Thanks, Don. That's obviously a very, very relevant<br />
and timely question in relation to the sorts of things<br />
I'm talking about. Let me say this, that I think it's<br />
neither necessary or practical or efficient for all<br />
deposit taking institutions to be supervised centrally<br />
and particularly by the Reserve Bank because, as you will<br />
appreciate, there is indeed a myriad of small<br />
institutions around the country. In fact some<br />
institutions indeed operate exclusively at a local level,<br />
regional level, even at the level of a firm and they are<br />
in no sense, those sorts of small institutions, part of<br />
the national financial system. It should be noted that<br />
many building societies that did want to operate at a<br />
national level have done so by making the change to<br />
banks. However, having said that, I think it ought to be<br />
said that, doubt if anyone in the country would argue<br />
against the proposition that non-bank deposit taking<br />
financial institutions must be effectively supervised and<br />
that this should be done in a uniform basis in this<br />
country. I believe that the Commonwealth and the States<br />
need to work together to develop effective uniform<br />
supervision and I say here, quite unequivocally, that the<br />
Commonwealth will assist in that process where it's like<br />
other areas that I've mentioned in the speech today. I<br />
think, to be precise, that this issue should be on the<br />
agenda for this first Premiers' Conference that I've set<br />
and, indeed, I think there should be and I will undertake<br />
that there will be prior discussions on this issue so<br />
that we can come to a consideration of it at that<br />
conference well prepared.<br />
JOURNALIST: The Australian Manufacturing Council found<br />
that the level of return required by an Australian<br />
company raising funds in Australia for a no risk<br />
investment in Australia to be at least 20 percent </p>
<p>compared with about 10 percent for a Japanese or German<br />
company raising funds in their own country for investment<br />
in Australia. In these circumstances, what's the<br />
rationale for privatising OTC, Telecom, Aussat, Qantas,<br />
Australian Airlines or any other Government business<br />
enterprise? Surely, in the present economic<br />
circumstances, privatisation of these assets would be the<br />
sale of them abroad, rather than presenting an<br />
opportunity for Australians to become their owners. Do<br />
you think constitutional reform would overcome, would<br />
remedy the impossible situation of Australian companies,<br />
as identified by the AMC?<br />
PM: Well, let me take the last part first, David.<br />
Obviously I don't accept that Australian companies are in<br />
an impossible position. That proposition is repudiated<br />
by the evidence. If you want to look at the and I<br />
don't want to bore you with statistics, you know I'm<br />
capable of doing that, so I refrain from it, but I ask<br />
you to recall, without me going to the detail the move,<br />
that is the dramatic move that's occurred in this country<br />
over the last seven years, the move from wages share to<br />
profit share, that we've had investment at record levels<br />
and so on. I can go through those, but you know them,<br />
I've given them before. I don't want to take up the time<br />
in repeating them. I'm simply making the proposition,<br />
David, that it is an inaccuracy to say that Australian<br />
companies are in an impossible position and, indeed, it's<br />
a matter of a very considerable pride to me to be able to<br />
look at a range of Australian companies which are in fact<br />
in the manufacturing sector showing their compacity to<br />
compete internationally, take on the best in the world<br />
and beat them. Now that, however, having said that<br />
David, I'm not saying that with any sense of complacency<br />
because it would be absurd for any Australian Prime<br />
Minister, or any political figure in this country, to<br />
just sit back and say that we haven't got challenges we<br />
have. Now, you led into that question by talking about<br />
the issue of privatisation. Now I don't want to go into<br />
any detail about that other than to say this, that I<br />
don't think on either side of politics that we should<br />
allow ourselves to be locked into assumptions and<br />
attitudes of the past. And I say this to my own Party<br />
and, with deference, I say it to the other side of<br />
politics, it's absurd to be approaching, in my judgement,<br />
the question of the ownership of public assets on the<br />
basis of some blind ideology of the Right that public<br />
ownership is intrinsically bad or, on the side of my<br />
Party, to say that it is necessary to have in public<br />
ownership today, everything that was there in the past.<br />
I think what we've all got to do is approach this issue<br />
in terms of saying, well, there are priorities for<br />
Government and there will be increasing demands on<br />
Government for services in the field of health,<br />
education, welfare and so on. And particularly, we must<br />
in this country remember that one of the most important<br />
statistics is the aging of the population and with that<br />
aging of the population there are going to be demands </p>
<p>upon the services of Government, which the private sector<br />
will not provide. Nor is it proper that we expect of the<br />
private sector that they will. So my judgement about<br />
these things is a quite non ideological one. It is based<br />
upon the premise that I believe that governments should<br />
put themselves in the position to be best able to<br />
discharge those functions which only they, the<br />
Government, will discharge and consistent with a<br />
protection of the public interest. Now, if you have that<br />
framework, then it seems to me that there are some<br />
institutions which are currently publicly owned that<br />
would stay within public ownership because the public<br />
interest is best protected in that way. There are others<br />
that should not remain in that form. Now, I think if we<br />
make the right decisions, as a community, according to<br />
those criteria and on both sides of politics we are<br />
prepared to adopt that approach, then we'll all be better<br />
served and included in that will be the creation of a<br />
better environment within which Australian companies are<br />
going to be able to prosper.<br />
JOURNALIST: Following up from Don Woolford's question,<br />
the Treasurer has claimed that supervision of building<br />
societies has been tight in all States. How can this be<br />
reconciled against the fact that Pyramid was involved in<br />
relatively high risk investments for some time before its<br />
difficulties were revealed and, secondly, you talk about<br />
working towards a unified national approach that is<br />
obviously something that's a fair way down the track.<br />
The problems show no sign of stopping yet. In fact,<br />
there has been increased nervousness in New South Wales<br />
with the Aust-Wide group. What can you do now to restore<br />
investor confidence?<br />
PM: Well, the first thing I can do is to just remind you<br />
of what the Reserve Bank, which is, after all, the<br />
Federal Government's relevant institution in this<br />
respect, we've had the situation where the Reserve Bank<br />
has announced its intention to assist banks in providing<br />
liquidity to building societies that might, might be<br />
adversely affected by the fall out from the Farrow<br />
collapse in Victoria. So the Reserve Bank has said that<br />
and we should, in answer to your question, emphasise that<br />
as the first point. And going on from that to the rest<br />
of your question, what Paul has said and properly said,<br />
that there should not be panic, there have been different<br />
approaches in different States and my answer, which I<br />
gave was to the effect in which, I repeat, I believe that<br />
while it is not appropriate for the people of this<br />
country to expect that the Federal Government is going to<br />
overtake the, undertake the supervision of every deposit<br />
taking institution. I mean, it's just unrealistic in<br />
concept. What we do need, however, is to make sure that<br />
there is effective supervision. By definition, it must<br />
follow that not every State has been as effective as<br />
others in that supervision. So what I was just saying,<br />
in answer to the question was this, that we ought to put<br />
this on the agenda and not simply have it on the agenda </p>
<p>for the October Premiers' Conference, but ensure that<br />
work is done and I will ensure that that is undertaken,<br />
so that we can, as Premiers and as a Commonwealth,<br />
discuss what are the most effective sorts of forms of<br />
supervision to have within the States and to try and get<br />
that uniformly applied around the country. Now that's<br />
the challenge that's before us I think it's one that's<br />
easily capable of being met.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you have any sympathy<br />
with a suggestion from the EPAC paper today from Dr Ken<br />
Wiltshire, that what should be done fairly early in the<br />
piece, perhaps at the first Premiers' Conference, special<br />
Premiers' Conference, is that an inventory be drawn up of<br />
areas in which there is overlapping and then a Senate<br />
Committee be charged with the job of overseeing the<br />
dismantling of this duplication and the assurance that<br />
efficiency is on-going?<br />
PM: No, I don't think there's a need for the Senate<br />
Committee, I'm not here to denigrate the Senate and all<br />
it's good works, but I think that the process that I have<br />
suggested is the appropriate one. That is, I've<br />
indicated in very specific terms, I mean, whatever one<br />
says about the Hawke speech today it can't be accused of<br />
being unspecific, I've said now here are the areas, here<br />
are the processes that I see as appropriate. I've<br />
written, as I say, to the Premiers today, asked them to<br />
put on the table what they want to talk about. Now noone<br />
knows better than the Commonwealth and the States<br />
where the problems of duplication and overlap occur. Now<br />
we will, before we meet at the end of October, as a<br />
result of the processes that I've established and the<br />
request I've made to the States to nominate a person to<br />
work with Mike Codd in getting the papers prepared for<br />
the conference. By the time we get to that conference a<br />
great deal of work will have been done, Paul, in<br />
identifying very precisely, the areas and the nature, the<br />
dimension of the problems and then our responsibility, as<br />
leaders, then will be to say alright, here we can<br />
identify the areas of problem, now what are the things we<br />
want to work on first? What are the priorities? And may<br />
I say, in that respect, that I want to emphasise again<br />
what I said in the speech, I don't see and will reject<br />
any proposition about saying we're just going to have one<br />
long inquiry and wait for a report at the end of that<br />
process. What we should do is to say we are going to<br />
work on it case by case, deal with it issue by issue and<br />
more than, by definition, more than one issue being dealt<br />
with at a time and where you're in a position to make<br />
decisions, make them and not wait for the end of some<br />
long unspecified period. Now, if the Senate wants to,<br />
you know, address this issue I'm not here to say, you<br />
know, don't look at it. But I think the reality is that<br />
it is the Commonwealth and the States working<br />
cooperatively together, as I have proposed, that is the<br />
proper process of dealing with this problem. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you have promised that no<br />
oil exploration will threaten the Great Barrier Reef.<br />
Greenpeace today have asked you to clarify this pledge.<br />
How can you ensure that any exploration near the Great<br />
Barrier Reef Marine Park, particularly in the event of an<br />
accident such as an oil spill, will not threaten the<br />
reef? Would you need to look at legislation or special<br />
regulation in this area?<br />
PM: Let me make these points. As you will have seen<br />
from the press today I've already indicated that I will<br />
not countenance, simply will not countenance any drilling<br />
which would in any way endanger sensitive marine<br />
environments. That's not Just the Great Barrier Reef<br />
area but also there's the Lord Howe Island, there's the<br />
Shark Bay area in Western Australia. Now let me, before<br />
I go on from that, let it be understood that of course no<br />
drilling is proposed and wouldn't ever be contemplated<br />
no-one would be silly enough to put it up in our presence<br />
that there would be any drilling within the Great<br />
Barrier Reef Marine Park. But as to exploration in the<br />
Coral Sea or other places near environmentally sensitive<br />
areas, it may simply be that exploration is too risky.<br />
So what I'm saying is that any proposal that may be made<br />
in the future, any proposal to be made in the future,<br />
would be subjected to the strictest scientific and<br />
environmental analysis which assess relevant<br />
considerations such as, without being exhaustive, ocean<br />
currents, tidal movements. Let me say this, that at<br />
least, at least a year before any permanent area in the<br />
Coral Sea was considered, I say even considered for<br />
release, we would ask the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park<br />
Authority for a full assessment of the proposed<br />
declaration before any such exploration could even be<br />
further contemplated. Now I hope in spelling that out<br />
that I've made it crystal clear to everyone in this<br />
community, whether they be in the exploration industry or<br />
whether they be ordinary Australians concerned with the<br />
environment, that this Government will absolutely ensure,<br />
and rigorously have the processes to ensure that there is<br />
no way that these sensitive World Heritage areas can be<br />
endangered. JOURNALIST: Could you just expand on your comment here<br />
in the speech that the imperative of national economic<br />
management need not preclude worthwhile change in<br />
Commonwealth-State financial arrangements?<br />
PM: I'll try and put the setting for this. I think it<br />
is true that the States themselves accept and understand<br />
that in this modern day and age that there must be a<br />
central responsibility for macro-economic management.<br />
You can't in this interconnected world have a situation<br />
where Australia hasn't got within its national government<br />
a capacity for the control of the macro economy. They<br />
accept that, and as you know, when they were given the<br />
opportunity for getting back into the income tax field,<br />
which was offered by my predecessor, they didn't take </p>
<p>that up. Now having said that, the real challenge is to<br />
try, and it's a political and economic challenge, is to<br />
try and this imbalance that we have, this vertically<br />
integrated imbalance we have in the area of fiscal<br />
responsibility. Just a few statistics of interest in<br />
this regard I think. If you look at the total Government<br />
revenue raised in this country, the Commonwealth raises<br />
77% of it and spends 50% of total government expenditure.<br />
The States raise 20% of all government revenue and they<br />
spend 40% of all government expenditures. There's the<br />
imbalance and the other statistic, which is interesting,<br />
is that 51% of all States' government budget revenue<br />
comes from Commonwealth grants. That briefly is the<br />
problem. You have this imbalance between revenue raising<br />
responsibilities and obligations and the expenditure<br />
pattern. What therefore we've got to try and do, it<br />
seems to me, is to make sure that we don't do anything<br />
that is going to in any way effectively derogate from the<br />
capacity of the national government to conduct microeconomic<br />
policy, but to do what we can to give the States<br />
some opportunity of having a greater sense of involvement<br />
in their revenue raising. There may be a limit to how<br />
far you can go there but that's why in fact I've<br />
announced today that we'll get out of BADT, the Bank<br />
Accounts Deposit Tax that's currently bringing in some<br />
$ 400 million. We will get out of that, obviously with<br />
the adjustment of the FAGS, the Financial Assistance<br />
Grants, because we're not here FAGS and BADTs, and<br />
FIDs. But the States are not expecting a bonus out of<br />
this. But what that will mean now, that by us getting<br />
out they will be able to operate that tax and put it at a<br />
level which they believe is consistent with their needs<br />
and with their other economic considerations. So that's<br />
the challenge we've got and I think that what I've said<br />
is indicative of the fact that we are serious about this<br />
approach. May I say Paul, when I raised these matters,<br />
really adumbrated them at the Premiers' Conference, there<br />
was a very very positive approach from the States. In<br />
other words they accept the sincerity of what we're<br />
about, that is to get a more effective co-operative<br />
basis. But they also, that's within the framework where<br />
I'm sure that they accept the fundamental point I make<br />
about the need, in terms of the interests of every<br />
citizen in this country, to have the capacity for macroeconomic<br />
management firmly in the hands of the national<br />
government. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, is there any basis, I should<br />
say is one of the reasons now for the push for reform in<br />
both Federal-State relations and the Constitution<br />
anything to do with the fact that some of the greatest<br />
impediments to change I'm talking about Joh Bjekle-<br />
Petersen and Premier Gray of Tasmania, are now left the<br />
political scene. Have we in place now a set of Premiers<br />
that you will find personally conducive to change,<br />
including Nick Greiner? </p>
<p>PM: I guess one should say they politically de mortis<br />
nihil nisi bonum, which means for those that are<br />
politically buggered, don't say anything ill. So Joh and<br />
Robin have departed the scene and I speak no ill of them.<br />
I just speak positively and say that I believe there has<br />
not been a more propitious time, looking at the States,<br />
and may I say looking at the Federal Government as well,<br />
there hasn't been a more propitious conjunction of<br />
political circumstances that we have today. I think the<br />
quality of leadership at the States is high. I think<br />
there's a very serious commitment to the processes of<br />
change and there certainly is at our level. Let me say<br />
in fairness, so that there'll be no implication that I'm<br />
simply reflecting on the fact that there's an<br />
overwhelming majority of Labor Premiers, let me say in<br />
fairness to Premier Greiner that both at the Premiers'<br />
Conference and in the observations that he's made and the<br />
attitude he's expressed, I believe that in Greiner we<br />
have a very responsive Premier. So it hasn't happened<br />
because of the changes to which you've referred, but<br />
having said that I don't think there's ever been a more<br />
congenial political environment for change of the sort<br />
that I'm trying to initiate.<br />
JOURNALIST: Victoria's become something of a disaster<br />
area for the Labor Party both at a State level and<br />
federally. What do you think John Cain can and should do<br />
to try to revive State Labor fortunes there and what will<br />
be your strategy to try to get a better result federally<br />
in Victoria next time?<br />
PM: I can't embrace the exact language of disaster area<br />
Michelle. Let me say this, that it would be absurd for<br />
me to try and deny the fact that Labor's fortunes in<br />
Victoria are not low. They are. But what I have to<br />
suggest to John Cain and his government, and obviously it<br />
will be something that I won't address via the Press Club<br />
but more directly in private conversation with him.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Likewise.<br />
JOURNALIST: I want to just clarify something in your<br />
speech in relation to your willingness to make the issue<br />
of untied grants a matter for review. Now in parts of<br />
your speech you acknowledge the need, a continuing need<br />
for uniformity, or the drive for uniformity in the<br />
delivery of services. On the other hand you recognise<br />
the frustration of the States about the fact that some<br />
of their grants from the Commonwealth is now in the<br />
form of tied grants.<br />
PM: It's just over 40 per cent Milton, now.<br />
JOURNALIST: Right. And the reason of course for those<br />
tied grants has largely been the drive by the<br />
Commonwealth Government to achieve uniformity in the </p>
<p>8<br />
delivery of services. But at the same time it's the<br />
strings attached to these grants which of course has led<br />
to a lot of the overlap and duplication. How do you<br />
resolve that sort of dilemma?<br />
PM: Just to give you some idea of how this picture has<br />
changed over the years, as I said interjection to<br />
Milton, it's just over 40% of our payments to the States<br />
now are tied grants. And that's quite a massive<br />
increase. If you go back to 1948-49 it was then only<br />
So that's a very, very significant increase. Now<br />
obviously we want to have a situation that if in a<br />
particular area we believe that there are certain<br />
standards and approaches that ought to be kept, but that<br />
the delivery of a program is better done by the States,<br />
then the challenge that we'll have in these discussions<br />
is how, through discussion, we can get an acceptance of<br />
certain standards and concepts, without having for them<br />
the stringencies that are associated with funds being<br />
tied. So that will be one area. There may simply be<br />
other areas that will come out of discussion Milton where<br />
we would simply come to the conclusion well it's best<br />
that we're out of it. You deal with that as you will.<br />
But as I say, in other areas where we think we have a<br />
responsibility for having some sort of national standard<br />
or approach, it will simply be a question of saying well,<br />
can we get an acceptance of these sorts of standards, but<br />
without the stringencies of a tied grant? Now I don't<br />
think that that is beyond intelligent and committed<br />
political leaders to achieve. And it's also, the other<br />
side of it, there may well be some areas Milton, in which<br />
the States may say, I don't know, that their view is that<br />
it's better that they be out and it will be over to us<br />
and then that sort or problem doesn't arise.<br />
JOURNALIST: There seems to have been a fairly<br />
conspicuous silence from Government members this week in<br />
response to the increasingly loud calls from senior<br />
members of the Government controlled airlines. I wonder<br />
if you could tell us what your position's been on the<br />
calls from Australian Airlines in particular, from Mr<br />
Harris, involving a 50 sale of it's island resorts as<br />
well as partial buy out or equity swaps involving foreign<br />
airlines? PM: Well I haven't been exactly silent on this issue<br />
over the years, but I'll really just do two things. I'll<br />
refer to the answer I gave earlier here Palita. I think<br />
both parties have got to be prepared to look at these<br />
issues without the blinkers of the past. I think that<br />
certainly applies to my side and the other side of<br />
politics on this issue. I have said before I think, that<br />
running airlines, having a total government involvement<br />
in running airlines, is not my sense, is not my sense of<br />
proper priorities. But I have gone out of my way to make<br />
clear that I want to conduct this discussion within the<br />
Party. There are signs that that discussion is going<br />
ahead in a fairly constructive way at the moment and not </p>
<p>9<br />
just in terms of the committee that has been set up to<br />
consider some of these issues at the federal party level.<br />
And I think there are groups right throughout the Party<br />
who are discussing this issue quite constructively and<br />
rationally and I welcome that. But I don't think I would<br />
help those processes by going any further than that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Another national issue of micro economic<br />
reform is that of telecommunications. It seems that the<br />
Government is headed towards some form of megacom<br />
arrangement in that area combining Telecom and OTC as the<br />
major player, with competition from Aussat and perhaps<br />
some private capital from overseas. Many critics have<br />
suggested this is a second best solution and that<br />
competition would be enhanced if OTC became the basis of<br />
the second player. Do you agree with some of this<br />
criticism and do you believe the Government could be<br />
ambitious in it's reform of telecommunications?<br />
PM: Let me make it clear what the ambitions of the<br />
Government are in this area. The ambitions go to what<br />
you deliver. And I'll give you this assurance as to what<br />
will come out of the processes of consideration by the<br />
Government. I can guarantee that out of the processes<br />
that we are going through there will be across the board<br />
effective competition to Telecom, involving both<br />
appropriate interconnection arrangements into Telecom's<br />
network which is a critical issue for anyone who knows<br />
anything about this. And there will be also a<br />
pro-competitive role for a regulatory agency. And the<br />
third guarantee I give is that in regard to rural and<br />
household users, they will not be disadvantaged. So<br />
there are the three ambitions. There are the three<br />
commitments. Now there is obviously discussion around<br />
the issue of possible co-locations of the three existing<br />
carriers, vis a vis any new private competitive forces<br />
that may come in. Now those issues will be discussed and<br />
decided within the Cabinet and the Party in the very near<br />
future. But I repeat Steve, the three things that are<br />
important, which I eluded to at the beginning, will be<br />
delivered. ends </p>
