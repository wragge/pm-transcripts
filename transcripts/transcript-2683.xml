COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. W. MeMAHON, M. P.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
ON<br />
Redistribution of States into Electoral Divisions<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 28 September 1972]<br />
Mr McMAHON ( Lowe-Prime Minister)<br />
-by leave-I desire to inform the House<br />
that as required by the Representation Act<br />
1905-1964, the Chief Electoral Officer has<br />
ascertained the numbers of the people of<br />
the Commonwealth and the -numbers of the<br />
people of the several States consequent upon<br />
the taking of the census on 30th June 1971.<br />
Copies of the Chief Electoral Officer's certificate<br />
specifying The said numbers have<br />
been tabled. Pursuant -to sections 9 and 10<br />
of the Representation Act the, Chief<br />
Electoral Officer has determined the<br />
number of members of the House of<br />
Representatives to be chosen for The<br />
several States. As a result of that determination<br />
the representation for Western<br />
Australia will be increased by one member<br />
as from the first general election held aftcr<br />
that State has been redistributed into<br />
electoral divisions. Section 25 of the Commonwealth<br />
Electoral Act provides:<br />
25( 1.) A re-distribution of any State into divisions<br />
shall be made in the manner hereinbefore<br />
provided whenever directed by the Governor-<br />
General by proclamation.<br />
Such proclamation may be madewhenever<br />
an alteration is made in the number<br />
of members of the House of Representatives<br />
to be elected for the State; and<br />
20374172 whenever in one-fourth of the divisions of<br />
the State the number of the electors differs<br />
from a quota ascertained in the manner<br />
provided in this part to a greater extent<br />
than one-filth more or one-fifth less; and<br />
at such other times as the Governor-<br />
General thinks fit.<br />
It will be noted that Western Australia<br />
qualifies for a redistribution under the provisions<br />
of Section 25<br />
The Chief Electoral Officer -has advised<br />
the Government that there is not now sufficient<br />
; time to give effect to a redistribution<br />
of any State before the forthcoming House<br />
of Representatives elections. Nevertheless,<br />
the Government believes that it has an<br />
obligation to set in motion the machinery<br />
for -a redistribution of Western Australia<br />
so as to ensure that that State gains its<br />
entitlement of an extra member from the<br />
beginning of the 29th Parliament. The<br />
Government therefore proposes to recommend<br />
to the Governor-General the appointmeint<br />
of distribution commissioners for<br />
Western Australia. Although there has been<br />
some shift of population in the other States,<br />
there is no requirement at present for a<br />
redistribution in any State other than Western<br />
Australia and consideration in respect<br />
of those States will be deferred for the time<br />
being. W. G. MuRRAy, Government Printer, Canberra </p>
