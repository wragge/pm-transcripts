COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt. Hon. SIR ROBERT MENZIES,<br />
M. P.,<br />
ON<br />
UNIERSITIES ( Financial Assistance) BIUl 1964.<br />
Second Reading.<br />
[ From the " Parliamentary Debates," 11Ith November, 1964.]<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES ( Kooyong-<br />
Prime Minister) [ 12.25].-I move-<br />
That the Bill be now read a second time.<br />
* This Bill, and the States Grants ( Universities)<br />
Bill, which I will introduce shortly,<br />
relate to the same subject-academic salaries-<br />
and I propose Sir, with your per-<br />
. msissipon, teo deeal wicth bhoth . Bi lls in this<br />
Last October I announced the<br />
intention of the Government to establish<br />
an inquiry to recommend the level of<br />
university salaries which we should support<br />
for grant purposes from the beginning of<br />
the current triennium, namely 1st January<br />
1964. 1 said then that, as an interim<br />
measure, the Commonwealth would offer<br />
to the States for recurrent expenditure by<br />
the universities grants calculated on the<br />
' basis of a professorial rate of Å 4,600 per<br />
annum. This rate would be payable from<br />
1st July 1963. As it was higher than the<br />
rate upon which the 1963 legislation was<br />
based, I undertook also to introduce amending<br />
legislation to provide the -supplementary<br />
funds required on the Commonwealth's part<br />
to support the new salary levels.<br />
14786/ 64. The Government asked Mr. Justice<br />
Eggleston to inquire into university salaries.<br />
His report has been received and was tabled<br />
yesterday. All honorable members will<br />
agree, I feel sure, that we are much indebted<br />
to Mr. Justice Eggleston, and to those who<br />
assisted him, for the thorough and lucid<br />
report which has been -furnished to the<br />
Government. Mr. Justice Eggleston has recommended<br />
a standard salary of Å 5,200 for professors<br />
and a standard salary of Å 4,300 for<br />
associate professors and readers. The Government<br />
has decided to accept these recommendations.<br />
In addition, however, in the<br />
process of arriving at his recommendations<br />
Mr. Justice Eggleston assumed that a reasonable<br />
minimum of the salary range to be<br />
paid to a lecturer would -be Å 2,400 -per<br />
annum, and a reasonable maximum of the<br />
salary range to be paid to a senior lecturer<br />
would be Å 3,800 per annum. Having noted<br />
that Mr. Justice Eggleston recommended a<br />
single salary for an associate professor or<br />
a reader, and not a salary range, we accept<br />
his suggestions for the salary ranges of<br />
lecturers and senior lecturers. </p>
<p>It is now necessary to do two things. The<br />
first is to amend the States Grants ( Universities)<br />
Act 1960-1963 to provide Commonwealth<br />
support appropriate to a basic<br />
professorial salary of Å 4,600 per annum for<br />
the period 1st July 1963 to 31st December<br />
1963. This is to cover the original provision.<br />
The second Bill does this by providing<br />
an additional Å 175,000 of Commonwealth<br />
money on condition that Å 318,000<br />
is provided in additional fees and State<br />
grants. This is the usual formula.<br />
The second need is to amend the Universities<br />
( Financial Assistance) Act to provide<br />
for our acceptance of Mr. Justice<br />
Eggleston's proposals. That is the purpose<br />
of the first Bill, but I emphasise that this is<br />
an interim measure only. We received the<br />
report on 30th October. Therefore there<br />
has ; been insufficient time to obtain from<br />
the States the detailed information necessary<br />
to enable accurate figures to be inserted in<br />
the First Schedule for recurrent expenditure<br />
in each of the years 1964, 1965 and<br />
1966. This Bill provides provisional figures<br />
for 1964 only. These indicate an increase<br />
of Å 1.3 million in the Commonwealth<br />
offer to a new total of Å 12.3 million. The<br />
corresponding figures for fees and State contributions<br />
are a Å 2.4 million increase to a<br />
new total of Å 22.8 million. As soon as<br />
practicable the Universities Commission<br />
will recommend final figures for 1964 as<br />
well as new figures for 1965 and 1966.<br />
It will do this on the basis of information<br />
received from the universities and the States,<br />
including information -about the levels of<br />
salaries adopted. I think it is appropriate<br />
that I emphasise once more that the salaries<br />
actually paid in a State university are<br />
ultimately a matter for each university and<br />
the State Government under whose authority<br />
it has been established.<br />
A State university may, in fact, pay<br />
salaries either higher or lower than those<br />
approved for grant purposes by the Commonwealth.<br />
If higher salaries are paid, no<br />
assistance will be forthcoming from the<br />
Commonwealth toward the cost of the<br />
excess. It would by my understanding that<br />
if salaries lower than the levels approved<br />
by the Commonwealth are paid, the amounts<br />
payable by the Commonwealth in respect<br />
of academic salaries would be limited to<br />
our share, according to the established formula, of the salaries actually paid. I think<br />
that all will agree that it would not -be<br />
reasonable for Commonwealth money,<br />
specifically offered as our share of the cost<br />
of higher salaries, to be used for other purposes,<br />
should salaries ' be adopted below the<br />
level on which our offer was made.<br />
I should add at this point that the Government<br />
views sympathetically the suggestion<br />
made in chapter 6 of the report that<br />
limited provision should be made for additional<br />
funds from which loadings to professorial<br />
salaries should be paid in certain<br />
individual cases where there is a desire to<br />
recognise particular merit. This is distin*<br />
from the established practice of paying'<br />
differential salaries to holders of certain<br />
Chairs. The Act to which we are now<br />
giving our attention applies only to<br />
State universities, but I take this<br />
opportunity of saying that, so f<br />
as academic salaries at the Australian'<br />
National University are concerned, the Government<br />
will adopt a similar policy to that<br />
which I have just described. In broad terms<br />
this means that in the School of General<br />
Studies in that University we shall recognise<br />
for grant purposes the four salary points<br />
already mentioned. In the ' Institute of<br />
Advanced Studies we would envisage a continuation<br />
of a loading broadly similar to<br />
that now paid, giving a basic professorial<br />
salary of Å 5,700 a year. The details of<br />
salaries at the Australian National University&amp;<br />
will , be settled in consultation with the W<br />
Council of the University and with the<br />
advice of the Universities Commission.<br />
There is another matter not related to the<br />
Bills now before us, but arising from the<br />
report, on which I take the present oppor-O<br />
tunity to indicate Government policy. Our<br />
experience with the recent inquiry has convinced<br />
us that this kind of machinery is<br />
perhaps the most satisfactory means we can<br />
devise for arriving at a measure of academic<br />
salaries for the purpose of fixing the level<br />
of Commonwealth grants for university<br />
purposes. Therefore, as suggested by Mr.<br />
Justice Eggleston, we stand ready to employ<br />
this kind of machinery again; we are not,<br />
however, prepared to adopt any specific<br />
period between reviews. That must depend<br />
on circumstances. I commend this Bill to<br />
the House.<br />
