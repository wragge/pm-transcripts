    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, how valuable is this pension rise for the war widows?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's a full passing on, beyond our election commitment,</p>
<p> of a $6.80 a fortnight increase for all war widows throughout Australia,</p>
<p> of which there are about 100,000. We have linked the pension to 25</p>
<p> per cent of male average weekly ordinary time earnings and we've</p>
<p> decided, although it wasn't part of our commitment to do so,</p>
<p> to go beyond that and to extend this increase to war widows. And it's</p>
<p> a mark of the appreciation that Australia feels towards mainly women,</p>
<p> but not all women. There are some men who are beneficiaries of this</p>
<p> - those people who either died in war or have since died. And it's</p>
<p> an act of national gratitude and a token that we should always remain</p>
<p> very grateful and in debt to those who lost their loved ones in defence</p>
<p> of our country.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, the Premiers would say that these are the sort of people</p>
<p> who would suffer from the Medicare stand-off. Did they express any</p>
<p> concerns about that or nursing homes, topics like that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, they didn't.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, how do you respond to Donald McDonald's criticism</p>
<p> that the Government hasn't liaised enough with the National Party</p>
<p> on guns and Telstra?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we liaise with everybody. As far as guns are concerned, we had</p>
<p> an agreement and all I'm doing is upholding the agreement that</p>
<p> all the governments made. And I just say again that I will not compromise</p>
<p> in any way on that uniform agreement. The Australian people want it</p>
<p> in force, to the letter, in full, without qualification. That is all</p>
<p> I'm doing. I'm not trying to change it. I'm not the</p>
<p> bloke who's trying to change the agreement. I think others are</p>
<p> trying to nibble away at the edges, but I'm not. And I don't</p>
<p> regard it as a minor matter. I regard it as a very important matter.</p>
<p> The gun culture is something we want to keep out of Australia. We</p>
<p> don't want dangerous weapons easily available to people in this</p>
<p> country. The gun culture is something that is abhorrent to Australians</p>
<p> and I will do all in my power to stop it coming into this country</p>
<p> and I don't care who criticises it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But does it reflect renewed tensions within the Coalition?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it doesn't. Every so often you get a bit of a salvo like</p>
<p> that. I'm not the least bit concerned about it. I have very good</p>
<p> relations with the National Party and they with me and we're</p>
<p> a very strong Coalition. You couldn't have a better Deputy Prime</p>
<p> Minister than Tim Fischer. He's a great fighter for the bush</p>
<p> and a great fighter for the Nats but he works very closely with me.</p>
<p> And I regard what the President said as the normal from periodic comments,</p>
<p> which you would expect in a Coalition which has a lively relationship.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Could APEC be doing more in Asia? Do you agree with Mr Keating's</p>
<p> view?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I haven't read the speech.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well, do you think APEC's had a big enough role, I mean...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think APEC's done a good job. But APEC is an organisation that's</p>
<p> dedicated to expanding trade. It is not an international financial</p>
<p> institution. I think it's a confusion in the former Prime Minister's</p>
<p> mind about the respective roles. It's the role of the IMF to</p>
<p> buttress the financial system. It's the role of APEC to promote</p>
<p> free trade within the region. They are two quite different roles.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, are you tempted to pull the double dissolution trigger?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's a beautiful morning here in Canberra. It's autumn.</p>
<p> Canberra is at its most lovely in autumn and I enjoy the ambience</p>
<p> of the place. An election is a long way from my mind. But what is</p>
<p> not from my mind is the 50,000 jobs that have been prevented - the</p>
<p> 50,000 jobs that have been destroyed by the Labor Party's destruction</p>
<p> of this very sensible bill. Once again the Labor Party has set its</p>
<p> face against small business. Small business has told us that if this</p>
<p> law had gone through, 50,000 new jobs in Australia could be created</p>
<p> because the fear in the hearts of small business about the present</p>
<p> law would be removed and they would be embolden to take on new staff.</p>
<p> So it's a simple choice - the Labor Party wants to destroy jobs</p>
<p> in small business, we want to promote them.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
