PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA MONDAY, 9 FEBRUARY, 1981<br />
ADDRESS TO COMMONW1EALTH CLUB LUNCHEON<br />
ADELAIDE<br />
1981 will be a year in which North-South issues feature very<br />
prominently both in international affairs generally and in<br />
Australia-' s foreign policy in particular. By North-South issues,<br />
I refer to the search for solutions to those grave human<br />
problems which affect the less developed countries. Decisions<br />
taken during its course or the failure to take them may have<br />
far-reaching consequences for the rest of this century and beyond.<br />
Ari important-round of global negotiations between developing<br />
and developed countries is scheduled to take place this year.<br />
In addition, a summit meeting arising from the recommendations<br />
of the Brandt Report is contemplated. And as far as Australia is<br />
concerned, the fact that we shall be hosting the Commonwealth<br />
Heads of Government Meeting in September focusses our attention<br />
sharply on NOrth-Soth issues.-This meeting will be the largest<br />
international conference ever held in Australia and the<br />
overwhelming majority of the Heads of Government attending will<br />
be from Third World countries.<br />
In recent years the Commonwealth has demonstrated that it has<br />
the capacity to make a constructive contribution to the resolution<br />
of North-South economic and political problems. The London<br />
Conference of 1977 resulted in an initiative on the Common Fund<br />
which was important in creating movement at a time when others<br />
were holding back. It also produced the Gleneagles Declaration<br />
on spQrt-and apartheid...<br />
The Lusaka Conference of 1979 played a decisive role in solving<br />
the seemingly intractable problem of Zimbabwe. On Australia's<br />
initiative, it also gave rise to study by a Commonwealth group<br />
of experts of factors inhibiting structural change and sustained<br />
impr-ovement in economic . growth and that group has since produced<br />
a valuable report. In addition, Commonwealth leaders played<br />
a prominent part in convening, and as participants in, the<br />
successful Runaway Bay meeting on global economic issues held<br />
in Jamaica in 1978. / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
These forthcoming events on the diplomatic calendar are<br />
important in their own right. But beyond that, they are important<br />
because they bring our attention to bear sharply on the basic,<br />
enduring problems of the Third World, problems which are already<br />
very grave and which if neglected will reach crisis proportions.<br />
It is one of the great merits of the Brandt Report one that<br />
transcends some reservations about particular parts and aspects<br />
of it that it restates these problems eloquently and compellingly.<br />
Abraham Lincoln once said that a house divided against itself<br />
cannot stand. He said that in the context of the division and<br />
travail of . a great country. But it is now surely applicable to<br />
relations between the developed and developing countries of<br />
the world that, after all, is what that much used word<br />
" interdependence" means.<br />
The problems of North-South relations must be understood and<br />
. tackled in-this-spirit. Not. in. a routine, business-as-usual mood.<br />
Not on the assumption that the smart thing to do is to leave them<br />
on the back-burner for as long as possible and play for time.<br />
And not in a polemical or confrontationalist spirit. But with<br />
vision and a sense of urgency; with the acknowledgement that<br />
time is a wasting asset; with an awareness that ultimately our<br />
fates are linked;-and with a -recognition that failure will have,<br />
disastrous consequences, not only for those who would suffer<br />
materially and physically as a result, but for all those who have<br />
a stake in peace and world order.<br />
Australia has such a stake. And because we too have a colonial<br />
' h8tcir17 be-cause we live in'close proximity to Third World<br />
countries, because our economy depends largely on the export of<br />
commodities and the import of capital and technology, we are almost<br />
uniquely placed from among developed countries to appreciate<br />
the concerns of the Third World. It is against this background<br />
that I want-to set out my thinking on North-South issues.<br />
I will start by referring back to a speech I prepared for<br />
presentation in this city last November and which was delivered<br />
by Senator Chaney on my behalf. In it I sought to spell out the<br />
Government's understanding of Liberal philosophy and its practical<br />
application to the business of Government. I stressed the<br />
Government's fundamental commitment to a free and open society,,<br />
to limiting the role and power of the State, to the private<br />
enterprise economic system. The Government is committed to these<br />
objectives because of its belief that policies based on them will<br />
do most to improve the lives of ordinary people.<br />
I also stressed the need for a Government which values the<br />
individual to maintain a framework of continuity in a period of<br />
rapid change; and to ensure that in liberating forces of change<br />
those who suffer as a result are given protection and help to<br />
adjust to new circumstances. What is economically most desirable<br />
hasto-be weighed in th-ebalance against broader values and . n<br />
some instances has to give way to them. / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
The true art of government in a free country like ours consists<br />
of finding the path to economic prosperity which expresses<br />
humane and compassionate respect for individual people, which<br />
reconciles innovation with continuity and order.<br />
The Government's position on North-South issues is entirely<br />
consistent with all of this. We believe, that is, that just as a<br />
basically liberal, Ifarket oriented economic system is best<br />
domestically, so it also best serves the interests of the<br />
international community. But we also believe that such a system<br />
works best indeed can only work when people have the<br />
certainty that their personal interests and security are<br />
protected and when there are accepted standards of co-operation<br />
and fair dealing. Our approach to North-South issues has<br />
reflected and will continue to reflect the importance of this<br />
belief. There are clearly two-categories of issues involved -in the<br />
North-South dialogue: those urgent practical problems health,<br />
food, education, technical assistance to which any developed<br />
country which has the will can make a contribution; and, secondly,<br />
the large structural and systemic issues raised by the Third<br />
World proposal for a new international economic order and by<br />
-other proponents of far-reaching changes.<br />
In the nature of things Australia's effort is concentrated on<br />
the first issues, for it is with respect to them that we have<br />
most to offer. It is only the major industrial countries which<br />
have the means the capital, the-technology, the managerial skills,<br />
the markets and the political power to enable substantial<br />
progress to be made on the second. This is recognised by the<br />
special position they occupy in managing the international economy.<br />
But if the major industrial countries have the means, do. they<br />
have the motivation? Why should they concern themselves with<br />
the needs of the developing countries? Some would answer these<br />
questions in humanitarian terms and it is morally legitimate<br />
to do so. When we contemplate the terrible suffering and<br />
degradation which are a routine part of life in many Third World<br />
countries and when we bear in mind the professed values of Western<br />
societies., the humanitarian case. is unanswerable. Having said<br />
that, however, realism requires the recognition that Governments<br />
rarely make major, sustained policy commitments on humanitarian<br />
grounds alone, that they exist primarily to look after the<br />
interests of their own countries.<br />
Agai-some, both.-in -the-oWest-itself. and in the Third World,<br />
argue the case in terms of an alleged historical guilt for the<br />
plight of Third World countries. The West, it is said, should<br />
make amends for past exploitation. I do not believe this is a<br />
productive argument. For one thing, the record of relations<br />
between the West and what is now the Third World is much more<br />
complex, various and debatable than it suggests. / 4 </p>
<p>4<br />
But even leaving aside the difficult question of the merits of the<br />
case, it is true, as one Third World economist has recently<br />
observed, that making a group of countries feel guilty is hardly<br />
a brilliant strategy for soliciting its co-operation. It is more<br />
likely to induce resentment and acrimony, and in fact it has<br />
done so in recent years.<br />
I suggest that a much sounder basis on which to approach the<br />
Governments of the major industrialised countries is provided by<br />
enlightened self-interest. These Governments should work<br />
energetically to solve the problems of North-South relations<br />
because if they do they will benefit and if they do not their<br />
interests will . suffer very seriously; that is where the most<br />
compelling motivation is to be found.<br />
To underline the mutuality of interests involved it is necessary<br />
only to point out that Third World countries take about one-quarter<br />
of Western exports and in the case of the United States and<br />
Japan, they-take a -considerably-higher proportion. This represents<br />
hundreds of thousands of jobs in the developed industrial countries.<br />
During the past decade the fact that a number of Third World<br />
countries, including several in our region, maintained levels of<br />
growth far above the world average, prevented the recession in the<br />
developed countries from being more severe than it was. Economic<br />
self-interest requires a recognition of the link between the<br />
under-utilised capital of the North and the growing market<br />
potential of the South, of the shifting comparative advantage between<br />
North and South in labour-intensive industries, and of the connection<br />
between achieving a satisfactory international energy regime and<br />
progress in other-aeas of the North-South dialogue.<br />
Overridingly, it requires the recognition of the need for the<br />
co-operation with the 120 countries which constitute the Third<br />
World countries which account for over 70% of the world's<br />
population if the existing economic order is to remain<br />
substantially in being. That co-operation will only be forthcoming<br />
if it is clearly apparent that the benefits of that order are<br />
mutual that they apply to the have-nots as well as the haves,<br />
to those who are on their way as well as to those who have arrived.<br />
Reform and flexibility which serve this purpose are not the<br />
enemies of. that order, they are . among.. the conditions . for its survival,<br />
It is proper that we should take account of the serious economic<br />
problems currently confronting the world economy as a consequence<br />
of unchecked inflation. We should be aware of the budgetary and<br />
monetary restraints these impose on developed and developing<br />
countries alike.... But-we. must not . allow these problems to force us<br />
to adopt short-sighted defensive policies which would add a crushing<br />
weight to the considerable burdens the developing countries already<br />
bear especially the oil importing countries, which are expected<br />
to face deficits of $ 80 billion in 1981. </p>
<p>If we were to act in ways which would severely set back the<br />
development of these countries or deny them the rewards for<br />
success when they achieve it which is what resorting to<br />
protectionist devices against the exports of newly industrialising<br />
countries does the result would inevitably be a turning away,.<br />
from the open, liberal trading framework we are seeking to<br />
maintain. Even-more severe than the problems of those countries which have<br />
started on the road of industrialisation and trade are the<br />
problems of the very poor countries. It is essential that these<br />
problems do not remain as abstractions but are visualised in r: eal.<br />
human terms. These ' are, for example, the problems of poor farmers<br />
in much of Africa and the sub-continent who try to till hard,<br />
arid soil with wooden ploughs. Quite simply, until they are<br />
provided with steel ploughs or better still with tractors -and<br />
assistance to irrigate and fertilise their land, they are doomed<br />
to. an unending . cycrle of . poverty, to. bare subsistence even in<br />
" good" years.<br />
There are tens of millions of people who are so doomed, ada<br />
long as they are, not only do they continue to suffer but the<br />
world economy-is impoverished. Is there not, then, a compelling<br />
*. mutual interest in breaking that cycle, in. converting what ar,-<br />
now clients into consumers and customers? But it is not simpl. y<br />
a matter of economic interest.<br />
Political self-interest also requires preventing the intensification<br />
of an adversary relationship between the developed Western<br />
countries-and the-Third World. As. recent experience in Iran. has<br />
shown, if the atmosphere deteriorates sufficiently, economic<br />
rationality becomes subordinate to political passion and a general<br />
turning away from Western allies, Western institutions and<br />
Western connections is likely to result. Again, strategic<br />
self-interest requires avoiding situations of chaos, breakdown<br />
and-violenice which invite exploitation-by the Soviet Union -and<br />
its clients or which create regional conflicts inimical to<br />
international peace and stability.<br />
East-West rivalry and North-South issues do not exist independently<br />
of each other; they are already enmeshed and if conditions in<br />
the'Thilrd World are allowed to' det6riorate further', the ) risk of<br />
super power conflict there will be greatly increased. That risk<br />
will be particularly acute during the next few years when the<br />
military advantage of the Soviet Union will be at its greatest.<br />
The appalling record-of the Soviet Union and the other Eastern<br />
European countries as economic aid givers to the Third World<br />
combined with their extremely impressive record as suppliers of<br />
arms, is the clearest indication that they see their interests<br />
as lying in the promotion and exploitation of instability and. violenc(<br />
In dealing with North-South issues economic considerations have a<br />
key role but as part of a broader perspective. The Government<br />
has always recognised this. / 6 </p>
<p>6<br />
At no time has the Government approached the North-South<br />
dialogue solely in terms of economic rationality and without<br />
paying careful regard to political and social factors. Arising<br />
as they do from profound and multiple changes in the international<br />
community demographic, cultural, social, political, technological<br />
as well as economic ones those issues are not amenable to<br />
solution simply by the application of economic rationality.<br />
They require to be tackled at the highest level, with a breadth<br />
of vision commensurate with the profundity of structural changes<br />
involved and the issues at stake.<br />
In recognising the critical nature of the problems and the fact<br />
that the important initiatives are needed from the major developed<br />
countries, I am not suggesting that the latter must accept all<br />
the rhetoric and demands of the developing countries at<br />
their face value. On the contrary, I think it is clear that the<br />
sooner the language of demands and accusations on the one side,<br />
and-theohabit of-lecturing and prevarication on the other, give<br />
way to discourse based on a real recognition of mutual interest,<br />
the better it will be.<br />
While initiatives from developed countries are essential,<br />
developing countries need to make sure, as many have, that their<br />
domes-tic,-political and economic--rrangements are so organised<br />
that they can take advantage of any opportunities that offer.<br />
There is a mutuality of obligation and responsibility as well. as<br />
of interest.<br />
It must also be recognised that the case for international reform<br />
and ad j, stxmnnts will be greatly strengthened and the climate for<br />
them greatly improved if more Third World countries adopt<br />
policies which stimulate growth and development and permit<br />
increased participation in world trade. In this respect the<br />
countries of our own region and the other newly industrialising<br />
countries have given a magnificent example of the transformation<br />
that can be achieved in a short period of time in some cases<br />
with very little in the way of natural resources.<br />
I have said that serious progress on the central North-South<br />
issues depends on the willingness of the major industrial powers<br />
to, give a lead. I have made it clear that. I think they should<br />
give such a lead. But I also wish to make it clear that<br />
Australia does not intend to wait passively for them to do so.<br />
The fact that we can have comparatively little effect on the<br />
progress of the main issues is no reason for neglecting to do<br />
what is within our means. The Australian Government has already<br />
demonstrated its positive attitude........<br />
Nearly three years ago, I accounced the setting up of a high level<br />
committee to conduct a comprehensive enquiry into Australia's<br />
relations with the Third World. To the best of my knowledge,<br />
Australia is the first Western country to take this step. / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
Basing its findings firmly on a perception of Australia's<br />
national interests, conceived in a long-term enlightened way,<br />
that committee advocated that Australia'should play a constructive<br />
role on North-South issues, that it should seek to facilitate<br />
compromise and co-operation and to ensure that Third World<br />
views receive fair and reasoned consideration in the councils<br />
of the developed countries. It advocated that Australia should<br />
be resourceful, innovative and positive in seeking practicable<br />
ways of satisfying Third World needs. It argued that Australia<br />
should formulate its policies in terms of its own needs and<br />
perspectives and should not assume that we must always follow<br />
the prevailing western line towards the Third World. And it<br />
maintained that developed countries should respond in good time<br />
to the moderate elements in the Third World rather than wait<br />
until its mood became radical and extreme.<br />
The Government has acted and will continue to act in terms<br />
of these guidelines. In practical terms, Australia has already<br />
been working in the resourceful, innovative and positive way<br />
recommended by the committee to further the interests of the<br />
Third World. We have done so-particularly though certainly not<br />
exclusively within the contexts of the Commonwealth and the<br />
region, with our initiative to create a Regional Commonwealth<br />
Heads of Government Meeting combining the two. This has alrEady<br />
resulted in projects designed to stimulate the industrial<br />
development of small island states, regional energy co-operation,<br />
industrial co-operation and agricultural research and development.<br />
The Branidt Report provides a timely reminder that there is more<br />
that can be done by a country like Australia. For while most<br />
attention has been focussed on that report's recommendation of<br />
a massive transfer of resources and controversial suggestions<br />
as to how this might be brought about, it has much<br />
to say of great value about other issues, including agricultural<br />
research and food production, the protection of the environmt-nt,<br />
energy, health and education. Many of these are areas in which<br />
Australia has expe~ rience and resources which are relevant to<br />
the problems of developing countries.<br />
It is the strength of the Brandt Report that it attempts to take<br />
discussion out of the framework of polemical trench-warfare-which<br />
has characterised much of the North-South discussion in the 1970s<br />
and to relate it to the whole human condition as the end of this<br />
century approaches, to man's relations with his environment,<br />
his resources and his institutions. In doing so, it makes<br />
inescapably clear that he can only grapple effectively with his<br />
problems in a context of international collaboration.<br />
In the application of such an approach the Government sees<br />
opportunities. The Government is ready to put its weight behind<br />
initiatives which can lead to productive results and we have<br />
initiated a major review for the purpose of identifying areaLs<br />
in which significant further progress can be made and in which<br />
Australia can play a distinctive role. / 8 </p>
<p>8-<br />
One such area, that of agricultural research and food product-ion,<br />
is clearly critical for developing countries. It is an area<br />
in which Australia, because of its geography and agricultural.<br />
history one-third of Australia is tropical.-has much to offer.<br />
Indeed, in recent years we have contributed significantly in<br />
pasture research and cattle breeding to neighbourintg countries<br />
in the South Pacific and South-East Asia'through our Overseas<br />
Aid Programme.<br />
Australia has considerable scientific and research expertise<br />
which can be used to deal with problems of great concern to<br />
developing countries. We will be considering ways of mobilising<br />
this valuable resource so that we can make the greatest<br />
contribution of which we are capable to improving the lives of<br />
people in the developing world.<br />
There is one particular area which I want to refer to because<br />
it is'subji~ ct t6 much misunderstanding and misinformation; * Lhat<br />
is the area of protectionism, or more specifically the access<br />
of Third World countries to Australian markets. It is sdmetimes<br />
argued that Australia's commitment to a market-oriented system<br />
and to the improving of North-South relations are somehow<br />
invalidated by the protection it affords to some of its<br />
manufacturing industries. This is simply not true and the facts<br />
refute it. Australia does-protect some of its industries, as<br />
most other countries developed and developing do. But the<br />
figures relating to Australian imports from neighbouring Third<br />
World countries clearly show that the level and scope of that<br />
protection does not deny them the opportunity to develop markets<br />
in Australia and to do so at a rapid rate.<br />
ASEAN exoorts to Australia in recent years have grown at the:<br />
rate of about 35% per annum. The developing countries' share of<br />
total Australian imports rose by nearly 50% between 1972/ 73 and<br />
1978/ 79. In the same period imports of manufactured goods from<br />
developing countries to Australia increased by more than 400'%.<br />
on a per capita basis, the USA is the only developed country which<br />
imports more manufactured products from developing countries than<br />
does Australia, and no country imports as much as we do of textiles,<br />
clothing and footwear.<br />
In respect of these three categories of manufactures, not only<br />
does Australia already import quantities from developing countries<br />
which are relatively high in-per capita terms, but we have<br />
recently taken decisions which will increase those quantities.<br />
Those decisions will open up all growth in the Australian market<br />
to inmport-competition-and, beyond that,. provide for a gradual<br />
but progressive additional liberalisation of access opportunities. / 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
A new system of developing country preferences is also to be<br />
introduced which will give developing countries a significant<br />
advantage in increasing their share of the Australian market.<br />
Australia's new policy for these products compares more than*<br />
favourably with those pursued by other developed countries.<br />
These facts and figures make a nonsense of the image of Australia<br />
as a country dug in behind protectionist ramparts and indifferent<br />
to the needs of its Third World neighbours. There is absolutely<br />
no reason for us to be on the defensive on this issue. If, even<br />
in the fact of these facts, some persist in this view, there iS<br />
another argument to consider.<br />
In the matter of market access the description of Australia as a<br />
middle power assumes a second meaning: we are not " middle" simply<br />
in terms of power ranking but in the sense that we are subject<br />
to pressure from both sides. The developing countries subject us<br />
to pressure for more access, the developed countries subject us<br />
to pressure by simultaneously denying access for our agricultural<br />
products to their markets and threatening our other traditional<br />
markets for those products. These two pressures are not<br />
unconnected, they cannot be considered in isolation from each other.<br />
The extent to which we can respond to the first is influenced by<br />
the kind of response we get to our requests for an easing of<br />
the second pressure.<br />
What a medium sized country especially one with a domestic<br />
market of only 14 million can do alone in this situation is<br />
very limited. Protectionism is an international problem which must<br />
be tackled internationally.' I would hope that regional Third<br />
World countries will appreciate the common interest they and we<br />
have in this respect.<br />
In concluding, I will reiterate the main themes in what I have<br />
said. The Australian Government shares fully the Brandt Report's<br />
view that the problems involved in North-South relations are grave<br />
and that there is an urgent need to come to terms with them.<br />
We believe that these problems cannot be understood or solved in<br />
I purely economic terms; that their political and strategic<br />
dimensions are of the utxtost importance; that in terms of vision<br />
and-courage their solution requires statesmanship of a high order.<br />
Wle believe that if real progress is to be made with the large<br />
structural problems which confront the Third World, there must be<br />
initiatives from the major industrial countries. We believe that<br />
it is very much in the interests of those countries, as well as of<br />
the developing countries, that they take such an initiative.<br />
"' Interdependence" implies such a mutuality of interests. We<br />
believe that middle level countries such as Australia can make<br />
significant direct contributions to alleviate indeed to solve<br />
some immediate practical problems. Such contributions should not<br />
be under-estimated. Technical assistance and education, for<br />
example, have enduring value. Australia is keeping a close watch on<br />
its position on North-South-issaues and-looking for practical,<br />
immediate ways it can enhance its contribution by unilateral action. </p>
<p>10<br />
And, lastly, we believe that all countries must not wait on<br />
events but must contribute what they can to create momentum<br />
and a climate of mutual confidence and hope.<br />
The Australian Government will certainly act in this spirit<br />
during this important year in North-South relations and in the<br />
affairs of the Commonwealth. 000---</p>
