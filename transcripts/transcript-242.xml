MviENZIES AT T'HE OPENING OF THE RUSSELL OFFICES)<br />
CANB QI. T1J__ SDAY, 17TH NOVEMBEH, 1960.<br />
Sir, Your Excellencies, Parliamentary colleagues and ladies<br />
and gentlemen: I have many reasons for being very pleased to be<br />
invited to do this task. One of them is that it is one of the<br />
rare occasions on which I can see the Diplomatic Corps sitting<br />
quietly, respectably, respectfully and with no grievances to<br />
ventilate. That makes it a very notable occasion.<br />
But there are other better reasons than that,<br />
speaking with very great respect.<br />
First of all this, or these buildings, this first<br />
one in particular, as the first of the four, represent a very<br />
remarkable phase of development in the national capital.<br />
The transfer of departments, so that we may have in<br />
Canberra almost literally, side by side, the great departments<br />
of State; so that no longer will it be necessary for chiefs of<br />
staff and those who toil with them to make long journeys to<br />
Canberra, to be consulted, or insulted, according to the mood<br />
of the moment. Here we are! We will r, 11 be together my o. m<br />
Department, the Department of External Affairs, the Departments<br />
of Defence, the Treasury the great Departments of State being<br />
brought in to this one capital city. This rcpresents a<br />
movement in national feeling, and in national efficiency which,<br />
perhaps, some people in Australia don't yet recognise. io, for<br />
ourselves, are determined to make the capital of Australia one<br />
of the fine capitals of the viorld. Because we believe thatif<br />
Australia is to take her place, more and more, as a nation in<br />
the world not a large nation, not unduly significant you may<br />
tell me, but still with a future then we must, so far as we<br />
can express our national instinct in concrete visible terms<br />
that appeal to the imagination.<br />
The creation of a national capital in this lovely<br />
spot is one of the great things to be done in the performance<br />
of that task. I must confess I have very little patience with<br />
people who appear to grud everything that is spent on<br />
buildings of this kind not that they are elaborate but<br />
buildings of this kind.<br />
The moaning that goes on about the imminent<br />
creation of a lake which will give to this city character,<br />
and make it a city around alake, as nothing else could make it,<br />
a coherent whole: I don't have any sympathy with those ideas<br />
at all. I believe that the future of this country, just<br />
l1D the future of any other democratic country, is largely<br />
associated with creating the national capital as a focus of<br />
intexest, as a focus of pride, as a place which will attract the<br />
best possible men and women, not only for Parliament, for the<br />
Public Service, but for all the activities that are associated<br />
with Government on the grand scale.<br />
So I believe that all the investments that we are<br />
making in Canberra are dividend-paying investments in the best<br />
sense of the word. </p>
<p>2.<br />
There is another reason why I am very glad to be<br />
here. Something pretty good happened in Canberra not so long<br />
ago. do had enough wit to establish a Commission; and we had<br />
enough wit to make Mr. Overall its Chairman.<br />
Now this man Overall occasionally frightens me. Ho<br />
looks to you to be a mild and disarming character. Ho has<br />
associated with him Commissioners of great talent who arc<br />
equally mild and disarming. But I'll tell you the great secret<br />
of this man: when he learns on the telephone that the Cabinet<br />
has approved of something, some scheme, some project, that<br />
concerns him, he has the bulldozers in on the site next<br />
miorning. He knows of politicians, even by instinct<br />
certainly not by expe. ience ( Laughter) but by instinct he<br />
knows them. He has given us imagination, and drive in the<br />
development of Canberra for which I, for one, as the Prime<br />
Minister, w. ill be eternally grateful to him. And I say that for<br />
him, and for his Commission.<br />
SThis conception, now beginning to take shape.-the<br />
offices here, the bridge, the other bridge that will go in, the<br />
lake, the whole city grouping itself with, I hope, ioro fine<br />
buildings in the future this is something that appeals to the<br />
imagination. I am only sorry that I have reached such advanced<br />
years now that I won't be able to come back in 50 years' time<br />
and see the fruit of all these labours, a marvel, and a pride,<br />
and a joy to Australians.<br />
But over here, we are doing something, we are here<br />
at a very remarkable step. Im delighted with it. I'n sure<br />
you are delighted with it. I am proud of everybody rwho has<br />
boon connected with achieving it. I am delighted to think that<br />
my colleague, Mr. Freoth, is able to be here on this matter<br />
he's had much to do with it and I: m vey grateful to think<br />
that my colleagues in Cabinet, and the Parliament of the<br />
Commonwealth of Australia, have, in the most practical wiay,<br />
supported these develop: mnts,<br />
So here we are a growing city; a greator, and<br />
more scientific aggregation of the people who work for us; a<br />
vision of the future; and a remarkable :. chievomrnt in the<br />
present. All these are great matters. They give me great<br />
personal joy and satisfaction, and they will explain to you why<br />
I am delighted to declare this building open. ( Applause) </p>
