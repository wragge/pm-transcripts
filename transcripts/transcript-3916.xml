Peko/ EZ subsequently sought further discussions<br />
with the Government to clarify in their mind the meaning<br />
of some of the terms agreed to in October of last year.<br />
These discussions have been held for the past three days<br />
and understanding has been reached with Peko/ EZ on the<br />
principles of the arrangements necessary for the development<br />
of the Ranger project. These very productive discussions<br />
with Peko/ EZ clear the way for further development of<br />
the project. The next steps will be a series of<br />
discussions between Government and company representatives<br />
for the purpose of drawing up detailed formal agreements<br />
covering the project.<br />
Further development of the project is subject,<br />
of course, to the outcome of the Ranger Uranium Environmental<br />
Inquiry headed by Mr Justice Fox.<br />
