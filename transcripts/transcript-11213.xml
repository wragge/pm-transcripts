    <content><![CDATA[<p>Subjects: Referendum result</p>
<p>E&amp;OE.............</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, good morning.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Good morning, Alan.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, are you surprised at the level of vilification and emotive</p>
<p>   language that seems to continue after the result on Saturday?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, from some people that - I think it is really from some people rather</p>
<p>   than from the great majority who voted yes. I think there were one or two</p>
<p>   strong examples of it, and you know who I'm referring to, and I don't particularly</p>
<p>   intend to dignify their remarks by mentioning their names. But my sense</p>
<p>   is that those people who voted yes in the main will say, well we've had</p>
<p>   a vote - they can hardly complain that it was an unfair campaign. They had</p>
<p>   the whole organisation of the Labor Party, they had one-third of the parliamentary</p>
<p>   members of the Liberal Party because we allowed a free vote. And people</p>
<p>   have lost sight of this that by allowing a free vote the Liberal Party's</p>
<p>   grassroots organisation was effectively unavailable to the no campaign.</p>
<p>   [Inaudible] and many of them did because they held strongly to the no view,</p>
<p>   they were able to do so but they weren't organised in a Liberal Party sense.</p>
<p>   And then on top of that I think it is fair to say that the great bulk of</p>
<p>   journalists in the media were very strongly barracking for the yes side.</p>
<p>   I don't think a fair-minded yes voter could say this morning that "we</p>
<p>   was robbed", that it was unfair. I'm being criticised simply because</p>
<p>   I've stuck to my guns on what I believe. I made it plain years ago that</p>
<p>   I was against change to the present system because not out of being nostalgic</p>
<p>   but I just think it's a damn safe system.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  I notice Paul Kelly in The Australian in 1998 last</p>
<p>   year wrote, "the pinnacle of the paradox was a moving speech from Howard.</p>
<p>   He entered the history books as a monarchical Prime Minister who called</p>
<p>   the referendum while signalling he would vote no." That suddenly seems</p>
<p>   to be a problem for some.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yeah, well, that is a paradox to me because when the Convention was held</p>
<p>   and I said that at the end of it, and a clear support emerged for the model</p>
<p>   that was put on Saturday, I said it would be put. The republicans were absolutely</p>
<p>   overjoyed. Thomas Keneally who's a very strong republican said it was the</p>
<p>   ultimate act of grace on my part to put the referendum even though I didn't</p>
<p>   agree with it. Nobody was there saying that I was manipulating the process.</p>
<p>   Nobody was then seriously arguing that I shouldn't have put that model.</p>
<p>   But as we approached last Saturday and the doubts arose as to whether it</p>
<p>   was going to be carried they then started rewriting history and then starting</p>
<p>   saying, he should have done it this way or he should have done it that way.</p>
<p>   I did it the way I said I would do it. Nobody was ever in any doubt about</p>
<p>   that and this has been defeated not because of me, this has been defeated</p>
<p>   because 55 percent of my fellow Australians have voted against it.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  Well, on one hand it's being argued that you influenced the vote in such</p>
<p>   a way that it's damaged Australia but somehow or other the preamble lost</p>
<p>   by 60 to 40, so where is the logic in all of that?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, there is no logic in that. That is not logic. I mean, I accept that</p>
<p>   when people lose something that they hold to very strongly they get upset.</p>
<p>   I mean, but they must ponder the fact that if it had gone the other way</p>
<p>   there would have been perhaps 45 to 50 percent of Australians who felt disappointed</p>
<p>   and upset. I mean, somebody wins, somebody loses something like this but</p>
<p>   the one thing can be said without any doubt and that is that the proposition</p>
<p>   that was put up on Saturday night had a fair go. It got huge media support,</p>
<p>   huge. I've not seen such concentrated barracking from most sections of the</p>
<p>   media. There were some exceptions and others that put it in a more balanced</p>
<p>   way but overwhelmingly it did enjoy very strong support from the media in</p>
<p>   so many ways. And, as I say, the whole Labor Party, a third of the Liberal</p>
<p>   Party because we allowed a free vote and I think correctly and I'm very</p>
<p>   proud that we did. So, I don't think anybody can turn around and say, oh</p>
<p>   gee, we were robbed, it wasn't given a fair go, there wasn't enough money.</p>
<p>   The yes campaign was more expensive because they had more sources of private</p>
<p>   money. The Government money made available was equal on each side - $7.5</p>
<p>   million on each side. I mean, I really, for the life of me, don't think</p>
<p>   anybody has a right to cry foul. They can criticise me. They can say my</p>
<p>   attitude is wrong. They're entitled to do that. I would say that the majority</p>
<p>   of Australians at present agree with me.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  Only one in three rural voters or voters in rural areas registered a yes</p>
<p>   vote, of the 10 New South Wales seats with an average age of under 32, only</p>
<p>   one voted yes. Is this a little bit offensive, is it not, for these people</p>
<p>   to now be labelled as being un-Australian or unpatriotic or unintelligent</p>
<p>   or uninformed which seems to be the arguments being used about those people</p>
<p>   who voted contrary to the way in which they were implored to vote?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, it was always offensive. I mean, it is always offensive to run a campaign</p>
<p>   on the basis that somehow or other you have got to do this or you have got</p>
<p>   to do that. There's one thing I have learnt in 25 years is the politics</p>
<p>   in this country and that is that you never take Australians for granted,</p>
<p>   you never assume that they will do what they are universally exhorted to</p>
<p>   do. You never do that. And there was far too much of that behaviour and</p>
<p>   that attitude in this particular campaign. It is one of the reasons why</p>
<p>   the "yes" campaign came unstuck. If it had been a little less</p>
<p>   celebrity driven, if it had been a little less hectoring it might have had</p>
<p>   more success. I don't know. But it never impresses people in Australia who</p>
<p>   admire the skills of somebody on the sporting field or on the stage to be</p>
<p>   effectively told by those people how they should vote. It never works that</p>
<p>   way. I mean, Australians aren't like that. They admire people for their</p>
<p>   skills and particular things, they don't necessarily take any notice of</p>
<p>   them in other fields.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  Yes. Just on all of that, in terms of where we go from here, I mean, just</p>
<p>   for the benefit of our listeners. We know that a plebiscite is something</p>
<p>   that you put before the elected which doesn't affect the Constitution.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  That's right. It's very simple. It's really an opinion poll.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  Is there a likelihood that there could be a plebiscite on this issue to</p>
<p>   ask the people a simple question which has no binding on the constitution</p>
<p>   whether they want a republic full stop and then to put together a body of</p>
<p>   people who can look at a way of representing that view if it's a yes view</p>
<p>   in a way which incorporates and encompasses all the opinions of Australians?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Alan, anything is possible. My guess is that the great bulk of Australians</p>
<p>   will be saying to me and saying to Mr Beazley that in the near future they</p>
<p>   don't want this thing revisited. Apart from anything else it is quite costly.</p>
<p>   And one of the reasons why I am sure some people voted against it was their</p>
<p>   resentment at the cost involved.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  But if Mr Beazley had to go to the next election saying that if you elect</p>
<p>   a Labor Government we will hold a plebiscite to offer you a choice on whether</p>
<p>   you want a republic or not, what will be your position on that?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, what we will do as a Government now is have a talk about it. We are</p>
<p>   having a Cabinet meeting tomorrow. There will obviously be some discussion</p>
<p>   about this. I have made it clear that we are now back to a Government position</p>
<p>   as being incorrectly interpreted within a lot of the press again this morning</p>
<p>   as an attempt by me to gag the debate. I have no intention of gagging the</p>
<p>   debate inside the Government. If people want to raise issues relating to</p>
<p>   constitutional reform inside the party room or inside the Cabinet they are</p>
<p>   free to do so. I am not going to.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  On something which was a matter of conscience last Friday will it become</p>
<p>   a matter of unified party policy this Friday?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I think so because the referendum has been held. See the free vote</p>
<p>   related to people's attitudes regarding the referendum question being put</p>
<p>   last Saturday, I think people are quite..there seems to be an inability</p>
<p>   or an unwillingness on the part of many in the media to grasp the difference</p>
<p>   between debate within the Government and everybody expressing a different</p>
<p>   point of view in public. I have never tried to gag debate inside the forums</p>
<p>   of the Government on this issue and I never will.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  There will be debate on a popularly elected head of state. People will talk</p>
<p>   about Ireland and they'll talk about whether you either have reserve powers</p>
<p>   or whether you codify the powers. If that debate wants to run how does the</p>
<p>   Government of the day give expression to it?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I think that the best thing is not to, sort of, make any hard and</p>
<p>   fast declarations.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  At this point.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Two days after the referendum. I think the community.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  You are not ruling that out?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Alan, in a democracy you never rule out anything, you only make predictions</p>
<p>   as to the time at which you think things will be dealt with. I mean, I was</p>
<p>   constantly asked during the campaign what happens if there's a no vote.</p>
<p>   And I said, I wouldn't think the thing would be revisited in a hurry. Now,</p>
<p>   I couldn't be more precise than that because that is what I believe. Of</p>
<p>   course people will be free to go on talking about it in the community and</p>
<p>   inside the political parties. All I am saying in relation to the free vote</p>
<p>   issue is that if the Government develops a view on doing this or not doing</p>
<p>   that, it will be in relation to the process, it will be a Government view</p>
<p>   and not just a free wheeling view. But if we were at some time in the future</p>
<p>   to decide on another process then we might decide in relation to that process</p>
<p>   that we will allow a free vote again because that is the right way of having..</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  Right. I mean, a plebiscite to that extent. You say that because we're having</p>
<p>   a debate about this and we need to clarify it. A plebiscite would be a simple</p>
<p>   way of doing that. That means Australians would vote yes or no whether they</p>
<p>   want a republic, and then if the vote were yes you or the government of</p>
<p>   the day would set up a large committee to conduct extensive consultations</p>
<p>   on framing an appropriate referendum question which would alter the constitution.</p>
<p>   It seems to me to be a better process than what we've been through.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well it is a different way of doing it. But can I say the only flaw in that,</p>
<p>   it's a great flaw of a plebiscite is that if you do have that and supposing</p>
<p>   the community were to say yes, and then you set up this committee and from</p>
<p>   that committee emerges a model and you put that model up and the model gets</p>
<p>   defeated. You're in a bit of a constitutional no man's land.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  And it ain't cheap.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No it isn't cheap. It ain't cheap. I mean the reason it is very expensive</p>
<p>   is you have two national votes and you could end up still with a narrow</p>
<p>   outcome and by having a plebiscite you've delegitimised the original..the</p>
<p>   current system. I mean it's all very well for you to run around and say</p>
<p>   70% want a republic, 80% want this, 20% don't want this. In the end the</p>
<p>   only vote that gives a correct expression of Australia's will is a referendum,</p>
<p>   or a full vote of all of the people. If you have a result like last Saturday</p>
<p>   against all of the odds when you think of it in terms of the mobilisation</p>
<p>   of groups in the community it's a very interesting outcome and one that</p>
<p>   I think all political leaders should reflect on.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  There is no reference in the constitution to head of state which seems to</p>
<p>   be the constant subject of debate. You weren't the Prime Minister in 1995</p>
<p>   that the official guide in the Commonwealth Government Directory in 1995</p>
<p>   notifies the public in that guide of the appointment of His Excellency the</p>
<p>   Honourable Sir William Deane AC KBE as Governor-General. It describes in</p>
<p>   the guide his function, and this is of course as I said not under your Government,</p>
<p>   but the functions says under the constitution the Governor-General is the</p>
<p>   Queen's representative in Australia, he is the head of state with the whom</p>
<p>   the executive powers of the Commonwealth is vested. But there's no ambiguity</p>
<p>   about what that title means?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well there is in the eyes of a lot. I mean the true position is that the</p>
<p>   Queen is, by law the Queen of Australia, but the effective head of state</p>
<p>   is the Governor-General, and that was the view that was expressed in the</p>
<p>   official government information pamphlet, and that is the truth. And nobody</p>
<p>   can alter that, nobody can deny that the Queen is the Queen of Australia</p>
<p>   by law, and equally nobody can deny that her powers under the constitution</p>
<p>   are exercised by the Governor-General. And people can swear at the way I</p>
<p>   put that as well as they like but it happens to be a fact. Nobody doubts</p>
<p>   that, I mean I was commissioned as Prime Minister not by the Queen. I was</p>
<p>   commissioned by the Governor-General. The Governor-General formally appointed</p>
<p>   me as Prime Minister. He did so under the provisions of a section of the</p>
<p>   Australian constitution which the Australian people almost a hundred years</p>
<p>   ago voted for. I mean all of these things are forgotten.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  So while all of this goes on, I mean while other issues of major significance,</p>
<p>   we've got troops in East Timor, we've got problems with education, with</p>
<p>   got Aboriginal health and wellbeing, we've got problems with the disabled</p>
<p>   and the aged. When is the Government of the country going to sort of get</p>
<p>   back on track away from what has been an amazingly expensive and dislocating</p>
<p>   side show?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well Alan we have never taken our eye of the ball on those issues. And of</p>
<p>   course now that the referendum has been voted on, there'll be an even greater</p>
<p>   preoccupation on those issues. But let me assure your listeners that through</p>
<p>   all of this we haven't stopped governing on the things that really count.</p>
<p>   Those things have always been far more important to me than constitutional</p>
<p>   change. I'm not saying that constitutional change is unimportant but I think</p>
<p>   one of the lessons out of Saturday for a lot of people on both sides of</p>
<p>   politics is that Australians are skeptical of things that don't directly</p>
<p>   relate to their lives, and they wonder about the motives of those who lead</p>
<p>   political parties who engage themselves too much in things that are not</p>
<p>   of direct concern to their daily lives. And I've always taken that view</p>
<p>   very much to heart, and the result on Saturday really enforces my view.</p>
<p>  JONES:</p>
<p>  Good to talk to you. Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Thank you. Bye bye.</p>
<p>  [Ends]</p>
