PRIME MINISTER<br />
~ PLEASE CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTE R, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
SIGNING OF COMMONWEALTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACCORD,<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, 14 NOVEMBER 1995<br />
I am very pleased to be here to sign the first partnership agreement entered<br />
into by Commonwealth and local governments.<br />
The textbooks commonly refer to local government as the " third" tier of<br />
government. I suppose it might seem a little remote when you're sitting on<br />
Capitol Hill but that description seems much less accurate when you're<br />
driving along a suburban road, or sitting in a local park or using the local<br />
library. Of all the tiers of government local government actually operates closest to<br />
the people. Good local governments keep their communities together and<br />
keep them strong. Local representatives are drawn in a very immediate way<br />
from their communities and because most elective positions are part-time,<br />
the incumbents remain fully engaged in those communities.<br />
Local government is situated directly in the communitys line of sight and<br />
your work is of interest to all the members of the community.<br />
Australia's councils have always served as the forum for local decisionmaking<br />
on local matters. But they are also increasingly significant to our<br />
national life.<br />
In all bu a few areas of Australia's public life, the decisions of local<br />
government and the quality of those decisions help determine our<br />
progress. This is the case with the regeneration of our cities and the redevelopment of<br />
our regions. It is most certainly the case with the protection of our natural<br />
environment. The health of our people and the houses they live in, the<br />
culture in which they participate, their jobs and their standard of livng all<br />
this is touched by the processes of local government-Many of the problems<br />
we face as a natio lie at the 1oca level and so do ft solutions.<br />

<p>All Australian governments owe a duty to the Australian people and all are<br />
charged with serving the Australian nation. No less than their<br />
Commonwealth, State and Territory counterparts, local governments have a<br />
role in addressing national issues and pursuing national goals.<br />
As local governments become more aware of their national responsibilities,<br />
the federal government is moving to anchor itself more securely in local<br />
communities.<br />
The lesson we can draw from such widely different initiatives as Working<br />
Nation Landcare and Australia Remembers is that national programs work<br />
best at the local level when they are delivered by local people, fuelled by<br />
local energy and informed by local needs.<br />
We realise that in pursuing national priorities, we must make use of the<br />
people and resources on the ground and very often that means local<br />
, tered governments. So a partnership between the Commonwealth and local government is very<br />
worthwhile and long overdue. But like all matches, it required some making.<br />
j on<br />
re In February David Plumridge first mentioned to me the idea of an Accord<br />
; al spurred on, I believe, by the success achieved at your First National<br />
Assembly last November.<br />
081, to I thought it was a very good idea and an excellent means of broadening and<br />
and deepening the relationship between our two levels of government<br />
e way<br />
-time, In the intervening months, the two parties, led by David Plumridge and Brian<br />
Howe, have worked hard to put some flesh-onto the bones of this Accord<br />
and they have succeeded. We will sign a very valuable document today, one<br />
ind which contains some significant undertakings and which will shape our future<br />
working relationship.<br />
At the heart of this Accord is a set of principles shared beliefs sincerely held<br />
ur and shared goals to be sincerely pursued. These include commitments to<br />
social justice and community cohesion, the pursuit of reconciliation with our<br />
indigenous people, recognition of the benefits of cultural diversity and the<br />
need for all governments to pursue micro-economic reform and to protect the<br />
environment. This is an important statement a statement of the principles which guide<br />
ent of Australian government. These principles have not always been the subject of<br />
iral consensus within the Australian polity, so it is worthwhile setting them down<br />
in ink if not in concrete.<br />

<p>W(<br />
The Commonwealth believes local government should be involved in COAG de<br />
processes and Ministerial Council activities where local government has a a r<br />
legitimate interest, such as a significant statutory responsibility or financial up<br />
commitment. Or<br />
The Commonwealth will consult with local government when its initiatives are thit<br />
likely to impact upon local government, having regard to normal budgetary an,<br />
processes and existing arrangements with State and Territory Governments. If/<br />
And the Commonwealth undertakes to provide funding, within existing anf<br />
resources, for a range of local government initiatives from the Local PC<br />
Government Development Program and to review the financial position of<br />
local government, taking account of such issues as future changes in local W<br />
government functions and responsibilities. de be<br />
So the Accord is good for local government. But it's also good for Australia. we<br />
It folds local affairs into the national mix and draws local government more rer<br />
fully into the mainstream of national life. art<br />
Under the Accord, local government commits to pull its weight in the arena of It v<br />
micro-economic reform, particularly through the implementation of national thE<br />
competition policy, enterprise bargaining, productive diversity and regulatory<br />
reform. Fir<br />
go'<br />
Following on the Report of the Urban Design Task Force, the Commonwealth pei<br />
welcomes local governments willingness to pursue reforms that will improve<br />
the quality of our cities and thus the quality of life of our people. Th<br />
I welcome your commitment to the protection of the environment. The Accord tw(<br />
provides for an integrated approach to planning and development and to Fe<br />
appropriate involvement in areas like waste management, sewerage and<br />
stormwater treatment issues that are crucial if we are to look after our rivers Tland<br />
our coasts. ac, th(<br />
In this Accord, local government signs up to the cause of invigorating<br />
Australian democracy through the creation of an effective citizenship W!,<br />

Th<br />
I know you had Philip Adams speaking to you yesterday and I gather you na<br />
warmly welcomed everything he said about the program called Australia<br />
Consult. Lei ffui-<br />
The government endorsed the program back in June, shortly after I Cc<br />
announiced the Government's preferred model of an Australian Republic. an(<br />
There has been a good deal of debate about the model. I believe it is the<br />
best means of reaching the objective of having an Australian as Australia's W(<br />
Heed of State; Au<br />
I t </p>
<p>We decided it was the best model after extensive consultations and a great<br />
n COAG deal of hard thinking. We still firmly believe it is the best model. But it is not<br />
has a a model we want to force upon Australians indeed no model can be forced<br />
iancial upon Australians. A republic can't be forced upon Australians.<br />
On the contrary, we want the whole nation to consider the issues. In fact, we<br />
atives are think that the consideration of them will be immensely beneficial to the nation<br />
igetary and to the life of our democracy.<br />
rnments. If Australia Consults serves the purpose of encouraging interest and debate<br />
ng and knowledge of our democratic system and an enlivened sense of national<br />
possibilities and national purpose, it will be an invaluable program.<br />
; ition of<br />
n local We have a chance with the approach of the Centenary of Federation and the<br />
debate about our Head of State and other constitutional arrangements to<br />
become much more familiar with our democracy and ourselves. And I hope<br />
, ustralia. we learn a great deal more than what our shortcomings are. I hope we will be<br />
int more reminded that there is no more robust democracy in the world: indeed, there<br />
are few older democracies and few, if any, more truly democratic.<br />
arena of It will do no harm if through the national debate ahead of us we are reminded<br />
ational that Australia is a very good, and very democratic place to live.<br />
egulatory Finally, by participating in a national system of performance indicators, local<br />
government joins the other two tiers of government in the measurement of<br />
ionwealth performance and progress in the delivery of services.<br />
improve The Commonwealth Local Government Accord is a balanced document,<br />
which will make for a more secure and productive relationship between our<br />
he Accord two levels of government. More than that though, it will make for a better<br />
nd to Federation and a stronger nation.<br />
iand<br />
our rivers The Accord demonstrates how well Australian federalism can work when the<br />
activities of all governments coalesce around national priorities and when<br />
the decisions of all governments are measured against the national interest.<br />
g<br />
a When this Labor Government signed our first Accord with the trade unions in<br />
1983, no one could have predicted the benefits that would flow to Australia.<br />
There is no reason why today's agreement should not similaily advance the<br />
ir you nation over the next decade.<br />
' ralia Let me say in dosing that it has been one of the real pleasures of my time in<br />
this office of Prime Minister to watch the relationship between the<br />
Commonrwealth and Local Government grow into something truly substantial<br />
iblic. and creative.<br />
is the<br />
; tralia's We will all have to drew our own conclusions about the other side of the<br />
Australian political equation who, at this premier event on fth local 2 I 9, </p>
<p>mi<br />
government calendar, decided that the interests of local government are best<br />
advanced by a deafening policy silence. DPI<br />
If we all rack our brains, perhaps we can think of some reason why we should<br />
be kept in the dark. I must say I can't think of one. If it is a decent policy I<br />
cannot think of any advantage the Government could take from it. If it is not a<br />
decent policy I cannot think why it would be more credible just before an<br />
election than it would be now. The<br />
Let me offer my thanks to those responsible for negotiating this Accord Lim.<br />

And to all the local government representatives here today: good luck for the Eproc<br />
future because the work of local councils represents much of the hard work " No<br />
of government. I trust you will return to your communities excited by our D<br />
achievement today and confident in the ability of Australians to work BedF<br />
together for a common cause. Bd<br />
