TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
7.30 REPORT WITH PAUL LYNEHAM, CANBERRA<br />
26 FEBRUARY 1.992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PL: Well Prime Minister aren't you being too modest, you<br />
talk of $ 2.3 billion but when you look at the revenue<br />
forgone and everything over the full four years it is<br />
$ 16.6, surely?<br />
PM: It is a cyclical kick to the economy, a stimulus the<br />
economy, which then basically is spent over $ 2.3<br />
billion over this financial year and next financial<br />
year and then tails off, and as the economy picks up as<br />
receipts grow, as employment grows, as business grows,<br />
as profits grows, as unemployment benefits recipients<br />
come off the Budget, as the Budget strengthens we pay<br />
tax cuts. And it is a four year program at the end of<br />
it we have the Budget back into surplus. We have tax<br />
cuts at 30 per cent without Dr Hewson's 15 per cent<br />
consumption tax. We have one of the biggest national<br />
infrastructure programs in our history, rebuilding the<br />
rail system.<br />
PL: Which a few years ago, you were telling us all that we<br />
had to realise we were a poor country we couldn't<br />
afford all these flash infrastructure projects.<br />
PM: In the ' 80s when private investment was running very,<br />
very strongly, the thing to do was to pull the public<br />
sector back, which we did, we produced these large<br />
Budget surpluses. But because we did all that hard<br />
work, we did what the Americans didn't do for instance,<br />
that is pull the big deficit into surplus in the good<br />
times. Now with a recession we are able to open them<br />
out to provide some of the stimulus that we need, and<br />
yet not leave it to lay there in the Budget, to see it<br />
wash out and see the Budget come back to surplus. </p>
<p>PL: Well let's separate this discussion a bit in terms of<br />
the short term kick-start things and the longer term<br />
things. I mean your most immediate thing is that $ 317<br />
million to families. Why did you decide a one-off gift<br />
like that?<br />
PM: Well, because the infrastructure programs of rail,<br />
ports, roads, will start from now, but they will only<br />
build up really this year. So for most of this year we<br />
won't get a stimulus unless we can find a way of<br />
injecting one quickly into the economy. And the best<br />
way to inject it, is into people who can use it<br />
families including of course the unemployed, but all<br />
families, and there is particularly a long going<br />
program there for low income families. But that<br />
stimulus will lift the activity and spending, profile<br />
the economy before and during the time when we build<br />
the rai. and road programs up.<br />
PL: Is it a form of Paul Keating saying I am sorry for the<br />
recession?<br />
PM: No, it i~ s a sensible thing to do. But it is spending<br />
it on the right people. I mean, if it had of been Dr<br />
Hewson hie would have thrown it to the top end tax<br />
payers, who would have thrown it to the big companies.<br />
We have given it to the people who can use it<br />
families, tax payers with children.<br />
PL: Alright, and the family car about $ 800 cheaper as of<br />
tomorrow?<br />
PM: Yes, I -think we have been producing the same number of<br />
cars this year as we were twenty years ago. We have<br />
got a car fleet, which on average is 17 years old.<br />
PL: Yours isn't too new is it, your old Mercedes?<br />
PM: Well I am part of the same syndrome. So this is to<br />
encourage people to buy new cars, to give a fill-up to<br />
our biggest manufacturing industry and a change. Make<br />
travel safer, make the environment cleaner with lead<br />
free cars, and to kick that again, another sector of<br />
commerce along.<br />
PL: What do you think it is going to do to car sales? You<br />
must have some ideas what it is going to do?<br />
PM: Well obviously, it is a substantial saving, and it is<br />
permanent. It is a permanent change to the car<br />
industry.<br />
PL: Is it going to produce sales though? Can you be sure<br />
of that?<br />
PM: I am pretty sure. When the car industry executives put<br />
advice to us about a change in tax rates, that was<br />
their certain belief. </p>
<p>PL: Industry assistance and development, that's fairly<br />
modest isn't it? I mean $ 31 million this year, $ 125<br />
million next year.<br />
PM: The biggest industry assistance is the revolution to<br />
depreciation rates for business. We are changing the<br />
depreciation schedules so that a twenty year asset, can<br />
now be written off in seven and a half years, or a<br />
forty year asset in fifteen years.<br />
PL: Which encourages me as a factory owner or company<br />
director to go out now and buy that new lathe?<br />
PM: Well, you will have the benefit of greater cash flows<br />
earlier because of the faster write-off, and it is the<br />
major change in the Statement for business. But of<br />
course as you say there are many others. I mean, we<br />
are going to produce by a tax change, private provision<br />
of public infrastructure. We are producing equity<br />
development funds for small and medium business that<br />
can't get equity, they can get debt, but they can't get:<br />
equity, they can't get it on the stock market and they<br />
can't get it anywhere else. We have got a quite novel<br />
concessionary change in the tax system for that, and<br />
also for big projects. So, this is a partnership<br />
proposition. Government and business, moving forward<br />
cooperatively, discursively, cooperatively to produce a<br />
recovery and change Australia.<br />
PL: And we end up in ' 92-' 93 with an $ 8 billion deficit, in<br />
' 95-' 96 we are suddenly $ 2 billion in surplus. How do<br />
you perform this?<br />
PM: Because as the economy grows, the receipts are very<br />
sensitive to pick up in growth profits and employment.<br />
If GDP kicks so do Budget receipts. And we expect GDP<br />
to change from zero, that's growth in the economy, to<br />
change from zero this year to 4 3/ 4 next year, and to<br />
on-go. So we are running at that sort of rate through<br />
the early ' 90s. Those estimates are put together by<br />
the Treasury, the Reserve Bank.<br />
PL: The team that brought us the Budget estimates for the<br />
last five years.<br />
PM: Well look in the 1990s we had huge growth, it was all<br />
forecast. The Budget is very sensitive to growth. If<br />
you get the growth, the revenue that's why this is<br />
a responsible package, it is a cyclical, it is a cycle<br />
to stimulate the economy, which then drops away and the<br />
Budget comes back into surplus. </p>
<p>PL: But I mean we look at these forecasts you have got in<br />
here going up to ' 95-' 96, I mean surely they are so a<br />
wish and a prayer by then that we should take them with<br />
an enormous grain of salt?<br />
PM: Well did you take Dr Hewson's with a grain of salt,<br />
which were not done by the Treasury, or the Reserve<br />
Bank, or the Department of Finance? I mean the fact is<br />
it is possible to give a reasonable indication of<br />
activity levels that far out.<br />
PL: I wish they had been that good in the last few years,<br />
Mr KeatLng.<br />
PM: Well they were good in the main on growth, but the boom<br />
of course of ' 88-' 89 was simply too great.<br />
PL: And wages and inflation? What's the ingredients here?<br />
PM: Well as the Party which broke the back of inflation<br />
from 10 per cent for nearly twenty years, to now 1 1/ 2<br />
per cent, we're not going to be letting that particular<br />
genie out of the bottle again. So unlike the Liberal<br />
Party, unlike the confrontation of Fightback, unlike<br />
the accountancy of the GST switch, we are not going to<br />
try to abolish trade unions, we're sitting down and we<br />
have a commitment from the trade unions that they won't<br />
claim, that their wage claims will be consistent with<br />
keeping our inflation rate and our trading partners<br />
average.<br />
PL: You got that commitment a few days ago, did you?<br />
PM: I did. And we had it through the<br />
PL: Is this you on the phone to Bill Kelty?<br />
PM: No, this is a meeting with the Wages Committee, with<br />
the whole 40 of them. As it always was, and that's why<br />
we have got a 1 1/ 2 per cent inflation rate. It is<br />
worth remembering, Paul, out of the last recession when<br />
Mr Howard was Treasurer and Dr Hewson was his adviser,<br />
inflation rate was 10 per cent on the way out. On the<br />
way out this time it is 1 1/ 2 per cent. The reason for<br />
that is the Accord and the trade unions and we will do<br />
it again. But this time part of that sympathetic<br />
environment is tax cuts for low to middle income tax<br />
payers, that 30 per cent tax rate, as I say without<br />
taxing the food you put in your mouth, or the shirt you<br />
put on your back, or your dry cleaning or anything<br />
else.<br />
PM: You reckon this will win you two elections on the trot? </p>
<p>PL: Well what this will do, this is a policy where we have<br />
sat back: and said what's best for Australia? Dr Hewson<br />
has sat back and said how can I be different to Labor?<br />
I will have a consumption tax. That's not what we have<br />
done, we have sat back and said what's best for<br />
Australia? How can we induce a recovery? How can we<br />
look after the Budget? How can we invest in the long<br />
term? How can we re-modernise the railroad, the roads,<br />
the ports, the airlines, how can we do all these<br />
things, and give Australia a long term productive<br />
focus? That's what this is about.<br />
PL: Prime Minister thanks very much. I know you have got a<br />
lot of other commitments so we will let you go now.<br />
PM: Thank you Paul.<br />
