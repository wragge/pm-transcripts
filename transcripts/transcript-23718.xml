    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today, Australia lost a musical giant with the passing of composer Peter Sculthorpe AO OBE.</p>
<p>From his humble beginnings in Tasmania, Peter Sculthorpe studied in post-war London, but returned to Australia and changed the country's music landscape forever.</p>
<p>Peter was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1977 and Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 1990.</p>
<p>His ‘Sun Music’ series of compositions from the 1960s was the dawning of the first identifiably Australian sound in classical music.</p>
<p>Peter Sculthorpe sought to render into music the earth, sea, sky and history of our country.</p>
<p>He influenced audiences and musicians around the world, and he was a deeply respected mentor and teacher to subsequent generations of composers.</p>
<p>Peter Sculthorpe much deepened Australia's musical voice and our country is forever richer because of him.</p>
