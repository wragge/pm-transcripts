Press Statement ED3.<br />
Review of Previous Government's Programmes<br />
The Prime Minister ( the Hon. E. G. WVhitlam, MP-) announcid<br />
today t~} at the Government was establishing a high level " task force"<br />
under the leadership of Dr, H. C. Coombs to undertake a close scrutiny<br />
of the continuing policies of the previous Government. The de-cision to<br />
undertake this scrutiny resulted from recent discussion by Cabtnet of<br />
the broad question of expenditure priorities and the review would relate<br />
to the spending programmes ( including " disguised expenditure" through<br />
the tz; xation system)~ which were in being when the Government took office.<br />
The Prime Minister said that, quiet apart from any other<br />
consideration, thorough-going review of the policies of the previous<br />
Government in these regards was highly desirable in its own right. Over<br />
and above that, the Government and undertaken to introduce a wide range of<br />
policies and programmes involving substantial expenditures of its own<br />
and, in doing so, it would be important that it should have the widest<br />
possible options available to it. Otherwise, there was a clear risk<br />
that the introduction of its own programmes could be impeded or even<br />
frustrated by the continuing demands on resources represented by the<br />
programmes of its predecessors. The Government was determined to avoid<br />
any such outcome.<br />
The terms of reference given to Dr. Coombs, and the membership of<br />
the task force he is to lead, are set out in the attached copy of the<br />
Prime Minister's letter of 28 March to Dr. Coombs. </p>
<p>28 March 197?*<br />
Dear Dr. Coombs, The purpose of this letter is to confirm to you the outcome<br />
of our recent discussions, arising out of' Cabinet's Decision that<br />
" Action be set in train to apply a close scrutiny to<br />
continuing policies of the previous Government so that<br />
room may be found for our own higher priority programmes."<br />
As you know, I regard the importance of such action as<br />
self-evident. Quite apart from any other consideration, a thoroughgoing<br />
review of the policies of our predecessors seems to me highly<br />
desirable in its own right. Over and'above that, we have a lot to do<br />
ourselves and it will be important that we should have the widest<br />
possible options available to us in instituting our own programmes.<br />
In the light of our idscussions, I have concluded that the<br />
only effective way in which the close scrutiny of the previous<br />
Government's continuing policies can be carried out is through the<br />
setting up of a high leveal " task force" for that purpose. You have<br />
agreed to serve as the leader of that task force.<br />
It is essential, I, think, to keep the task force small and I<br />
am proposing the appointment of six people of appropriate standing and<br />
capacity to assist you, namely<br />
Mr. M. A. Besley, First Assistant Secretary,<br />
Department of External Territories.<br />
Dr. S. F. Harris, Deputy Secretary,<br />
Department of Overseas Trade.<br />
Mr. R. D. Phillips, Deputy Director-General,<br />
Department of Civil Aviation.<br />
Mr. J. J. Spigelman, Senior Adviser to the<br />
Prime Minister.<br />
Mr. J. O. Stone, Deputy Secretary ( Economic),<br />
Department of the Treasury.<br />
Mr. P. P. McGuiness, Senior Adviser to the<br />
Minister for Social Security,<br />
I am requesting that these officers should serve in their<br />
personal as distinct from departmental or other capacities.<br />
As leader of the task force, you will have the tight to call<br />
on departments for such information, and for the preparation of such<br />
papers, as you deem relevant to your enquiries.<br />
So far as purely administrative aspects are concerned, you<br />
have authority to make such arrangements as you deem appropriate in the<br />
circumstances. No doubt those appointed to assist you would in any<br />
case be able to draw on their own departments for " back-up" in the<br />
pursuit of your enquiries.<br />
In order to avoid any problems that might arise in preparing<br />
a report from the task force as a whole, I am placing responsibility<br />
for its report upon you personally. That is, I envisage that the<br />
task force as a whole would discuss what should go into your report;<br />
but you, as leader, will decide. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
I should be grateful if you would arrange for your report<br />
to be available to me well before the Budget. I would then propose<br />
to bring it forward for consideration by Ministers in the Budget<br />
context. Yours sincerely,<br />
E. G. WHITLAM<br />
Dr. H. C. Coombs,<br />
