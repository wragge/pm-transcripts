    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am saddened to hear of the recent death of Mr Simon Wiesenthal in Vienna, at the age of 96.</p>
<p> In particular, I wish to express my sympathy to the members of the family of   Mr Wiesenthal and to the Jewish community who are mourning his passing.</p>
<p>A concentration camp survivor, Mr Wiesenthal devoted his life to bringing to justice those who perpetrated egregious crimes, including genocide, helping to bring over 1100 Nazi war criminals to justice. Throughout his life he fought tirelessly against racism, and in particular anti-Semitism.  He worked to ensure that those who perpetrated crimes against humanity were held accountable and that the world did not forget the suffering their actions brought to generations of victims of the Holocaust.</p>
<p>As a community we must remain vigilant against the evil represented by those who advocate violence and hatred.  Mr Wiesenthal's death provides us all with an opportunity to reflect on the destructive power of racism and the lessons of the Holocaust.  We are reminded of the value of tolerance, fairness and equality, and that all people are of equal value regardless of their religion, colour or ethnicity.  We are also reminded of the importance to the international community of challenging violent regimes and fighting tyranny and injustice.</p>
<p>  Those are the lessons of Mr Wiesenthal's life. They are the things he stood for.  The Australian community is grateful for the extraordinary contribution he made and the important legacy he left the international community.</p>
