PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, COBURG PRIMARY SCHOOL, MELBOURNE,<br />
24 MARCH 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, in the unlikely event that<br />
you lose tonight, is there life after this? What do you<br />
do? PM: Well, I didn't think that I'd be starting of f with a<br />
hypothetical but I'm prepared to. I will do what I've<br />
said during the campaign that I would see what the Party<br />
wanted me to do and I would listen to what they had to<br />
say. If they wanted me to stay on as leader I would<br />
listen to that but I wouldn't necessarily accept it. But<br />
I have had a life long involvement with and commitment to<br />
the Australian Labor Party. It is the party for the<br />
people of Australia and I wouldn't lightly just ignore<br />
their wishes, I would want to take it into account. But<br />
having said that, having answered the hypothetical, I am<br />
confident that the good sense of the Australian<br />
electorate-will prevail again and that I'll have the<br />
great honour and privilege of continuing to lead<br />
Australia as its Prime Minister.<br />
JOURNALIST: I ask the question that way simply because<br />
it looks as though it is going to be extremely tight<br />
tonight. How tight do you think it's going to be and is<br />
it possible that we won't get a clear result tonight?<br />
PM: I think we'll know tonight. It is the case that<br />
there will be a higher vote for the non-major parties on<br />
this occasion than there has been in the past, for a<br />
number of reasons, and the most important of which I<br />
think is probably the increasing interest in<br />
environmental matters. It does seem to be the case as<br />
far as we can tell from our own research and the<br />
published polls that we will get a clear majority of the<br />
preferences of the Democrats and the environmentally<br />
inclined Independents. And I guess in answer to that<br />
part of the question which goes to when will we know the<br />
result, it may be that one will have to apply this<br />
evening some assumptions a little bit more than in the<br />
past. But I think, on the basis of our knowledge, we<br />
will be in a position to make those sorts of assumptions<br />
about the distribution of preferences. </p>

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you more nervous at this<br />
stage of voting day than you have been in the previous<br />
two elections?<br />
PM: I don't get nervous and in the same way I don't get<br />
cocky or complacent. I don't get nervous. I mean, one<br />
of my principles in life has been because I've seen it<br />
happen so often to others that you don't worry about<br />
things which you can do nothing about. I've seen people<br />
destroy themselves by just worrying and fretting about<br />
things over which they can have no control and do<br />
nothing. It would be stupid for me to be nervous now.<br />
I've given this campaign my best shot. I've tried with<br />
all the resources at my command to do the job that I<br />
think the Australian people want of me. That is to<br />
explain my policies and to expose the inadequacies of the<br />
alternative. Now I've done the best shot, I've given<br />
that the best shot. Now that's done. There's no point<br />
in being nervous about it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you have a gut feeling about<br />
tonight? PM: Yes, I have a gut feeling. I think the Australian<br />
people generally speaking in the post-war period have got<br />
it right. And I say that knowing that we were out of<br />
office for a long period and I think we were out of<br />
office for a long period because we were demonstrating to<br />
the public in the Labor Party that we couldn't control<br />
ourselves, govern ourselves, and I think the Australian<br />
electorate made the judgement that if you couldn't<br />
control yourselves you weren't proper to control the<br />
government of the country. I think they've essentially<br />
got their judgements right in federal elections for a<br />
very long period and I don't think they're going to get<br />
it wrong this time.<br />
