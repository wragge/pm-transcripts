MT. ISA. RAILWAY ITTERNATIONAL BAK LOAN PROPOSAL<br />
Statement by the Acting Prime Minister the Rt. Hon. J. McEweng M. P.<br />
The. Acting'Prime Minister ( Mr. McEvien) said today the<br />
Prime Minister ( Mr. Menzies) while in Washington had interviewed<br />
the Chairman and Board of Directors of the International Bank to<br />
explore further the Mt. Isa railway loan proposal which the<br />
Commonwealth and Queensland Governments had been sponsoring for<br />
some time. Mr. McEwen said that as an outcome of Mr. Menzies'<br />
discussions with the Ban, a proposal had emerged that the<br />
appropriate Queensland Minister, who would no doubt be the<br />
Treasurer, and Mr. G. R. Fisher9 Chairman of Mt. Isa Mines Ltd.<br />
should go to Washington for explicit discussions with the<br />
International Bank on points involved in any loan arrangements<br />
which had hitherto not been resolved to the satisfaction of the<br />
various parties. Mr. McEwen said he had conveyed this suggestion, received<br />
from Mr. Menzies, to Mr. F. Nicklin, Premier of Queensland, who<br />
had intimated his willingness that his Treasurer should visit<br />
Washington in the near future. He had also conveyed the<br />
suggestion directly to Mr, Fisher who irmmediately expressed his<br />
willingness to go to Washington as soon as it was convenient to<br />
the Queensland Minister.<br />
Mr. McEwen said he was sure that through these arrangements,<br />
Mr. Menzies had now established a basis of personal contact for<br />
the Queensland Government and the Mt. Isa Company with the<br />
International Ban officials.<br />
This would no doubt load to an identification of the issues<br />
which were decisive to the whole proposal.<br />
As the Commonwealth Government was the principal, as<br />
ultimate guarantor of any loan, the Federal Treasurer ( Mr. Holt)<br />
had agreed to arrange for an appropriate official of the<br />
Commonwealth Treasury to be present at Washington also.<br />
