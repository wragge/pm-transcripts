    <content><![CDATA[<p>It is with great regret that my wife and I have learnt of the death of Dame Enid Lyons.</p>
<p>Dame Enid has given a lifetime of service to her country.Born and raised in Tasmania, she represented the Tasmanian electorate of Darwin from 1943 to 1951 and was the first woman member of the House of Representatives. In 1949 she was made Vice President of the Federal Executive Council in the Menzies Ministry becoming the first woman Minister in the Commonwealth Parliament. She was later a Commissioner of the ABC from 1951 to 1962.</p>
<p>For almost a quarter of a century she stood beside her husband, the late Joe Lyons, in political life, until he died in 1939 after serving his country as Prime Minister for seven years.</p>
<p>Dame Enid was an inspiration to many and her long life bore testament to her sense of dedication and service.</p>
<p>To her family, we extend our deepest sympathies.</p>
<p>Â 2 September 1983</p>
