<p> Mobil fuel crisis.</p>
<p>E&amp;OE...........................................................................................</p>
<p> REYNOLDS:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, you have singled backbenchers, Trish Draper and Trish Worth,</p>
<p> out for praise in the past, now they are campaigning against your tampon</p>
<p> tax. Are you wrong?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Can I just answer that by saying this, what we are talking about here</p>
<p> is a small element of the GST which is part of an overall, dramatic improvement</p>
<p> to our tax system. We are not talking about a tax on an item in isolation,</p>
<p> or a GST in isolation. We are talking about a tax change that is going</p>
<p> to make our exports cheaper, our business operating costs lower, our fuel</p>
<p> in the bush cheaper. And overall give Australians a $12 billion tax cut</p>
<p> and give us the most modern taxation system this country has seen in fifty</p>
<p> years, and also enable this country to be even more competitive in international</p>
<p> markets. Now it is important to see every aspect of the GST as part of</p>
<p> that whole. Now you can always mount an argument not to tax an individual</p>
<p> item, I understand that. And taken in isolation that argument can be compelling.</p>
<p> But you can't take things in isolation, you've got to look at</p>
<p> it, every little part as a section of the whole, and that is what I am</p>
<p> doing in relation to this. And if you take the GST off say tampons, within</p>
<p> a few days, I promise you, there will be a group of people mounting quite</p>
<p> a respectable argument in isolation to take it off children's clothing.</p>
<p> Everybody needs clothing and that argument can be mounted. I mean, our</p>
<p> original idea was that you had it on virtually everything and then because</p>
<p> of the need to get the support of the Democrats in order to get the legislation</p>
<p> through Parliament, we had to agree to take out certain food items. Now</p>
<p> we didn't want to do that. Not because we want to tax things in particular,</p>
<p> it is just the fewer exemptions you have, the better the system. The more</p>
<p> exemptions you have, the more pressure there is to have still more exemptions,</p>
<p> and the still more exemptions you have you then start to threaten the</p>
<p> existence of the whole system. Now that of course is what our political</p>
<p> opponents want, but I remind them and I remind your listeners that we</p>
<p> took this to the election in 1998, we won that election, we've got</p>
<p> it through the Parliament. It is now the law and I am opposed to any further</p>
<p> exemptions.</p>
<p>REYNOLDS:</p>
<p>Well, New South Wales Liberal Leader, Kerry Chikarovski also wants the</p>
<p> decision reversed. You're not going to listen to her?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I have explained why I don't believe any change should be made.</p>
<p>REYNOLDS:</p>
<p>Well, the Tasmanian Government's received legal advice from the</p>
<p> State's Anti-discrimination Commissioner that women could pursue</p>
<p> a class action against the Commonwealth. Do you take that seriously?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I am quite certain that if people hunt around you can find somebody</p>
<p> who will express an opinion like that about just about every aspect of</p>
<p> government behaviour and government life. There is nothing in front of</p>
<p> me that suggests there is any form of discrimination involved of any kind.</p>
<p> Look, we haven't set out to discriminate against anybody, what we</p>
<p> have set out to do is to give this country a tax system for the 21st</p>
<p> century. And if we're going to spend all of our time debating in</p>
<p> isolation the minutiae of the taxes application or a particular item we</p>
<p> will lose sight of the overall national benefit. Because everytime you</p>
<p> exempt something, you open up pressure to exempt something more.</p>
<p>REYNOLDS:But Canada . . .</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:And once that happens, then the whole system begins</p>
<p> to unravel and I am not going to allow a change which will be of enormous</p>
<p> benefit to this country, I mean we are going to take billions of dollars</p>
<p> off the cost of Australia's exports, we are going to reduce the cost</p>
<p> of fuel in the bush by billions of dollars a year, we are going to have</p>
<p> 80% of Australian taxpayers on a top marginal rate of no more than 30</p>
<p> cents in the dollar and if we start unravelling and unpicking and pulling</p>
<p> this thing apart, you are going to threaten that. And this reform, this</p>
<p> new system of which the GST is but one part, will be of enormous economic</p>
<p> benefit to Australia that is why I support it. And that is why I believe</p>
<p> in it so very strongly.</p>
<p> REYNOLDS:</p>
<p> But Canada saw its way clear to exclude women's</p>
<p> sanitary products from the GST.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Canada would be about the worst example of any country</p>
<p> in recent years to follow in relation to the GST. If you want an example</p>
<p> that was far more successful, have a look at New Zealand.</p>
<p> REYNOLDS:</p>
<p> Well the AMA and gynaecologists also say that 10% of</p>
<p> women need to use tampons for a medical condition. Doesn't that .</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well, as I said, Fiona . .</p>
<p> REYNOLDS:</p>
<p> . . . doesn't that undermine your argument?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Fiona, as I said at the beginning of this interview, if you look at something</p>
<p> in isolation you can mount an argument. That is not the point. The point</p>
<p> is whether we want a new tax system for a new century. Whether we want</p>
<p> $12 billion of personal tax cuts. Whether we want 80% of Australians on</p>
<p> a top marginal rate of 30% or whether we want cheaper fuel in the bush</p>
<p> and billions of dollars taken off our exports. Now, if we want all of</p>
<p> those benefits the only way that you can achieve it is to have an essentially</p>
<p> comprehensive broad-based indirect tax replacing the existing ramshackle</p>
<p> wholesale tax system and that is what we are determined and resolved to</p>
<p> do. And I expect on a whole range of items over the next five months people</p>
<p> are going to put their hands up and say why don't you exempt Âx',</p>
<p> why don't you do this, why don't you do that. And looked at</p>
<p> in isolation all of those things can sound very respectable but whereas</p>
<p> the AMA and other groups may be able to look at things in isolation when</p>
<p> you are the Prime Minister of the whole country you have to look at the</p>
<p> national benefit. And essentially we are changing the tax system for Australia's</p>
<p> benefit, we are not living out some ideological commitment. I am doing</p>
<p> this because I believe it will make Australia stronger and better economically.</p>
<p>REYNOLDS:</p>
<p>Your Health Minister, Dr Michael Wooldridge, apologised yesterday for</p>
<p> causing offence by equating shaving cream with tampons, are you sorry</p>
<p> for causing offence?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Michael Wooldridge chose a particular remark. He's made a</p>
<p> subsequent observation about that, that is entirely a matter for him.</p>
<p> I don't believe that the Government's decision is in any way</p>
<p> offensive and the position that we are taking is in no way offensive.</p>
<p> Everybody has a different way of explaining and defending Government decisions</p>
<p> and I give great credit to Michael - great credit to Michael - for saying</p>
<p> what he has just said.</p>
<p>REYNOLDS:</p>
<p>Well, while you were on leave there was some speculation of a reshuffle</p>
<p> and Dr Michael Wooldridge was one who was named. Can you rule out a reshuffle?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>None of that speculation came from me and as far as Michael is concerned</p>
<p> I think he is a quite outstanding Health Minister and he has my total</p>
<p> confidence and total support.</p>
<p>REYNOLDS:</p>
<p>So no reshuffle this year?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>All of that speculation came from others.</p>
<p>REYNOLDS:</p>
<p>You are heading on a tour of regional communities next week, they are</p>
<p> now amongst the worst affected from the aviation fuel crisis. When will</p>
<p> planes be back in the air?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I find that hard to answer Fiona. This is, of course, something</p>
<p> that has come from out of the clear blue sky no pun intended. It is really</p>
<p> a very difficult issue. We are in the hands of the experts. The absolute</p>
<p> first priority is safety. You can't take risks going into the air</p>
<p> if there's any danger and we are in the hands of the experts. And</p>
<p> as far as we are concerned we are pressing the authorities, we are pressing</p>
<p> Mobil, we are encouraging the experts to come up with the necessary tests</p>
<p> and procedures and clearances as soon as possible. Now, I feel very deeply</p>
<p> for people who are dependent on the aviation industry. I feel deeply for</p>
<p> the pilots and the operators and all of those people associated and I</p>
<p> can understand that they would be looking to the appropriate people for</p>
<p> legal advice. John Anderson has, although he's meant to go on leave,</p>
<p> he's remained on the job to continue to pursue the matter as the</p>
<p> responsible Minister. I am concerned about it but it's one of those</p>
<p> things that really as a layman I can't override the views of the</p>
<p> experts. If an expert says to me it's not safe to fly I can't</p>
<p> override that and in the end we are in the hands of the experts.</p>
<p>REYNOLDS:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, thank you for your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You're welcome.</p>
