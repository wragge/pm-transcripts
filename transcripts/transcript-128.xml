COPY OF LETTER FROM THiE PREMIER OF QUEENSLAND<br />
TO THE PRIME MINISTER DATED 28TH OCTOBER, 1959<br />
My dear Prime Minister, My Government gratefully accepts the offer<br />
to finance the construction of the Mount Isa Railway Project as<br />
outlined in your letter of the 26th instant.<br />
In order that there be no delays in<br />
reaching final agreement on all points, we have already commenced<br />
to prepare the details as set out in paragraphs one to three in<br />
the annexure to your letter. At this stage, all our advices are<br />
that the Project will broadly encompass the full scheme as<br />
outlined in the Ford Bacon and Davis reports.<br />
We are firmly of the opinion that Mount<br />
Isa Mines Limited should complete a freight agreement with my<br />
Government and have no doubt that they will acquiesce in completing<br />
such an agreement, substantially along the lines tentatively<br />
agreed on previously. I agree with you that minor matters can be<br />
clarified later when your proposal is being written into agreement<br />
form. You will be pleased to know that Ford Bacon<br />
and Davis will be asked by my Government to not only act as<br />
Engineer-Managers, but also to prepare an operating schedule for<br />
our northern line. Additionally, they will be asked to make a<br />
review of the entire operation of our complete railway system.<br />
This project will I believe, be of tremendous<br />
benefit not only to Queensland but to the whole of Australia,<br />
as it will open wide to development one of the richest mineral<br />
and pastoral areas of the Commonwealth. It is particularly<br />
significant that this agreement should have be-en -brou-ght to<br />
fruition in Queen-sland's-Certenar--Year,-<br />
My colleagues and I deeply appreciate your<br />
Government's interest, and particularly the part played personally<br />
by yourself and your Treasurer in making such a material<br />
contribution to the successful conclusion of the ' Lengthy and<br />
difficult ne., otiations that have taken place in connection with<br />
the Project. Please accept our sincere thanks.<br />
I would suggest that you be responsible for<br />
the release to the Press, but would appreciate it if you would<br />
advise me when you are making such release.<br />
Kind regards, Yours sincerely,<br />
Frank Nicklin<br />
Premier </p>
