PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 15 December 1989<br />
I will be paying an official visit to New Zealand from<br />
1-4 February 1990.<br />
Earlier this year, Prime Minister Palmer invited me to visit<br />
New Zealand in early February next year to participate in<br />
New Zealand's 150th Anniversary celebrations. I am very<br />
happy to be able to take up his kind invitation.<br />
While in New Zealand, I will be holding extensive<br />
discussions with Prime Minister Palmer. Our agenda will<br />
cover bilateral, regional and global issues and address<br />
environmental, political, and economic developments.<br />
I will also have the opportunity to attend some of thie<br />
events and ceremonies associated with -the Commoniweal h Games<br />
being held in Auckland at the time.<br />
The relationship with New Zealand remains one of our most<br />
impo. tant bilateral relationships. 1990 is an important year<br />
and I know that: all. Australians will join me in<br />
congratulating New Zealand on the 150th Anniversary of the<br />
signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. It is also a year ini<br />
which b) oth countries will be commemorating the<br />
anniversary of the ANZAC landing Gallipoli ani event<br />
which not only forged the ANZAC ties but also helped -to<br />
develop a sense of national consciousness in both countries.<br />
I am looking forward very much to the opportunitLy which this<br />
trip provides for me to reaffirm the priority Australia<br />
attaches to the relationship with New Zealand, -to<br />
participate in -their .150th celebrations, and to discuss the<br />
issues which will sustain this important relationship Into<br />
the future.<br />
