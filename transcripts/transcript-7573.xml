CENTRE AND TRAINING, 19 APRIL 1989<br />
a a 0 E proof only<br />
PM' because the decisions which we took in the April<br />
Statement will put noQ pressure on interest rates because we've<br />
financed the very substantial tax cuts and family allowances<br />
out of the surplus that we generated by the previous tough<br />
decisions that we've taken. The level of demand that<br />
characterised the previous twelve months will not be theta in<br />
the same proportions because there won't be the great surge of<br />
income coming from the improvement in the terms of trade and we<br />
think therefore that intrinsically there is no reason. But, as<br />
I say, I don't got into the question of prediction of short<br />
term rates because that, of itself, can have some impact. I'm<br />
simply laying that the Government has made the decisions that<br />
are neceasary to keep a level of viable economic growth but not<br />
at the same high level that we ' ve got now because we can't, as<br />
must be evident from the figures yesterday, we can't have a<br />
level of economic activity in Australia which koeps sucking in<br />
too many imports. Vow the evidence is starting to emerge I<br />
think that we are levelling off in the economic activity in<br />
this country. That's good &amp; Ad I can give the commitment to the<br />
people of Australia, am I do, that high interest rates, tight<br />
monetary policy won't be kept there for one moment, one day<br />
longer than is necessary because, as I say, I'm not a mug. I<br />
know that people don't like high interest rates. I don't like<br />
them myself. But it is necessary to protect the Australian<br />
economy. JOuR4ALIST&amp; do you think further tightening of fiscal<br />
policy during the April Statement might have been a good idea?<br />
PMe No, let me make two points about that* about the further<br />
tightening of fiscal policy. The first is that we did take off<br />
another three quarters of a billion dollars and we simply are<br />
in a position now an a community where you can't be cutting<br />
public outlays any more. Remember what we've done. In this<br />
coming year there'll be four years in a row of real reductions,<br />
real reductions in Commonwealth outlays. We've reduced<br />
Commonwealth outlays as a percentage of # gross domestic product<br />
from 30 percent down to 25 percent. We've got the Budget into<br />
surplus now years in a row, hasn't been done for thirty<br />
five years. We've got a tighter fiscal policy than has been in<br />
this country since statistics have been kept. Now what </p>
<p>P. M.' s PRESS OFFICE CANB TEL: 61-062-732923 2.<br />
( PM cont)<br />
therefore does tighter fiscal policy mean in those<br />
circumstances? It means cutting into the services of ordinary<br />
Australian people in the area of education, of welfare, of<br />
roads and the pension and so on. So the obligation is upon our<br />
political opponents, if they just blandly get up as Mr Howard<br />
did last Thursday night in the House and say ' We would cut<br />
public expenditure more'. Easily said. The time has come for<br />
Mr Howard now to put up or shut up and say ' this is where we'd<br />
cut, we'd cut your social welfare, we'd cut your roads, we'd<br />
cut your defence, we'd Cut your education'. Let him say so and<br />
then he can be judged.<br />
JOURNALISTs Prime Minister, Nobby Clark has said again this<br />
morning he expects interest rates to rise to 16.5 or 17<br />
percent. PM: Yes, well you mention Nobby Clark but he's not the only<br />
person from the banking industry who's spoken today. That's<br />
not the unanimous statement of the banking industry today so<br />
why take any particular notice of him where others haven't<br />
endorsed what he's had to say?<br />
JOURNALISTs Do you share the Treasurer's view of the National<br />
Australia Bank then that it's not accepting a cut in profit<br />
where it could have?<br />
PMs I agree entirely with what Mr Keating has said on that and<br />
on other matters in regard to the economy over recent days<br />
because, as usual, we are at one on these issues.<br />
JOURNALISTi, So you wouldn't expect there to be<br />
PMs Inaudible<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister you talked about community<br />
cooveration today at the opening here. Are you confident<br />
you ve got the cooperation of the community with your economic<br />
policies at the moment?<br />
PMi Well, obviously the community doesn't like the high<br />
interest rates and I understand that. I don't like them myself<br />
and so you've got a situation where, if you look at the level<br />
of popularity of the Government, we're down a little bit. We'd<br />
probably still win an election on the Gallop poil figurem today<br />
and those were taken before the Statement of last Wedesday.<br />
So there is some concern about the level of interest rates, but<br />
basically people the understand, I think, that we've been in<br />
oix years, we've given them employment growth better than<br />
they've ever had before, better than the rest of the world,<br />
lowered unemployment and brought inflation down from the very<br />
high level we inherited. There's, as far as they're concerned,<br />
a bit of a dip, they don't like now the financial Well, I<br />
understand that, but I'm not going to change monetary policy<br />
just now because there ' might be some unpopularity I What<br />
you've got to do is to keep those policies ln place which<br />
are necessary to look after the Australian economy. We've<br />
shown in the past that we're prepared to take the tough<br />
decisions, you can't cut public public outlays in the way we hav'q.<br />
19,04,89 15: 22 No. O04 P. 03 </p>
<p>( PM cont)<br />
over all this period without taking a lot of tough decisions.<br />
We'll take the decisions that are necessary to look after the<br />
welfare of Australia.<br />
JOIMAALISTs ( inaudible)<br />
PH: Well, in economics you can neve~ r be absolutely certain<br />
about any prediction, I mean, there's no economist in the<br />
world, including myself, if you know anything about economics,<br />
and say that you can be absolutely certain about outcomes. I<br />
mean economics is about the aggrelate of decisions. in this<br />
country of 16.5 million individuala and groups of individuals<br />
and economic outcomes in this country are not only the outcome<br />
of the decisions of 18.5 million people, well all those acting<br />
on behalf of their children as wel l, but it's the outcome of<br />
what happens in a world of Borne six billion people. Now don't<br />
be silly and suggest that in that sort of world you can be<br />
cartain about Outcomes. All that you can do is to make the<br />
decisions which you think are most calculated to produce the<br />
right results. Now, we're entitled to be listened to now an<br />
the basis of six years in Government where we've oot it right.<br />
JOURNALISTS The banks seem to be indicating that they're only<br />
waiting for next month's inflation figures before they raise<br />
mortage rates.<br />
PM: Well, let's Bee. Does it mean that if the inflation rate<br />
goes down that they'll lower intereet rate.? I meant the banks<br />
have historically a reasonably well demonstrated capacity to<br />
try and take advantage of whatever circumstance they see that<br />
serves their own interest, But let me wait and see what they<br />
do. Simply because one spokesman says interest rates are going<br />
to go up further doesn't mean that tat's what will happen.<br />
But I think that we have done all that we can to create the<br />
conditions where, over the longer term, interest rates will<br />
fall, but I'm not saying that that's an immediate prospect.<br />
JOURNALISTS You say yourself to be concerned about the young<br />
Australians. Are you aware of the fact that there We6<br />
young Australians, juvenile delinquents are being held in adult<br />
prisons around Australia at the moment even though this<br />
contravenes the Human Rights guidelines<br />
PM: Well that's a matter, of course, that you need to take up<br />
with the State Governments because the question of people being<br />
hold in prison and so on and under what conditions is a matter<br />
for State Governments and that's a matter which you have to<br />
take up with the State Governments concerned. All I can say is<br />
that as far as this Government in concerned and what we've done<br />
for youth, it is now understood by everyone-in the welfare<br />
community that there's simply never been, in the history of<br />
this country, a Government which has done so much and so<br />
positively to the welfare of youth.<br />
JOURNALISTS Are You worried about cormunity perceptions that<br />
come of the gains that you gave in the wage/ tax statement might<br />
be being eroded by high inflation and also by high interest<br />
rates? </p>
<p>pm4; Well, I've already addressed that on a Aumber of<br />
occasions. Let Me do it again, in fact I've alluded to it<br />
already in an answer I've given you before. The decisions that<br />
we took on Wednesday in the economic Statement will not, of<br />
themselves, have an adverse impact upon either inflation or<br />
interest rates. Why do I say that? Let's look at inflation<br />
first. In regard to wages outcomes there is a com~ mitment by<br />
the trade union movement for an aggregate wages outcome of<br />
percent in 1989/ 90. Now that means, and it wil. l be delivered,<br />
that means that on the wages front taere will not be upward<br />
prssure on inflation. We expect inflation, therefore, to come<br />
down. On intereat rates, I've indicated to you that as far as<br />
the paqkage is concerned, we've paid for that out of our<br />
accumulated surpluses. It is a paid for tax cut and welfare<br />
pack~ age and we will have for 1989/ 90F the same level of<br />
surpluses we had before. We'll have, as we had this year, a<br />
zero public sector borrowing requirement. We will be making no<br />
demand upon savings so therefore on both the Inflation and-the<br />
0 interest rates front, there is nio reason by what we've done<br />
see*<br />
JOURNALIST a ( inaudib~ le)<br />
PX:' Brian Noakes is unrepresentative of Australian employer Is.<br />
He can't even speak for people he's been associated with<br />
himself, I mean, the most vibrant sector of the employers that<br />
he used to speak for, those in the metal trades, Metal Trades<br />
Employers, they repudiate Brian Noakes. He doesn't speak f or<br />
them. The Metal Trades Employers joined with the Government<br />
and the ACTU in theaft?'( 1that has been taken, they endorse what<br />
we are doing. Brian Noakes in a professional pessimist and'CAl<br />
is, to a very large extent, is an arm~ of the Liberal Party.<br />
You can take very little notice of them. Listen to the<br />
employers, both organisationally and individually, who are<br />
about, positively about, developing this country. You get very<br />
so,. cooperation from them. For those who want to peddle their<br />
politics, as Brian Noakes good luck to them se<br />
JOURNALISTS some of the more cynical among us might think<br />
you are heading for an early election<br />
P14: as I said before, no early election<br />
ends </p>
