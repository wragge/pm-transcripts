RADIO INTERVIEW JOBN LAW'S PROGR] V4NE WITH ' HE PRIIE 14INJSTIR<br />
FRIDAY 7 AUGUST 1981<br />
Prime Minister: Happy birthday John.<br />
Laws: Ah, that's very nice of you. Thank you. That's verly..<br />
nice of you I appreciate it.<br />
Prime Minister: Anyway, what are you going to do?<br />
Laws: I'm going to get back on that big motor,. bike that you...<br />
told me not to get on.<br />
Prime Minister: Which one is it this time?<br />
Laws: I didn't buy-that one that we were talking about. I got<br />
hold of a 430 Husquavana.<br />
Prime Minister: Oh, good heavens.<br />
Laws: Great motor bike.<br />
Prime Minister: That's a really exciting machine.<br />
Laws: Yes, that's a fabulous motor bike and there's another<br />
one around, that if ever you get an opportunity to try it you<br />
should. It's a 390 CC Hlusquavana Automatic. And that's<br />
unbelievable it's really a fabulous motor bike. while we're<br />
Into machinery, are you going to buy that little Alfa they<br />
said on the television the other night you were looking out to<br />
buy? Prime Minister: That was during the car strike down here<br />
and I was driving myself and enjoying it. Jt'sa lovely little<br />
car but the agent's got a twin better version which is just<br />
a little bit tougher. So I'm tempted but I don't get a chance<br />
to drive very much, but it's a beautiful machine it really is.<br />
a V6., Io , s very good and it looks as though it'd handle<br />
_ re tt </p>
<p>Prime lHinister: It handles very well and it's got a lot of room<br />
in the front. It's a small trunk but it fits in tall people<br />
very easily.<br />
Laws: t Yes, I haven't looked at them or sat in them, but _ I'l1<br />
take your advice on that as I took your advice on the motor bike<br />
and I did fall off the motor bike Incidentally.<br />
Primne Minister: You fell off!<br />
Laws: Yes I certainly did.<br />
Prime 1Minister: it's very easy to do.<br />
Laws: It's not difficult is it! Well, you've come back to.<br />
some interesting situations in Auostralia.. It seems when you<br />
go away things seem to happen and when yob come back they seem<br />
to happen even more because next week you've got this sumriit.<br />
meeting to decide on the alternatives to wage indexation. Did<br />
you really predict the downfall of indexation?<br />
Prime 14nister: No, I think that probably moved a little faster<br />
than I would have expected. The main thing next week. is-to get.<br />
a broad understanding of the Government's position. We have., got<br />
on the board in terms of<br />
and employment' that*' s rising and real wages have also risen very<br />
substantially over the last 12 months, and so you Rnow we<br />
oughtn't to have to argue the real benefits. of obir policies,, but<br />
we have got to consolidate it and build on it and imake sure it<br />
doesn't get blown away by irrationally stupid or unreasorsabie<br />
strikes or by a few powerful people in One contnunity trying to.<br />
grab too much for theipselves. And, you know, the ACTU want; us<br />
to maintain a centralised nystem of wage fixing, well, you ] mow,<br />
if they want that and are serious about it, and I've got no<br />
reason to doubt it$ then I think the community has a right -to </p>
<p>expect some kind of restraint on claims made outside the<br />
arbitration system.*<br />
Laws: What sort of stand do you expect from the ACTU?<br />
Prime Minister: During the Transport Workers' dispute, I<br />
think they demonstrated and we demonstrated that we could<br />
both work together as Australians, certainly from different<br />
Organisations, but nobody was trying to grandstand, nobody<br />
wa s trying to score points over the other or claim victorias<br />
or defeats; we were trying to solve a problem together on.-the<br />
basis of some agreed principles.-And basically, that worked,<br />
and it was sensible. I can see no reason why we shouldn't<br />
approach matters next week in the same week. We can't solve<br />
things nex: t week, because these are matters which involve -the<br />
ArbtraionCommission, they not only involve the A CU the-Y<br />
involve all their constituent parts~ all the other trade uions.<br />
Laws: What are the alternatives to wage indexation,?<br />
Prime M~ inister: Well, over the time you have a number of<br />
different'situations -you've had an annual national wage case<br />
apart-from other industry cases. thzouqhout. th-e-couxe. of a year<br />
that'Is.. happened, you know1 quite ' frequently during the course of<br />
Australia's history. The common factor has been the reliance<br />
that has always been mnade on a centralised wage f ixdation system,<br />
And if the ACT) say they want to viaintain that, and 1 can<br />
understand their reasons for it because it is that system -that<br />
protects the weaker unions and the weaker people in the coimrnity.<br />
Dxut at the same time, if we are goin) g to maintain arbitratiLon<br />
as we traditionally know it, I think we have cjot to do inox4e<br />
to make sure that unreasonable strikes do not occur, and that<br />
people accept the unbiased verdict, or they-think that we . ought<br />
to be going to collective bargaining and these are legally<br />
en forcea) Ae </p>
<p>I Laws: Yeswell, what's the possibility o ht<br />
Prime Milnister: Well, It would be a very substantial change<br />
from the current situation. I know it would make a lot of<br />
employers nervous and it's not being advocated by the trade.<br />
* uni~ ons. But, I don't want to go into-the discussions next<br />
* week, you know, having stated fixed views. I want to, on<br />
Tuesday when the Government meats, be able to clarify on our<br />
own mind, on the v'arious options that might be available to<br />
Ila# and then discuss these in a plain way first with the<br />
employerst-then with the unions, and then on the Thursday<br />
wehave got discussions with the States also about wages,<br />
but also about where we are going with interest rates.<br />
Laws: Now, tell me is one of the prime objections of these<br />
dciscussions next week to do somrething about the strike<br />
situation as it has ex-isted in the past 12 months in A~ ustralia?<br />
Prime Minister: Yes, of course it 1s..<br />
Lw: Doyo tkhat youax going to have anyl~ Joy there?<br />
. o you think that the unions and the more powerf ul.-and<br />
generally more militant unions, will be ever prepared to<br />
accept the umpire.' s decision?<br />
Prime M~ inister: I think. that they are starting to understaid.<br />
that the communjity is increasingly impatient with unreasonable<br />
strikes. For example, I believe that most unions who are nlow<br />
involved in Conuonwealth m~ ployrnent know that we would be using<br />
the Cormonwalth sessional provisions in the Commonwealth<br />
employment bill which was passed some time ago which. enables;<br />
us to sospend or stand down people who aren't doing the normal<br />
work for which they are paid. A~ nd you k~ now, we started off by<br />
saying that we only wanted to -use this legislation as a<br />
last resort. Well we're getting to the stac when people who </p>
<p>have ignored arbitration, who won't accept the umpire's verdict,<br />
then they go along and do 70 or 80% of their work, they eyxpect<br />
to be paid by government, which is not really by government, itis<br />
by taxpayers, by John Laws, arnd all the people who have<br />
written to you and everyone else, and we have virtually come<br />
to the position where people are going to do this act and.<br />
these powers will be used and people will be suspended f ort: rwithl.<br />
14ow, I1 think already there's starting to be an understanding<br />
In what we say to the -onions, that this* is the position. And<br />
miaybe a glimmerings of a greater degree of responsibility aid<br />
comimonsense as a result,<br />
Laws: We seem to go so close to it so often, there seems to<br />
develop a situation where we almost reach. a crisis point and<br />
the Government appears that it's going to show. A great deal of<br />
strength, and there's talk of deregistration of unions,. there's<br />
talk of massive standouns or whatever it might be,: and then it<br />
seems to Å“ izz.<br />
Prime Mi1nister: TIhe reason it hasn't is because the unions then<br />
draw back. See, you take the Transport Workers' di spute anal the<br />
-disputes in. Telecom.. Wie were using in the shorthand term the<br />
.* feedback' as it's called, and we had over 2,000 people suspended,<br />
there would ha\' e been about 20,000 people suspended, and thon<br />
the ACTU wanted talks, we ca-me to an arrangement which was<br />
reasonable and people went back to work. without any bans. anm]<br />
limitations so the su) spensions were lifted; -bift the Transport<br />
Workers' Union, we said look we would rather get a declaration<br />
fromn the Arbitration Commission which would either have enabled<br />
us to deregister the Union or part of the Union, or e&gt;: ercisLother<br />
powers on the basis that the Abitration commission has*<br />
Itndicated that the Transport W~ orkers' Union had threatened the </p>
<p>7 7. 17 6.<br />
safety, health or welfare of the community or part of . the<br />
community, and you. know, they were refusing t o d rive milk<br />
trucks and all this sort of thing.<br />
Laws:, But don't you think it will happen again?<br />
Prime Minister: if it happens again we will go to that<br />
position, but they said alright, if we all go back to work.<br />
axe you going to continue with that action; well on the.<br />
basiis that they were prepared to go back to work forthwith<br />
it ' was reasonable enough not to continue with that action.-<br />
Laws: But, what happens if the same situation arises again<br />
and you're forced into. a. position where you have got to make<br />
moves so it.. looks as though there is a possibility of<br />
deregistration of the union and then they go back to work again,<br />
the damage is still done isn't it?<br />
Prime minister: The daynage is still done, but 1. think ou. t o f<br />
it all there's coming a greater understanding of the union.<br />
movem~ ent that the Government will use the power that it has<br />
taken to itself by legislation over the last two or. three<br />
years and if people behave unreasonably towards the wider<br />
community then we will1 if necessary,' use the powers qnickly ancl<br />
-firmly and irrevocably., if the Transport Workers' Union were f<br />
threatening milk supplies to baby health. centres and hospitals<br />
again, I doubt if anyone could persuade us to call the action<br />
off. I think it would be the third tine. * You see, the<br />
legislation was put in place when the Transport Workers' Union. did th'<br />
in Victoria, I think, what, two or three years ago.<br />
Laws: So, in other words, they have had fair warning, they've<br />
had two or three bites at that cherry.<br />
Prime M~ inister: It was put there, because they, you know, with<br />
respect to milk, they beld up milk two or three years aqo and </p>
<p>we didn't have the powers we needed to deal with them.<br />
Tony Street then introduced these additional sections Into<br />
the legislation, we showed that we were quite prepared to<br />
use-those provisions In the dispute of two or three weeks<br />
ago. Laws: Prime inister, I am going to have to leave you<br />
because we are about to encounter the news. But, in summary,<br />
next time you . nay not draw back as quickly as you did this time?<br />
Prime llinister: Next time, if they cut milk supplies, again<br />
keeping it nice and simple, I believe that we would go straight<br />
in and use those provisions and would not draw back from it.<br />
Laws: Thank's very much for your time, it was good to talk<br />
to you.<br />
Prime Minister: Thank you very much.<br />
Laws: Goodbye.<br />
