EMBARGO NOT FOR RELEASIEPBEFORE 7.15 PNJ0-"<br />
Senate Election 1967<br />
FINAL MESSAGE FROM THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
( MR HAROLD HOLT)<br />
22ND NOVEMIBER, 1967<br />
( This final message will be broadcast and telecast nationally this evening.<br />
The ABC will broadcast the talk at 7.15 pm ( EST) and the telecast will be<br />
at 8.30 pm 
This is my last opportunity to speak directly to you all before<br />
you vote on Sattirday. So I would like to sum up this Senate campaign as<br />
I see it. You will all know by now that this is not an election to choose a<br />
government. YVou exercised that choice a year ago and your answer was<br />
decisively In my Government's favour. On Saturday, your responsibility<br />
is to elect thirty Senators five from each State and therefore I ask you<br />
by your vote to give us the majority we need In the Senate. You can do this<br />
by electing a majority of Government Senators In each of the six States.<br />
The tirst and most obvious reason for doing this is that we cannot<br />
have the most effective administration If a Government with a big majority<br />
In the House of Representatives the popular House-lacks a majority in<br />
the Senate. If you ask why, the answer may be stated quite simply.<br />
Although the Senate Is intended to function as a House safeguarding State<br />
interests and as a House of Review, It acts so far as the ALP is concerned<br />
as a party House with a regimented vote.<br />
I should also point out that the Senate is always fairly close to<br />
being evenly divided because it is elected by the proportional system of<br />
voting. That Is an additional reason why I ask for a solid Government vote<br />
in all States. Effective government Is, of course, obviously necessary, but let<br />
me put to you an even more important reason why I ask for your Senate<br />
votes. I am not simply asking you to reaffirm what you said a year ago.<br />
I put the matter with more urgency than that. All of us in the Government<br />
would welcome from you today a repudiation of what the policy-makers of<br />
the Labor Party decided in-Adlaide in July. The Federal Parliamentary<br />
Labor Party Is under direction from the Federal Conference of the ALP to<br />
advocate withdrawal of our armed forces from Viet Nam If the United States<br />
does not bow to the Labor Party's demands.<br />
This is serious enough, but more serious, I suggest, Is the<br />
attitude now taken up by the Leader of the Opposition. His interpretation<br />
of his Federal Conference's binding decision must alarm all thoughtful<br />
Australians. We can only read Into his devious explanations his demand<br />
for cessation of the bombing of North Vietnam and for converting the<br />
conflict into a ' holding operation' that the communists of North Viet Nam<br />
should have unopposed access to the South with no restraint on their<br />
capacity to carry the war to our own troops and those of our allies, and<br />
that our Australian troops and the Americans should merely sit down and try to<br />
defend themselves. We are then told that If these courses are not followed,<br />
a Labor Government would pull out our troops. e e. e / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
The Leader of the Opposition puts forward neither a military nor<br />
a political solution. He talks about my Government encouraging escalation<br />
of the war, yet a plain man's view must be that he is encouraging defeat.<br />
Let us not make any mistake about the significance of Labor's<br />
policy on Viet Nam. This policy, and all it implies, should be understood<br />
by e very Australian as It will be understood by our friends and allies. The<br />
Federal Conference of the Labor Party has refused to accept the nation's<br />
verdict on Viet Nam and external security. It has contemptuously rejected<br />
the electorate's decision a decision reached only seven months before the<br />
Conference met and has threatened to break with the United States on<br />
South-East Asian policy. Anyone would be blind who cannot see this.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition suggests that Issues that seemed<br />
clear a year ago are not so clear now. They were never clear to the Labor<br />
Party. As far as we are concerned, these things are very clear<br />
That South Viet Nam has a right to choose its own way of life;<br />
That a communist takeover in South-East Asia would be contrary<br />
to the vital interests of Australia;<br />
That our alliance with the United States must be preserved! and<br />
That we want peace as much as the Labor Party says it wants<br />
peace but we want peace on decent terms a just and<br />
enduring peace.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition has a taste for challenges these days.<br />
Well, let him stand up in public and read in a loud, clear voice and without<br />
running away from it, the actual resolution carried by the Federal ALP<br />
Conference in Adelaide. It has been hailed by Mr Arthur Galwell, and other<br />
leading Labor spokesmen. So why should Mr Whitlam be so elusive about<br />
his party line? It is understandable, of course, that the Labor Party should, in<br />
this campaign, be eager to talk about anything except the country's external<br />
policy. But even when our opponents talk about the Australian scene it is all<br />
sour grapes. You may recall that a few weeks ago the Opposition was very<br />
peevish when we announced substantial financial help for the Ord River<br />
project in Western Australia and the Nogoa Dam project In Queensland.<br />
They were critical when we gave effect to our promises to provide an<br />
additional $ 50 million for beef roads. They were peevish, incensed and<br />
un happy because these decisions were welcomed by people directly affected<br />
all over Australia. If you think our opponents' reluctance to be pleased by thes e<br />
things Is rather childish, what about the story they have been telling you<br />
about the state of the nation? When the Leader of the Opposition opened<br />
his campaign on the night of November 13, you would have thought this<br />
country was on its Last legs. He was brimming over with synthetic gloom.<br />
He saw A ustralia as a backward, poverty-stricken, rejected country<br />
and we the Government were cast in the role of the villains. That kind<br />
of political childishness only highlights the truths about the P: ustralian scene<br />
today. s. </p>
<p>3-<br />
We are in an almost fantastic growth period and our economic<br />
progress is remarkable by any standards. I would not be so fond or<br />
foolish as to say that our governments since 1949 have been the magicians<br />
who made all this possible. But I can fairly say that sound and stable<br />
government has created the climate In which our national prosperity has<br />
flourished. We enjoy one of the highest standards of living In the world<br />
and there Is no limit to our potential if we go about this in the right way.<br />
I say " in the right way" because the most sensible and practical<br />
domestic programme designed to promote national growth and individual<br />
welfare has little reality unless it Is set In the framework of a foreign<br />
policy cementing our security. You can find plenty of shifting sand in<br />
Labor's policy, but not much cement.<br />
I said at the outset that we cannot have effective administration<br />
unless the Government of the day In command of the popular House also has<br />
a majority voice In rhe Senate.<br />
That is a business-like reason for voting for the Government's<br />
candidates on November<br />
1 also put It to you that It would be bad for Australia to<br />
record a vote which could be Interpreted at home and abroad as support<br />
for the dangerous policy decisions taken by the Federal ALP Conference In<br />
Adelaide. I end this message with the words I used In opening the<br />
campaign what we plan for the well-being and security of Australia and<br />
the development of our country must not be put at risk. </p>
