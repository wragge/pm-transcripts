FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 19 MARCH 1982<br />
LAUNCHING OF' THE SYDNEY CITY MISSION'S 120TH ANNIVERSARY APPEAL<br />
I am delighted and o-honioured to be here today because the<br />
Sydney City Mission provides a living, dynamic, example of how<br />
to help the people in our community who really need help.<br />
This Mission was founded by volunteers who saw the reality of<br />
other people's need and suffering staring them in., theface,. and<br />
these founders got straight on with the job of helping in a<br />
practical way.<br />
As we have bEen told, it was Benjamin Short, the AMP Society's<br />
first insurance salesman, who founded this Mission, with the<br />
help of businessmen, clergymen and Members of Parliament. To<br />
take the initiative and do something about the problems which<br />
they saw in * their community in a purely voluntary way was<br />
impressive at. the time, and it is reassuring that there are so<br />
many people today who are willing to follow their example.<br />
The continuity of concern about poverty and other problems<br />
which members of this Mission have been expressing for the past<br />
120 years shows real dedication. When we look at the<br />
activities of the Sydney Mission in 1982, we can be confident<br />
that the same! kind of concern is going to continue to exist<br />
for years to come.<br />
I wish it was possible to look ahead realistically to a time<br />
when the kind of problems which the Mission takes in hand so<br />
effectively would have been overcome completely to circumstances<br />
in which this kind of suffering would be eliminated entirely,<br />
but while that is probably not possible, our response must<br />
be to strive even harder to achieve as much as we can. There<br />
will continue! to be a job to be done, a task in which all sections<br />
of the community have a role to play and responsibilities to<br />
fulfil.<br />
And I must say that it is impressive to be associated with an<br />
organisation such as this, where there is a dedicated staff of<br />
250 solidly backed up by more than 500 volunteers from all parts<br />
of Sydney, all working to reduce suffering and create a brighter<br />
future for people who are currently experiencing difficulty or<br />
hardship. This Mission helps in opening up lines of communication<br />
with many who can do little to help themselves, the homeless,<br />
young people in crisis, the aged, drug dependants, alcoholics<br />
and needy children.. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Through this work, the Mission is more than a vehicle for helping<br />
such people, it is an investment for the future of us all.<br />
The care and assistance which the Mission provides has given<br />
countless people a firmer and more secure base from which to<br />
begin their lives again, and make a useful and rewarding<br />
contribution to the society in which they live. The task of<br />
giving people confidence and restoring their self-respect is<br />
vastly important in this kind of work, and no person or institution<br />
working in the field can afford to overlook it.<br />
In recent decades govenynents -have become increasingly committed<br />
and involved in trying to help solve many of these kinds of<br />
problems. I believe that the community wants governments to<br />
take a leading part, and there is indeed a great deal that<br />
governments can do. One of the great challenges which governments.<br />
face in this area is to make sure that the help they can offer<br />
goes to the people who really need help and this obviously means<br />
that governments must keep in touch with needs and problems as<br />
they exist inL the real world.<br />
We must at al. l costs avoid falling into the trap of thinking<br />
that governme~ nts could ever replace the kind of work done by<br />
voluntary agEncies in a community in which people care about<br />
each other. Governments plainly need to be able to take advice<br />
from those most closely associated with the needs of the<br />
underprivileg~ ed, and at the same time be able to make their own<br />
sound judgements about needs and priorities.<br />
In coming to terms with the real problems in the most<br />
productive way, there is obviously need for maximum co-operation<br />
between all : levels of government and between the many providers<br />
of community welfare and support services throughout our society.<br />
It is probably inevitable that there will be differences of<br />
emphasis in -the approaches taken by different groups or agencies,<br />
but plainly every effort must be made to avoid any situation in<br />
which different views are pursued to the extent where those<br />
in need lose out.<br />
* Over the last decade or so, the Ccinwealth Government has been ' moving into sane<br />
. areas where it previously had no funding involvement, and dramatically increasing<br />
its level of funding in others where Comonwealth funds pass either directly or<br />
indirectly to voluntary organisations. These areas include<br />
payments to or for state governments to support such services<br />
as senior citizens centres or home care for the elderly, direct<br />
subsidies to assist organisations in providing services like<br />
accommodation for the aged, or sheltered workshop facilities<br />
for disabled people. Total payments of this kind in the social<br />
security and welfare area totall. ed some $ 24 million in 1971-72.<br />
In this financial year it is estimated that they will be more<br />
than $ 220 million.<br />
Commonwealth support for the Mission comes through funding<br />
from programrs as diverse as the Children's Services Program,<br />
the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act, the Aged or Disabled / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
Persons Homes Act, the Emergency Relief Program and the Homeless<br />
Persons Assistance Act. Under this latter program, I understand<br />
the. Minister for Social Security has recently approved a<br />
capital grant of $ 540,000 towards the purchase of the three<br />
buildings making up " The Opposition" youth crisis centre in<br />
Kings Cross. This is an important initiative in an area of<br />
present great concern, and it is perhaps one area for which your<br />
founder, Benjamin Short, may not have even contemplated a need.<br />
But in attempting to find solutions to the unfortunate problem<br />
of youth homelessness, the Sydney City Mission has<br />
demonstrated its relevance today just as much as it did 120<br />
years ago. Youth homelessness and drug abuse, although certainly<br />
not new problems in themselves, have increased in recent years<br />
and are among today's most signficant social problems. That<br />
the Sydney City Mission as an organisation has been able to<br />
adapt its services to meet modern day need is, to my mind, a<br />
strong argument for the community to continue its support for<br />
the work of the Mission. In your letter of invitation to me<br />
I noted that the Mission itself raises around $ 1.6 million annually<br />
through self help, and that the support from the people of<br />
Sydney amounts to $ 800,000 a year.<br />
I understand that this year's 120th anniversary appeal is for<br />
$ 1,200,000, for an impressively wide range of youth programs<br />
and projects. I can think of no better demonstration of<br />
appreciation by the people of Sydney for the work of the<br />
Mission than to contribute this amount for this year's appeal.<br />
I appreciate the opportunity you have given me today to pay<br />
tribute to the work of the Sydney City Mission. I want<br />
particularly to congratulate the Mission on its work and<br />
its humanitarian services to the people of Sydney. I commend<br />
the 120th Anniversary Appeal to them all, and I would urge<br />
them.. to contribute to the Mission's appeal to<br />
ensure that its excellent work may continue for another 120<br />
years.<br />
