PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH PAUL BARBER, RADIO 3AW, 28 MARCH 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PB: Prime Minister, good afternoon.<br />
PM: How are you, Paul?<br />
PB: I'm okay, thanks, but you're a man under siege at the moment.<br />
PM: Oh well, that happens to Prime Ministers from time to time it's an<br />
occupational hazard.<br />
PB: You can wear it?<br />
PM: Well, I have in the past.<br />
PB: Can you understand why people call you arrogant and unwilling to<br />
listen?<br />
PM: Well, I mean, let's not mistake what people mean. If it's arrogant to<br />
have pride in what you're doing and want to get the things done, then<br />
that's a label I suppose I have to wear. But, I mean, I've been here for<br />
26 years and I've seen a succession of Prime Ministers pass the parcel<br />
on all the big hard issues of Australia, that is, opening it up, making it<br />
competitive, reducing a contestable economy inside a country,<br />
breaking the back of decade-long inflation.<br />
PB: So, what, you're determined to be better than any of the other previous<br />
Prime Ministers?<br />
PM: Well, I'm determined at least when it's all over, whenever that is for<br />
me, to say that I never shirked the big ones.<br />
PB: Are you the best Prime Minister in your 26 years? </p>
<p>PM: Well, just get this point about arrogance, I mean, there are other<br />
people here who, I mean, my argument is, I suppose, don't mistake<br />
pride in one's craft and getting things done. I mean, you look at the<br />
last couple of weeks. There's the Native Title Act seven votes to<br />
zero, seven Judges to zero on the High Court. There's the Land Fund<br />
Bill passed. There's 91,000 job growth last month. I mean, the<br />
economy is growing at 5 per cent and we've had just on 4 per cent<br />
employment growth. I mean, they're real, I mean, you understand,<br />
they're real things and to get the real things done, if you throw the<br />
fights up here or be soppy, let everybody tread all over you in the<br />
system, then the Australian public lose out.<br />
PB: Yes, but with respect, I mean, what is more important this is what the<br />
critics are saying Mabo and the Republic, or a fragile economy and<br />
interest rates? It appears to be interest rates is the thing....<br />
PM: No, but it's not fragile. Understand this I mean, the economy, if<br />
anything, has been too strong. I mean, that's why the interest rates<br />
were increased in November and December because the economy<br />
was running too strongly.<br />
PB: Except you're being forced to bring in a tough Budget next month?<br />
PM: But, what would you rather be handling? A strong economy with low<br />
inflation or the thing that I was handling back in 1991/ 92 of a recession<br />
and trying to get out of it? I mean, we're growing faster than any other<br />
country in the world with low inflation and we've got a couple of<br />
problems. But I would rather be attending to problems in the context of<br />
high growth. I mean, the Government was rehired and<br />
recommissioned in 1993 to start growth and employment. I mean, you<br />
give me that, that the main thing in the election was employment, was<br />
it not? Well, here we are, we are now at 590,000 jobs since the<br />
election. We are 90,000 jobs passed the Government's 500,000 target<br />
which we achieved in two years, not three. You know, I think, we've<br />
had this dreadful sort of debate running the sky's going to fall in,<br />
interest rates have risen, we're all ruined, it's all over where in fact,<br />
you know, I walked around western Europe a couple of weeks ago as<br />
the only head of government in the western world able to say that<br />
we're growing at 5 per cent with 2 per cent inflation.<br />
PB: But you told them how to improve their architecture.<br />
PM: No, I didn't that's again another bit of urban myth.<br />
PB: You told them how to improve their economy?<br />
PM: No, no.<br />
PB: Signs of arrogance? </p>
<p>PM: No, you get asked, you get asked. I mean, if you go to Europe where<br />
the rates of growth are 2 per cent and the employment growth is threequarters,<br />
I mean, are there no things Australians are proud of? I<br />
mean, do you really think, Paul, we ought to have the cultural cringe to<br />
the point where European growth is 2 per cent and employment growth<br />
is about three-quarters of a per cent, and we've got 5 per cent growth<br />
and 4 per cent employment growth and you should shut up about it?<br />
Oh, I won't mention that, oh no, I'm not going to tell you we're growing<br />
well. No, no, I will definitely not tell you we've got 4 per cent<br />
employment growth because it might look like that we're telling you<br />
how to run your affairs you get asked.<br />
PB: Well, this comment today you made about you didn't want to be locked<br />
into a mortgage grindstone. Well, you mightn't want to be, but I mean,<br />
millions of Australians, they haven't got any choice.<br />
PM: No, but understand what I said. I said, my opponents believe that they<br />
can reduce the whole national debate of Australia down to simply a<br />
discussion only about interest rates. In other words, Australia's place<br />
in the world, APEC Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation opening up<br />
markets in this part of the world, changing training and retraining in<br />
Australia through Working Nation, getting the arts into the high-tech<br />
end of multimedia, or the Republic, or Mabo, or any of these things<br />
should all go out the window and the only discussion we should have<br />
should be about interest rates despite the fact that we've had the<br />
largest fall in unemployment in any one year in our history last year.<br />
PB: But isn't that the message from the massive rejection you got in the<br />
Canberra by-election? I mean, what lesson is to be learnt?<br />
PM: Well, I don't know that that's the sole message. Well, the Canberra<br />
by-election was a complex election. I mean, we had a 10 percentage<br />
point shift from the Labor Party to the Liberal Party in the ACT<br />
Assembly elections. Now, part of that is to do with the fact that<br />
Canberra used to be funded Federally, and generously funded, and<br />
when the ACT moved to Statehood funding under the Grants<br />
Commission, it's now had three or four years of very large reductions<br />
in Commonwealth payments to the ACT. The local community hate the<br />
sight of the Assembly up here, and I think Rosemary Follett unfairly<br />
carried that burden. Now, that's obviously....<br />
PB: Did you have the wrong candidate as well?<br />
PM: That obviously switched across to the Federal by-election as well as<br />
the, what you may call, national influences which were there, which I<br />
accept were there.<br />
PB: But you see, you've just called those voters, today, Canberra fat cats. </p>
<p>PM: Who did?<br />
PB: You.<br />
PM: When?<br />
PB: This afternoon. I did not at all. Where did you get that from?<br />
PB: I was told that after the reception for Mr Havel that you described them<br />
as fat cats.<br />
PM: Well, you are quite wrong about that.<br />
PB: Well, I apologise if I'm wrong ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I mean, this is the thing, I mean, we've got this sort of low-grade media<br />
debate which runs on scuttlebutt and nonsense. I mean, you know,<br />
you're talking to a Government here who's doing things in social terms<br />
employment and growth. Look, you know the Liberals couldn't beat<br />
inflation. Ten years we had double digit inflation. You know, that was<br />
one of the nasty jobs that was left to me. That's why we've got now<br />
comparatively low interest rates. You've still got interest rates around<br />
9-10 per cent out there in the commercial world.<br />
PB: It's not just the media, I mean, take Graham Richardson. I mean, has<br />
he really become a Judas? You described him as taking the 30 pieces<br />
of silver has he really become a Judas?<br />
PM: Well, Graham can't represent himself as a Labor person giving Labor<br />
comment when he is being paid to represent a network.<br />
PB: Has he ratted on the Party though?<br />
PM: Well, look, that's for other people to make a judgement about.<br />
PB: Oh, what, you can make that judgement?<br />
PM: Well, yes I can. But I'm not making it for you.<br />
PB: Why not?<br />
PM: Because it doesn't suit me to.<br />
PB: He hasn't ratted on you?<br />
PM: Just go on to other things. Look, I can talk about any number of<br />
commentators I could move through half the Press Gallery if you<br />
wanted me to. </p>
<p>PB: And what? ( inaudibie)<br />
PM: Well, there's just no product in it. I mean, there's no product. We're in<br />
the middle of this sort of debate which is seeking to deny the<br />
undeniable, and that is, that Australia's economy has been, if anything,<br />
too strong and that the Government has taken the right action at the<br />
right time to slow it down. As I said a couple of weeks ago, those<br />
interest rate rises have been done to protect people's jobs in the<br />
longer run the guarantee that there's a recovery that goes on right<br />
through the 1990s.<br />
PB: Alright, well, Prime Minister, Caucus today, what was it like going into<br />
the lion's den? They're pretty ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well, it wasn't a lion's den at all. That's another bit of hype and<br />
nonsense, you see. It wasn't a lion's den.<br />
PB: Did they all get up and applaud you when you walked in?<br />
PM: No, they were fine. They were like they were every other meeting and<br />
I gave them my thought, I addressed the issues of the week, and the<br />
issues of this week include the by-election loss, and I addressed them<br />
I thought directly and frankly.<br />
PB: You've got this Sylvia Smith from Bass threatening to resign because<br />
( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well, there's always some comment. You get a Caucus of nearly a<br />
hundred people, you are always going to get someone say something.<br />
PB: Well, have you hosed her down?<br />
PM: No.<br />
PB: What if she resigns?<br />
PM: She's not resigning, I mean, where did you get that nonsense from? I<br />
mean, do you just think this stuff up, Paul? Do you work at it or does it<br />
just come naturally? I mean, you know, do you sit up there, I mean,<br />
what do they put in your coffee, down there?<br />
PB: I'm drinking water here at the moment, actually.<br />
PM: You've obviously got a mickey finn in the coffee.<br />
PB: I'm not dreaming this stuff up. You know that she is threatening to<br />
resign over ( inaudible)<br />
I </p>
<p>PM: She's not threatening to resign at all. She passed a critical comment,<br />
but so what? She's entitled to have her view.<br />
PB: What lessons have you learnt then from NSW and from Canberra on<br />
Saturday?<br />
PM: Well, from NSW there is one lesson and that is the John Howard<br />
lesson. He said it is completely critical to the future of the federal<br />
coalition that John Fahey win in NSW. Well, one lesson out of that is<br />
they lost, or it seems they have lost and it looks like Bob Carr will form<br />
a Government that is one lesson. Out of the ACT I think there are<br />
multiple lessons.<br />
PB: Just before we go onto Canberra, even there you have got members of<br />
your own faction saying they would have won much more easily or Bob<br />
Carr would have won much more easily had it not been for you.<br />
PM: Yes, well that is a bit of analysis, but all the people that give us the<br />
analysis have not won an election themselves.<br />
PB: But, this is your own faction.<br />
PM: I know, they are not all wise. They may all be inclusive Paul, but they<br />
are not all uniformly wise about deciphering election results.<br />
PB: Yes, but the NSW Right falling apart, I mean you have got Carr,<br />
Loosley, Della Bosca, all of you sniping at each other.<br />
PM: No, no, I just think that it is never really right that the public will never<br />
accept one part of a party denying the other. It was like when Joan<br />
Kirner was in her last days as Premier, she was never denied by me.<br />
Because I think the notion of saying ' oh look, they are in the Labor<br />
Party but they are not ours' people say ' come off it, don't be so<br />
dishonest, of course they are yours'. So you go together for good or ill,<br />
you go together.<br />
PB: Do you regret that Ros Kelly went when she did?<br />
PM: Obviously, if she hadn't have gone we wouldn't have had a by-election.<br />
So, we would have been better off.<br />
PB: Are you disappointed that she put her interests before the interests of<br />
the party?<br />
PM: There is another thing here. Look, the Government has won five<br />
elections and at every election there is always somebody that moves<br />
out. In this cycle we had John Kerin and we had Neal Blewett and the<br />
system has got to be able to let people go and bring other people in.<br />
The Government is substantially renewed with a big influx of new and </p>
<p>young members including over half of the ministry having changed<br />
since the last election. There has got to be some process where that<br />
happens. Now occasionally, in the transition, as is the case here, the<br />
public will take hold of an issue or a set of issues and give you a<br />
message.<br />
PB: But you reckon you can win the public back despite what the polls are<br />
showing?<br />
PM: I think so, because I think this is the Government of post war change in<br />
Australia. This is the Government that broke the back of Australian<br />
inflation. This is the Government that opened Australia up to the world<br />
by removing the tariff walls.<br />
PB: Is it the best government you have seen?<br />
PM: Well, it is the best of the ones I have belonged to and it is certainly the<br />
most conscientious and effective government in the years I have been<br />
in public life which is 26 now. Look, the thing is, let me just make a<br />
little point to you. One of the things I was able to say to Helmut Kohl,<br />
you know the European Community have the Treaty of Maastricht, you<br />
have heard of it?<br />
PB: Yes.<br />
PM: It has terms and conditions tough terms and conditions about who<br />
can join the European Monetary Union with the Deutschmark with<br />
Germany. At the moment there are two countries which can qualify<br />
only two Luxemburg and Australia. Now, it says something about us<br />
doesn't it? That we can meet the toughest economic convergence<br />
criteria, probably in the world, to join in what would be were we to be<br />
Europeans in the Deutschmark area. So, I think Australians should<br />
understand that this quite malicious debate that John Howard and the<br />
Liberal party are running, that there is something wrong with the<br />
economy and that we have had five minutes of sunshine. We have<br />
had three years of growth 36 months of growth, 12 quarters of growth<br />
and will go on having growth and the whole claim is fallacious and<br />
untrue.<br />
PB: Yes, but there again, you see I am sure that half of the people listening<br />
to me at the moment, whilst they might think ' oh well, it is a feather in<br />
your cap there to be able to give a bit of advice to the " old Koh lie" over<br />
there' on the other hand they are saying ' hang on a sec, Keating<br />
should be back here doing something about interest rates.'<br />
PM: No, what I was doing, well, I was over there doing something about<br />
interest rates. I was over there at the CeBIT fair where we were the<br />
guest country with 170 companies, high technology companies, on<br />
exhibit. I was over there trying to inculcate in the European business </p>
<p>mind that Australia is a high technology country and given the fact we<br />
had this great opportunity to be the guest country at the largest<br />
information and communications fair in the world, I took the opportunity<br />
to go and drive that message home so that as we export now, higher<br />
value added, and we wrote tens of millions of business coming out of<br />
that and we will, no doubt, build relationships now for years to come.<br />
When we write those higher technology values in and their higher<br />
exports, you write down any attendant pressure on you for interest<br />
rates. I mean, you have got to understand this, that Australia's way for<br />
the last ten years out of its difficulties, is by exports and by product and<br />
it doesn't just happen with the wave of a wand. You have got to<br />
basically earn your place in these markets and if the Prime Minister of<br />
Australia is not interested to make the point in the largest market in<br />
Europe that Australia is a competent, high technology country, but<br />
rather sit back here and do radio programs talking about interest rates,<br />
I mean, there is not much of a judgement to be made there is there?<br />
PB: Will you completely rule out an election for this year?<br />
PM: I get asked these questions by journalists and I take no notice of them.<br />
Why would any Prime Minister give up any option he or she enjoys?<br />
PB: So you are just going to say nothing about it?<br />
PM: No, just that I will do, I will give you my general view on this. All last<br />
year I had this claim made firstly by Dr Hewson, then by Mr Downer<br />
and more laterly by others, that the Government is about to have an<br />
early election. We were never having an early election. Never ever.<br />
The reason I don't believe in early elections is, [-think, the public want<br />
value from the political system. They want the government to get on<br />
and do the work and not run tricky polls against them.<br />
PB: All right and will they need time to, the public, will they need time to<br />
absorb what appears as going to be a pretty tough budget?<br />
PM: I don't think time, but understanding of what the Government has done<br />
to preserve the recovery and to keep it going. I think that is the<br />
important thing. The important thing is that you look people in the face<br />
and say ' look, we did all the things we thought we needed to do to<br />
keep your jobs secure and to give another member of your family a<br />
job.' Now, as I said to you, we have had this remarkable number<br />
590,000 jobs since the 1993 election. Our opponents were saying,<br />
when we mentioned 500,000 in the election, they were laughing and<br />
going on. John Hewson told us we would have a double dip recession<br />
and then a depression. Remember those ads, the gun sight adds that<br />
were on television, how through the gun sight we were going to shoot<br />
people out of jobs. Well, we have shot people into 590,000 jobs. </p>
<p>PB: All right, this good news you are telling me now, are you going to make<br />
a stronger effort, if I can put it that way, this year to sell your message<br />
more than you have in the past?<br />
PM: One thing the Canberra by-election has brought home is this sort of<br />
doom saying and this dishonesty that Howard and his cohorts are<br />
running, that we have just had five minutes of economic sunshine and<br />
it is all shutting down. It is completely untrue. It is a distortion. It is<br />
completely untrue and the fact that it ever had any currency is to be<br />
regretted. So, obviously the Government will make a bigger effort to<br />
make sure that people understand that they have, for the first time in<br />
years, a strong low inflation recovery with high productivity.<br />
PB: I know you have got to go so just a couple of quick ones. I am sure<br />
you would describe John Howard as ' recycled' but are you none the<br />
less surprised by the good impression that he is making so far,<br />
particularly in the polls?<br />
PM: I don't think he is making an impression in policy. I think what's<br />
happened is<br />
PB: People like him though.<br />
PM: I think what happened is this. That consumer sentiment turned down<br />
when interest rates changed. They thought ' hello, there is something<br />
going on here' and that was right at the time that he came to office and<br />
he has just surfed his way along that wave. But he has got nothing to<br />
say. You couldn't identify one policy with him and he believes that if<br />
he makes himself as small as possible a target and says nothing until<br />
the next election, he can win. Well, I think the Australian public have<br />
walked way past that. They don't want no policy change governments.<br />
They don't want policy free zones. They want change. They want it<br />
explained. They want you to be in there doing their bidding for them<br />
and doing their work for them. That gets me back to the principal<br />
thing: what was I principally asked to do at the last election? That was<br />
to start growth and employment again with low inflation and that is<br />
what I have done in full measure.<br />
PB: Another quick one, and you are probably aware of this anyway, but<br />
have a listen to this Mr Murdoch speaking on ' 60 Minutes' the other<br />
night -" Question: Would you do business with John Howard"<br />
Murdoch " Absolutely, I don't want to do any business with him and I<br />
don't want to do any business with Paul Keating. Do I think John<br />
Howard would be a good Prime Minister of this country? I think it<br />
would depend on can he control his back benchers who don't look to<br />
me like conservatives or anything other than to me moderate Labor<br />
politicians, half of them. But, John Howard if can be the John Howard<br />
we have been hearing from for the last five years, he might present a<br />
very real alternative and a good one. On the other hand you have got </p>
<p>say about Paul Keating, that he is one of the very few strong leaders in<br />
the world today. You couldn't use all the fingers of one hand to say<br />
who lead their countries and are strong, why, and know what they are<br />
doing and are on top of their own political scenes". Would I be right in<br />
suggesting that you would sooner have lunch with Rupert Murdoch at<br />
the moment than Kerry Packer?<br />
PM: Not necessarily, it is just that I think Rupert Murdoch does meet many<br />
heads of government in Europe and in north America. He has got a<br />
business that operates in the United States and in Europe. He owns<br />
The London Times. He had got major assets in the United States. He<br />
has interests in Europe and he has interests in the Asia-Pacific. So,<br />
he makes his own judgements and that is a matter for him. But, being<br />
an international company, I suppose those international comparisons<br />
spring to mind.<br />
PB: A final question, I asked it earlier on. Are you the best Prime Minister<br />
we have ever had?<br />
PM: Well, I will certainly be, you could say this about me. I will never have<br />
gone home of a night, ever throwing a policy fight. The public can<br />
know about me and say at least when the big issues are on, this<br />
character will actually represent us. In those late Cabinet meetings or<br />
in the discussions or in any of the economic debates or the social<br />
debate, I will be in there doing the things that other governments in the<br />
past shirked. Whether it be in the big issues like land rights and Mabo<br />
or whether it be in breaking the back of inflation or whether it be in<br />
training and retraining or any of these issues I won't be in there<br />
throwing the fight. Now, I think that is the thing the important thing to<br />
me is to be a good Prime Minister rather than be someone out there<br />
chasing cheers.<br />
PB: So, you are the best Prime Ministerial fighter we have had?<br />
PM: Well, don't try to put words in my mouth Paul, don't be too obvious<br />
about all this.<br />
PB: I am looking for a headline.<br />
PM: I know you are. The fact that I am on your program is important to you,<br />
I think.<br />
PB: All right, I am very appreciative of that. It has been a long wait, but it is<br />
good to have you on. I hope you will come on again.<br />
PM: OK, thank you very much.<br />
PB: That's a deal is it? </p>
<p>PM: Well, I think it is.<br />
PB: Good on you. Thanks very much.<br />
PM: It's not too bad, I mean, they do put something in the coffee there. But<br />
all things considered, it is reasonable enough.<br />
PB: Thanks for your time.<br />
PM: Good, thank you.<br />
