    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today here in Brisbane our nation’s leaders are assembled to address a matter of great national shame – violence against women and children, often called domestic violence.</p>
<p>It is a disgrace.</p>
<p>We should have zero tolerance for this.</p>
<p>We are assembled with 150 experts in the field and as leaders, as heads of government; we will be listening to them. To hear their assessment of how our first two action plans have progressed the important measures that we have underway, including those that the Commonwealth set in train last year. And we will be announcing our third action plan which involves a commitment of a further $100 million from the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>But above all, what we need to drive is cultural change.</p>
<p>We have to recognise that it is our duty as parents and grandparents to ensure that we bring up our sons and grandsons to respect the women in their lives, beginning with their mothers and their sisters - their families.</p>
<p>We have to remember that while not all disrespect of women leads to violence against women that is where all violence against women begins.</p>
<p>This is about respect; it is about changing cultural attitudes and ensuring that we end this disgrace – this violence against women and children.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
