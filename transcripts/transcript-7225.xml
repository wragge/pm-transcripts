    <content><![CDATA[<p>29 September 1987Â </p>
<p>A competition to design a National Memorial to theÂ Australian Army, commemorating all facets of its long andÂ proud history, has been won by a West Australian sculptor.Â Mrs Joan Walsh-Smith of Gidgegannup, Western Australia, in<br />association with Ken Maher and Partners Pty Ltd, is theÂ winner of the competition.</p>
<p>11 November 1988 has been proposed as the most suitable dateÂ for the dedication of this memorial to those distinguishedÂ men and women who created the heritage of the AustralianÂ Army. It is particularly fitting that the unveiling is to take<br />place in our Bicentennial year.</p>
<p>The memorial will be erected in the niche on the westernÂ side of Anzac Parade, Canberra, closest to the AustralianÂ War memorial.</p>
<p>The area is being planned to cater for both majorÂ commemorative ceremonies and for quiet contemplation.Â The central theme and focus of the memorial will be twoÂ sculptured figures on a raised dais set against aÂ semi-circular background of seven pillars representing sevenÂ major campaigns in which the Australian Army has beenÂ involved.</p>
<p>Ms Walsh-Smith, the winning sculptor, and her husbandÂ Charlie Smith work as a team. They arrived in AustraliaÂ from Ireland in 1984 and are members of the Sculptor SocietyÂ of Ireland, the Association of Artists in Ireland and the<br />National Association of Visual Arts in Australia.Â The competition for the design was conducted by the NationalÂ Capital Development Commission on behalf of the CommonwealthÂ Government. Ms Walsh-Smith and Ken Maher and Partners PtyÂ Ltd will be commissioned to construct the memorial.Â </p>
<p>( NOTE: The Prime Minister is the Chairman of the CanberraÂ National Memorials Committee.)Â </p>
