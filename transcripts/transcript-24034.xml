    <content><![CDATA[<p>Dutch authorities have confirmed that all of the 38 Australian victims who died when Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 was downed in Eastern Ukraine have now been formally identified.</p>
<p>Operation Bring Them Home will conclude in the coming weeks when the final remains of the victims are reunited with their families. </p>
<p>The successful recovery, identification and repatriation of the victims has been a painstaking and meticulous process.</p>
<p>It has been a tremendously difficult period for the families and for all Australians. </p>
<p>After such a long wait, we can now be assured that the Australian victims have been accorded the dignity and respect they deserve.</p>
<p>Our determination to bring the perpetrators of this atrocity to justice is undiminished.</p>
<p>The Australian and Dutch governments continue to press for full implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2166.</p>
<p>Progress continues on the two investigations that are underway by the Dutch Safety Board and the criminal investigation being led by the Dutch Public Prosecution Service.</p>
<p>We owe it to the victims and their families that these investigations are concluded successfully and that those responsible are brought to justice.</p>
<p>Australia’s response to this tragedy has involved a remarkable effort from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian Federal Police, the Air Transport Safety Bureau and the Australian Defence Force.</p>
<p>All the officials involved are to be commended for their commitment, compassion and professionalism. </p>
<p>We acknowledge the leadership of the Prime Minister’s Special Envoy Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston and Ambassador Jean Dunn.</p>
<p>Dutch authorities advise that a total of 292 of the victims on board MH17 have been positively identified.</p>
