THE PRIME MINISTER, MR E. G. WHITLAM, ADDRESSING THE<br />
NATIONAL PRESS CLUB, HOTEL CANBERRA, CANBERRA,<br />
THURSDAY, 8 NOVEMBER, 1973<br />
QUESTION: Following your conversation in Peking with Prince Sihanouk,<br />
can I ask you what is the Australian relationship now with the<br />
Royalist Government in Cambodia? Has Prince Sihanouk been given<br />
any assurances? Has he been told, for instance, that his Government<br />
will be recognised if the Lon Nol regime were to fall?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Australia maintains relations with the Lon Nol<br />
Government. As I said in Peking, and many of you were there when<br />
I said it, it will continue to do so as long as that Government is<br />
in the United Nations and Pnom Penh. Prince Sihanouk knows that<br />
that is our attitude and that while he is the Government-in-exile<br />
he can't, of course, expect to be recognised as the Government of<br />
his country by the Australian Government.<br />
QUESTION: What are the areas about which there is'still<br />
speculation following your visit to Japan. Is your statement that<br />
we would aim for and desire 100 per cent ownership-of our four<br />
energy resources. Could you clarify what you meant by that? Are<br />
we intractably wed now to a policy of developing those resources<br />
without foreign equity, and do you believe we can do that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I hope that we can do it; we will certainly try.<br />
It ought to be possible to strive for that objective, i. e. for<br />
100 per cent Australian ownership of uranium and oil and natural<br />
gas and black coal.<br />
QUESTION: In the last twelve months you have travelled more than<br />
any other Prime Minister in a similar period; you have achieved<br />
possibly all your major immediate policy objectives. I understand<br />
that next year you intend to visit South-East Asia early in the<br />
year and also Europe later in the year. Do you think now that<br />
Senator Willesee could be given these two missions while you<br />
concentrate on domestic matters at home?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would add that I expect to visit the United Nation<br />
in about September. I will be making these visits and Senator<br />
Willesee will be continuing to make no fewer visits than he has<br />
been making throughout the year. A head of government these da-,' s<br />
inevitably has to make a great number of visits. I don't believe<br />
that I will be making fewer visits that I had intended to make<br />
in any case.<br />
QUESTION: My question follows on that asked by David Barnett<br />
and it is in relation to a statement that was issue3d in Pcking<br />
by Prince Sihanouk. To clarify the position one step further,<br />
Prime Minister, has Australia cut military and econor-Fi-I t~ o<br />
the Lon Nol regime, has it limited its diplomatic nr-s-ice therc.<br />
and are you looking forward to Prince Sihanouk beinr1 installed<br />
back in Pnom Penh? </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: In respect to the last question, it is not for<br />
me to express a view. It is for the people of Cambodia, I hope,<br />
to choose their government without outside interference. I will<br />
read what I said in Peking at the press conference in answer<br />
to your question on this subject:<br />
While I was in Peking where Prince Sihanouk resides, I<br />
welcomed the opportunity to have an exchange of views<br />
with him. He is the acknowledge spokesman of GRUNK AND FUNK.<br />
He is the only representative of either who is known to<br />
me or to the ambassador or to Australians in general.<br />
It was a valuable opportunity to hear at first hand his<br />
views on the situation in his country and in the region.<br />
I was asked: " It doesn't suggest any change in our<br />
recognition of the present Lon Nol Government". I answered:<br />
" No, as long as the Lon Nol Government is in possession<br />
of the capital of Cambodia and is ' in the United Nations<br />
the present Australian attitude towards it will continue."<br />
I was asked: " How are we voting in the United Nations".<br />
I answered: " We have been abstaining on the procedural<br />
issues." I was asked: " Will we continue to abstain?"<br />
I answered: " When the question of the seating of the<br />
Government arises, we will vote for that Government with<br />
which we have relations but we-are abstaining on the<br />
procedural matters. We did not oppose the inscription<br />
of the item. our concern in Cambodia is that the people<br />
of Cambodia should have a government of their own wish.<br />
We will do all we can to put an end to the hostilities<br />
and to deter any supplies from outside. It is the only<br />
part of Indo-China where there has not yet been a ceasefire<br />
or an agreement or an accord. This is all the more<br />
deplorable since, for so many years, from the Geneva accords<br />
of 1954 until the invasion of Cambodia by and from South<br />
Vietnam in March 1970, Cambodia had enjoyed an undiminished<br />
peaceful identity."<br />
There was one specific question you asked me about military<br />
and economic aid. The military aid ceased last year within a<br />
couple of weeks of our coming to office, as it did throughout<br />
Indo-China. The economic aid, in the sense of support for the<br />
currency, will end at the end of this year. Colombo Plan aid<br />
continues, and will.<br />
QUESTION: May I take your mind of f foreign affairs? The Senate<br />
has rejected, unacceptably amended or unreasonably delayed items of<br />
important Government legislation. The prospects are that it will<br />
deal in a similar fashion with the National Health Scheme or the<br />
Schools Commission. In this sense, the Senate is preventing your<br />
government from implementing important matters which you pledged<br />
in your policy speech. How long can your Government tolerate a<br />
hostile Senate, and what do you propose to do about it? </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I won't put our opponents out of the position<br />
where they have to wonder about this. The situation has arisen,<br />
as you know, that whenever we like we can have a double dissolution.<br />
The objectionable feature of the Australian constitution and of<br />
most of the State Constitutions it has never been applied in<br />
Australia is that the Upper House can send the Lower House to<br />
the people without going to the people itself. The Upper House<br />
in the Australian National Parliament can do that twice a year.<br />
It can do it before the end of November when the Budget for the<br />
financial year has to be passed; it can do it before the end of<br />
June when the interim supply up until the end of November has to<br />
be provided. I can do that at any time. If it does it, it will<br />
go to the people not only the House of Representatives. That<br />
position is available to the Australian Government.<br />
QUESTION: On page three of your stat-ement,-you said in illustrating<br />
your foreign policy, that you start with the basic thesis that<br />
the crucial factor governing the well-being. of the West Pacific<br />
region is the relations between China, Japan and the* United States.<br />
There is another great power, sir, which has a. . coastline in this<br />
particular area, the Soviet Union. It also has a great deal of<br />
shipping in the Indian ocean region tand in * the North West Pacific.<br />
To what extent do you take the role of the Soviet Union into<br />
account in this basic premise of yours, and whet role do you think<br />
Australia should and does have vis-a-vis the Soviet Union?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I' am speaking of the passage you quote about<br />
the relationship between Australia and Japan. It is there that<br />
Australia can help very greatly in relationships between Japan<br />
and China and between Japan and the United States. When we were<br />
there over two years ago, relations between Japan and China were<br />
almost-as bad they were between China and America and China<br />
and the Soviet Union. Also, in the interim, relations,<br />
particularly on economic matters, Australia's relationship with<br />
Japan can help relationships between all these three. Australia<br />
does not have the same leverage or influence with the Soviet Union<br />
as it has with Japan or as it has with the United States. However,<br />
there is the situation that a detente to a considerable extent has<br />
been established between the United States and the Soviet Union.<br />
It might have been badly shaken by the Middle East war but it seems<br />
to have been restored. The centre of Soviet power and influence<br />
is not in the Pacific. Obviously, the centre of Chinese and<br />
Japanese influence is in the Pacific. The fact that Russian<br />
shipping of both naval and maritime kinds is to be found in tc<br />
Pacific and in the Indian Oceans is a completely natural and<br />
expected development because the Soviet Union is the second largost<br />
economic force in the world.<br />
QUESTION: Why did you feel it necessary to st: lc own -as Foreig4n<br />
Minisc'-er. Do you regret the decision? </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The answer to the second one is yes. Of course,<br />
I would have liked to have been Foreign Minister; I have been<br />
the greatest that they have had in the last generation! The fact<br />
is that it is not just the paper-work that takes up your time,<br />
which is what people usually say; it is the number of calls that<br />
one has to receive. Quite frankly, if you look at the number of<br />
visitors coming to Australia -many times as numerous as has<br />
happened in any previous year -it is just beyond me to receive<br />
as Foreign Minister the number of foreign ministers who call.<br />
Senator Willesee was doing an immesne amount of this work but<br />
QUESTION: May I clarify what appears to be some ambiguity in your<br />
central statement in Tokyo concerning foreign investment in our<br />
energy resources, mentioned by Mr Barron uranium, oil, gas and<br />
coal? You spoke of the possible need for more foreign money<br />
for exploration. Will foreign capital be permitted to explore all<br />
those energy resources in Australia and-* if they find these energy<br />
resources in Australia will they be permitted to own and develop<br />
them? PRIME MINISTER: It may be necessary or desirable to have overseas<br />
interests participating. It largely depends on the cost or the<br />
skill of finding resources. We don't really need much assistance<br />
from outside to discover uranium or black coal resources. We<br />
obviously could not by ourselves have found all the oil or<br />
natural gas resources. This much is clear: that whatever<br />
participation there may be required, permitted or desired in<br />
exploration, there will be Australian control in the exploitation,<br />
the development; and that is understood. I wish those who so<br />
easily fall for handouts from public relations people in Australia<br />
or from some companies in Japan would face up to the fact that the<br />
Japanese have wondered why we have taken so long to do in our<br />
country what they long ago always, in fact had determined to<br />
do in their own.<br />
QUESTION: In the areas where the Commonwealth, quite clearly,<br />
asserts control, in the Northern Territory in the off-shore oil<br />
region, when these leases expire, is the Labor Government going<br />
to impose conditions that those who tender for it will have to be<br />
Australian owned? In other words, where you do have unquestionable<br />
control, are you going to insist upon, at this stage, 100 per cent<br />
Australian control and ownership of exploration of our energy<br />
resources? PRIME MINISTER: I don't think I need add anything to what I said<br />
in Japan, handed out there and tabled in the Parliament yesterday.<br />
QUESTION: The indications are that your Government has suffered<br />
a severe drop in support since the election. Do you accept that<br />
this has happened? If so, how do you account for it and what<br />
are you going to do about it? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: Yes, there has been some drop in our support. If<br />
there is an election, whenever it is, we will regain it. Anybody<br />
reading or listening to the censure motion a couple of weeks ago<br />
will see my grounds for optimism and assertion in that respect.<br />
QUESTION: It would not have escaped your attention, sir, that<br />
Mr Barton has offered you membership of the Australia Party. Have<br />
you got any observations on this? Also, can you confirm or deny<br />
the very strong and persistent rumours that the Liberal Party has<br />
also offered several of its leading members membership of the<br />
Australia Party?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have to answer no to both of those questions.<br />
QUESTION: Did you discuss in Peking with ei -ther Mao Tsetung<br />
or Chou En-lai the question of Sino-Indian relations?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
QUESTION: What were the discussions -what was the'-tenor of<br />
the discussions?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't want to go into any detail about what<br />
was said there. It was a general course of informing each other<br />
of our respective attitudes over recent years and at the present<br />
time but I don't feel free to go into any further detail on such<br />
matters. I think we discussed every country in Asia except, thinking<br />
over it, Iraq.<br />
QUESTION: Can you explain why you see a need to have a senior<br />
party official on the staff of the Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I need and welcome the best men to work for<br />
me that I can get. I believe I have got them.<br />
QUESTION: Your joint communique issued after your talks in<br />
Peking suggested that Australia and China regarded all nations,<br />
small and big, as equal and respected their rights to maintain<br />
their territorial integrity. Well, with your Middle East policy,<br />
one could be forgiven perhaps for believing that some nations<br />
are more equal than others, particularly if they have oil. Do you<br />
regard that as a fair interpretation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It is not a fair interpretation, and I wouldn't<br />
have believed that anybody covering the scene in the Australian<br />
capital could hold that view. The Australian Government has been<br />
neutral in the Middle East, and preceding Australian Governments<br />
were neutral too. I am not reflecting on McMahon, Gorton, Holt<br />
or Menzies because they were all neutral their Governments also.<br />
The Australian Government has maintained the policy, traditional<br />
in Australia, of neutrality in the Middle East dispute. Wc. were<br />
in a position to be of particular effect because the Australian<br />
ambassador to the United Nations was in the chair -in thie Security<br />
Council during the crucial month of October an ' d I i,-) ald like to pay<br />
tribute to him for what he did, because the final solutior, it<br />
will be remembered, came from the non-permanent members of the<br />
Security Council and he was instrumental very largely in bringing<br />
about that solution. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
QUESTION: Were any of the United States bases in Australia at<br />
North West Cape, Pine Gap or Woomera put on a normal alert prior<br />
to the general American alert of its overseas bases? If so, were<br />
you told and when were you told? Secondly, when all the American<br />
overseas bases were put on a higher level than normal alert, when<br />
were you told and was it before the NATO partners were told?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know if they were put on alert. I wasn't<br />
told. I believe the announcement was for domestic American<br />
consumption.<br />
QUESTION: Both Bob Hawke and Dr Coombs have suggested that an<br />
increase in direct taxation would help curb inflation. Are you<br />
considering this, and do you regret that you made an election<br />
promise that you wouldn't increase taxation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I will not be drawn on-. making promises, yes or<br />
no., on any fiscal matters. Dr Coombs, as is'well-known, did<br />
suggest an increase in taxation as a means of curbing inflation<br />
as far back as June or July. His advice was not accepted.<br />
Mr Hawke's advice was not sought; it will not. be sought.<br />
The Government makes up its mind on this matter. The President<br />
of the Federal Executive of the Labor Party does not determine<br />
such matters; he is not consulted in such matters; he doesn't<br />
speak for the party on such matters; I doubt if on this matter<br />
he speaks on behalf of the trade union movement.<br />
QUESTION: Can you tell me why you have offered a post on your<br />
personal staff to the former Federal secretary of your party,<br />
Mr Mick Young?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I answered a previous question on this. I said<br />
that I want on my staff, working with me, the best people available<br />
in Australia, and I believe I have them. The combination of<br />
Young and Whitlam was superb, and it will continue to be.<br />
QUESTION: Many people would think it was unfortunate that you<br />
used the term " final solution" in relation to what the United NationE<br />
was doing. I wondered if you could say something more about what<br />
you claim is a neutral policy. Firstly, why is it necessary for<br />
you to so carefully refuse to condemn what was quite clearly the<br />
Arab initiation of warfare on Israel? Secondly, I wonder if you<br />
would answer a question about whether Australia had urged the<br />
U~ nited States not to re-supply the Israelis with arms and<br />
equipment when the Russians were re-supplying their allies there?<br />
And, finally, could you tell us whether you raised with the Chinese<br />
the question of their wholehearted support for the Palestinian<br />
terrorist movement by way of propaganda, training and armaments? </p>
<p>-7-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I discussed the question of the Middle East<br />
in Peking. You have been told that that was so; I was asked a<br />
question in Parliament about it yesterday. The attitude of the<br />
Australian and the Chinese Governments is known and it is unchanged.<br />
It was discussed; it is unchanged in each case. Now it is quite<br />
spurious than one can come to any sound view or one can produce<br />
any solution to the disputes in the Middle East by looking at<br />
any one particular date. The fact is there is a situation which<br />
has continued there for quarter of a century and there are certain<br />
features of it which have to be solved if it is to end. One is<br />
the question of recognition of the existence, the sovereignty,<br />
of Israel.. One is the question of the occupation of Arab<br />
territories by Israel. And the one which people mention least<br />
is the Palestinian problem not just the question of Palestinian<br />
terrorism, but of people who lived in what used to. be called<br />
Palestine and no longer live there.<br />
QUESTION: What about the other questions I asked you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The attitude of the Australian Government was<br />
made known before I went to Japan and China on this. I said at<br />
question time there that there should not be supplies from<br />
outside and that applies to both. The war would never have broken<br />
out, it would never have continued, but for supplies from outsideby<br />
the Soviet Union and the United States; and they both recovered<br />
their sanity in time to save us all.<br />
QUESTION: Some months ago you said you did not believe that the<br />
Watergate scandal could happen in Australia, referring to the<br />
fact that the Executive was answerable to the Parliament. Do<br />
you believe that the machinery for mid-term elections under<br />
parliamentary democracy would prevent such events happening in<br />
Australia? PRIME MINISTER: I frankly don't see the link between the statement<br />
I made some time ago and the position that you are now putting.<br />
I don't see the link between them. What I was referring to some<br />
months ago was the fact that I believe that the situation in<br />
America, whereby the Head of State and of government is isolated<br />
from the legislature and very often from the press and gatherings<br />
like this, means that that head doesn't discern trends in public<br />
opinion in time. I am under no illusions that questions that<br />
you gentlemen and ladies ask me are your own inspirations, created<br />
in isolation. It's very useful for me to know what you have in<br />
mind. It warns me of things in time. I believe there are virtues<br />
in the British system which save us from a position such as the<br />
Watergate scandal.<br />
QUESTION: Yesterday a Senate Committee was very critical of the<br />
operations and limitations of the Government's much-vaunted Prices<br />
Justification Tribunal. Could you tell us whether you intend to<br />
take any action to overcome these criticisms and to make the<br />
tribunal more effective? </p>
<p>-8-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I haven't read the Senate report on this matter.<br />
There have been some criticisms made of the Prices Justification<br />
Tribunal; I don't believe they are justified. I believe the<br />
appointments we have made to the Prices Justification Tribunal,<br />
Mr Justice Williams, President Chambers and the lay members, have<br />
been excellent appointments and I believe the tribunal is developing<br />
procedures which are of very great benefit to the Australian people.<br />
There have already been many price rises projected or sought which<br />
have then been abandoned because of the existence of this tribunal.<br />
I admire the way the tribunal is carrying out its functions. I see<br />
at this stage no reason at all why its statute should be altered.<br />
If however, it is in any way defined, then, with the powers I<br />
expect to get on 8 December we will reinforce the act so as to<br />
buttress the tribunal. It is a very fine tribunal indeed. It<br />
deserves our support and the support of the Australian people. We<br />
are all very much better off because of its operations, already.<br />
After all, it has only operated for four months; it has already<br />
had a very salutary effect indeed.<br />
QUESTION: You have visited almost every important capital in the<br />
world except Moscow. Do you feel in view of the sensitivity of<br />
relations between China and the Soviet Union, Soviet leaders might<br />
feel justified in believing they have been left out in the cold<br />
by the warmth of your welcome in Peking? Do you have any plans<br />
to visit Moscow?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It has been brought home to me that the Soviet<br />
Government does have some feeling that they are being neglected.<br />
There are limitations even on the most active head of government.<br />
I was asked earlier whether I would be visiting Europe. The capital<br />
of the Soviet is in Europe; I expect to be visiting it together<br />
with several otier European capital3 in the date mentioned in the<br />
o;. o Jout next June. Perhaps it would be useful to<br />
in-tor . tiir for you the pattern of the visits I have made this<br />
_ ecar. T., e y Iargely dictated by geographic propinquity<br />
or by particuJar events to which Australia would be expected to<br />
subscribe. I first went to New Zealand; I then went to New Guinea<br />
dnd Indonesia; I then went to the South Pacific Forum and for<br />
various constitutional reasons to Westminster and Windsor, and<br />
to keep the ecclesiastical balance to be completely ecumenical<br />
I visited Rome, and on the Orthodox Good Friday, Rhodes. Then<br />
North America because there was the Commonwealth Heads of Gcvernmen'<br />
Meeting in Ottawa. Before that I visited Mexico the first Latin<br />
American country ever visited by an Australian Prime Minister and<br />
Washington and New York. I should have mentioned India just<br />
before that. Then Japan and China. It will be seen, I believe,<br />
that there has been regard paid to priorities of geography and<br />
traditional associations.<br />
QUESTION: You were reported to have sid th.-t the Chinem crow-d<br />
that spontaneously greeted you on your arrival in Peking reacted<br />
with rapture to the strains of Waltzing Matiidno I wonder 0. et: er<br />
you would consider extending the sample of inii. o 1 that tho -' ria<br />
of Census and Statistics is going to take out ' n lke Art-an<br />
population on our National Anthem to Po-ing,. o \. hther<br />
personally favour Advance Australia Fair? </p>
<p>-9-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm only one voter in this respect. I doubt<br />
whether I will be among the 60,000 polled in February by the<br />
Statistician on the matter. I find it very difficult to make up<br />
my mind between Advance Australia Fair and Waltzing Matilda.<br />
Waltzing Matilda I would think is very much the more exciting tune<br />
but a very great number of people seem to be worried by the words.<br />
I don't think they understood them in China, although realising<br />
the economic and ideological basis of the words, it would probably<br />
have been even more rapturously received. Many people think it is<br />
quite indecent in fact, subversive to have a song. with words<br />
such as Waltzing Matilda. There apparently are people who, whenever<br />
they hear God Save the Queen played, decide to sing it. Anthems<br />
are mainly for t1e music alone, not the words, and it is possible<br />
to create other words. There are lots of different words for<br />
God Save the Queen, the Americans have one set and the Hohenzollerns<br />
used to have another set; and it is the same tune.' Now what I'<br />
said in China in the House yesterday -about Waltzing Matilda<br />
being more rapturously received than Advance Australia Fair may be<br />
due to one or other of two factors. The one is that when Advance<br />
Australia Fair was played in Peking, we all stood to attention;<br />
it would have been unseemly to cheer. That-broke out immediately<br />
the tune finished it might have been for the tune or it might<br />
have been for the Premier and Prime Minister. Trhe other reason<br />
may be, of course, that when Waltzing Matilda was played in the<br />
Great Hall of the People there were equal numbers of Chinese and<br />
Australians present. I couldn't discern which section was more<br />
rapturous. QUESTION: Accepting that you want the best people working for<br />
you and accep,,; ng that you believe you have them, could I ask<br />
you specifically what will Mr Young's role be when the brilliant<br />
' Yt-. r-Young :~~ esi: is re cons tituted? Could you tell us<br />
lm~ y what job will be, what his title will be, what his<br />
u~ ary wiill hu ~ fyou can) nd, what you hope to see him achieve?<br />
you see him as the miracle w-. orker who will recover that lost<br />
popularity? PRIME MINISTER: I don't know how to describe the role that<br />
Mick Young performed last year and the year before he did it<br />
thiough. I don't know how I will describe his role from now on<br />
but he will perform similarly " superbly" was'the word I used,<br />
not " brilliantly".<br />
MR OAKES: It was my word.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I will accept it if you say it is your<br />
word, but I'm too modest to apply words like that to myself and my<br />
closest partner. It was a great combination the best in Australia<br />
political history for the last quarter of a century and I believe<br />
it will prove a similarly superb combination unt'll the next House<br />
of Representatives election when, I expe. 2t, Nick Young will bc<br />
a Member of Parliament and, I hope, a inister. </p>
<p>QUESTION: At any time did you invite either Chairman Mao or<br />
Premier Chou En-lai to visit Australia and, if so, did either<br />
of them accept it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I answered this question in Peking and I suppose<br />
I could read it out to you but the gist of it is this: Premier<br />
Chou En-lai knows quite well that he would be very welcome in<br />
Australia as he would be in any country in the world. I think<br />
there are over a hundred pending invitations. Our invitation,<br />
of course, is less than a year old he wouldn't have been<br />
invited before that. But other people got in ahead. There are<br />
some office holders in the world who can't reasonably be expected<br />
to accept all the invitations extended to them. It's no courtesy<br />
to press an invitation, say, on a President of the United States<br />
or the Premier of the People's Republic of . China. They can't<br />
be expected to accept those invitations. They would, obviously,<br />
in each case, be very welcome. There will be visits each way<br />
by ministers, and senior officials between China and Australia.<br />
We have overcome those inhibitions of the last twenty-three years<br />
that lost generation. At last, relations between Australia and<br />
China are as warm as they should have been throughout.<br />
QUESTION: Did you get the impression in China that the Chinese<br />
attitude was " You come to us, we won't go to you"?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Not in the least. As a matter of fact, it was<br />
a Chinese minister who visited us before an Australian minister<br />
visited China, and there will be just as many visits each way.<br />
The Chinese are courteous people. This is not a matter of<br />
ideology; it is a matter of historic habit and they don't<br />
patronize other people. k* </p>
