VISIT TO SOUTH EAST ASIA 1968<br />
SAIGON<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR. JOHN GORTON 9 JUNE 1968<br />
Q. Mr. Gorton you haven't been here very long, Sir, but what is your<br />
7 assessment of the military situation in Vietnam?<br />
PM. I don't believe I'm competent to make a military assessment, I'm not<br />
a military man. We get assessments given to us by our military advisers and<br />
I'm certainly no trained strategist nor a trained tactician, but there is one thing<br />
I do believe is quite certain, and that is the spirit and morale of our Australian<br />
troops here is as high as I have ever seen in any body of troops anywhere.<br />
Q. Sir, you were quoted as saying that you felt that news reports of the<br />
situation in Saigon had been exaggerated; can you tell me what areas of<br />
Saigon and Cholon you have seen?<br />
0M. All I can tell you is that flying in, both myself and I think those who<br />
were with me, had expected to see from the air much greater areas of<br />
devastation than were, in fact, apparent.<br />
Have you offered, or been asked, for any more Australian troops for<br />
Vietnam?<br />
PM. The answer to both those questions is no.<br />
Q. Excelleilcy, as yotJ have notilced aboiut the general situation in Vietnaffi<br />
do yoU ihihk thai the trend of ihis situation Will turn towards peace or towards<br />
an escalation of the war?<br />
Pm. What we all hope for is a peace which will bring to the people of South<br />
Vietnam a just, enduring and lasting peace under which they can elect their own<br />
Government free from fear and live under that Government free from fear.<br />
This is the peace, the objective sought as I understand all the allies agreed<br />
at the Manila Conference.<br />
Excellency, do you think that the Americans will withdraw from Vietnam?<br />
In other words, will give up in Vietnam?<br />
FM. I' m not qualified to speak for the Americans but the American President<br />
I understand has made this situation perfectly clear.<br />
Q. Mr. Gorton, the Australian 1st Battalion in 1965 took far less casualties<br />
than the Australian 1st Battalion is now taking in the same areas. It's the<br />
Australian 1st Battalion in War Zone now fighting N. V. A. units which<br />
are better equipped and are deeper entrenched in War Zone How can<br />
you then refer to military progress by the Australian Task Force as you have<br />
done elsewhere in the tour?<br />
PM. I' d like you to point out where I've referred to military progress by the<br />
Australian Task Force. What I have said and what I repeat is that the spirit and<br />
morale of the Australian troops are as good as I have seen in any body of troops<br />
anywhere. But since you have raised the question, I understand from our<br />
Australian military advisers, that the Battalion has played a significant part in<br />
setting itself across one of the main supply routes of Vietcong units down here<br />
and has caused so much discomfort to the enemy that it has led to attacks upon<br />
that Battalion in considerable force; and attacks which were repulsed with, and<br />
I speak from memory, losses to the enemy of some 45 to 55 men and a<br />
considerable number of arms. I think that is an indication of capacity and<br />
progress of the Australian Force as far as the Australian Forces are concerned.<br />
I just want to make it perfectly clear that the progress and capacity of the<br />
Australian military forces are not to be impugnedwhile in my presence. At<br />
least I won't accept it. </p>
