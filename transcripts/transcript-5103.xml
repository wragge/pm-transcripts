PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT WEDNESDAY 11 JULY 1979<br />
PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED BY REV. NEIL ADCOCK,<br />
RADIO STATION 6PR, PERTH<br />
Adcock On Nightline I'm happy to be talking by ' phone in Canberra<br />
with the Prime Minister of Australia, the Rt. Hon. Malcolm Fraser.<br />
Mr. Fraser, welcome to 6PR and thank you for your willingness<br />
to talk to me.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Thank you very much.<br />
Adco ck<br />
People I talk to in Perth are very deeply concerned, as I'm sure<br />
they are all over Australia, about what they see as the present<br />
fragmentation of this nation. What are you and your Government<br />
willing to do to bring us together again?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, I'm also concerned. I don't believe the fragmentation<br />
is as great as people often see but in industrial matters it's<br />
very often more evident than in other areas. There have been<br />
problems in Western Australia. There have been problems in<br />
Telecom, especially in the Sydney area right at this very<br />
moment. One of the things that we've got to do is to understand<br />
that in many things we need to put Australia first and our<br />
own particular or individual interests second or third. In the<br />
industrial arena if we could all only understand that we have<br />
established an arbitration system, a system of independent<br />
tribunals designed to determine the merits of cases between<br />
employees and employers, that we don't need industrial dispruption,<br />
bans and limitations to enable that system to work, that if we<br />
allow the arbitration processes to work then the public are not<br />
going to be inconvenienced. We are not going to have<br />
confrontation as essential services dry up and fail, then that<br />
in itself would be making an enormous contribution. I was<br />
very disappointed last Friday when we appealed to the ACTU to put<br />
its weight and to try to get its affiliates to support the<br />
general system of conciliation and arbitration. We weren't<br />
putting it to them that they should support any on side in that,<br />
merely that they should support the system and urge their trade<br />
union affiliates to do so and leave strikes and bans aside.<br />
I was very disappointed indeed that Mr. Hawke and the ACTU<br />
executives who were with him were not prepared to join in<br />
that particular appeal. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Adcoc k<br />
Do you believe that the time has come in Australia for<br />
people at top level of Government, trade union and management<br />
maybe to get away from the eyes of the media, the general<br />
publicity, to do mayble what was done by President Carter<br />
with Begin and Sadat, to talk together in the hope that<br />
there can be some sort of personal conciliation.<br />
Prime* Minister<br />
I think that's certainly a good thing. Now, again, during<br />
the proposed national stoppage and the possible blockade of<br />
Western Australia with the members of the ACTU, Peter Nolan<br />
and myself and other members of his organisation and my<br />
Cabinet, we were able to discuss that matter for several hours,<br />
to be in communication with Des O'Neil in Perth and also<br />
with the TLC representatives and a major national stoppage or<br />
a blockade of Western Australia was averted as I believe, by<br />
sensible discussion. I think that was an example of the way<br />
we ought to go about our business.<br />
Adcoc k<br />
Well do you believe that this sort of thing can happen again<br />
or should happen again?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
I think it-should happen again. We hoped the process would work<br />
in what we thought was, in a sense, an appeal to motherhood,<br />
in support for the arbitration system. That didn't work<br />
last Friday.<br />
Adco ck<br />
Thank you. Now, on another track, why is it apparently<br />
inevitable that high unemployment should be the price that<br />
Australia is paying to achieve the commendable goal of<br />
containing inflation?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It is not really the price of it. The high unemployment we now have<br />
is the price we are paying for high inflation in earlier years<br />
and we need to remember what happened. Wages went up too much,<br />
Government expenditure went up too much, there was a rapid<br />
inflation that went up to 19 percent in one half year. and,<br />
against that background, Australian manufacturers were just<br />
not able to sell their goods overseas. They were also<br />
prejudiced in delivering overseas because of strikes which meant_<br />
they couldn't deliver on time so they lsot overseas markets.<br />
But they also lost many domestic markets because Australian goods<br />
became too high priced compared to prices from countries<br />
overseas, which had done a better job in controlling inflation.<br />
./ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
If a factory in Perth can't sell its goods it plainly can't<br />
employ. So to overcome that situation we've had to get back<br />
to re-establishing the competitive basis of Australian industry<br />
so that we get a better share of the local market and get back<br />
into exports. Now that's starting to happen. Australian<br />
manufacturers are getting out into export markets in a very<br />
imaginative way and they're getting a much better share of<br />
the local market, but the process unfortunately takes a<br />
considerable time to work its way through.<br />
Adcock And when do you-anticipate it will have basically worked<br />
its way through?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well', to get back to the kind of employment levels we had<br />
seven or eight years ago might be very difficult indeed. Wage<br />
levels have gone up so much that many jobs have disappeared.<br />
You know, you get automatic petrol pumps and self-help<br />
petrol pumps, less jobs there for young people who might<br />
sometimes find it hard to get jobs that take many particular<br />
talents or qualifications.<br />
Adcock On the development of technology, this leads me into the next<br />
question because it appears to me that the galloping effects<br />
of technology have largely caught us in Australia unprepared.<br />
Is Australia facing up realistically to the predictable social<br />
effects of new technology, of automation and the resultant<br />
increased leisure time, say in the next ten years?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We sometimes need better mechanisms of consultation between<br />
management and labour on the introduction of new technology but<br />
what we also need to know very clearly is that without new<br />
technology unemployment will rise. New technology is one of<br />
the things that again makes it possible for Australian industry<br />
to compete. If something can be produced more cheaply as a<br />
result of new technology, well then there's the chance for<br />
the Australian firm to be producing more of it. You can be<br />
very certain that countries overseas will be using the new<br />
technology so if we don't we get left behind. We've got no<br />
option in that. </p>
<p>.4<br />
Adcock I suppose what I'm really saying is that, you know, have<br />
again the leaders of the nation from the various disciplines<br />
sort of sat down and worked out a policy whereby it will<br />
not create unnecessary unemployment but the new technology<br />
can be absorbed and used constructively for the benefit<br />
of the nation.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think so, yes. But it varies industry by industry. Some<br />
industries are much better at consultation than others. and,<br />
you know, very often the introduction of new technology in<br />
fact opens up more jobs because you find industry doing new<br />
things and additional things, supplying additional<br />
commodities which people are going to want, all things which<br />
have only become possible because of new techniques and new<br />
technology. So what we need to do is to embrace new<br />
technology and use it to Australia's advantage. The Government<br />
has had surveys of this particular matter long before there<br />
was general public concern in Australia. We had expressed<br />
our own concern by iniating significant investigations and<br />
examinations of technology, its implications for Australia,<br />
what we ought to be doing about That was going<br />
back a couple of years so there are complex questions. But<br />
one of the most important things is to make sure that more<br />
people understand the implications. I think that so often<br />
it is the unknown that frightens people.<br />
Adcock Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to ask you a question not<br />
related to the whole oil issue, but if more oil reserves<br />
were discovered in Australia would it be necessary then to lift<br />
our prices to world parity and why?<br />
Prime* Minister<br />
I believe we ought to, yes. The main reason is that we want<br />
industry and individuals to make rational economic decisions<br />
about the energy they use. That means we want an economic<br />
price for oil, the gas, the coal and then people will make<br />
the appropriate choices. If we keep oil down to artificially<br />
low levels, then more industries will stay on oil, more<br />
individuals will use oil, less people will go to natural<br />
gas-fired motor cars than to petrol. That means that a<br />
finite resource will be used up more quickly than it should be.<br />
One of the great tragedies in the United States is that it<br />
uses more oil than any other nation, it uses vast quantities<br />
and the price is so low that they use much more than<br />
their fair share of, again, a finite resource. It ought to be<br />
understood.-also that most European countries put much higher<br />
taxes on oil than we do, again to try and make sure that there<br />
are rational and sensible economic decisions made about<br />
the use of energy.: Because their taxes on oil are higher,<br />
their actual fuel prices will be anything up to double ours.<br />
I'm not suggesting~ we should do that but I do believe we need<br />
to stay basically with world parity pricing. </p>
<p>Adcock Well, are you suggesting it's more a conservation measure<br />
than an economic measure?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, it's a conservation measure, but we're only going to<br />
get that conservation measure if industry makes rational<br />
decisions about the source of energy they are going to use.<br />
Adcock Now can I ask you a question about one issue that's on here<br />
in the West? Gold is running at a record price. Is it ' likely<br />
that your Government will take any initiatives or give any<br />
incentive to get the Golden Mile operation again in Kalgoorlie?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
Well again, this is very much a function of price and if more<br />
mines could open up as a result of the cuirrent price nothing<br />
would please us more.<br />
Adcoc k<br />
You'll be very happy to know that the arena that you opened,<br />
the gift of the Federal Government for Western Australia's<br />
150th year, the hockey stadium here in Perth, is being-. used<br />
very effectively and very thoroughly. Are you involved<br />
in any other event in the 150th celebration coming to Perth<br />
before the end of the year?<br />
Prime* Minister<br />
I hope I'll be o ver in Perth towards the end of the year.<br />
I'll be over in twoor three weeks time for a particular function<br />
but it's not specifically related to the Centenerary and I<br />
hope very much to be there towards the end of the year.<br />
Adcock Right. Thanks very much for talking to us and will it be<br />
possible for me to talk to you again maybe about once a month<br />
so that you can keep us up to date here in Perth with the things<br />
that are happening in Canberra?<br />
Prime' Minister-<br />
Yes. I'd be very happy to do that, very happy indeed.<br />
* Adcock<br />
Mr. Fraser, thank you very much for talking to us on 6PR tonight.<br />
