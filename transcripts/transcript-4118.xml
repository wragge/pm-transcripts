FOR PRESS 11 May 1976<br />
AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE TO EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS<br />
The Australian Government is to donate the sum of $ 250,000<br />
to help relieve the plight of victims of the earthquake<br />
which on 6 May devastated a large area in north eastern Italy.<br />
All Australians share the grief of the families of those who<br />
lost their lives in this tragic disaster and Australia<br />
wishes to play its part in helping the injured and homeless<br />
of the affected regions.<br />
The Government has already announced that Australia will<br />
help the earthquake victims through immigration.<br />
In that connection the Australian Ambassador to Italy and<br />
immigration officials from the Embassy are already in the<br />
disaster area coordinating arrangements for the processing<br />
of nominations of those who are to come to Australia.<br />
