PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS MARCH 4, 1976<br />
JOINT COMMUNIQUE ISSUED ON THURSDAY 4 MARCH 1976 BY THE<br />
PRIME MINISTERS OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA AND AUSTRALIA DURING<br />
MR SOMARE'S VISIT TO CANBERRA<br />
At the invitation of the Government of Australia, the Prime<br />
Minister of Papua New Guinea, the Honourable Michael T. Somare,<br />
accompanied by Mrs Somare, is paying an official visit to<br />
Canberra on 4 and 5 March 1976.<br />
Mr Somare was received by His Excellency, the Governor-General,<br />
Sir John Kerr and by the Prime Minister, the Right Honourable<br />
Malcolm Fraser. Mr Somare had extensive discussions with Mr Fraser,<br />
with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Peacock, and with other<br />
Australian Ministers.<br />
The Australian Prime Minister extended a most warm welcome to<br />
Mr Somare on his first visit to Australia as the Prime Minister<br />
of an independent Papua New Guinea.<br />
The Prime Ministers noted with great satisfaction that Papua<br />
New Guinea had acceded to independence in 1975 smoothly and<br />
without difficulties. They paid tribute to the many Papua New<br />
Guineans and Australians who had contributed to this process, which<br />
they believed had established a sound and co-operative basis for<br />
the development of the post-independence relationship. They saw<br />
the end of the colonial relationship as a passing step in history;<br />
what was important to both countries in contrast with many other<br />
former colonies and administrating powers was that they are each<br />
other's closest neighbours, and would remain so. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The Prime Ministers said that Australia and Papua New Guinea<br />
had many abiding common interests. Their relationship was<br />
therefore of great importance to both countries: the Prime<br />
Ministers pledged that they would work for the closest development<br />
of that relationship, a relationship which would clearly be based<br />
on the sovereign, independent status of each country, and which<br />
would reflect mutual appreciation of each country's independent<br />
national interest. They agreed that they and their colleagues<br />
would continue to consult regularly and as often as judged<br />
necessary on any aspect of concern or interest.<br />
The Prime Ministers said that they had reviewed major aspects<br />
of relations between the two countries.<br />
Aid The Prime Ministers agreed that a new aid relationship was<br />
required properly to reflect Papua New Guinea's independent<br />
status. They agreed that the objectives of the new relationship<br />
would be to facilitate and promote economic and social development<br />
for the people of Papua New Guinea, to facilitate the achievement<br />
by the Papua New Guinea Government of its objective of increasing<br />
self-reliance, and to enable Papua New Guinea to plan its development<br />
on the basis of resources available to it including those to be<br />
provided by Australia, but to put an end to arrangements under<br />
which Australia had been involved in Papua New Guinea's budgetmaking.<br />
Mr Fraser told Mr Somare that, in determining the allocation of<br />
aid funds, Australia would continue to give the highest priority<br />
to providing aid to Papua New Guinea on a substantial scale to<br />
assist it towards its objective of self-reliance.<br />
Mr Fraser informed Mr Somare that the Australian Government now<br />
wished to enter into a new, long-term commitment on economic and<br />
social aid to Papua New Guinea. Mr Fraser said that the Australian<br />
Government had therefore decided that, subject to normal parliamentary<br />
procedures on appropriation, Australia would provide a minimum of<br />
$ 180 million in social and economic aid to Papua New Guinea for<br />
each of the five years beginning on 1 July 1976 and would consider / 3 </p>
<p>further annual supplements in the light of circumstances. it<br />
had been further decided that the annual supplements above the<br />
base figure would be $ 10 million in 1976-77 and $ 20 million in<br />
1977-78, bringing aid on this basis in those two years to $ 190<br />
million and $ 200 million.<br />
In addition to the figures mentioned above Australia will provide<br />
the following the Australian contribution to the Wabo<br />
Hydro-e-lectric feasibility study, the Australian-independence<br />
gift to Papua New Guinea, payments relating to war pensions<br />
and cemeteries, payments under the Employment Security Scheme,<br />
which the Australian Government was by legislation obliged<br />
to make, for termination benefits to former expatriate employees<br />
of the Government of Papua New Guinea; and expenditures by<br />
the Australian Government on the completion of the current<br />
aid projects for airport construction works at Port Moresby and<br />
Nadzab, ( estimated at $ 3.8 million in 1976/ 77) and on the<br />
Australia-Papua New Guinea Training and Education Scheme<br />
( estimated at $ 1.2 million in 1976/ 77). ( Payments under this<br />
Employment Security Scheme are tentively estimated at $ 37 million<br />
for 1976/ 77 and $ 21 million for 1977/ 78J,<br />
This means that Australian assistance to Papua New Guinea<br />
in 1976-77 for economic and social purposes will exceed<br />
$ 195 million. This represents an increase of at least $ 33 million<br />
in Australian aid to Papua New Guinea compared with 1975-76.<br />
Mr Somare warmly welcomed the new and generous long-term aid<br />
commitment by the Australian Government which he said the Government<br />
of Papua New Guinea found fully acceptable. He stressed, however,<br />
that Papua New Guinea would not be in any way relaxing its<br />
serious attempts to live within its means in the years ahead.<br />
Financial Reserves<br />
The Prime Ministers discussed the earlier Australian Government<br />
offer whereby the Reserve Bank of Australia would provide<br />
a $ 30 million standby to the Bank of Papua New Guinea to assist<br />
Papua New Guinea to cope if necessary with possible fluctuations<br />
in international trade and capital movements. Mr Fraser<br />
agreed that the standby arrangement would be increased to $ 60 million<br />

Torres Strait<br />
The Prime Ministers agreed it was important that an equitable<br />
and permanent settlement of all outstanding issues relating<br />
to Torres Strait be achieved as soon as possible. To this end,<br />
negotiations would be undertaken at an early date. Mr Fraser<br />
informed Mr Somare that the Commonwealth Government was<br />
prepared to negotiate some adjustment of present arrangements<br />
in Torres Strait. It was agreed that one object of the negotiations<br />
would be to draw a seabed delimitation line between Australia<br />
and Papua New Guinea.. The Prime Ministers agreed that the<br />
settlement should include the establishment in the Strait of<br />
a zone designed to protect the environment and to preserve the<br />
traditional way of life and livelihood of the local inhabitants.<br />
Mr Fraser explained to Mr Somare that certain aspects of the<br />
matter raised constitutional issues in which the co-operation<br />
of the Government of Queensland was required. Accordingly, the<br />
Commonwealth Government would commence Ministerial discussions<br />
with Queensland befor. e the end of April and thereafter would<br />
meet with the Government o f Papua New Guinea.<br />
Both Prime Ministers agreed that a settlement of the issue had<br />
been too long delayed. They looked to an early and equitable<br />
solution. Telephone Services<br />
The Prime Ministers noted that the two Governments had had under<br />
review for some time the telephone services between the two<br />
countries. Mr Somare welcomed Mr Fraser's advice that Australia<br />
would introduce, within a month or so, a new facility whereby<br />
all Australian telephone subscribers would be able, as subscribers<br />
in Papua New Guinea already are, to dial Papua New Guinea<br />
direct on an ISD ( International Subscriber Dialling) system<br />
with a special dialling code. The Prime Ministers agreed that<br />
this would not only facilitate communication between the many<br />
people resident in each country with relatives, friends or </p>
<p>other interests in the other, but would also offset the<br />
foreign exchange flow to Australia which had resulted<br />
from the present system.<br />
Other Bilateral Matters<br />
The Prime Ministers noted that, naturally, in view of the short<br />
period since independence, a number of other matters of<br />
bilateral importance required resolution. They noted that<br />
negotiations were proceeding on long-term arrangements<br />
in the defence, trade and civil aviation areas, as well<br />
as on a number of other matters of mutual interest and co-operation.<br />
They agreed that they would ask their colleagues responsible<br />
for these various matters of intergovernmental co-operation<br />
to proceed steadily towards completion of appropriate agreements<br />
or understandings. Announcements would be made as appropriate.<br />
Bougainville Mr Somare gave Mr Fraser an account of recent developments<br />
in Bougainville and of the negotiations proceeding with<br />
Bouganvillean representatives. Mr Somare explained that<br />
the Coalition Government under-his'leadership is committed<br />
to maintaining a united and stable Papua New Guinea. To this<br />
end he was working towards a structure of government that would<br />
satisfy the aspirations of the Bougainvilleans within the<br />
framework of a united Papua New Guinea.<br />
Mr Fraser informed Mr Somare that the Australian Government<br />
appreciated that the question of Bougainville was clearly<br />
an internal matter for the Government of Papua New Guinea<br />
and accordingly one in which, in the post-independence situation<br />
Australia was no longer directly involved. He nevertheless<br />
wishes to state clearly and publicly, with Mr Somare ' s agreement,<br />
that the Australian Government maintained unequivocally the<br />
position, made clear by the unanimous support of the Australian<br />
Parliament for Papua New Guinea's accession to independence last<br />
year, and also by the support of the United Nations Special </p>
<p>-6-<br />
Committee of Twenty-Four, the Trusteeship Council and the<br />
General Assembly, that a united Papua New Guinea was in the<br />
interest of all concerned. The Australian Government would<br />
therefore give the fullest support to the current efforts<br />
of the Government of Papua New Guinea directed towards<br />
a negotiated and peaceful settlement of the issues involved,<br />
enabling Bougainville to remain within a united Papua New Guinea.<br />
International Affairs<br />
The Prime Ministers stated that both their Governments<br />
would puruse independent foreign policies based on their<br />
perception of their own national interests. Both Governments<br />
would attach great importance to consultation and to<br />
co-operation with their neighbours in the affairs of the region.<br />
As was well known, both countries gave their firm support<br />
to the principles of the United Nations charter.<br />
The Australian Primer Minister assured Mr Somare<br />
that in those countries where Papua New Guinea had not established<br />
its own representation, Australian diplomatic and consular<br />
missions would, to the extent desired by the Government<br />
of Papua New Guinea and within the limits of their resources,<br />
act for the Government of Papua New Guinea in the prosecution<br />
of its diplomatic and consular interests. Mr Somare warmly<br />
welcomed this assurance.<br />
Invitation to Mr Fraser to Visit Papua New Guinea<br />
Mr Somare extended a most cordial invitation to Mr Fraser<br />
to visit Papua New Guinea. Mr Fraser accepted the invitation<br />
with pleasure. It was agreed that a date for the visit would<br />
be fixed by consultation between the two Governments.<br />
Mr Somare thanked Mr Fraser for the warmth of the welcome<br />
extended to him, to his wife, and to members of his-party,<br />
and for the arrangemnents which had been so generously made<br />
for their stay in Australia. 000000000 </p>
