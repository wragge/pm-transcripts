<p>WHY AUSTRALIA SAYS NO TO TESTING<br />
BY P. J. KEATING, PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA<br />
Australia and its citizens, along with the peoples and governments of many other<br />
countries, have been angered by the French government's announcement that it will<br />
resume nuclear testing at Mururoa. I believe the French people will have no difficulty<br />
understanding such feelings.<br />
The sentiment in the countries of the South Pacific is all but universal: if France must<br />
test these weapons, let her test them in metropolitan France. Whatever the French<br />
government intends by these actions, they are read by the great majority of people in<br />
this region as an assault upon the rights of small nations by a large one. Inevitably,<br />
the decision to resume tests is seen as a regression to old colonial attitudes. This is<br />
all the more tragic because in recent years France's relationship with the countries of<br />
the region has become much more positive and fruitful.<br />
Neither Australia nor the other countries of the region are motivated by a desire to<br />
see France out of the Pacific. On the contrary, we want to work closely and<br />
cooperatively with her. But it is one regrettable consequence of this decision that<br />
many in the region will now question the legitimacy of France's role.<br />
The anger and frustration which Australians feel is the more acute because of the<br />
history we share with France. French ships were present at the birth of European<br />
settlement in Australia. French explorers and scientists and artists are prominent<br />
among those who mapped the Australian coastline and interpreted the Australian<br />
landscape. French culture significantly shaped our own cultural development. And<br />
twice this century Australians fought in France. In World War I Australian and New<br />
Zealand casualties on French battlefields were the highest per capita of any of the<br />
combatants and that experience was a seminal influence on Australia's<br />
development. The names of those battlefields are part of Australia's history and<br />
legend.<br />
Australia's concerns are heightened further by the added responsibility which derives<br />
from our role this year as Chair of the 15-member South Pacific Forum. In this<br />
capacity we speak on behalf of all the countries in the region, many of them small<br />
and ecologically vulnerable, all of them in a profound material and spiritual<br />
relationship with the Pacific Ocean.<br />
I am confident that I speak for the members of the Forum in continuing to press<br />
France to reverse her decision, and in asserting that if she were to do so she would<br />
gain greatly in prestige, not only among the countries of the South Pacific, but among<br />
the peoples of the world.<br />
The French government has defended the environmental safety of the tests at<br />
Mururoa. But we are deeply concerned about the possibility of accidents. And noone<br />
can possibly foresee the longer term dangers'associated with possible leakage<br />
from the fragile atoll structures housing the tests. </p>
<p>2<br />
Australia's is not a hastily considered or reflexive reaction. Australia has a long<br />
history of responsible diplomatic effort on nuclear issues. Along with the other<br />
countries of the South Pacific, Australia opposed France's atmospheric tests in the<br />
1970s, and on our initiative the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone was created in<br />
1985.<br />
Australia has also been consistently active on nuclear matters in the United Nations<br />
and other international forums. We have often acted in close cooperation with<br />
France, in particular since the very welcome decision by President Mitterrand in 1992<br />
to declare a moratorium on nuclear tests. These efforts moved forward on 11 May<br />
with the decision of the international community to indefinitely extend the Treaty on<br />
the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons a vital element in the security of both our<br />
countries. It is not for Australia or any other country to define France's security; but, in the<br />
circumstances, I believe readers of Le Monde will permit me to say why we think<br />
France's actions are not good for the world or for France.<br />
We believe these tests pose a threat to our efforts to sustain the effectiveness of<br />
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and achieve universal membership. Critical to the<br />
indefinite extension of that treaty was the simultaneous negotiation and adoption by<br />
all parties, including the nuclear weapon states, of a " Declaration of Principles and<br />
Objectives on Non-Proliferation and Disarmament".<br />
That declaration foreshadowed the early conclusion, no later than 1996 of a<br />
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. And pending the entry into force of such a treaty,<br />
the nuclear weapon states committed themselves to exercise " utmost restraint".<br />
But " utmost restraint" on nuclear testing cannot possibly comprehend a program of<br />
eight tests. France's decision is certain to raise in the minds of non-nuclear weapon<br />
states questions about the good faith of all the nuclear weapon states. That will put<br />
pressure on the credibility of the Treaty, which must be maintained if some of the<br />
states which have not yet signed it are to be persuaded to do so.<br />
The decision will also add to the negotiating difficulties over the Comprehensive Test<br />
Ban Treaty.<br />
Despite the very welcome declaration by President Chirac that France will sign the<br />
CTBT, there is a real danger that the very difficult series of negotiations which lie<br />
ahead in Geneva over the Treaty will be made even harder.<br />
France's very position as a responsible and leading power in the world means that<br />
each new test by France will give comfort to would-be proliferators, and each test will<br />
give pause to many of those countries whose support we will need to conclude the<br />
CTBT. We are familiar with the arguments for France's nuclear capability and the strategic<br />
dimensions of nuclear power. We are not arguing from a merely emotive standpoint </p>
<p>when we say that, for all of us, the greatest responsibility is to keep alive the hope of<br />
a nuclear free world that was born with the end of the Cold War. The burden of that<br />
responsibility falls most heavily on the nuclear states, particularly following the<br />
indefinite extension of the NPT.<br />
And, surely, for those with nuclear expertise in Europe, the greatest present test of<br />
leadership is the one which lies at Europe's door. The damaged Chernobyl reactor<br />
may now be entombed, but in the territory of the former Soviet Union there are<br />
another twenty reactors with similar design faults. Scores of nuclear-powered<br />
submarines from the former Soviet Fleet now lie idle. Nuclear materials and nuclear<br />
expertise are seeping out of the former Soviet Union and into illicit markets.<br />
These dangers, like the stockpiles of degrading nuclear weapons and contaminated<br />
sites, will not be deterred by the development of further nuclear weapon capability.<br />
But France's world class skills in nuclear science and technology can help. How<br />
much more respect France would earn, and how much more sense it would make, if<br />
instead of concentrating her skills and energy on combating a purely hypothetical<br />
threat, she turned more of them to tackling a real one.<br />
I have no doubt that Australians would want it known in France that their attitude is in<br />
no way shaped by any hostility to the French people or the French nation. Our<br />
opposition is specific to the French Government's decision to resume testing in the<br />
Pacific. Sometimes in the past Australia's attitude has been read in France as an expression<br />
of some Anglo-Saxon hostility to France.<br />
But Australia is by no means an Anglo Saxon enclave in the Asia-Pacific region. As<br />
the many French people who live in Australia could attest, this is a rich multicultural<br />
society, half of whose immigrants these days come from the countries of Asia. It is<br />
clear that among those same French residents of Australia there are many who<br />
believe that the French Government should reverse its decision.<br />
If they live on the eastern seaboard of Australia they will know that there is a world of<br />
difference between studying a map of the Pacific in Europe and living on the shores<br />
of the ocean in Sydney or Brisbane or Auckland or Suva. The map puts these places<br />
a long way from Mururoa. But when you live in these places you know that, vast<br />
though it is, the South Pacific is one environment and it binds all those who share it.<br />
The sense of community which the Pacific Ocean gives us is not unlike that which the<br />
idea of " Europe" gives France. It is the underlying reason for our opposition to<br />
France's decision to resume testing and it is why Australia and our partners in the<br />
South Pacific Forum will continue to press our views strongly to the French<br />
government and to convey to the people of France, as far we are able, the depth of<br />
our feelings. </p>
