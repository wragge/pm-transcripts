STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
PUBLIC DUTY AND PRIVATE INTERESTS<br />
For the information of honourable members I present<br />
copies of the statements which Ministers have provided<br />
to me concerning their private interests. My own return<br />
is, of course, also included.<br />
Mr Speaker, I seek leave to make a statement.<br />
The statements of private interests which I have<br />
presented to the House represent a landmark in the<br />
development of this Parliament and in the provision of<br />
information to the public about the Ministers to whom<br />
that public has entrusted the government of this<br />
country. Never before in the history of this Parliament have<br />
Ministers disclosed publicly the private interests which<br />
they hold.<br />
It is right and proper that they should do so. The<br />
public the electors of this country are entitled to<br />
have confidence in the integrity of their elected<br />
representatives; to know that Ministers of the<br />
Government will perform their duties without fear or </p>
<p>favour; to be reassured that a Minister's private<br />
interests whatever they may be do not conflict with<br />
his or her public duties in holding the high office of a<br />
Minister in the Federal Government.<br />
With those beliefs in mind the Australian Labor Party<br />
has long held the view that public disclosure of the<br />
private interests of Ministers and of others, to whom<br />
I shall refer later is appropriate.<br />
I want to turn now to some of the details of the system<br />
of declaration of private interests which the Government<br />
has decided upon.<br />
In respect of Ministers, there are two statements of<br />
private interests. The first is a statement in general<br />
terms of the interests held by a Minister and those of<br />
his or her immediate family ( that is, spouse and<br />
dependent children) of which he, or she, is aware. It<br />
is required to be provided on an annual basis ( with any<br />
significant changes in the meantime also disclosed to<br />
me) and will cover:<br />
shareholdings in public and private companies<br />
family and business trusts and nominee<br />
companies </p>
<p>real estate<br />
S directorships in private companies<br />
and I should make it clear that Ministers are<br />
required to resign any directorships in public<br />
companies and directorships of private companies<br />
unless, for example, such companies operate a<br />
family farm, business or investments and the<br />
retention of the directorship is not likely to<br />
conflict with the public duty of the Minister<br />
partnerships liabilities, other than short-term credit<br />
arrangements bonds, debentures and like investments<br />
savings or investment accounts<br />
other assets ( including collections but<br />
excluding household and personal effects) each<br />
valued at over $ 5000 </p>
<p>that is, each collection valued at more than $ 5000,<br />
other than any used for household purposes, will be<br />
declared other substantial sources of income<br />
in relation to which I should say that Ministers of<br />
this Government may not derive any income through<br />
personal exertion other than as a Minister and a<br />
member of this Parliament<br />
gifts valued at more than $ 250 received from<br />
official sources or in excess of $ 100 from<br />
non-official sources, in accordance with<br />
agreed guidelines<br />
sponsored travel or hospitality ( other than<br />
' guest of government' hospitality)<br />
bearing in mind there are long-standing<br />
restrictions on Ministers in that respect<br />
and finally, any other interests ( such as<br />
membership of organisations) where a conflict<br />
of interest with public duties could<br />
foreseeably arise. </p>
<p>I have mentioned some of the particular restrictions<br />
which are placed on Ministers. So that all members of<br />
the House, and the public, are aware of the full extent<br />
of those restrictions I shall mention other<br />
requirements.<br />
Ministers, upon appointment as Ministers, must cease to<br />
engage in any professional practice or in the daily work<br />
of any business; nor, as I have mentioned, can they<br />
derive any income through personal exertion other than<br />
as a Minister or a member of this Parliament.<br />
Ministers have to divest themselves of shares or similar<br />
interests in any company or business involved in the<br />
area of their portfolio responsibilities.<br />
Ministers have to make a declaration at meetings of the<br />
Cabinet or its Committees of any matter which may give<br />
rise to a conflict of interests.<br />
And should any particular conflict of interest arise<br />
during the course of Ministers' administration of their<br />
Departments, I have to be informed so that a decision<br />
can be made on how the particular matter is to be<br />
progressed. </p>
<p>From the statements I have presented, honourable members<br />
will see that money amounts of individual Ministers'<br />
interests whether income, assets or liabilities have<br />
not been included. It is the Government's belief that<br />
public disclosure of that information would be an undue<br />
invasion of the privacy of Ministers and of their<br />
families. Ministers, however, have declared those<br />
amounts to me in a private and confidential statement.<br />
This is the second of the statements to which I referred<br />
earlier which will also be required to be provided on an<br />
annual basis.<br />
I turn now to provisions which might be applied to<br />
senators and members generally.<br />
I remarked earlier on the right of the public to have<br />
confidence in the integrity of its elected<br />
representatives. While that confidence demands<br />
particularly high standards in Government Ministers it<br />
also demands certain standards of each and every member<br />
of this House and each and every member of the Senate.<br />
The Government therefore proposes that all senators and<br />
members should disclose by way of a public register<br />
their own private interests, and those interests of </p>
<p>their families of which they are aware. The details to<br />
be disclosed would be no more than are in the Ministers'<br />
statements which I have presented today. In one<br />
important respect they would be much less: there would<br />
be no requirement to disclose money values at all.<br />
The Government also proposes that the Standing Orders be<br />
amended to require all members to declare a relevant<br />
interest if they participate in a debate or vote in a<br />
division in the House. Standing orders already make<br />
certain provisions in respect of committee membership<br />
where a member has a personal interest in the subject<br />
matter before the committee.<br />
It is the Government's intention that the precise method<br />
of implementation of the provisions to apply to senators<br />
and members should be examined by the Standing Orders<br />
Committees of the respective Houses, meeting as<br />
necessary as a joint committee to ensure that the<br />
provisions are as far as possible consistent between the<br />
two Houses. In addition, it is intended that the<br />
Standing Orders Committee should be asked to report upon<br />
whether, as proposed in the Bowen Report on Public Duty </p>
<p>and Private Interest, a Code of Conduct should apply to<br />
all senators and members and if so what form it should<br />
take and how it should be implemented. The Committee<br />
will also be asked to look at the other recommendations<br />
of the Bowen Report ( apart from those relating to the<br />
Constitution) affecting senators and members. My<br />
colleague the Leader of the House will be presenting<br />
a notice of motion today giving further details and<br />
proposing referral to the Standing Orders Committee for<br />
consideration and report. One question is whether the<br />
registration system should be compulsory or voluntary.<br />
If the House ultimately decides upon the latter and a<br />
member refuses to provide a statement I am sure that<br />
people especially the electors concerned will be<br />
able to make their own judgement about that particular<br />
member. Mr Speaker, some may argue that any system of<br />
registration of private interests should be confined to<br />
the public'selected representatives. We believe,<br />
however, that the public is entitled to have confidence<br />
in the integrity of the wider machinery of government;<br />
in the integrity of public administration generally. </p>
<p>Therefore, the Government has decided that senior public<br />
servants, statutory officeholders, senior staff of<br />
statutory authorities, and all ministerial staff will be<br />
required to furnish a statement of their private<br />
interests similar to the public statement required of<br />
Ministers that is, containing details of the interests<br />
I mentioned earlier, but not as to their money amounts.<br />
The statements will not be public but, in the case of<br />
public servants and members and staff of statutory<br />
authorities, will be available to the relevant Minister<br />
and to the head of the department or authority<br />
concerned. In the case of ministerial staff the<br />
statements will be available to the relevant Minister,<br />
to the Special Minister of State, and to me. The Public<br />
Service Board or, in the case of statutory authorities,<br />
the responsible Minister, will be informing the people<br />
concerned of the requirements in the near future. The<br />
Department of the Special Minister of State will be<br />
contacting ministerial staff to the extent that their<br />
present statements do not cover the requirements I have<br />
announced today.<br />
On such an important matter as this, Mr Speaker, I could<br />
not conclude without a reference to those who work in<br />
this building and whose task it is to report upon our<br />
L </p>
<p>activities via the media. They enjoy particular<br />
privileges and rights of access including to the<br />
galleries of this Chamber which many other people do<br />
not. They are there, however, not only to report upon<br />
words spoken in this House but to express views and<br />
opinions on the actions and decisions of the Government<br />
as a whole, individual members and, occasionally, the<br />
Opposition. The Government therefore believes that it would be<br />
consistent with its overall approach to this particular<br />
matter if the Australian Journalists' Association and<br />
the Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery were invited to<br />
develop a similar system of disclosure of the private<br />
interests of journalists of those media organisations<br />
accredited to or using the facilities of the Parliament,<br />
and all members of the media who have quarters in or<br />
work from Parliament House. My colleague the Special<br />
Minister of State will be pursuing these aspects in the<br />
near future.<br />
Mr Speaker, the Government's decisions on this matter<br />
are the culmination of the work of many people over many<br />
years. The parliamentary committee which reported in<br />
1975, chaired by the then member for Phillip, Joe </p>
<p>11.<br />
Riordan, made a most significant contribution to a<br />
proper system of registration of private interests. One<br />
cannot overlook, also, the comprehensive report of the<br />
Committee of Inquiry into Public Duty and Private<br />
Interest, chaired by Sir Nigel Bowen.<br />
The arrangements I have announced today represent a new<br />
extension in parliamentary democracy. The electors of<br />
this country have a right to be confident that those<br />
whom they send to represent them in this Parliament will<br />
do so in all matters without fear or favour. A large<br />
part of that confidence rests in the public knowledge<br />
that the private interests of the elected member<br />
whether a Minister, a Government backbencher or an<br />
Opposition member will not influence, nor will they be<br />
likely to influence, the discharge of his or her public<br />
duties in whatever capacity he or she may serve in this<br />
Parliament. 22 September 1983 </p>
