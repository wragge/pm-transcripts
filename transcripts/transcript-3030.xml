SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
TO TH' ANNUAL DINNER OF THE QUEENSLAND CHAMBER OF MIANUFACTU] REPS,<br />
LENT4OJIS PLAZA HOTEL, BRISBANE, MOLJDAY 1ST OCTOBER, 1973<br />
During the past few weeks I have spoken on five occasions<br />
to business leaders throughout Australia. I certainly intend no<br />
slight to Queensland by the fact that this gathering is the last<br />
of the series. On the contrary, you will receive the distillation<br />
of all the accumulated wisdom of my travels. You may justly call<br />
this my summing up, my final address to the jury.<br />
In everything I have had to say to the business community<br />
and especially to manufacturers I Lhave sought to omphasise one<br />
bas: ic fact about my Government. And it is this: We are committed<br />
to your prosperity, we need you. 1e need your success, your<br />
growth, your co.-operation.<br />
I have to confess that this is partly a vested interest.<br />
And, as such, it is the more compelling. The fact is, as I<br />
have always stressed, that if my Government is to bring fruition to<br />
our ambitious plans for Australia's welfare and development, we can<br />
do it only in the context of an expanding economy, a buoyant and<br />
prosperous private sector. We were elected on a platform of<br />
reform; we will stand or fall depending on how successfully that<br />
mandate is discharged. We need business, we need industry, we need<br />
men like yourselves, to help us to discharge it. You are our<br />
in. l. insensable allies.<br />
So that is my first unequivocal assurance to you. Whenever<br />
you hear people say that the Government is indifferent, or even<br />
hostile, to the business world, you will realise how shallow, how<br />
short--sighted, how politically naive, such a judgement must be.<br />
Of course you will have criticisms to make of the Government in<br />
detail, just as the Government may have particular criticisms of<br />
business or industry. That is a fact of life, and a fact of<br />
politics, whatever Government may be in power. 1ut I ask you<br />
to remember that our underlying commitment is to the maintenance<br />
of strong and prosperous local industries. That commitment has been<br />
reflected in every major policy announcement, every major economic<br />
decision we have taken since coming to office.<br />
To illustrate my point, I mention some of the measures we<br />
have chosen to fight inflation. Rather, I shall mention first one<br />
3f the methods we have not chosen. We have not chosen to fight<br />
inflation by creating massive unemployment. Yours are the industries<br />
that would suffer most from such measures as indeed, you have<br />
already suffered to your great cost. I hardly need to remind you<br />
of the losses entailed by empty or half-used factories. So we will<br />
not attack inflation by destroying jobs. That is not simply an<br />
ideological commitment to the wage earner, though of course such a<br />
commitment is central to our perception of social . justice. It is<br />
a commitment no less realistic, to your welfare as well. We will not<br />
expose Australian industry to stop-go fluctuations in demand which can<br />
destroy its efficiency and inventives. As part of our attack on<br />
inflation we have created conditions in which most industries can<br />
produce to capacity and benefit from the lower unit costs which<br />
result. </p>
<p>-2<br />
So let me spell out the essentials of our community of interest.<br />
' Full employment is one, and in the past 10 months we have restored<br />
genuine full employment. Next, we are committed to growth, to a<br />
national economy geared to the highest level of its capacity and<br />
real productivity. That means the manufacturer and the investor<br />
can plan-with complete assurance on the maintenance of the highest<br />
possible level of economic growth, and don't forget that in the<br />
past 10 months we have lifted our national growth rate to a near<br />
record 7%.<br />
N~ ext, we both need a high level of real wages and real<br />
purchasing power. Then again, we have a vested interest in your<br />
achieving fair profits. We need the growth which the investment of<br />
such profits brings. And finally, we believe there are enormous<br />
opportunities for manufacturers, for prudent investors, in the<br />
initiatives we have taken to enlarge the public sector of the<br />
economy. When Governments take initiatives where none were taken<br />
before as we have in the cities, in education, in transport,<br />
in housing it is private enterpris e and privato mnufacturing<br />
which share in the fruits of these initiatives.<br />
There is another message I have tried to convey to the<br />
businessmen of this country. It is one of pure optimism, or if<br />
you like, of self-congratulation. I ask you to remember that our<br />
economy is basically strong and healthy, and that jusinoss is<br />
currently enjoying a buoyant prosperity. We hear a good deal<br />
about anxiety or uncertainty; we hear little about the real<br />
tangible strength of the Australian economy at this time. After<br />
all, manufactuers should know this better than anyone.<br />
Niowhere is our prosperity more apparent than in manufacturing.<br />
Consumer spending is running at very high levels.<br />
In the June quarter the level of activity rose in almost<br />
every major area of manufacturing industry. Sales rose by 12%<br />
over March 1973 and a further increase of 15% is expected<br />
in the December half-year. In the June quarter capital expenditure<br />
rose by 23% over March, and orders were 11% above the already high<br />
March values. So whatever doubts you may have about the future<br />
let there be no doubts about the present. We are thriving.<br />
I know that for many of you the Government' s approach to<br />
industry may seem to be one of denial, rather than generosity;<br />
of exposure to chill winds, rather than protection. I acknowledge<br />
the anxieties you have experienced over our tariff cuts and<br />
revaluations, though I must say frankly that we h~ ve seen little<br />
evidence so far of any harmful effects of these measures, either<br />
on industry or the workforce. And I am confident that the measures<br />
were justified by considerations of the national economic interest<br />
that you, as businessmen, will recognise. I acknowledge also that,<br />
for some of you, our proposals for reforming the tariff machinery<br />
for establishing an Australian Industry Development Corporation,<br />
for legislating in far--reaching fashion for consumer protection and<br />
against restrictive practices, may seem part o~ f some complex and<br />
oppresive pattern of interference or intimidation. That is what<br />
our critics would like you to believe. They arc wrong. / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
It is my purpose to assure you, to convince you, that they<br />
are wrong. In the first place, we have undertaken that the<br />
Government will assist any industry adversely affected by our<br />
revaluations in tariff cuts. As to our long-term reforms, I<br />
stress that their purpose is not to weaken industry but to<br />
strengthen it still further to meet whatever challenges may be<br />
posed by international events or economic conditions at home.<br />
I am talking now of industries that are genuinely strong,<br />
genuinely responsive, competitive, flexible and efficient.<br />
A weak industry is not strong-whatever governments may do to<br />
help it. In the long run, it will not survive. Nhat we aim<br />
to do, in all our measures for encouraging and assisting industry,<br />
is to make sure that efficient and well-run industries not<br />
only survive but prosper.<br />
So I give you this assurance: nothing we do, either in our<br />
fight against inflation or in our general economic policies,<br />
will do anything to damage the underlying strength and prosperity<br />
of Australian industry. We are pledged to your growth and progress.<br />
I do not see anything in our announced policies that industry<br />
should fear. In a sense, our plans for consumer protection, for<br />
industry assistance, for banning restrictive trading practices<br />
far-reaching and important as they are-involve no more than logical<br />
extensions of what are now accepted principles. If you take our<br />
legislation on restrictive practices, for example, you will see<br />
that what we are doing is directly prohibiting certain practices<br />
instead of leaving them to be restrained separately after timeconsuming<br />
inquiries. We have not so much a new objective, as a new<br />
and more direct means of achieving it. At the very least you will<br />
concede that our appraoch will eliminate a great deal of uncertainty.<br />
As the influence of this legislation spreads we can expect a sharper<br />
and more competitive spirit to emerge in the economy, with industry<br />
quicker to respond to changes in the market and to new opportunities<br />
in general. ' This must benefit everyone.<br />
Similarly, with our attitude to industry assistance.<br />
We are by no means abolishing the accepted principle that deserving<br />
industries should be assisted to develop and flourish. Far from it.<br />
What we are doing is extending this principle to all industries<br />
not just manufacturing and ensuring that the whole process of<br />
assistance is subject to the most rigorous and extensive public<br />
scrutiny. I am sure there is no one in this room who would not agree with<br />
me that the report on industry assistance prepared at my Government's<br />
invitation by Sir John Crawford and on which our legislation was<br />
based is one of the most far-sighted and historic contributions<br />
to the welfare of Australian industry ever prepared or published.<br />
The other basic thought I have sought to convey to the business<br />
community is our desire for full and frank communication with you.<br />
We seek this communication, this understanding, with industry<br />
and business just as much as we seek it with the trade union<br />
movement. We want to hear from you and be involved in your problems.<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>Ole established at the outset of the Government a new<br />
Department of Secondary Industry. Like you, we have always<br />
emphasised the need for co-operation between industry and<br />
government. My colleague, Dr. Cairns, has announced his<br />
proposal for industry panels to bring together representatives<br />
of industry, government, the trade unions and consumers to advise<br />
on the development of industries. We have ncver run away from<br />
consultation with industry, and I assure you that in future we<br />
will never be anything but receptive to your views, sensitive to<br />
to your needs, and sympathetic to your rightful ambitions.<br />
It will help you, I think, if I state as clearly and<br />
concisely as I can the wayt we should like to see industry develop<br />
and the hopes we have for its future. They are confident hopes.<br />
r? ha1y are based on a generous appraisal of your innate strength,<br />
your good sense, your capacity to adapt and adjust to fresh<br />
opportunities. We want to see industry, and the whole economy,<br />
become more adaptable to changing technology and to changing<br />
economic conditions both at homo and abraod. Whatever government may<br />
be in power, there can never be, in today's unstable world, a<br />
guarantee of absolute security for any industry, or indeed for any<br />
sector of industry. You know how vulnerable primary industry has<br />
proved to changes in the world climate; secondary industry on the<br />
whole has been more fortunate. We want to ensure for all industry,<br />
as far as possible, a greater resilienco and strength -a greater<br />
competitive spirit and efficiency to enable it to withstand the<br />
inevitable vicissitudes of a changing and more uncertain world.<br />
2e want our manufacturing industries to become m~ ore oriented to<br />
international markets not through sudden switches of policy, but<br />
by gradual application and readjustment. In all these efforts,<br />
industry will to assured of the guidance and support of the<br />
Austral ian Government.<br />
My final message tonight is addressed to you,<br />
not as businessmen or manufacturers, but as Queenslanders. It<br />
concerns the future of your State its relationship with the rest<br />
of Australia and my own Government. I hope I am not breaking<br />
confidence if I disclose, Mr. President, that when you wrote to me<br />
recently about what I should say at this dinner, you said:<br />
" Mayne it is time we were told once again that our industrial output<br />
per head is the second lowest in Australia." Well, I would rather you<br />
made the point than I, but quite frankly, it never occurred to me<br />
to resort to such partisan and inflammatory remarns. Nevertheless,<br />
I think there is a lesson here that is worth repeating. Whatever<br />
the industrial output in Queensland, there is no reason why it<br />
should not be among the highest in Australia, and I sincerely believe<br />
the policies of my Government will help strengthen your industries<br />
and raise your general prosperity.<br />
For myself, I have never had anything but affection and<br />
admiration for your State. After all, I am spcendi ng a few days'<br />
holiday in one of your coastal cities this week. But I suppose,<br />
like me, you have occasionally detected a slight sense of<br />
estrangement between Mr. Bjelhe-Petersen's Government and mine.<br />
There is, quite frankly, a coolness between us such as exists<br />
between no other two governments in Australia. It can only be<br />
damaging and desiructive to both of us. I seek an end to it. </p>
<p>I am sure it is not for any want of generosity or willingness on our<br />
part that the normal goodwill and mutual cooperation so essential<br />
between State and National governments so essential to a<br />
Federation somehow has faltered in the case of Queensland.<br />
So that you may judge our good intentions, let me tell you of<br />
some of . the things we have done for Queensland. When I first came<br />
to Brisbane as Prime Minister that was in March this year I said:<br />
" My Government's commitment to the welfare and progress of<br />
Queensland is both general and specific. It is ' ased on two<br />
great themes. There is first our general commitment to the<br />
cities. It is in these areas that my Government's attack on<br />
the problems of land and housing costs, school opp ortunities,<br />
hospitals, public transport, unemployment, sport and culture<br />
are principally directed. We have established a Department<br />
of Urban and Regional Development to co-ordinate our work:<br />
of rebuilding and regenerating our cities. Queensland will<br />
share in that process. The related task of brinrjing new<br />
standards of social welfare to the people has been entrusted<br />
to our new Department of Social Security. I remind you that<br />
this Department is headed by a Queenslander, my colleague<br />
Bill Hayden. The second part of my Government's commitment to<br />
Queensland is a specific one. It is in our policies for<br />
northern Development. That Department is also headed by a<br />
Queenslander, Dr. Rex Patterson. It is our aim, in co-operation<br />
with the Government of Queensland, to develon the vast and valuable<br />
resources of northern Australia for the benefit of the Australian<br />
people. It is in the north that the great sugar and cattle<br />
industries and much of our mineral industries hiave keen established.<br />
It is in the north that Australians face their greatest challenge<br />
in retaining the ownership of the nation's resources and<br />
developing new industries under Australian control.<br />
My Government has made one other specific pledge to the<br />
Queensland people. We have undertaken that one of our two main<br />
initiatives in regional development will be concentrated in<br />
Townsville. I said last year in my policy speech that the national<br />
Government was already responsible for decisions which have determined<br />
the growth and the burdens of Townsville more than any other<br />
Australian city except Canberra itself."<br />
A few figures will suffice to show the extent of my Government's<br />
assistance to Queensland. Remember that we spend much more on one<br />
average Queenslander tnan we do on other Australians.<br />
Our total payments to Queensland in 173/ 74, for all purposes,<br />
are estimated at $ 585 million. This represents about $ 300 per head<br />
compared with average payments to all States of about S270 per head.<br />
Our housing advances of $ 17.4 million in 1973/ 74 will be 20% up on<br />
last year. Our payments for education will rise dramatically as a<br />
result of the recommendations of the Karmel committee and once<br />
again Queensland will be getting a bigger percentage increase than<br />
Australia as a whole. For primary and secondary schools we will be<br />
paying $ 26.3 million in 1973/ 74 an increase of 148% over the<br />
previous year ( for all States the increase is 144% from $ 74 million<br />
to $ 181.9 million). For tertiary education we will pay Queensland<br />
$ 47.9 million in 1973/ 74 an increase of 140% over the previous year. </p>
<p>6<br />
: We are taking several important initiatives in health,<br />
and welfare a grant of $ 250,000 in 1973/ 74 for site acauisition<br />
and planning of hospitals in Brishane, $ 2.3 million for co. mm.-unity<br />
health facilities, an estimated $ 1 million for school dental<br />
services. To help plan and develop new cities we are paying<br />
$ 4.4 million to Queensland in 1973/ 74 and we have orovided<br />
$ 3.1 million as a first contribution to Queensland to overcome<br />
the unsewered premises.<br />
Vie have moved quickly to improve your urban and country transport<br />
systems. As we see it, the area most urgently requiring attention is<br />
public transport. In Brisbane alone between 1960--61 and 1970.-71<br />
the number of passenger journeys on public transport fell by<br />
On a per capita basis the decline was even more diram-atic; it was<br />
just about halved. So in F] c-, ruary A, thues tralian Government approved<br />
a scheme to provide two-thirds. of the cos t of i~,' pvi-ngq urban publ. ic<br />
transport. In our first Budget an allocation of $ 3?. 00 million<br />
was made to commence this program. Tn Brisbane this year work will<br />
begin on the Merivale Street Bridge, electrification of the railway<br />
betw; Ueen Ferny Grove and Darra and construction of a third railway<br />
track on the northern corridor to Jorthgate.<br />
Our ex-enditure in this field will increase ranidly as these<br />
projects get fully underway and other projects are added.<br />
We have taken other action to improve your railways.<br />
I wrote to your Premier on 8 Feruary confirming the Australian<br />
Government's willingness to accept responsibility for your railway<br />
system, if the Queensland Government wished to offer it.<br />
Your Premier re quested more information on our initiative to help<br />
his Government decide. ' ihis information has been provided and I<br />
await Queensland's reply.<br />
Four of the other States have agreed to hold discussions<br />
to see if a mutually satisfactory basis for such a transfer<br />
of responsibility can be devised. In both South Australia and<br />
Western Australia these discussions are well advanced. For don't<br />
forget, there are three main benefits to Queensland if you were to<br />
accept our initiative. Your Government would be relieved of the<br />
heavy burden of capital debt and interest payments in respect of the<br />
railways. We would accept full responsibility for financing the<br />
urban railway projects I have mentioned. At present Queensland is<br />
required to provide one-third of the cost of these projects.<br />
And we would accept the responsibility of ensuring that the railway<br />
system in your State was efficient and provided the services<br />
you need. That is an account, by no means exhaustive, of the kind of help<br />
the Australian Government is providing. I have been in constant touch<br />
with Mr. Bjelke-Petersen on matters of mutual concern to us.<br />
Mind you, most of our dealings are conducted : y post; it is rare<br />
that we have dinner together. But I confess in all sincerity that<br />
I find it puzzling, disappointing, and not a little hurtful that the<br />
Australian Government's earnest and proven concern for Queensland<br />
is so often resented and mistrusted by your State Government. / 7 </p>
