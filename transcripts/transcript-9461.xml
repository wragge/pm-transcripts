PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
JAPAN EARTHQUAKE<br />
All Australians will have watched with sadness the tragedy unfolding in Japan<br />
following the powerful earthquake which struck the Kansai region in the early<br />
hours of 17 January.<br />
Soon after the earthquake I wrote to Prime Minister Murayama expressing our<br />
profound sympathy towards those affected by this disaster. The Japanese<br />
Government was also asked if Australia might be able to assist in some<br />
practical way.<br />
I am pleased to announce that the Australian Government will contribute to<br />
the relief effort by supplying about 200,000 litres of bottled Australian mineral<br />
water, valued at more than $ 150,000. The mineral water is already in Japan<br />
as part of a commercial shipment, and therefore is available for immediate<br />
distribution in the disaster area. We will also assist with some internal<br />
transport costs.<br />
The provision of fresh water to affected areas has been identified as a high<br />
priority by the Japanese emergency authorities.<br />
