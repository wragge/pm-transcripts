    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce the Australian Government will establish a scholarship program for senior public servants in the Pacific Islands to study at the Australia and New Zealand School of Government.</p>
<p>The Pacific Islands Scholarship for Governance will provide five recipients each year with the opportunity to work for three months in a relevant Australian government agency and then attend a three-week intensive residential course at the school.</p>
<p>I believe this combination of academic study and professional experience will provide a valuable training opportunity for senior public servants from Pacific Island nations.</p>
<p>The friendships recipients develop with their Australian and New Zealand colleagues will provide a network of support when they return to serve in their own countries.</p>
<p>For Australia it represents an investment in our region. Good governance is an essential ingredient to economic and political security.</p>
<p>Australia is committed to facing up to the challenges confronting the region and is taking a lead role in fostering cooperation between nations to advance the cause of good governance.</p>
