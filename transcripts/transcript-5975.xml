MEDIA RELEASE WAGES PAUSE: MEETING WITH THE ACTU<br />
( Statement by the Acting Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. J. D.<br />
Anthony, M. P.)<br />
Representatives of the Government and the ACTU met<br />
today in Canberra to discuss aspects of the Wages Pause<br />
agreed to at the Special Premiers Conference in Canberra.<br />
The ACTU was represented by the President, Mr Cliff<br />
Dolan, Senior Vice-President, Mr Charlie Fitzgibbon, Vice-<br />
President, Mr Simon Crean, Advocate, Ms Jan Marsh, and<br />
Assistant Secretaries Mr Bill Kelty, Mr Bill Richardson and<br />
Mr Bob Gradwell. With me representing the Government were the Treasurer,<br />
Mr Howard; the Defence Minister, Mr Sinclair; the Minister for<br />
National Development and Energy and Leader of the Government in<br />
the Senate, Senator Carrick; the Minister for Finance, Senator<br />
Guilfoyle; the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr Peacock;<br />
the Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney; and the<br />
Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. Mr Macphee.<br />
Our talks, which lasted for almost two hours, were<br />
marked by a friendly and constructive atmosphere and a shared<br />
concern about the current employment situation.<br />
The ACTU sought clarification of a number of details<br />
of the Wages Pause and related aspects of the Government's<br />
economic policies. There was frank and detailed discussion<br />
about all of the matters raised.<br />
Although no commitments were made, the Government is<br />
confident that the ACTU will be taking a constructive approach<br />
to the Wages Pause, and I personally welcome the . opportunity<br />
today's meeting provided to fully inform the ACTU on the measures<br />
agreed to by the Commonwealth and the Premiers.<br />
Today's talks were also a valuable lead-up to tomorrow's<br />
meeting of the National ] J1abour Consultative Council.<br />
