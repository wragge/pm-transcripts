    <content><![CDATA[<p>Revelations today that senior union figures tried to prevent discussion of Australia's low unemployment record at the International Labour Organisation meeting in Switzerland further defines the true purpose of the union bosses' opposition to the Government's workplace reforms.</p>
<p>It has everything to do with the pursuit of union power and nothing to do with the welfare of Australian workers.</p>
<p>What other conclusion can be drawn from this overt attempt by Sharan Burrow and the Australian Council of Trade Unions to conceal from the world the fact that unemployment is at a 32-year-low of 4.2 per cent?</p>
<p>The ACTU's attempt to prevent a Government representative from raising the unemployment statistics during the debate on Australia's workplace laws, and the subsequent attacks on Australia's reputation by union leaders, was a shameless attempt to whip up confected international condemnation of Australia.</p>
<p>Ms Burrow is clearly more interested in furthering the Labor Party's political agenda than engaging in a sensible debate about employment and workplace relations.</p>
<p>Despite these efforts, the ILO did not find that Australia's workplace laws breached any international conventions.</p>
<p>If the union movement was focussed on the welfare of Australia's workers they would be happy to proclaim the latest jobless rate. It should be the goal of the ACTU to ensure that as many Australians as possible have a job.</p>
<p>It is disappointing to all Australians that the union movement does not seek to work cooperatively with the business sector and the Government to help drive unemployment even lower.</p>
<p>Labor leader, Mr Kevin Rudd, should take Sharan Burrow and the ACTU to task for this latest attempt to deceive the world community and blacken Australia's international standing.</p>
<p>Australia's low unemployment record has benefited many Australians. It is a record we should all be proud of. </p>
