    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia Day is a time to celebrate our nation's past achievements.</p>
<p>And it's a time to embrace our nation's future.</p>
<p>This is a great country, rich in heritage and unlimited in its possibilities.</p>
<p>We should be deeply proud of our country.</p>
<p>Proud of Aboriginal culture, which represents the oldest continuing culture in human history.</p>
<p>Our explorers and our pioneers - brave men and women who settled this vast continent.</p>
<p>Our men and women in uniform who have given their lives and their service to defend Australia.</p>
<p>Our farmers, factory workers, business leaders; those who have fought for the rights of working families; our artists, our sporting heroes.</p>
<p>Our immigrants who have contributed so much to the diversity and vitality of Australia.</p>
<p>And then there is the family - the core and continuing unit of our society, which has underpinned so much of our national life together.</p>
<p>I am proud of this nation's past achievements.</p>
<p>And as Prime Minister, I am optimistic, supremely optimistic, about what our nation can achieve in the future.</p>
<p>As we look to the future our task is together is this, to build a modern Australia - an Australia capable of meeting the challenges that are being thrown at us for the future.</p>
<p>Because the challenges we face are great:</p>
<p>     * an uncertain economic outlook, globally</p>
<p>     * an increasingly competitive world, where we now face highly educated, highly trained, highly skilled workers right around the world;</p>
<p>     * new threats to our security;</p>
<p>     * unprecedented pressures on our health system,</p>
<p>     * our ageing population;</p>
<p>     * the great challenge of climate change;</p>
<p>     * and how to achieve effective reconciliation, so that we can all move forward together - Aboriginal and non Aboriginal Australia.</p>
<p>These challenges are great.</p>
<p>But as a country we have faced great challenges in the past.</p>
<p>And as a people, we have always prevailed.</p>
<p>We have prevailed because of the enduring set of values that have shaped us as a country.</p>
<p>Values of independence, values of freedom, of resilience, enterprise and hard work.</p>
<p>At the same time, values of looking out for one another, of mateship and compassion.</p>
<p>And the value of a fair go for all  -  that great Australian value.</p>
<p>These values remain the bedrock of our nation  -  they have forged our past and they will fortify our future.</p>
<p>As we go forward into the future we must draw on these values to build a modern Australia.</p>
<p>A modern Australia capable of meeting head on the challenges of the future.</p>
<p>A modern Australia secure, competitive, compassionate and creative - that becomes even more the envy of the entire world.</p>
<p>And why? Because in one country we are capable of combining two ideas: that working for ourselves and our families is not incompatible with working for our community and our country.</p>
<p>This is the great ethos that is Australia.</p>
<p>But the truth is we can only build a modern Australia by doing it together.</p>
<p>We must draw together the nation's talents, the nation's ideas, the nation's energies to imagine what the nation can still become.</p>
<p>Government is not the fountain of all knowledge.</p>
<p>If we are to build a modern Australia to face the challenges of the future we need to harness our best brains, our best ideas, all for the national good.</p>
<p>And that is what we must now do.</p>
<p>I am an optimist about Australia's future.</p>
<p>Let's together seize the opportunities that lie before us.</p>
<p>To realise Australia's potential as a nation  -  and the individual potential of every member of the Australian family.</p>
<p>Therese and I and our family would like to wish everyone a very happy and a very safe Australia Day 2008.</p>
