MEDIA RELEASE VISIT TO URANIUM AREAS IN THE NORTHERN TERRITORY<br />
Statement by the Acting Prime Minister, Minister<br />
for National Resources and Minister for Overseas<br />
Trade, the Rt. Hon. J. D. Anthony, M. P.<br />
.1I will be visiting the uranium areas in the Northern<br />
Territory at the weekend.<br />
Areas included in the visit will be Jabiru, Koongarra,<br />
Nabarlek and Jabiluka.<br />
Jabiru is the site of the Ranger deposit which is the<br />
subject of the current Inquiry by Mr Justice Fox. It is expected<br />
that the Inquiry's report will, however, cover matters which will<br />
be relevant to all future uranium mining operations in Australia.<br />
I am making a visit to the area to inform myself of the<br />
on-the-ground situation.<br />
The Government will, of course, await Mr Justice Fox's<br />
report before making any decisions in regard to uranium development,<br />
but I believe it will be useful for me to have some personal<br />
knowledge of the areas before the Government begins its consideration<br />
of the important questions involved.<br />
