    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Turnbull Government welcomes confirmation from the President of the United States that Australia will be exempt from its steel and aluminium tariffs.</p>
<p>The exemption reflects the fair and reciprocal trade relationship Australia shares with the United States and underpins the unbreakable friendship between our two great nations.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister, Minister Ciobo, Cabinet colleagues and Ambassador Joe Hockey have advocated for Australia’s interests at all levels of the Trump Administration.</p>
<p>This exemption supports both Australian and US jobs and will ensure our trade relationship continues to grow in a fair and reciprocal manner.</p>
<p>Australia knows where our steel comes from and where it goes, and will continue working with the US and our other trading partners to prevent practices such as dumping and transhipment.</p>
<p>The Turnbull Government will always stand up for Australia’s interests and Australian jobs.</p>
