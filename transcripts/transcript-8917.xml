STATIMNT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J ] KEATING XP<br />
PROPOSED METING OF APEC LM~ ERS IN1 SEATTLE<br />
Australia warmly welcomes the announcement by<br />
President Clinton in Tokyo today that he proposes hosting<br />
an APEC Leaders Economic Meeting in Seattle this<br />
November. it is intended that the meeting will discuss<br />
economic development and trade liberalisation in the<br />
Asia-Pacific region.<br />
In recent days, President Clinton has been consulting<br />
other APEC leaders about the proposed summit meeting.<br />
I have already written to him welcoming the proposal and<br />
pledging Australia's firm support. I advised him I will<br />
attend the leaders meeting if it goes ahead on the basis<br />
proposed. Australia believes the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation<br />
or APEC process offers an historic opportunity to promote<br />
the economic integration of the Asia-Pacific region in a<br />
way that serves the interests of all members and is<br />
compatible with a sound multilateral trading system.<br />
The current members of APEC are the United States,<br />
Canada, Japan, the Republic of Korea, China, Taiwan, Hong<br />
Kong, the six ASEAN countries, Australia and New Zealand.<br />
APEC economies account for half the world's output and<br />
per cent of world exports.<br />
Since 1989, an APEC Ministerial Meeting has been held on<br />
an annual basis to promote an agenda of economic<br />
cooperation anid trade liberalisation. This November, the<br />
annual Ministerial Meeting is scheduled to take place in<br />
Seattle and is expected to consider a trade and<br />
investment. -framework -agreement and an action agenda of<br />
trade-liberalising measures. Australia has been active<br />
in helping define an effective role and agenda for APEC.<br />
There were very positive reactions in Washington and<br />
other APEC capitals to the proposals set out in my speech<br />
of 8 February 1993 for APEC to take a lead in creating an<br />
Asia-Pacific economic community through measures such as<br />
the harmonisation of standards and trade and investment<br />
rules. Since April last year, Australia has advocated the<br />
establishment of a process of periodic meetings of APEC<br />
leaders to increase the statue and authority of APEC. </p>
<p>2<br />
We, 0 therefore, warmly welcome President Clinton-s<br />
invitation to attend an APEC Leaders Meeting in Seattle<br />
following the Ministerial Meeting. If the summit meeting<br />
goes ahead on the basis proposed, it will be the f irst<br />
step in an important process to ensure that APEC achieve.<br />
its great potential for economic integration in the<br />
Asia-Pacific region.<br />
