MARITIME COLLEGE SITE. CHOSEN<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that the main site of<br />
the-Australian Maritime College will be at Newnham, adjacent<br />
to the Launceston campus of the Tasmanian College of<br />
Advanced Education.<br />
Mr. Fraser said that the Maritime College's Interim<br />
Council had resolved, at its recent first meeting, to<br />
recommend this site. The Government had agreed with the<br />
choice which came as the culmination of substantial<br />
investigation by the Commonwealth, over a period of<br />
time, of a number of possible sites.<br />
The Prime Minister said he had already obtained an<br />
assurance from the Premier of Tasmania that, in the<br />
event of this site being chosen,. it would be presented<br />
as a gift to the Commonwealth by the Tasmanian Government.<br />
The Interim Council would now proceed with its planning<br />
of-the development of the site and of other necessary<br />
steps towards the establishment of the College. </p>
