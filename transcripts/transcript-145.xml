P. M. No. 49/ 1959<br />
DENIAL ON TROOPS FOR NORTH BORNEO<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. MenZies, this afternoon<br />
categorically denied a report published earlier today<br />
that he " is expected to announce earlS next year that<br />
Australian troops will be sent to North Borneo."<br />
Mr. Menzies said that no such proposal had been<br />

of its author.<br />
