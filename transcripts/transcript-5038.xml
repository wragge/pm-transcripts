PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 3 MAY 1979<br />
PRIME MINISTER ON TALK-BACK PROGRA DIE<br />
RADIO STATION 6VA, ALBANY, WVESTERN AUSTRALIA<br />
Question For several days now we have been promising you the opportunity<br />
of talking directly to the nation's leader, the Rt. Honourable<br />
the Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser. That moment has arrived.<br />
Our Prime Minister is with us in the studios right at this<br />
moment. Mr. Prime Minister, you may not be aware of it but this<br />
is an important occasion for us here at 6VA and our listeners<br />
so our welcome to you is a most sincere one. Welcome and it<br />
is great to have you here in Albany.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Thank you very much. It's very good to be here.<br />
Question Can I ask you first of all, is this the first time you have<br />
been to Albany or were you here as a Minister some years ago?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I was here as a Minister for Education some years ago. I think<br />
also once before that. It was quite a long while ago and I have<br />
been looking forward to coming back very much.<br />
Question I think the last time Albany was visited by a Prime Minister<br />
wvas on the occasion of-the unveiling of the Desert Mount<br />
( inaud) Memorial; the late Sir Robert Menzies was here.<br />
Do you recall that visit by Sir Robert?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I wasn't here, but I think I recall the occasion. There was a<br />
good deal of debate where this memorial was to be placed I think,<br />
wasn't there, in earlier times?<br />
Question Yes Prime Minister<br />
I was in the Parliament at the time of course and in the end<br />
I think the memorial was placed in a very fitting place.<br />
Question That brings us to Anzac Day of course, tomorrow. What are your<br />
own personal feelings about Anzac Day. It is the 64th anniversary.<br />
Should Australians be remembering or should we be forgetting? / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, we ought to be remembering. One of the things<br />
ANZACS fought for and people in world wars and other wars<br />
have fought for I think is I wasn't in the War, I was a kid<br />
during the last World War I think that most people would<br />
be saying ' I hope this doesn't have to happen again, I hope<br />
my sons won't be involved as I have been involved' and I think<br />
that would be the kind of thought in a serviceman's mind.<br />
I believe that we ought to remember. We ought to remember<br />
the debt that we owe those who have fought for freedom and<br />
liberty in Australia which is really fighting for the right<br />
of people to bring up their families in their own way and<br />
that is really what it is all about. We ought to remember on<br />
this one day a year, what many people did valiantly and<br />
I think we ought to try and commit ourselves a bit harder to<br />
work* to make sure that the same sorts of circumstances<br />
and need doesn't arise again.<br />
CALLER I am Peter Lomas and I am President of the Albany Voluntary<br />
Community Group, which has some 32 affiliated groups in the<br />
local area of membership and we recently conducted a survey<br />
as to the need for a family planning clinic in this town,<br />
to service the wide area of the great southern. This survey<br />
has shown that there is a real need and demand for such a<br />
facility. In fact these figures were 11 to 1 in favour of<br />
having one. We-have been told by t * he Perth-based Family<br />
Planning Association, who receive a Commonwealth funding for<br />
this purpose, that such funds for Albany are simply not<br />
available. As such a project is needed here, and as we would<br />
be serving such a large geographical area, have you, sir, any<br />
suggestions as to where we may get Government help in this<br />
matter and if not, could you please explain how this policy<br />
fits in with the Government's policy of decentralisation?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think there are two or three things there and let me try<br />
and deal with it separately. We all know that there has been<br />
difficulty in Government expenditure over the last two or three<br />
years because whatever we spend we have to take from you<br />
and many thousands of others like you, in taxes. Governments<br />
haven't got anything of their own, or politicians certainly<br />
haven't, when they are making political promises to spend.<br />
They are really saying we are gping to spend something that we<br />
have to take from the people of Albany, the people of Perth,<br />
the people of Melbourne and Sydney. There has been a need for<br />
restraint in expenditure... There has been a great desire for<br />
lower taxes. I think this has also been necessary for the<br />
general health of the economy in Australia. Family planning<br />
is important and I am interested to know the results of the<br />
survey that you've undertaken. What I would like to do is to<br />
see how the priorities are set in Western Australia. I will talk<br />
to Peter Drummond, who is in the studio with me at the moment,<br />
about this and what I would like to do perhaps is to be able<br />
to get your name and address get that written down so that<br />
either I or Peter Drummond can write to you a little later<br />
about it. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
CALLER I wish to pass on my congratulations in Western Australia.<br />
We follow as much as we cani what you are doing on the other<br />
part of the continent. We know that you have some very<br />
difficult situations to get through and we appreciate some<br />
of what you are doing. What I have to ask is this: you<br />
remember the census that you had in July 1976 on population<br />
and housing. Now, I have nothing against you people, but as<br />
it happened, because of certain happenings, I refused to answer<br />
a single word in the census. Now, sir, according to law<br />
anyone that has not completed the census are supposed to<br />
be prosecuted and fined. Here is 1979 now and I am still<br />
awaiting a summons as to the reason why I have not filled in<br />
the paper. As I say, I have nothing against your party<br />
but ( inaudible) in this?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Can I ask you a question, do you want a summons?<br />
CALLER<br />
The thing is this for the sake of population, put it that<br />
way all the better, as far as I go. But of course, again,<br />
there must be others who have failed to fill in their forms<br />
and if I am pulled over the coals then the others should also.<br />
But I am certainly looking forward, if it comes to that, to<br />
ask the reason as to why I deliberately failed to<br />
I have said before, congratulations in what you are doing, but<br />
there is a certain, if I may use the word, strategy in the<br />
refusal of what I did.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I would say two things; I would like to thank you very much<br />
for what you have said about the Government and what the<br />
Government is trying to do. In relation to the census I think<br />
there has been a feeling that the Bureau of Statistics has<br />
been asking more and more questions, going more and more into<br />
matters which some people have regarded as personal and private<br />
to them. I think there has been an objection to that.<br />
In past censuses the Government has looked at the form and it<br />
has ultimately approved it. But what we have determined in<br />
relation to the next census is that there should be public<br />
communication, public discussion, about the nature of the<br />
questions and the sorts of questions so that they can be<br />
a community input into the census and therefore maybe a better<br />
understanding of the purposes that-the census is meant to fulfill.<br />
I don't know if that gets to the cause of your particular...<br />
CALLER<br />
Not at all. I heartily agree with the census of population, 3<br />
housing, Australia. I heartily agree with that. As I say,<br />
there is a certain reason I wanted to know why I hadn't been<br />
pulled over the coals. 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I'd have to make some enquiries about that so I would need<br />
you name and address, again, and I could try and find out why<br />
that hasn't happened. Again, either I or Peter Drummond could<br />
let you know.<br />
CALLER I have experience in both parts of the world in various<br />
miatters... Birthday calls on programme.<br />
CALLER First of all Mr. Prime Minister,, welcome to Albany and I hope<br />
you have a very pleasant stay here. I am a Member of the<br />
Samaratin Telephone Service in this area and I also speak<br />
on behalf of the Albany Voluntary Community Group.<br />
I know your interest in what I am going to have to say.<br />
Our work makes us increasingly aware of the very real need<br />
for a Government funded and operated accommodation centre,<br />
both short and long term, for people with emotional disorders.<br />
That ranges through alcoholics, drug addicts, potential<br />
suicides, women in need of a refuge and homeless youngsters.<br />
Funds have been allocated in the past for any of these project<br />
-have rarely flowed beyond -the metropolitan area. Albany is<br />
a large community with a wide landward area and we should nolonger<br />
have to say to a caller ' you must go 250 miles for<br />
the accomodation and treatment you need'.~ Can you make some<br />
comments on that or how we can possibly get some action in<br />
this area.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think two things; we do try and get services out into<br />
remote areas.. Albany is not really a remote area in the sense<br />
that many parts of Western Australia are remote, but we do try<br />
and get the best possible services available over major<br />
decentralised areas throughout Australia. It depends on, I<br />
suppose, demand, and again how much money we've got to spend<br />
as to how far you can go with that. Again, I would like to do<br />
what I indicated in relation to an earlier question. I will<br />
discuss this with Peter Drummnond who is in the studio with me.<br />
We will make some inquiries as to how priorities are set in<br />
Western Australia and either Peter or myself will drop you a<br />
note about it a little later on. But when I have said this<br />
on a couple of occasions.,. I hope the.. radio station is taking<br />
the names.<br />
Question It seems that there are a number of people who have items of<br />
concern, but I'm wondering just how a man in your position,<br />
how aware can you be of the difficulties facing a small town,<br />
or a relatively small town such as our. Does it ever come<br />
across your table that there are a lot of small towns in<br />
this country and the problems that they have. </p>
<p>Prime Minister<br />
It does every day of the week because I represent an<br />
electorate, Wannon; it is a country electorate in<br />
Western Victoria. I won it from the Labor Party and they had<br />
held it for the previous 13 years and through most of its<br />
history in Federal life. Whether it is a safe Liberal seat<br />
now or not I don't know, but I have held it for the last<br />
24 or 25 years. There are towns there of 200 or 300. Some<br />
towns of 20 or 30, 10,9000, 15,000, 20,000, 25,000. I still<br />
regard my job as a local representative, as in a sense, a<br />
first duty in politics. I advertise that I am going to be<br />
in Hamilton at 9: 00 o'clock in the morning and people with their<br />
problems come along and see me, whatever they might be.<br />
I have a very large electoral correspondence. In this way,<br />
quite apart from other occasions coming to. Albany, Bunbury<br />
earlier today people tell you what their problems are, their<br />
concerns are, their fears are. In these ways you do keep in<br />
touch. Maybe if that doesn't make you conscious of the<br />
concerns of people then the representations of Members like<br />
Peter Drummond certainly does because they come along and say<br />
" look, my people are worried this, or concerned about that".<br />
The image of politicians shut away in Canberra,' not knowing<br />
what goes on, I don't really think is valid in many cases<br />
because we are out and about. A week doesn't pass when I'm<br />
not in some part of Australia speaking to some real Australians.<br />
CALLER Ken Bruce. One query I have. We had this I forget what<br />
you call it cost of living index rise. This, I presume,<br />
accounts for the cost of living in the previous six months.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Three months. It comes out every quarter.<br />
CALLER Every quarter, yes. That's right. Well how come, how does it<br />
arise that we then get price rises to compensate for the wage<br />
increase? Prime Minister<br />
This is the old chicken and the eg-g argument. What comes first.<br />
If wages go up too much prices plainly have to go up. Raw<br />
material prices can go up. Over the last year beef prices<br />
have plainly gone up. That affects the price of meat in the<br />
supermarkets. It does affect a lot of manufactured products,<br />
food processed products. The price of oil has gone up because<br />
we had to move to a world parity pricing for oil and that flows<br />
through into a number of areas in different industries.<br />
transport and power industries in some areas. What we have<br />
is a Prices Justification Tribunal that does watch prices in<br />
that area and makes recommendations. There are some amendments<br />
to the Act which I think will make the Tribunal more effective<br />
and more flexible and it will be getting a reference to cover<br />
all those areas affected or that have an impact on the Consumer<br />
6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
Price Index. In other words, that are important to people<br />
in their daily living. In many senses the Prices Tribunal<br />
is the umpire for the areas which it has under reference,<br />
just as the Arbitration Commission is the umpire in the wages<br />
area. These things need to be kept in balance. I am just<br />
as much opposed to companies putting up prices too much as I<br />
am opposed to trade unionists who sometimes demand too much<br />
in a wage increase, because both are damaging to the economy.<br />
CALLER I am inclined to agree with that, but it seems as though if we<br />
put up the wages sort of thing to compensate for the previous<br />
price rise in materials, etc. and then as soon as the wages go<br />
up again they turn around and put them up again to compensate<br />
for the wages, which doesn't seem<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Thi~ s is where it all ought to stop, and if we could go for a<br />
year with no wage increases...<br />
CALLER And no price increases<br />
Prime Minister<br />
And to the maximum extent possible no price-increases, we would<br />
knock the biggest hole in inflation that there ever was.<br />
But you can't impose I think by some statute or some law.<br />
The Federal Parliament hasn't the power anyway. But countries<br />
where the Governments do have the constitutional power to do<br />
that it hasn't really worked. They might have held things down<br />
for a while but it's a bit like a kettle on a gas ring. You<br />
can keep the lid on it for a while but if it is boiling away<br />
the pressure builds up and at the end of the time countries<br />
that have tried that sort of statutory price control have found<br />
that it has been impossible to maintain and after the controls<br />
were off the price increases were very great. One of the things<br />
that is most important in this for all of us is restraint by<br />
all of us. Somebody said that if we all got paid according to<br />
our own judgement of what we are worth, we would send the country<br />
bankrupt. So we all have to take a bit less than maybe we think<br />
we ought to get.<br />
CALLER I rang to say I am very proud to see that you are here<br />
and that if a lot of people in the Albany areas were to have<br />
so much confidence in you and Mr. Drummond, Mr. Knight and our<br />
local representative, I think that this world would be a lot<br />
better to deal with.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I am delighted that you rang. So often people ring up and they<br />
throw some bricks, or whatever, or try to, it's very nice for<br />
7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
somebody who has some kind thoughts to express to ring up.<br />
CALLER Mr. Prime Minister, if they throw bricks at you I would be<br />
your bodyguard sir.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Sometimes I catch them and throw them back.<br />
CALLER Mr. Knight and the rest of our representatives. It is<br />
great to have you here, sir and I hope that everybody will<br />
listen to you and try to get us where you are trying to head.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The thing I like most about what you said is the respect<br />
you obviously have for your local State representatives and<br />
also for Peter Drummond, who does a very great job in Canberra,<br />
because in one sense even if you don't think much of me so long<br />
as you think a lot of Peter Drummond as a local representative<br />
that is really the important thing. He is the guy that I<br />
hope people are going to go on voting for.<br />
CALLER I think Mr. Drummond would know me. I'm very very proud to<br />
know him, you sir, and our local representative.<br />
Question I don't know. Talking about some people throwing stones, I<br />
suppose, and I am surprised that somebody hasn't already thrown<br />
this stone regarding the whaling issue. I guess it's up to<br />
me,, Mr. Prime Minister, to ask you for your own personal<br />
appraisal of what the cessation of whaling in Australia has done<br />
for the nation. Has it been worth the price that Albany has paid.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The Government's decision in relation to the Frost Inquiry was<br />
in one sense made easier by the earlier economic decision of<br />
Cheynes Beach Whaling to shut down. I know the companies tried<br />
to-say that the-very fact that an inquiry was-being held made<br />
it difficult for it to market its product. I find that a<br />
little difficult to accept. I don't think that's valid. If<br />
it was the Inquiry I think they would have kept going and waited<br />
until the inquiry had reported and maybe waited until the<br />
Government was making a decision about it. But because the<br />
company had just down, as we believe for economic reasons,<br />
not related to the inquiry, when we came to make decisions on<br />
the Frost Report itself. It was in fact a much easier decision<br />
than it would otherwise have been, simply because the activity<br />
had ceased so far as Australia is concerned. / 8 </p>
<p>8-<br />
Question H-ave you had that feedback internationally, from other<br />
countries. Prime Minister<br />
We've had a feedback from a large number of people around the<br />
world. I was speaking with Sir Peter Scott, who is I don't<br />
know if you know of the World Wildlife Fund but it is probably<br />
the most responsible conservation body worldwide. It doesn't<br />
politicise. It doesn't get out and play politics with<br />
environmental issues. It is now established in Australia and<br />
has been operating here over the last, or seeking to get<br />
established, over the last two years. It's got a very eminent<br />
group of people in charge of it. Peter Scott comes out from<br />
time to time from Britian to keep in touch, because it is a<br />
worldwide organisation. I know, in that environment, there is<br />
a very great respect and hope for the decision that Australia<br />
has in fact taken. We haven't had any objections on economic<br />
grounds from other countries, from those that are continuing<br />
to operate in whaling. Indeed, I would believe that they are<br />
already starting to make moves towards the general worldwide<br />
phasing out of whaling and in the international environment<br />
Australia's voice Iwill now be directed to that end. These<br />
things are very difficult when there is an economic activity<br />
that has been important to a country community. We would have<br />
been faced with very difficult decis ions if the whaling company<br />
had still be operating. But it hadn't and on our judgement of<br />
the facts it has stopped for genuine economic reasons, quite<br />
unrelated to the inquiry itself.<br />
Question Can I ask how well-informed you were at the time that the<br />
inquiry was sitting in Albany. Were you personally aware of<br />
the situation as it was developing day by day?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, not in front of the inquiry. You have to get people to do<br />
a job, then you look at their report. I am afraid that with<br />
all the things that have to come over my desk, I can't keep<br />
in daily touch with the actual conduct of a particular<br />
inquiry, although if there are major or significant problems with<br />
the way a particular tribunal inquiry is operating, that gets<br />
reported and you soon hear about that.<br />
Question-I should have asked you this question right at the beginning<br />
because I think a lot of people in the town and the area<br />
generally are feeling that perhaps when the Prime Minister comes<br />
to Albany he might have some glad tidings for us, some good news.<br />
Do you have any such good news for us sir? 9 </p>
<p>-9-<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think there is good news, but it is not in the form of<br />
I have come here like Father Christmas. Australia is looking<br />
up, the future is looking much brighter. The rural community<br />
is happier I think than it has been for a long while. Beef and<br />
sheep and wheat have all had a good year. From a look at<br />
the countryside flying in it has rained so there has been<br />
an autumn break around here. I really do believe that with<br />
inflation down and costs much more under control, with the<br />
way we have worked over the last three years to develop and<br />
protect markets for beef and rural products in the United<br />
States and Japan, and I think we will even have some limited<br />
success into Europe, I think the future is much more assured.<br />
In 1974 when beef prices really crashed, down to disaster<br />
levels and they stayed very low since except-for the last year,<br />
we built up to 100,000 tonnes into Japan and then they suddenly<br />
said no beef this year. Obviously that was disaster news for<br />
Australian producers in large parts of Australia. With the<br />
trade negotations and the trade agreements that we will have<br />
I think our markets are going to be secured in a way that they<br />
haven't ever been for Australia's agricultural exports. I am<br />
not going to say that farmers have never had it so good, because<br />
somebody else said that once and it wasn't really so. But I do<br />
think it is looking up. I think we have a right to expect,<br />
provided the seasons are reasonably kind, that the next year<br />
or so are going to enable farmers to re-build their reserves<br />
and assets a bit. That's not just farmers you are talking about<br />
when you are saying that, because it obviously has an impact<br />
on country towns, farmers are buying more equipment, they are<br />
repairing their properties, they are buying new machinery.<br />
So it has impact on country towns and on the industries that<br />
service the rural community. If I am bringing any sort of a<br />
message to Albany, it's one of confidence; confidence in this<br />
part of a very very great State and enormous confidence in<br />
the 1980s and in what Australia can achieve.<br />
CALLER I have a question for the Prime Minister. I was going to ask<br />
whether he has any thoughts about youth unemployment. The<br />
high. level of the young people leaving ( inaudible) lack of<br />
jobs. Prime Minister<br />
Yes I have. This is a difficult problem for a -number of young<br />
people. I think we need to understand that it is not the whole<br />
group that is in difficulty, it is maybe 10% or 12% of a<br />
particular age group, people that perhaps haven't done so well<br />
at school, might be a bit diffident, might be a bit uncertain<br />
of themselves. The training programmes that we have developed<br />
are designed to try and assist such people, to give them an<br />
opportunity to get into work. Something over 400,000 people,<br />
many of them young people, have been helped by the Government's<br />
training programmes over the last two to three years. I also<br />
believe that for that section of each age group that does find<br />
it difficult to get work that schools can pay more attention </p>
<p>10<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
in their own training because so often schools pay a lot of<br />
attention to those that are academically bright, that are going<br />
to go on to universities and colleges and this is good for<br />
the schools reputation we've got such a percentate of our<br />
kids going to university or college and they are all doing<br />
well, but what about the ones that don't go to university or<br />
college that want a different kind of future, that want to<br />
go ' into a apprenticeship or a trade or something else. I am<br />
not at all sure that in recent times our school system hasn't<br />
concentrated too much on the academic qualifications and hasn't<br />
sought to draw out and build a confidence in kids that mightn't<br />
be so bright academically but might have many other talents<br />
which are quite as valuable but they are different talents.<br />
What I am saying is there is a problem. I think many people<br />
can contribute to trying to solve it, but the better economic<br />
future which we are now facing is also of course going to make<br />
sure that more jobs are available. The problems aren't all<br />
going to disappear overnight. I don't want to suggest that<br />
because there are so many that are tending to disappear. You<br />
used to have people look after petrol bowsers. Now they tend<br />
to be automatic or self-serve. So a job disappears. That I<br />
think just means that we've got to pay more attention at school<br />
and after school and to the transition into work to try and<br />
help people that are finding it a bit difficult.<br />
