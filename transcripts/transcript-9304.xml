TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE WITH THE HON PETER BALDWIN MP<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, THURSDAY, 4 AUGUST 1994<br />
E &amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PMV: Well, thank you very much for coming. This is a, quite a proud<br />
moment for the Government in honouring yet another election<br />
commitment. I'm pleased and proud today, with my colleague Peter<br />
Baldwin, to officiate at the start of what's going to be a large change to<br />
income support in this country. And that is, with-the Home Child Care<br />
Allowance, which is a substantial reform and one which will now<br />
funnel, I think, transfer a $ 1000m from the budget and from what was<br />
formerly the Dependent Spouse Rebate, to the daily carer of the<br />
children usually the mother. So, that's to say, there's about $ 1 b<br />
transfer from the wallet to the purse, and it's important to appreciate<br />
that this is not all. All of this new payment includes $ 230m which the<br />
Government has added additionally to the old Dependent Spouse<br />
Rebate to make the Home Child Care Allowance a more progressive,<br />
responsive payment. It means we will, for the first time, have built a<br />
system of payments, in the main to mothers, directly to their bank<br />
accounts upon which other changes can be built. And, as you know,<br />
the Government is also contemplating has announced, in fact the<br />
parenting allowance which will be built on the same administrative<br />
system. Now, there's also an improvement in the way the allowance worked,<br />
compared to the DSR and my colleague Peter Baldwin will go into<br />
that in a moment but it will mean that up to 120,000 more families will<br />
be assisted by the new measure. And there is, I think, 55,000 families<br />
who will be eligible for the Home Child Care Allowance who were<br />
ineligible for the Dependent Spouse Rebate. So, 55,000 families who<br />
were ineligible for the Dependent Spouse Rebate will get the Home<br />
Child Care Allowance, and up to 120,000 more families will be assisted<br />
because of the new income test. </p>
<p>The general point in all this is, of course, is that the Government has<br />
delivered mightily in income support to Australian families. In the<br />
period when the coalition was in office, the real value of family<br />
payments for low income families in particular, fell by more than 2%.<br />
Under this Government, we've given large real increases over 30%<br />
in payments for low income families and let me give an example: a low<br />
income family with two children now receive $ 153 per week. We've of<br />
course indexed all family payments for the first time and we deliver<br />
payments directly into the hands of carers. And this means that under<br />
this Government nearly $ 6b has been transferred to carers, usually of<br />
course, mothers.<br />
And of course, we're committed to doing more, and in the context of<br />
the recent Accord negotiations, I announced the new maternity<br />
allowance for women who are not entitled to paid maternity leave. So,<br />
there's an important social change here. A set of payments directly<br />
a week directly paid to the carer at home, usually the mother,<br />
and this will be apart from the value of the income support it will be<br />
a step forward in developing a new payment system and a new<br />
relationship between the Commonwealth and carers, usually mothers,<br />
in this country. Now, I'd like you to see the advertisement which is a<br />
simple one. We're now going to run it for you, I think probably one or<br />
two times, and then I'll invite Peter Baldwin to say a few words, too.<br />
Thank you.<br />
( advertisement shown)<br />
PM: Well, I invite Peter Baldwin now to add to my remarks.<br />
PB: Thank you, and this, the Home Child Care Allowance is yet another<br />
major structural reform to the system of assistance provided by<br />
government to families with children. If you look at what's happened<br />
over the past few years, there has been a major effort in this area by<br />
the Government. We've seen the introduction of additional family<br />
payment and it's very substantial real increase over a period of years,<br />
and if you look at that part of the assistance to families there is a huge<br />
improvement. This payment takes that a step further by replacing the<br />
old with child rate of Dependent Spouse Rebate. It increases the<br />
amount of assistance available and there will be about 840,000<br />
families that will benefit from that somewhat increased level of<br />
assistance for each.<br />
But more significantly, I think, the payment is made directly to the<br />
carer, as the PM said. And furthermore, there are about 55,000 low<br />
income families that don't have a sufficient taxable income to benefit<br />
fully from a tax rebate who will be on average, some $ 20 a week better<br />
off as a result of this payment. It's also the case that it's a much more<br />
flexible arrangement whereby a partner who might come in and out of </p>
<p>the workforce, say that the child is sick for a number of months and a<br />
person needs to leave the workforce, they can go right straight back<br />
onto this payment rather than having to wait for the end of the financial<br />
year and reconciliation through the tax process.<br />
So, in those respects it is a major improvement. It does represent a<br />
net significant addition by the Commonwealth in spending on<br />
assistance for families. It's worth around $ 230 million a year more<br />
than the old Dependent Spouse Rebate and a lot of that expense is<br />
because, as I said, those low income families that couldn't benefit fully<br />
from the Dependent Spouse Rebate will gain significantly from this. If<br />
you look at the totality of assistance to families now, it is very<br />
significant particularly that targeted assistance to low income families<br />
where a low income couple with a couple of dependent children in<br />
aggregate can end up with around about $ 150 a week in extra support<br />
provided by the Commonwealth.<br />
So, it is very significant. It is not the end of our agenda in this whole<br />
area of assistance to families. In the White Paper we announced from<br />
July next year we will be paying the new Parenting Allowance which,<br />
as well as overcoming some significant disincentive effects to people<br />
joining the workforce, we will also provide significant additional income<br />
to low income working households up to $ 130 a week through the<br />
Parenting Allowance. When the Parenting Allowance is introduced the<br />
Home Childcare Allowance will be integrated into it. So, what we are<br />
calling at this point, the Home Childcare Allowance, will in effect be the<br />
base level of the Parenting Allowance that will be free of any income<br />
test on the partners income and it will also be nontaxable.<br />
So, as from July next year, significant further boost through the<br />
Parenting Allowance which will then subsume and integrate the Home<br />
Childcare Allowance. Put all that together and it is a very major<br />
agenda and in addition to that, of course as the Prime Minister has<br />
said, we are intending to look at a maternity allowance type payment<br />
as well.<br />
It is a very major effort in this whole area of assistance to families. We<br />
pay enormous attention to equity in the structure of these things, which<br />
I might say, is a sharp contrast with the Coalition. Every proposal that<br />
has surfaced from them whether it be income splitting, whether it be<br />
lumping together all the child payments and childcare assistance and<br />
splitting it up on a per capita basis means significantly dramatically<br />
lower levels of assistance to low income families and additional<br />
assistance to families with incomes over $ 100,000. In vertical equity<br />
terms there is simply no comparison between our approach to this<br />
issue and that of the Coalition party. So, I think this should be<br />
recognised for the major reform it is. We are exceeding our election<br />
commitments in this area. This is a more costly package than the one </p>
<p>we described during the election campaign and, I think, that is another<br />
important point that needs to be recognised. Thank you very much.<br />
PM: I think we would be happy to take a few questions if you would like.<br />
J: Mr Keating, the Catholic Bishops have accused your Government of<br />
using women as guinea pigs in the tests on the contraceptive drug<br />
RU486 and say they are going to take their fight directly to you. How<br />
do you respond to that?<br />
PM: Well, I am in receipt of no approach by the Catholic Bishops at this<br />
point. They may approach me, but as I understand it the drug trails<br />
will be conducted in accordance with proper procedures and in the<br />
informed consent documentation has been complied with under the<br />
rules of the National Health and Medical Research Council. Anyway,<br />
I'll wait and see what the Bishops have to say.<br />
J: It could be assumed Prime Minister, that the Bishops are targeting you<br />
on this issue because of your Catholic background. Are you entirely<br />
happy with the testing?<br />
PM: I'm not here to be debating that principally, but this.<br />
J: Prime Minister, on another issue, Alexander Downer says that you<br />
haven't visited Aboriginal communities and he has thrown out a<br />
challenge for you to follow his footsteps.<br />
PM: What? Visit them and take their land while I'm at it. Is that the idea? I<br />
should visit while I announce they are going to repeal the Native Title<br />
legislation. We saw Dr Hewson visit them in that sham a year or so<br />
ago when the Aboriginal people of this country opened their hearts<br />
and their hospitality to him and when we brought the Bill into the<br />
House of Representatives to pass it, he said ' it was a day of shame'.<br />
A day of shame. And, can I just say, yesterday when Alexander<br />
Downer was credited with softening his stand on this he said ' 1 have<br />
said that if we have to, we will repeal the legislation and put new<br />
legislation in place, but let's just see how things pan out.' In other<br />
words, he will repeal the Native Title Act and the Liberals will put a<br />
new Native Title Act in place. That's softening his stand. Well, if that<br />
is a softer stand, I mean, the thing he might tell us is what he is going<br />
to tell the Western Australian Liberals next time he visits there.<br />
J: How far are you prepared to go in terms of modifying the legislation to<br />
meet the concerns of Justice French and also of the NFF and the<br />
miners?<br />
PM: Well, the Government has always been, I think, very sensible about<br />
the Native Title Act. I mean, it was a complex piece of property and<br />
cultural law that was written from a clean sheet of paper, developing a </p>
<p>very large body of legislation and we've always said that at some point<br />
in time as we see the Act operate there may be cause for remedial<br />
changes and the person we would take advice from in this, of course,<br />
is the Mr Justice French amongst others.<br />
J: Mr Keating, do you think the Childcare Allowance is part of a wide<br />
stream of family assistance the Government seems to have brought on<br />
tap over the last few years. Can you explain the rationale for the<br />
continuation of large funding into the family groups particularly when<br />
quite a lot of it is unmeans tested<br />
PM: Well, I don't think that much of it is unmeans tested. The very large<br />
payments, I think, something like $ 3.6 billion which is the additional<br />
family payment or the old Family Allowance Supplement has a very<br />
tight means test about it. The whole point of it was to deliver very<br />
strong payments, but within a defined income range. And then, of<br />
course, the basic family payment or the old Family Allowance is<br />
income tested because the DSR was non-income tested, it's being<br />
paid across the board at $ 30 a week, but the basic structure of the<br />
payments has been they are income tested therefore the Government<br />
is capable of delivering much greater amounts to particular categories<br />
of families. And that is, I think, one of its strengths. It's one of the<br />
points that Peter made a moment ago about the equity in the system of<br />
family payments under the Government under the Labor Party has<br />
been to basically to help those who need the help most.<br />
J: So, what do you have to say then to the suggestions from people like<br />
Peter Walsh that the tendency in the growth of welfare payments that<br />
will have implications for the tax base downstream, that the tax base is<br />
simply too narrow to sustain the..<br />
PM: I don't I mean, Peter might want to add some words to this. What<br />
the Government has done over, now, a decade is to dramatically<br />
change the priorities of former governments in their spending and<br />
direct it to where we thought the priorities might best lie. And, quite a<br />
deal of this has gone into targeted social security and family payments.<br />
But, I don't see any demographic trend which is going to change this<br />
other than, of course, with the aged pension which, of course, is<br />
income tested and asset tested and for which we now have<br />
occupational superannuation. So, the notion that we have got a set of<br />
payments that are going to put up some inordinate pressure on the<br />
Budget, I think, is wrong. I don't know whether you want to add to that<br />
Peter.<br />
PB: Well, just by way of addition, there have been a number of studies<br />
done of the impact of the changes that have been made in the social<br />
security system over the past decade and there is not the slightest<br />
doubt that we now have a more efficient and effective instrument for </p>
<p>poverty alleviation than we did at the start. We have around about<br />
per cent in net terms, when you take account of tax clawbacks of social<br />
security payments, now going to people who would otherwise be in<br />
poverty. It is a very carefully targeted scheme and it has become a lot<br />
more targeted over the past decade with the result that we do have the<br />
resources to raise the real level of assistance to those who actually<br />
need it.<br />
J: But, you would have to concede though with this home childcare<br />
allowance there is no benefit to equity or to income redistribution?<br />
PB: What we are doing with the home childcare allowance is replacing the<br />
old Dependent Spouse rebate which was seen as, if you like, a<br />
horizontal equity measure rather than a vertical equity measure. It was<br />
seen as being something there to recognise the additional costs to<br />
families irrespective of their overall income of having children. So, it is<br />
bringing across into the outlays side the Social Security side a<br />
measure that has a strong horizontal rather than a vertical equity<br />
dimension. But, you can't look at that in isolation. You have to look at<br />
the totality of what we're doing and, as the PM said, the great bulk of<br />
our payments are highly targeted with a strong vertical equity aspect to<br />
them. They are focussed on the low income families, but this as the<br />
DSR it replaces is part of the rationale is a horizontal equity one.<br />
J: But, on the revenue side, you've got the customs base coming down..<br />
PM: Look, Tom ( Burton) we are not here to go through the Budget. Surely<br />
you are not saying at a launch like this we ought to have a discussion<br />
about budgetary trends on the revenue and outlay side.<br />
TB: I'm just trying to explore what's the durability of this sort of round,<br />
talking in the general funding..<br />
PM: Well, it's paid as the Dependent Spouse Rebate. It was there anyway,<br />
but for the $ 230 million we've added to it. But, the important point is,<br />
it's paid directly to, in the main, the mothers and that is part of the<br />
reform. There is a transfer here within families and it's going to the<br />
ones who need it most obviously and that's mothers. But, you know, to<br />
beg the question then about I mean, I know you are short of things<br />
for the column, but I mean, to get us here for 20 minutes talking about<br />
the the state of the budget.<br />
J: One area of child care that has been identified as being deficient is<br />
long term day care places for babies and younger infants. What is the<br />
Government doing on that one?<br />
PM: Well, we have extended apart from the building of long day care<br />
places we've also extended to the private sector, encouraged the<br />
private sector, to be in the child care business. And, that's where we </p>
<p>are going to see the substantial addition to places. There has been an<br />
absolute explosion in places for child care under this government, and<br />
after school care. And, of course, we have later in this financial year<br />
the generalised child care rebate which you might see in a similar<br />
presentation.<br />
J: Is the aim to increase kids... ( inaudible)?<br />
PM: Well, I think we're now into column space. Is there<br />
J: I think, perhaps, Tom's point is, we've had a tax cut war on both sides<br />
of politics, driven the tax base down, now we seem to have a lot written<br />
about both sides competing for the family...<br />
PM: That's wrong, that's wrong. What has, in recent times, driven the tax<br />
base down, was the decline in economic growth. The notion that<br />
you've got to hang on to fiscal drag to actually lift the tax and if you<br />
give it back, you're in some way driving the tax base down, is for those<br />
who want the biggest possible surpluses and the lowest possible<br />
deficits in any circumstances. A group, I can say, well represented in<br />
this room, today.<br />
J: My attendant question is, is the family going to be a policy<br />
battleground for the next election and are you planning more initiatives<br />
for families?<br />
PM: Well, let me just say this, the Government now, over a decade, has<br />
carefully, studiously put into place enormous, equitable, beneficial<br />
changes for families. The most obvious being the additional family<br />
payment which is running at $ 3.6 billion. And, as well as that, of<br />
course, there has been rent assistance and there are other things<br />
which go to families. There is Medicare, there are a whole lot of things<br />
which affect families other than direct payments. And, of course, there<br />
have been the tax cuts which have gone, the great bulk of them, to low<br />
income earners. When the Government was elected in 1983 the<br />
bottom rate of tax was 30 per cent. It is now 20 per cent. And the tax<br />
free threshold is greater. So, for families, there has been an equitable<br />
shift of income to low and middle income families and the last tax cuts<br />
were directed towards middle incomes. That's knocking the rate down<br />
to $ 20,500.<br />
So, the government has now, over a decade, put in steps, one after the<br />
other, into building blocks, to build a system of payments to families<br />
with particular focus on vertical equity. Now, this is another such<br />
building block reform. This sets up a system of payments directly in a<br />
linkage between the Commonwealth and the carers, mostly mothers.<br />
We're not doing it because the Liberal Party have another idea about<br />
how they could sneak their way back into office. It is being done, and<br />
it has been done over a decade, consistently, with a view to equity. </p>
<p>We're not responding to a set of poll driven things in research as the<br />
Liberal Party does in its tax cut policies of the past and as it may<br />
well be doing, now. The fact is, it should be obvious to everyone,<br />
particularly everyone covering public life in this country who is in this<br />
room today, that this has been on now, for a very long period of time.<br />
We committed ourselves to the family allowance supplement, as it was<br />
then called, in 1987, the 1987 election. And we introduced it in 1988.<br />
J: Mr Keating, what do you think of the States' attempt to reassert<br />
themselves in the federation, the new federation document they put<br />
out on Friday?<br />
PM: This will be a useful discussion at COAG. COAG has become quite a<br />
useful body, I think, for progressing non-financial matters. And, ahead<br />
of each one of these meetings there is a certain, you know, ritual<br />
like the dance of the brolgas, everyone is out there doing their<br />
particular dance and theirs came out last week.<br />
J: What's going to be the biggest test? Is it going to be the rights and<br />
responsibilities, is that going to be the real stumbling block or is it<br />
simply the question of money, how big a bribe you have to pay?<br />
PM: I think the Commonwealth-State relationship is a complex one,<br />
particularly as the Commonwealth is now quite heavily engaged and<br />
involved in micro-economic change and getting the states to the<br />
barrier on micro-economic reform. And, also seeing, as I think we<br />
believe, that the delivery of programs is best accomplished when there<br />
is particularly in the social area when there is a unanimity of view<br />
between the Commonwealth and the states about how that might best<br />
be done. Now, in working through these program reviews, as we have<br />
been in functional areas like health and community services and<br />
housing, we are making, I think, a lot of progress. And, we are getting<br />
better program delivery for the people who are to receive the programs<br />
while, at the same time, overlaying that is a discussion about the<br />
states' authorities and their efficiency, and competition policy. So, it is<br />
a complex set of interrelationships and that is the point of the<br />
discussion and the point of the meeting. Thanks very much.<br />
ends. </p>
