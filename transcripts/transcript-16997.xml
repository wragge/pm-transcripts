    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Parliamentary Secretary for International Development Assistance, Bob McMullan, has announced that he will not recontest the next federal election.</p>
<p>During his 22 years of public service as a Federal Member of Parliament, Mr McMullan has made a significant contribution to the nation as a Minister and to the people of Fraser in the ACT.</p>
<p>As Parliamentary Secretary for International Development Assistance, Mr McMullan has played a key role in ensuring Australia's international aid efforts genuinely reduce poverty, assist in creating regional and global security, provide vital aid during times of crisis, and deliver programs in developing countries that build local capacity.</p>
<p>Mr McMullan has had a distinguished career with the Australian Labor Party, beginning in 1975 when he became Secretary of the Western Australian Branch of the ALP, and then National Secretary in 1981, where he helped Labor achieve victory in the 1983, 1984 and 1987 federal elections.</p>
<p>As both a senator and a member of the House of Representatives, Mr McMullan has served the nation with distinction. One of his first acts in 1988 was advocating and ensuring the legislative passage of the ACT self-government legislation. In 1993 he became the first Minister for Arts in Cabinet, and in 1994 became Minister for Trade. He continued to work hard in the difficult years of Opposition in several key shadow portfolios including Treasury, and Finance and Small Business.</p>
<p>I am immensely grateful to Mr McMullan for his dedication and service to the Australian Labor Party both nationally and in the ACT. He leaves big shoes to fill in the electorate of Fraser.</p>
<p>Mr McMullan will remain in his role as Parliamentary Secretary. He will continue to serve the people of Fraser until the next Federal election.</p>
<p>I wish Mr McMullan and his wife Robin all the very best in his future career, confident that his contribution to the nation will not end with his political resignation, and I thank him for his invaluable work for the Australian Government.</p>
