SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF THE COMMONWEALTH SERUM LABORATORIES'<br />
HUMAN VACCINE BUILDING AT PARKVILLE 13 APRIL 1984<br />
Distinguished Guests<br />
It is with great pleasure that I accepted the invitation to<br />
join you today.<br />
This new human vaccine building, this new biotechnology<br />
facility, is a major addition to the nation's health care<br />
system. At a cost of approximately $ 9 million it represents a<br />
significant investment by the Australian community in the<br />
health of present and future generations.<br />
CSL is well established as an important supplier of vaccines<br />
for the Australian population. The diphtheria, tetanus and<br />
whooping cough vaccines from this new facility will further<br />
underwrite the health of Australia's children into the next<br />
century. It is also important that this plant will have the potential<br />
to be a major supplier for the communicable disease control<br />
program through which the World Health Organisation is<br />
attempting to ensure the health of the children of the<br />
developing countries.<br />
It is appropriate that this building is named " the Bazeley<br />
Building'. Val Bazeley is the man to whom Australia owed its penicillin<br />
and after, when he became director of CSL, to whom it owed<br />
its polio vaccine. It was his determination and great flair<br />
for organization that enabled full scale penicillin<br />
production at CSL. This saved many Australian lives in New<br />
Guinea during the closing stages of the Second World War.<br />
I am delighted that Val Bazeley is with us here today. Val<br />
Bazeley's contribution to public health in Australia is<br />
immense. It was a contribution made, I might add, at great<br />
personal cost.<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY </p>
<p>The Australian Pharmaceutical Industry is predominantly<br />
engaged in the marketing of products formulated and packaged<br />
from imported active ingredients. The Commonwealth Serum<br />
Laboratories as a Government owned pharmaceutical<br />
manufacturer with a substantial manufacturing base, is a<br />
notable exception.<br />
Founded in 1916 as a manufacturer of vaccines and antisera,'<br />
CSL's biological product and national interest missions have<br />
been key aspects of its operation.<br />
The establishment of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories<br />
Commission in 1961 as a statutory authority included a<br />
mandate which required that commercial operations be<br />
dominant and meet post tax dividend criteria from trading<br />
profits, and that non commercial operations be undertaken<br />
only to the extent of allotted Government budget funds.<br />
Today, with an annual total revenue approaching $ 60 million,<br />
the commercial operations are responsible for more than<br />
per cent of total activity.<br />
The CSL, as the Ross Committee recently noted, provides one<br />
of the few examples of a commonwealth authority which<br />
operates in a fully commercial manner.<br />
Since its establishment the CSL commission has demonstrated<br />
its ability to pursue successfully both national interest<br />
and commercial roles. The commercial orientation has<br />
provided a stimulus to overall performance, a degree of<br />
efficiency, and a public and Government acceptance that<br />
could not have been achieved through pursuit of national<br />
interest functions alone.<br />
Furthermore, in providing work for more than 1000 people,<br />
many of whom reside in my own electorate, CSL makes a<br />
substantial contribution to local employment.<br />
Over its 65 years of existence CSL has established an<br />
excellent rapport with doctors, pharmacists, veterinary<br />
surgeons, hospitals, State Government departments and the<br />
scientific and research community generally. Members of<br />
these groups have come to value CSL because in most cases<br />
CSL is their only Australian origin source of supply. They<br />
also value it for the high standard of its products; the<br />
back up and consultative services provided by its R and D<br />
section ( which is unique in Australia); and its willingness<br />
to attempt to solve and provide for problems of<br />
distinctively Australian character. </p>
<p>Many of the major advances of this century in therapeutics<br />
have been taken up by CSL and developed commercially. They<br />
include: Industrial scale manufacture of insulin<br />
Diphtheria toxoid<br />
Tetanus toxoid<br />
Penicillin and<br />
Salk polio vaccine<br />
In addition to these contributions to human health we can<br />
add CSL's extensive range of vaccines in veterinary<br />
medicine. CSL is also, as noted earlier, a World Health Organisation<br />
collaborating centre with extensive terms of reference.<br />
Through that role it undertakes training and aid programs<br />
for our Asian neighbours.<br />
CSL is well placed to be a focus of pharmaceutical<br />
biotechnology in Australia. The main thrust of CSL's work<br />
is pharmaceutical biotechnology, which it is able to carry<br />
from research through to production and marketing. More of<br />
its resources are being directed to aspects of ' new<br />
biotechnology'. Through collaborative arrangements with<br />
CSL, an excellent opportunity exists for both private and<br />
public sector research advances to find the route to<br />
commercial development in this area.<br />
To support its R and D based biological production, CSL has<br />
developed a strong presence in the national pharmaceutical<br />
markets and effective international linkages through<br />
vigorous export performance and licensing arrangements.<br />
CSL has gained international recognition for its planning<br />
and marketing strategies and has won three export awards for<br />
outstanding export achievement since these were instituted<br />
by the Commonwealth.<br />
The experience and indeed the success of CSL in taking new<br />
products through from the research and development stage to<br />
successful marketing stands as a compelling example to<br />
others in Australian industry.<br />
Too often Australian industry has failed to take advantage<br />
of new products and processes and as a result misses out on<br />
new markets. The opportunity to create jobs and make<br />
profits is also missed. r~. </p>
<p>While Australia has a well-educated workforce and makes a<br />
substantial effort in the area of science and technology,<br />
there is a problem in taking this R and D effort through to<br />
successful commercial development:<br />
People and institutions involved in research often<br />
fail to take new products or processes to<br />
commercial development what is needed from our<br />
institutions is " technology push"; and<br />
Existing companies fail to seek out areas where<br />
technological breakthroughs could be profitably<br />
exploited they are not providing the necessary<br />
" demand pull".<br />
The Government is concerned at this situation and has sought,.<br />
to draw the various strands together. In particular:<br />
The Government has established sirotech to take<br />
developments pioneered by the CSIRO to commercial<br />
application. In addition, we are pleased to see<br />
that universitites and research institutions have<br />
also adopted the approach of setting up commercial<br />
ventures to market their research findings;<br />
The Government has also sought to help small<br />
business to exploit available market opportunities<br />
through the development of a venture capital market<br />
in Australia. This should help businessmen to take<br />
Australian, or overseas technological<br />
breakthroughs, and turn them into profitable<br />
business ventures.<br />
The response to these initiatives has been encouraging.<br />
The promotion of efforts to bridge the gap between research<br />
and development is part of the Government's overall approach<br />
to the area of science and technology and needs to be seen<br />
in the context of the Government's genera. approach to the<br />
development of Australian industry.<br />
The linkages are drawn out quite fully in the discussion<br />
paper on a National Technology Strategy released today by my<br />
colleague Mr Jones, the Minister for Science and Technology.<br />
While acceptance of an overall strategy will depend<br />
ultimately on an appreciation of the major issues facing<br />
Australia in this area by all parties involved, release of<br />
this paper is an important part of the process of developing<br />
an active and coherent approach to technology issues and<br />
their relevance for Australian industry growth.<br />
ti.. </p>
<p>While the Government recognises the value of scientific<br />
research and the pursuit of scientific excellence for its<br />
own sake, there are additional benefits if this research can<br />
be turned into new methods of production or new products<br />
which increase productivity or living standards. Such<br />
technological developments will play an important part in<br />
the dynamic processes of structural change within Australian<br />
industry. Indeed we should not ignore this process.<br />
Companies abroad are investing in new products and<br />
in cost reducing production technology, and unless<br />
Australian industry acts to maintain its<br />
competitiveness and to develop new mar'kets our<br />
economy will stagnate and we will fail to sustain<br />
living standards commensurate with our ability and,,<br />
expectations.<br />
The Government believes that there is now a quite widespread<br />
community acceptance of the need for structural change.<br />
There is also a growing community appreciation of the<br />
benefits such change will bring. But change, no matter how<br />
desirable, usually imposes costs on those directly affected.<br />
It is my firm view, however, that the costs and benefits of<br />
change should be borne by all in the community not solely<br />
by those at the face of change.<br />
As part of this approach, the Government considers that<br />
technological change needs to be managed constructively. it<br />
is simply not good enough to be in a position of constantly<br />
reacting to the effects of technological innovation as it<br />
proceeds. Rather we should:<br />
Aim to consolidate and give substance to the<br />
climate of acceptance of change within the<br />
community; Build on the willingness on the part of business<br />
both to take active steps to adopt the most<br />
appropriate technology, and to consider market<br />
possibilities both domestically and externally; and<br />
ensure that our scientific and educational effort<br />
is supportive of our policy objectives.<br />
To co-ordinate policies in the areas of education, trade,<br />
science and technology and industry, the Government has<br />
established a special group of Ministers, chaired by Senator<br />
Button. Their work will form the basis of our policies to<br />
revitalise our industry. </p>
<p>Some issues they are considering go to both education policy<br />
directions and the practical/ commercial application of<br />
research. They are asking:<br />
What are the educational requirements for<br />
Australia's technological future? How can the<br />
education system best provide for Australia's<br />
needs? The content and orientation of courses is<br />
particularly crucial. Falling school retention<br />
rates, which threaten to lower the educational<br />
quality of our workforce in the future are also<br />
important;<br />
They are also asking:<br />
How can Australia get the best dividedd from its<br />
very considerable investment in Government tertiary<br />
research? What further measures could be<br />
introduced to close the gap between research and<br />
commercial development? In particular what role is<br />
there for joint ventures with overseas companies to<br />
develop Australian research?<br />
In the area of science and technology this Governemnt has<br />
already taken several initiatives:<br />
We have provided extra funding t~ o extend the<br />
Australian industrial research and development<br />
incentives scheme to encompass biotechnology<br />
projects; We have increased funding for the Australian<br />
Research Grants Scheme, the aim being to support<br />
research projects designed to assist in an<br />
understanding of or the solution to important<br />
practical problems;<br />
And we have established the national research<br />
fellowships scheme to provide individuals and<br />
research teams with opportunities to undertake<br />
research of national significance, with a view to<br />
strengthening Australia's development capacity.<br />
One other initiative which has special relevance to CSL is<br />
the National Biotechnology Scheme. As I noted at the outset<br />
this new building is an important biotechnology facility.<br />
Among the high technology industries, biotechnology holds<br />
considerable promise for the generation of wealth. New and<br />
improved products and processes can be obtained through<br />
biotechnology techniques, which often are more efficient and<br />
use less energy than the traditional processes.<br />
Furthermore, Australian researchers are world leaders in<br />
many areas of biotechnology including agriculture, plant and<br />
animal genetics, microbiology, biochemistry and medical<br />
research. </p>
<p>The Government has embarked on a National Biotechnology<br />
Program which builds upon the excellent research base we<br />
have in microbiology and genetic engineering as well as in<br />
other fields. Grants for seven projects worth $ 4.5 million<br />
have been approved for the calendar years 1984 to 1986.<br />
Although by no means the only worthy research projects<br />
currently under way, the seven projects chosen to be the<br />
first recipients of the grants represent a diversity of<br />
biotechnological research and share the potential for<br />
placing this country in the forefront of international<br />
efforts in their respective fields.<br />
The gap between research and product development must be<br />
closed. The slow rate of technology transfer into new<br />
products and rocesses must be accelerated. We must learn<br />
not only how to develop the product we must also focus on<br />
what the market requires.<br />
What we have to recapture today is the spirit, energy and<br />
vision of people like Bazeley, Florey and John Curtin which<br />
in different and disparate ways lead to great Australian<br />
ventures such as industrial scale penicillin production at<br />
CSL and the establishment of the Australian National<br />
University with its John Curtin School of Medical Research.<br />
We must again bring together all who can contribute to a<br />
coherent national effort in technology development. We<br />
should do this so that we can take full advantage of the<br />
promise offered by our scientific endeavour and our resource<br />
endowment. CSL, and this new " Bazeley Building" in particular, are<br />
poised to take advantage of new technologies and to contine,<br />
through increased pharmaceutical technology development, the<br />
great service given over the years to this country.<br />
CSL stands as a great example which I commend to all<br />
Australians. Accordingly it is with great pleasure that I<br />
now formally declare this new Human Vaccine Building the<br />
Bazeley building open.<br />
