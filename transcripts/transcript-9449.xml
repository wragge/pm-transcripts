TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SPEECH FOR THE LAUNCH OF THE " WALTZING MATILDA"<br />
CENTENARY, NATIONAL ART GALLERY, 12 DECEMBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
It is the parallels between the last decade of this century and the last decade<br />
of the last century are almost uncanny as they reveal that in times of hardship<br />
of economic change that in these times, the spirit of Australia and our<br />
sense of ourselves, has become so much more obvious perhaps than at<br />
times certainly in the 19th Century after the great growth and wealth in the<br />
gold era of the 1860s, 70s and 80s, to the recession of the 1 890s to the<br />
familiar problem of drought, to problems in the countryside. We saw in this<br />
decade of the 1890s this great period of Australian social experimentation<br />
which was, of course, snuffed out by the FIrst World War. But in this period,<br />
as Ken (-Cowley) has just mentioned, we saw the pulling together of the<br />
Federation, in the midst of all this difficulty those thinking through the screen<br />
of troubles to see a nation emerging from the other side and not losing the<br />
opportunity with the chance to federate. At the time this song was written<br />
itself part of the ethos of the period the Labor Party was formed, and we<br />
then see the quite amazing period of social change leading up to 1914. Now,<br />
you would wonder it would take another century to do these things again, but<br />
of course as we know, there was a bout of prosperity between the Wars, and<br />
then the Second World War basically took the gloss off all that, and then we<br />
had a period of gr6_ withiaiid Orosperity, but all set in the terms of the post-War<br />
era, not particularly about us, but about us being part of the western world as<br />
it then became. This is probably the first time, the 1990s, where the world is<br />
returning to the sort of world it was before the First World War, with these<br />
great states joining the world economy for the first time since then, like<br />
Russia first time since 1917, but again partly a consequence of the First<br />
World War and we are seeing these other great states joining it China,<br />
India and South America. So we are entering a period again somewhat<br />
similar, but we are doing it at a time when Australia's confidence about itself<br />
pride in itself has I think coalesced and come together, perhaps as we might<br />
not have expected a decade ago and it is that confidence and that </p>
<p>expression of ourselves that is powering on now our national identity and<br />
our place in the world, particularly the world we live in.<br />
Now, all these threads tend to come together, and it is a most unlikely thing<br />
that Ken Cowley from News Ltd well I think it is unlikely anyway is one of<br />
the driving forces of the Stockman's Hall of Fame, and is the proprietor of<br />
Australia's most famous riding boot and country shoe R M Williams and<br />
that he is mixed up with Hugh Sawrey and the brushmen of the bush,<br />
because that in itself is a celebration of the great ethos of rural Australia. But<br />
here we are with Ansett one of our two great airlines celebrating the<br />
centenary of this, what has become our national song " Waltzing Matilda"<br />
and doing it with these painting so evocative of the time by Hugh Sawrey.<br />
This is a very good thing to do it is an important thing to do in it's own right<br />
because in this country where we for so long were left as an outpost of Britain<br />
and the British Empire, the bits that were ours we tended to hug and keep,<br />
and one of them of course is this song " Waltzing Matilda". Now, apparently<br />
no-one quite knows who wrote the music, but we know that Banjo Patterson<br />
wrote the lyrics, and Ken said he went out to a property, but apparently it was<br />
sang at the North Gregory Hotel in Winton on the 6th April 1895. Now, I don't<br />
quite know where that was recorded, but I am sure it's true. And it was<br />
apparently sung throughout Western Queensland, but there is no doubt that<br />
Banjo Patterson wrote the words, and famous words they have become. And<br />
it is a sonl tfiat has been chosen by the Australian Olympic Federation as our<br />
National Song at the Montreal Olympics, it has been recorded by over 400<br />
artists I'm told, it has been sung by Harry Belafonte and Bill Halley I mean<br />
for just trivial bits of information Tom Waites and almost every generation<br />
has sung it and there is no doubt that all of us, where we are in a place where<br />
it is sung are very moved by it. Now, the p! ace I was most moved by it was in<br />
Ireland about eighteen months ago, where the whole stadium sang it and see<br />
if that doesn't grab you. I can tell you it does. When they had mass bands<br />
who then played it and apparently all of the verses are well known in Ireland<br />
and they were all sung. Anyway, as they went from one verse to the next<br />
nobody missed a beat and it was a terribly moving thing.<br />
So, I think that it is, again, an evocation of the rural ethos of Australia and<br />
Ken Cowley made the point about people doing it tough on the land now and<br />
that is true probably never tougher this is without a doubt, I think, probably<br />
the worst drought we have ever had. I think on of the great challenges for<br />
Australia is to understand that the rural family, the farm family, the grazing<br />
family have been so much the backbone of our country's way of life,<br />
particularly outside of the cities, that we have got to do now those things<br />
within our power to keep it together while this natural phenomena exists and<br />
to give them a hand through it and to give them a hand out the other side and<br />
that is why the Government has taken now the opportunity of announcing<br />
particular policy packages to try to keep ahead of the problem and we can<br />
only hope that widespread rains in breaking the drought solves the problem.<br />
Because that, indeed in the end, is the only thing that will solve the problem,<br />
but it is important, I think, that the people in the country understand that they<br />
have the sympathies of all of us, especially those of us who live in the big </p>
<p>' U 3<br />
urban aggregations, the cities and the large provincial cities to say that we<br />
haven't forgotten them and that we are with them.<br />
So, to have the song this great song, this great rural song celebrated for its<br />
centenary and to have it done with this spectacular array of pictures which<br />
Hugh has painted for us. I had quite a bit of contact with brushman of the<br />
bush because being the member for Blaxland around Bankstown in Sydney<br />
they have a sister city relationship with Broken Hill and has a great contact<br />
there and each year they have a great exhibition of the brushman of the bush<br />
pictures. So, I am somewhat familiar with them and I have always thought<br />
that they have been capturing, in a very contemporary way, that feeling of the<br />
bush and that part of our history that might have started to fade or be it<br />
somewhat lost to us.<br />
So, let me first of all, congratulate Ken and Ansett for this initiative which is a<br />
good thing to do in national terms and thank Graeme McMahon who runs<br />
Ansett with Ken for that too. I would like to congratulate Hugh on his pictures<br />
and, of course, also did the 737, the people of Winton, the Waltzing Matilda<br />
Centennial Committee and everyone else associated with the e events. As I<br />
say, this is a mood, I think, in the 1990s very much as we found it 100 years<br />
ago and we should lose for a second the opportunity to drive home the fact<br />
that Australia is a unique place, what we have created here ourselves is<br />
completely different than what it was, what Australia has become in a country<br />
with an enormous power about it and a huge sense of confidence. We have<br />
got this debate now about the republic, we'd often say to people ' the republic<br />
is not the instrument of our confidence or our identity, but rather the<br />
manifestation of it'. It will be the cherry on the top rather than the cake itself.<br />
The cake being our own confidence about ourselves and what we are and<br />
who we have become.<br />
So, this song has been right through these years, part and parcel of whatever<br />
we are, because it always brings the hair up on the back of our neck most of<br />
us. So, I would like to, again, thank Ken for inviting me to launch this today<br />
and to officially launch the Waltzing Matilda Centenary at Winton in 1995 by<br />
declaring this exhibition formally open and unveil the plaque which I will have<br />
much pleasure in doing for the Ansett 737. Thank you indeed. </p>
