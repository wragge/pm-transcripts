J, AUSTKHA. IA<br />
PRIMVE MINISTER EMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A. M.<br />
FOR MEDIA 1C June 1983<br />
The following message was read on the Prime Minister's behalf by the<br />
Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, Mr. Cohen, at the official<br />
opening of the National Conservation Strategy for Australia<br />
Conference today:<br />
I regret that due to commitments overseas, I will not b. able either<br />
to address you personally or to open this most important Conference<br />
to discuss a National Conservation Strategy for Australia.<br />
You meet together as a group of Australians drawn from differing<br />
situations and backgrounds, representing a diversity of organisations<br />
and with differing outlooks and interests. Your collective purpose<br />
is to discuss, debate and hopefully agree upon a set of Stratecic<br />
principles which will promote the conservation and sustainable<br />
development and use of the nation's living resources. This most<br />
important undertaking should form part of our overall objectives for<br />
the future of our country. You will already know of the Government's<br />
comnitment to achieving sustainable economic growth, full employment<br />
and high quality environment. These objectives are not, as some may<br />
suggest, totally in conflict without hope of reconciliation, In<br />
fact, the World Conservation Strategy points out that to achieve our<br />
goals of social and economic development we need competent<br />
environmental management.<br />
In the course of this Conference, you will be asked to consider and<br />
balance some very complex questions involving Australia's living<br />
resources. Each of you will rightly seek to put your views in a<br />
strong and forthright manner. This I encourage, but above all, I<br />
ask you to keep firmly before you the principle of consensus<br />
building and the responsibility we all have to develop this nation<br />
for the benefit of its own people and with due regard for its place<br />
in the community of nations.<br />
The recent Economic Summit meeting achieved a high degree of<br />
unanimity because its participants brought to that meeting an<br />
awareness of difficult economic circumstances and arrived at<br />
agreement on the fact of the matter. They had a willingness to work<br />
together to achieve agreed objectives. The challenge to you all as<br />
delegates to this Conference is similarly to face realistically the<br />
difficulties posed by living and working within Australia's unique<br />
environmental conditions and to produce a Strategy that will ensure<br />
sustainable development of our living resources.<br />
Be assured that your considerations will be taken seriously by the<br />
Federal Government. The Minister will be elaborating on our current<br />
policies and will provide an indication of initiatives the<br />
Government is considering in regard to the implementation of the<br />
National Conservation Strategy for Australia.<br />
I wish you well in your endeavours in the full expectation that you<br />
will provide to the community and Government in Australia a Strategy<br />
for the sensible and sustainable use of living resources in<br />
Australia for the future. </p>
