PRIME MINISTER<br />
PRESS STATEMENT 13 APRIL 1978<br />
AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY COUNCIL<br />
BILL 1978<br />
SECOND READING SPEECH<br />
In a statement on 19 April last year, I informed the House of<br />
the Government's decision to establish the Australian Science<br />
and Technology Council ( or " ASTEC") as a permanent statutory<br />
body. The purpose of this Bill is to put that decision into effect,<br />
thereby ensuring that the Government-will have available to<br />
it, on a continuing basis, independent advice of the highest<br />
calibre on matters of science and technology.<br />
The original forerunner of the present ASTEC was an advisory<br />
committee on science and technology, the formation of which<br />
was announced by the Rt. Hon. the Member for Lowe<br />
( Sir William McMahon) in April 1972. I was the responsible<br />
Minister at that time, and the formation of the Committee<br />
reflected the great importance which the then Government<br />
attached to having independent, expert advice on these matters.<br />
After the change of Government, the advisory committee was<br />
disbanded in February 1973. Two years later, an interim ASTEC<br />
was formed. After the 1975 election, the interim ASTEC was<br />
re-established, with some modifications to its membership and<br />
functions.<br />
In November 1976, the interim ASTEC recommended to the Government<br />
that a permanent Australian Science and Technology Council be<br />
established as an independent statutory body. This recommendation<br />
was accepted. Pending the passage of legislation, the permanent<br />
Council was established by executive action in April 1977.<br />
Since that time, ASTEC has provided the Government with valuable<br />
advice on a range of matters, notably its report on Energy Research<br />
and Development which I tabled in this House on 4 April 1978. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The history of science policy advisory bodies in Australia has<br />
been chequered. It is important that ASTEC be constituted as a<br />
statutory body, in order to provide the Council with the status,<br />
permanence and stability it needs to do its job effectively.<br />
It is also very important to ensure that ASTEC be as independent<br />
as possible of any Department of Government, and statutory status<br />
is necessary to achieve this. The Council will report to the<br />
Prime Minister, an administrative arrangement reflecting both<br />
the status and independence of ASTEC.<br />
The Bill before the House has three major purposes, intended to<br />
guarantee ASTEC's effectiveness as a working body. First, the<br />
functions of the Council are defined. Second, the Council is<br />
invested with sufficiently wide powers to enable it to execute<br />
its functions. Third, provisions are made for the independence<br />
of the Council, to enable it to undertake its functions effectively.<br />
The functions of the Council are defined in clause 5 of the Bill.<br />
The Council's role will be to investigate and furnish information<br />
and advice to the Government on science and technology, particularly<br />
" The advancement of scientific knowledge;<br />
the development and application of science and<br />
technology to the furtherance of the national<br />
wel11-being;<br />
the adequacy, effectiveness and overall balance of<br />
scientific and technological activities in Australia;<br />
the identification and support of new ideas in science<br />
and technology likely to be of national importance;<br />
the practical development and application of scientific<br />
discoveries; the fostering of scientific and technological innovation<br />
in industry; and<br />
the means of improving efficiency in the use of<br />
resources by the application of science and technology."<br />
These functions will allow the Council a very wide purview indeed.<br />
It can range from pure science, to the problems of improving<br />
efficiency in industry by applying the results of research and<br />
development. It can consider the activities and technological<br />
problems of higher education institutions and private enterprise.<br />
The Government believes that this wide overview will allow ASTEC<br />
to play an important part in ensuring that there is a worthwhile<br />
interchange of ideas, information and new discoveries between<br />
Government, industry and academic science and scientists. </p>
<p>The Council's advice to the Government on priorities and balance of<br />
effor ' t will inevitably influence the allocation of resources by the<br />
Government, and facilitate long-term, well-conceived forward<br />
planning by both Government and industry.<br />
In keeping with the quality of advice which the Council is to<br />
provide, only people of the highest quality and standing will be<br />
appointed as members. A proportion of the membership will have<br />
backgrounds in various sectors of the industry, and others will<br />
have academic backgrounds. People having a contribution to make<br />
by virtue of special knowledge and experience can also be<br />
appointed. Members will be selected for their personal qualities<br />
rather than as representatives of organisations or interests.<br />
To discharge its important functions, the Council is to be provided<br />
with appropriate powers, listed in clauses 6 and 9, and 20 to 24<br />
of the Bill. The Council will be able to conduct inquiries and<br />
collect information on any aspect of its functions, either from its<br />
own initiative or at the direction of its minister.<br />
It is intended that the Council's reports to the Government will<br />
be made public unless there are overwhelming reasons in the<br />
national interest for not doing so. Clause 6 contains detailed<br />
provisions requiring the prompt tabling in Parliament of ASTEC<br />
reports except in the closely defined circumstances there referred<br />
to. The Council will be able to consult widely, with Commonwealth and<br />
State bodies, and with scientific, commercial, industrial and other<br />
organisations. Commonwealth bodies shall provide the Council with<br />
such assistance in the performance of its functions as is<br />
reasonably practicable. The Council will also have powers to<br />
engage consultants to conduct studies for it, and to arrange with<br />
Commonwealth authorities for officers of those authorities to be<br />
available to assist the Council. The Council will also be able to<br />
form committees of council members and others, who will conduct<br />
investigations on behalf of the Council, and will report their<br />
findings and recommendations to the Council.<br />
These powers should enable the Council to meet its responsibilities<br />
adequately, from the conduct of basic investigations and informationgathering,<br />
using such expert advice and assistance as are necessary,<br />
to reporting its advice and recommendations directly to the<br />
Government.<br />
The third important purpose of this'legislation is the provision<br />
of necessary independence for the Council in its actions, so that<br />
its advice can be provided to government freely and without<br />
unwarranted influence. Clause 8 of the Bill provides that, although<br />
the Council will be subject to direction by the Minister, these<br />
directions will not extend to the content of any information,<br />
advice or report which ASTEC provides to the Minister. This will<br />
ensure that ASTEC's advice is truly independent, and free of even<br />
the possibility of political influence on advice which must be<br />
founded on sound scientific judgement. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Another important area where independence is ensured is in the<br />
staffing of ASTEC. It is intended that ASTEC will be served by<br />
a small staff of skilled officers. Such staff are to be provided<br />
under the Public Service Act, but clause 19 of the Bill includes<br />
provisions designed to ensure that the staff of ASTEC are under<br />
the direction of the Council, free of any unwarranted influence<br />
from other Commonwealth agencies. In particular, clause 19<br />
provides specifically that staff members shall perform their<br />
functions and duties in accordance with the directions of the<br />
Council. Another provision designed to secure the independence of the<br />
Council is clause 25 of the Bill, which exempts the Council and<br />
those working for it, from legal action in relation to any<br />
act done in good faith and in accordance with ASTEC's powers and<br />
functions. People supplying information to the Council in good<br />
faith will be similarly protected. This legal indemnity will<br />
allow the Council, and its witnesses, to provide information and<br />
advice fearlessly and candidly.<br />
The Bill also provides proper protection for information provided<br />
to the Council in confidence.<br />
The above represent the more important purposes of the Bill.<br />
There are, in addition, the usual provisions of a Bill of this<br />
nature, concerning the appointment, terms of office and remuneration<br />
of Council members, and acting members, and related matters. The<br />
Council will be obliged to meet as necessary to perform its<br />
functions. Council members will be required to disclose any<br />
interest they may have in any matter under consideration by the<br />
Council. Such an interest will debar the Council member involved<br />
from taking part in any decision on the matter in question and,<br />
if the Council sees fit, from being present at any discussions on<br />
that matter.<br />
Mr. Speaker, the Government believes that there is an overwhelming<br />
case for establishing an effective science advisory body in Australia<br />
which is an independent and permanent statutory authority. Nothing<br />
less will properly safeguard the status, permanence and stability<br />
of ASTEC. This Bill provides the necessary safeguards, and I<br />
commend the Bill to the House. 0000000o </p>
