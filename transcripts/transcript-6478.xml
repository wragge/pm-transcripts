over many years Au-traiia has been enriched by the coming to<br />
Australia of very large numbers of citizens of German origins.<br />
Indeed, in one of our great industries the wine industry In<br />
South Australia it was founded by settlers from northern<br />
Germany at the end of the last century and some of those many<br />
of those -' from Berlin itself. We have many Australians going to<br />
the great cultural centres of Europe, and particularly going to<br />
Berlin. Those of our citizens who are interested in music and the<br />
theatre and the. arts make Berlin one of their centres of<br />
destination. And so we have all those reasons for closeness with<br />
you your magnificent stand of courage in the post War period;<br />
he fact that you remain, as we say, a symbol of freedom in this<br />
uncertain world, and the historical connection We have through the<br />
large numbers of people who come from that city to settle in<br />
Australia. So for all these reasons-we have great feelings of<br />
identity with you.<br />

people coming from Australia and we have 2 million Berliners in<br />
our city, and on behalf of the Senate of Berlin I would take this<br />
opportunity to invite you to come to Berlin and all these people<br />
the Australians and the Berliners would be very happy if you'd<br />
come to Berlin, and I think Berlin is a very, very strange city<br />
sometimes, of course wonderful on the other hand, and some things<br />
in life and in the world you only can understand if you see it.<br />
You can read and write and talk with each other you can't<br />
understand but if you come you will, and that means we would<br />
be very glad , if you come t. o Berlin and again I want to invite you<br />
to come.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well thank you very much Mr. Lummer, and let me<br />
say this, that I would be expecting to travel overseas next year<br />
and I would say to you now that I have much pleasure in accepting<br />
the invitation that you put to me on behalf of the people of<br />
Berlin and I would hope to be able to take that up next year, and<br />
I do regard it as a great honour that you've extended that<br />
invitation to me.<br />
MAYOR OF BERLIN: I will tell it to all the Berliners and I am<br />
quote sure they will be happy. Thank you so much.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Thank you Mr. Lummer, my best wishes.<br />
TINGLE: Mr. Hawke thank you very much irdeed for that. I think<br />
you'll find it's a beautiful city and it is, as you said, a symbol<br />
of freedom. It's an exciting place to be in and I know, I hope<br />
that I don't presume when I say that I think you and I knew each<br />
other well enough for me to say that you'll enjOy it as I did<br />
and I look forward to your visit.<br />
PRIIE MINISTER: Thank you very much indeed John. Thank you.<br />
TINGLE: Okay Mr. Hawke, thanks for talhing to me. ' Bye.<br />
