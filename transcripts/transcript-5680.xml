MEMBERSHIP OF THE OFFICIAL ESTABLISHMENTS TRUST<br />
I am pleased to announce the appointment of Mr J G ( Jock)<br />
Gosse and Mrs Frank Crean as members of the Official<br />
Establishments Trust.<br />
The terms of appointment of two of the inaugural members of<br />
the Trust, the Hon James Cope, CMG, and Dame Helen Blaxland, DBE,<br />
were completed last month.<br />
Both made valuable contributions to the work of the Trust<br />
during the initial period of its operations.<br />
The five member Trust is chaired by Sir Andrew Grimwade, CBE.<br />
The other members are Mr Guilford Bell and Mrs H B Gullet.<br />
The Trust was established by the Government in September 1979<br />
to advise on the conservation, development and efficient<br />
operation of the buildings and grounds of Government House<br />
and the The Lodge, Canberra, and Admiralty House and<br />
Kirribilli House, Sydney.<br />
The Government is pleased that Mr Gosse and Mrs Crean have agreed<br />
to serve on the Trust. Both are also members of'the<br />
Australiana Fund which is developing a collection of fine art<br />
and furnishings for display in the four official residences. </p>
