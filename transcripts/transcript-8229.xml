PRIME MINISTER<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE COMMONWEALTH, NEW SOUTH WALES,<br />
VICTORIAN AND AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY GOVERNMENTS AND<br />
THE VFT JOINT VENTURE ON PROCESSES FOR GOVERNMENT<br />
COORDINATION AND FACILITATION OF THE VERY FAST TRAIN<br />
PROPOSAL The Prime Minister, the Premiers of New South Wales and<br />
Victoria and the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital<br />
Territory met in Sydney today with the Joint Venture<br />
partners to discuss future arrangements for coordination and<br />
facilitation of Government consideration of the Very Fast<br />
Train ( VFT) project.<br />
The Heads of Government agreed to streamline mechanisms<br />
across the four jurisdictions to assess effectively the<br />
potential economic, environmental and social impacts of the<br />
project. The processes developed today would allow<br />
Government to respond quickly and consistently as the<br />
information already provided by the VFT Joint Venture is<br />
assessed, and as more information on the VFT becomes<br />
available. The four Heads of Government agreed on a joint response to<br />
the VFT Joint Venture partners' recent submission to each<br />
Government on VFT processes. This will guide the future<br />
direction of each Government's involvement with the VFT<br />
project, and provide the VFT Joint Venture with a single<br />
point of contact on most issues.<br />
Each Government would, of course, retain jurisdiction for<br />
areas for which it has sole responsibility and ultimately<br />
would be responsible for those decisions. The Heads of<br />
Government also reiterated each Government's current<br />
position that the VFT concept deserves serious consideration<br />
as a private sector project. The VFT Joint Venture has<br />
approached the Commonwealth with suggested changes to the<br />
tax regime, which the VFT Joint Venture intends to<br />
facilitate the financing of infrastructure projects from<br />
Australian private sector sources. The proposals are<br />
complex and have far reaching implications for the<br />
Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Government has agreed to<br />
consider the proposals and to respond to the Joint Venture<br />
early in 1991.<br />
The Joint Venture has now submitted the Project Evaluation<br />
Report ( PER) to the Commonwealth and State Governments.<br />
Issues addressed by the PER include those required for a<br />
43LAM It~ ffC~ </p>
<p>decision to advance to Stage two ( eg project justification,<br />
major route choice, right of way, project finance). The<br />
second stage will involve a fully coordinated environmental<br />
impact assessment and full public participation.<br />
It was also agreed that the Heads of Agencies group<br />
( comprising leading officials from each Government) which<br />
exercises a general oversight of Government involvement with<br />
the project, will become a standing committee of lead<br />
officials to facilitate the VFT evaluation process and act<br />
as the Governments' primary liaison point. The Commonwealth<br />
Department of Transport and Communications would have the<br />
role of chair, and the group would be supported by a joint<br />
Commonwealth/ State/ ACT Task Force.<br />
The four Governments acknowledged the need for public<br />
exposure and announced that they encourage public briefings<br />
by the Joint Venture and welcome public comments. The Heads<br />
of Government noted that a number of public inquiries into<br />
the VFT had concluded or were underway, and that there would<br />
be full public participation under the Stage two<br />
environmental assessment. The Joint Venture will be making<br />
all information relevant to Government consideration<br />
available to the Governments. It would also be publicly<br />
available except where commerciality was at risk.<br />
On timing, the Heads of Government agreed that it should be<br />
possible to conclude Stage one with a response to the VFT<br />
Joint Venture on the submissions already received by early<br />
1991. The four Heads of Government also agreed to aim for<br />
completion of the coordinated environmental assessment<br />
process 10 months after the exhibition of the environmental<br />
impact statement. This is within the Joint Venture's<br />
requirements for completion of the process. The Joint<br />
Venture advised that their target date for the start of<br />
project operations was 1 December 1997. </p>
