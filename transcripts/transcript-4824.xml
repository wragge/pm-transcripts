PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 17 SEPTEMBER 1978<br />
SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM<br />
The Prime Minister will attend the ninth South Pacific Forum, to<br />
be held in Niue, from 17 to 20 September. He will be<br />
accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Andrew Peacock.<br />
Mr Fraser said that Australia attached considerable importance<br />
to the South Pacific Forum.. This annual gathering of South Pacific<br />
leaders provided the principal venue for discussion of political<br />
issues and questions of economic development of significance to<br />
the region.<br />
The Forum was basically an organisation for the Island states.<br />
It was a mark of Australia's positive role in the Pacific that<br />
it was accepted as a full member and active participant in the<br />
Forum. This year's Forum will discuss several issues of regional concern.<br />
The most important will be the proposed convention for the<br />
establishment of a South Pacific Regional Fisheries Agency.<br />
Other issues will include transportation, trade and environmental<br />
protection. Mr Fraser said that the priority the Australian Government<br />
accorded the Forum reflected the Government's interest in the<br />
South Pacific and the growing links it sought to foster with<br />
countries in the region. Ile said he looked forward to<br />
renewing contacts with Pacific leaders during his visit to Niue. </p>
