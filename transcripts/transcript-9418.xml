TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE MON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, GRAND HYATT HOTEL, MONDAY, 14 NOVEMBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Well, since I saw you last I have had meetings with Prime Minister Chuan<br />
and lunch with President Clinton and a meeting this afternoon with<br />
President Soeharto. So, I would be quite happy to take any questions from<br />
you.<br />
J; Lets start with President Clinton<br />
PM: We had a lunch, we reaffirmed our country's strong support for the APEC<br />
commitment. The President was very complimentary about our role In our<br />
APEC and I was of his decision last year to hold the Leaders meeting. And<br />
we have acknowledged both the central role that President So eharto has<br />
played in getting the communique together and negotiating it to this point.<br />
We agreed on the Importance of developing an action plan for free trade,<br />
that is the Importance of deciding whien next we meet how we then start<br />
giving effect to some of the content and decision taken In Bogor. We also<br />
agree on the Importance of APEC Loaders continuing to meet regularly.<br />
The President thought it was a tremendously good thing that the Asia-<br />
Pacific was meeting at Leaders level and that you can see just from one day<br />
how many countries and just how many leaders can meet one another so<br />
effectively and quickly and efficiently. We shared other views on the region<br />
Including Japan, Korea and China. Then we had an Interesting and amiable<br />
discussion about domestic political issues and developments In both<br />
countries. I'm not sure the Liberal Party of Australia would have been<br />
terribly -pleased with. my contribution. but it certainly amused the President.<br />
And, he had a few things to say about his opponents as well.<br />
So, that was the sort of general discussion. I think that the President, I<br />
made this point to him that the likelihood of an American President being In </p>
<p>Indonesia for the development of a free trade agreement, free trade<br />
declaration across the most developed and developing countries is so novel<br />
as to indicate very clearly that the United States obvlousiy sees a large part<br />
of Its future in Asia.<br />
J: Mr Keating, can you give us a sense of how you feel less than 24 hours<br />
away from an agreement...<br />
PM: I think that for a start this issue has been well and truly debated now over<br />
the year. Each of us have got a stake In it. I have spoken to various<br />
Leaders. President Soeharto has, I think, put together a very cogent, well<br />
worded, thoughtful communique and It has got the hard decisions in It and<br />
he stuck to it. I think this has been a very big factor and will be a big factor<br />
in its success the strength and determination which he has committed to it.<br />
One gets the sense that gradually peoples fears are being assuaged. That<br />
Is, those who believe they have I mean, there has been quite a bit of<br />
gnashing of teeth with ft because It Is quite a decision of such moment. This<br />
is not just verbiage, this Is not just some sort of communique, some piece of<br />
empty rhetoric, there Is a whole lot of decisions being taken here and when<br />
the weight comes on, people do start thinking what consequences it has for<br />
them and that Is why, I think, that there has been on the part of some<br />
countries some real concerns. But, gradually, I think, they're concerns are<br />
being settled and the communique Is looking stronger.<br />
J: Would you say It is fair to characterise this as possibly the most Important<br />
process that you have been Involved In?<br />
PM: Certainly the most important I have ever been involved with.. Because this<br />
is the birth of a free trade agreement, of a community of countries coming<br />
together to introduce and support the benefits of free trade and it gives<br />
Australia, as I have said before, a seat at the largest table It has ever been<br />
at. So, one can't be other than struck by the sense of occasion.<br />
J: How do you explain the significance of It though to ordinary Australians who<br />
can see something happening very far away?<br />
PM: It will matter to Australians in terms of jobs, of opportunities, of the fact that<br />
Australian products and services will be more freely traded in the Asia-<br />
Pacific, it will mean interesting jobs for many Australians and younger<br />
Australians in particular, It will mean mobility that my generation didn't have,<br />
S it willmean all those things." It will mean Australia has gof a stake In a very<br />
large market that tt has never had a stake In before.<br />
J: Do you expect to. see a Leaders meeting in Japan next year as a result of<br />
your meeting with Clinton </p>
<p>PM: I think so. I think there Is now fairly clear support gathering for a succession<br />
of meetings and the next of ci rce would be In Japan. But still, this Is for<br />
the Leaders to discuss tomorrow, but just from the informal expressions I<br />
am getting I think we will probably see this becoming If not permanent a<br />
semi-permanent feature of the landscape.<br />
J: Do you see APEC as being a process for, If you like, a reform of US foreign<br />
policy in this area moving away from the hubs and spokes Involved In five<br />
or six years ago In the multi-lateral<br />
PM: I think so. I think as the cold war has evaporated and the American<br />
Presidency is less about control of a strategic force and more about regional<br />
dispute settlement of the kind you have seen in Central America and the<br />
Carribean in the Middle East, North Korea et cetera I think we will find the<br />
expression of American foreign policy perhaps more and more in trade.<br />
Therefore, It Is, I think, a very bold step for President Clinton to Imagine a<br />
free and open Asia-Pacific in which America takes part and trying to turn<br />
that sense of imagination Into a reality.<br />
J: Prime Minister, after your discussion with Mr Clinton today has he come<br />
further around to the view that you have had on the relationship between<br />
human rights questions and development In trade?<br />
PM: I think we have a concurrence of view about this, but we didn't discuss It at<br />
lunch. But, let me say I couldn't be happier with the nature of the discussion<br />
I had with him. It was relaxed, It was informal, it was one which not<br />
unreasonably was one between countries which are very friendly and who<br />
have a common set of objectives here. But, can I also say. I have just<br />
recently finished a meeting with President Soeharto and that was the most<br />
relaxed, informal meeting I have had with him and the President Is. I think,<br />
feeling good about this meeting and, I think, he Is entitled to feel good about<br />
it. Prime Minister, on Friday you said you were Just looking for perhaps a<br />
political commitment from the APEC members to an organisation program.<br />
Do you have more detail than that?<br />
PM: The words In the communique are fairly hard words. They are not alms and<br />
endeavours, they are hard words. I mean, this Is being approached by the<br />
APEC4eadership-as a set of executive decisioris that chart a course which<br />
will then have to be facilitated. So. this, if you like, this communique Is like<br />
the Cabinet decision, it will then have to be fleshed out and that will happen<br />
probably over the next couple of years. </p>
<p>J: Prime Minister, on your talks with the Thai Prime Minister, is Thailand still<br />
Intending to boycott defence sales coming through?<br />
PM: I had a most amiable discussion with Prime Minister Chuan and I told him<br />
how delighted we had been with not just the work his government has done<br />
in the course of Its charter for Thailand, but coming at a time when it has<br />
been the first democratically elected government likely to be running its term<br />
Is a very encouraging development and I said while we had had concerns<br />
about the certainly more in the past than at present, this support for<br />
groups In Cambodia he said that it was his government's express policy not<br />
to nurture, support or give succour to the Khmer Rouge, certainly In a way<br />
suggested by ourselves and others and that he would bring to book and to<br />
account any officer who was engaged in such activities. So, he expressed,<br />
I think, a very firm view on the part of the government of Thailand against<br />
any material support in this way and again we agreed together that the best<br />
way, of course, consolidating Cambodia under a democratic regime was for<br />
the government of Cambodia to perform to the expectations of the<br />
Cambodian community.<br />
J: Mr Keating, how close is the draft communique to the Eminent Persons<br />
recommendations?<br />
PM: I'd have to go back and try to thread them across one to the other. The<br />
Eminent Persons Group was there, I think, to run a debate amongst the<br />
government trade economic forces of each particular country, to focus on<br />
these questions and to try to develop some sort of coherent consensus of<br />
view. But, it was never, ever Intended to be the draft, if you like, of any<br />
such communique. This was always left to the Leaders. So, It has helped<br />
flesh out opinion within the community of the Asia-Pacific, but it In no way<br />
substituted for the Leaders own work, but it has been a very useful adjunct<br />
to . that work.<br />
J: Prime Minister, do you have any plans to meet with Dr Mahathir?<br />
PM: I met him today and I have since done a press conference about that.<br />
J: So, can I Just go back to that question about the rifle sales to Thailand, did<br />
you talk about that, did you get any Informatlon about that?.<br />
PM: No, he said that apparently some parliamentarians in Australia had made<br />
. some reference to rifles, were Thailand to buy rifles from Australian being<br />
passed across to other forces and I told him this wasn't the view of the<br />
government and that we didn't put any weight on that view at all.<br />
J: Did he then say that he would lift any restrictions on possible sales </p>
<p>I L<br />
PM: There are no restrictions to lift I don't believe.<br />
J: Do you expect sales will go ahead successfully?<br />
PM: I don't know, but who knows. I mean, all the world tenders for these sorts of<br />
things.<br />
J: What is President Clinton's assessment of the recent mid-term<br />
congressional elections?<br />
PM: I think his views were very ably expressed in his Georgetown speech, I<br />
mean more comprehensively than he expressed them today and I think it Is<br />
obviously leading to some rethinking of his political positioning in the United<br />
States, but again some of the more what one may say intuitive views he put,<br />
I think, were put In the context of a private meeting.<br />
J: What were his views for example on getting the GATT through the<br />
Congress?<br />
PM: We didn't discuss It. I think he would think, as I do, that getting the GATT<br />
through was central to the US's role In the world In terms of the International<br />
trading community. So, It just never arose as any point of discussion.<br />
J: Australia's exports to all APEC countries are growing, but ASEAN<br />
Interregional trade is growing faster than that, so Australia is losing market<br />
share. Does that concern you, have you brought up that with any of the<br />
ASEAN leaders that you have met?<br />
PM: I don't quite understand the. question, just put it again.<br />
J: Interregional ASEAN trade Is growing extremely fast, cutting Australia's<br />
market access.<br />
PM: Inter-ASEAN trade.<br />
J: Yes, does that concern you, have you brought that up with any of the<br />
ASEAN leaders.<br />
PM: Well, they have got a free trade agreement. They have got an agreement<br />
called AFTA and one would. hope that that would have the effect of<br />
speeding up intra-ASEAN trade. We trade with ASEAN countries on a<br />
bilateral basis and also we trade Into the Asia-Pacific more broadly and as<br />
you know, there Is a very lively debate now between us about whether<br />
Australia and New Zealand should join AFTA. This would be a good 1 </p>
<p>development I think, but it would seem to me fairly normal that Intra-ASEAN<br />
trade is growing given the fact that they have a policy there to make it grow.<br />
Are we upset about that? No more than they would be upset about CER<br />
between Australia and New Zealand.<br />
J: That would be concern though, if you are losing market share?<br />
PM: It is not a concern that Is keeping me awake at night I can tell you.<br />
J: Prime Minister, can you tell us a bit about your discussions with President<br />
Soeharto<br />
PM: He was in a very good frame of mind, I think, and feeling that he Is gradually<br />
winning the day on his communique and, I think, appreciated the role<br />
Australia has played in backing him In because I told him and I told you we<br />
would stick with him absolutely In this communique, So, to say relations<br />
have never been better Is to understate, I would say.<br />
J: You spoke with President Clinton about an action plan for free trade to be<br />
discussed does that mean that basically you have only got to nail down a<br />
couple of details tomorrow<br />
PM: No, tomorrow's meeting will decide amongst other things where we meet<br />
next and what we do. Now, what we do obviously will be to start to think<br />
about some of the machinery to give effect to what we are now deciding<br />
and that Is what I meant by that remark.<br />
J: Mr Keating, you said President Soeharto is gradually winning the day who<br />
is yet to be won over?<br />
PM: I think we are at the point where there are few to be won over.. But; again,<br />
I'm not about making the winning over of people harder by making them the<br />
focus of attention.<br />
J: Mr Keating, can you comment a little more on how much comfort China has<br />
In getting WTO membership<br />
PM: Well, the fact that the communique. explicltly says that all members of APEC<br />
should be members of the WTO and the US signs on to that means that<br />
there Is a point of principle where the US Is saying that China should be part<br />
of the World. Trade-Organisation. -Now, there Is a negotiation still to be had<br />
and for any of us joining these bodies there are commitments to be given,<br />
obligations to be met for benefits to be gained. But, In principle, I think this<br />
is a very strong piece of paper for China and they understand that perfectly<br />
well. </p>
<p>* 7 J: the Chinese were saying at their press conferences that they still want a<br />
Sbit more comfort on the way the free trade agenda Is Implemented<br />
PM: They will be raising some of these things with the President, but it will be all<br />
in the wash tomorrow when you get the communique.<br />
ends </p>
