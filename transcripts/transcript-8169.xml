PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, BEAUFORT HOTEL, DARWIN,<br />
OCTOBE 1990<br />
3 &amp; a 03 PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke are you aware of reports that the<br />
Malaysian Prime Minister has ordered the Australian<br />
Ambassador In to be carpeted over the Australian series<br />
Embassy? PM4: Yes I've seen the report and I Just want to say<br />
these things, about It. Firstly, I haven't had the<br />
opportunity of, at this stage, talking with my people.<br />
I'll do that, in the near future. Secondly, I want to say<br />
that, of course, the ABC is a totally independent<br />
Organisation of the Government. We don't control the<br />
ABC, in fact, you might have noticed that at times the<br />
ABC has ever, been critical of me. Thirdly, I can assure<br />
my friend, Dr Mahatir, that no offence would ever have<br />
been intended towards himself, his Government, or the<br />
people of Malaysia but I will get a full report on it-<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, there's a report in this morning's<br />
press that Abu Nidal was somehow responsible for the<br />
sailors being told not to wear their uniforms. Is that<br />
correct? PM: You'll appreciate that I never have and never can<br />
comment on secret intelligence matters and I don't intend<br />
to on this occasion.<br />
3OURNALIST: Is there any evidence that they're operating<br />
at all in Australia?<br />
PM: You heard my answer.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, since you last expressed your<br />
optimism about the economy there's been a report from<br />
your own Government that the figures are showing the<br />
worst bankruptcies, consumer and business bankruptcies,<br />
in five years. Have you any comment to make on those<br />
figures? PM: I'll simply repeat what I've said in the Parliament<br />
which Is indisputably the fact. Firstly, that while<br />
there is pain in the community, which I regret has been<br />
necessary, the tact is that this country is not anywhere </p>
<p>2.<br />
near in as bad a recession shape as it was in 1982-3 when<br />
we ca ms to office and rescued this country from the worst<br />
recession in 50 years. Doesn't matter what statiStiC you<br />
look at.* Whether It's employment, you'd had five<br />
quarters of negative employment growth then. Now you<br />
haven' t got negative employment growth. Whether you look<br />
at investment, whatever statistics you look at it was<br />
much worse then. We've had to slow the economy down<br />
because we were bringing in at pre-existing levels of<br />
activity an unsustainably high level of imports.<br />
Fortunately, it seems now that the Impact of the tight<br />
policies that we've had to impose have had sufficient an<br />
effect. As I've said with the easing of monetary policy<br />
now I think we will. see as we go into 91 the sort of<br />
recovery in the economy that we want to see.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there a danger of the property market<br />
Ooverheating after yesterday's drop in home loan interest<br />
rates?<br />
PH: Not overheating. It had dropped very considerably,<br />
as you know. Therem will be some recovery I think. The<br />
easing of monetary policy was necessary because we'd gone<br />
as far as was nece13sary to slow the economy generally but<br />
as I say I think there will be some recovery in property<br />
prices. JOURNALIST: Is there more short term relief on the way<br />
for home owners?<br />
PM: We are not making any commitments about further<br />
movements. I thinkI we've shown in 1990 with the five<br />
drops we've had now in rates since January that we have<br />
been prepared to be flexible in the conduct of monetary<br />
policy. We mustn't be irresponsible. We can't afford a<br />
Osituation where you drop rates that low that you run the<br />
risk of turning the economy to such a high level of<br />
activity that we'd have the same current account deficit<br />
problems that we had to deal with before.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke<br />
PM: Just a minute. There are a number of other people.<br />
You've had three. Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are the banks being flexible enough?<br />
PH: There was some evidence, as you know, that the banks<br />
perhaps weren't as quickly as we thought they should have<br />
been translating the falls in official rates through to<br />
rates to their customers. That they may have been trying<br />
to adjust the significant book losses they'd had from<br />
some of their corporate decisions. As my friend and<br />
colleague, Paul Keating, has said the evidence now does<br />
seem to suggest that they are getting now back to more<br />
appropriate procedures. We certainly hope that that's<br />
the case. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Do you think next week's airline<br />
deregulation weill result in real competition?<br />
PM: It has already. You could see that there have been<br />
significant cuts in airfares round Australia as they are<br />
getting ready for that deregulated environment. That's<br />
what we expect~ ed would happen. It's a remarkable thing<br />
about AustraliLan politics and it's relevant to say it<br />
here in this electoral context here. The great hypocrisy<br />
of Australian politics is that the conservative parties<br />
whatever name they happen to go under. They change their<br />
names as frequently, and you know about that up here, as<br />
other people change their clothes. The conservative<br />
parties are the parties In Australian politics who have<br />
talked about competition, free competition, creating free<br />
competition, getting the market going. They presided in<br />
this country over the throttling policy of a two airline<br />
policy which mesant that there was no competition. It<br />
took my Goverarment to bring that two airline policy to an<br />
end and as a result the people of Australia are going to<br />
be the beneficiaries of that.<br />
JOURNALIST: There are complaints that some of the budget<br />
airfares advertised aren't available.<br />
PM: Well I don't run the airlines. What I do is to<br />
create the environment within which without any doubt<br />
there are now occurring round Australia significant falls<br />
In airf ares.<br />
JOURNALIST: In relation to the Territory election.<br />
Mr Hawke. Do you think it's legitimate for Marshall<br />
Perron to have used the forthcoming Premiers' Conference<br />
in Brisbane as what he calls the catalyst for this<br />
election? PM: There've been many pieces of hypocrisy of which<br />
conservative politicians in the Northern Territory have<br />
been guilty. Marshall Perron with this one just about<br />
takes the cake. He says he's called the election to seek<br />
a mandate going to the Premiers' Conference. This is an<br />
absolute nonsense. In fact, if anything, he's reduced<br />
the effectiveness with which a Government of the Northern<br />
Territory can go to the Conference cause it may be that<br />
the result of the election wouldn't be known by the time<br />
we go into the Conference. Although I think it will be<br />
and that Terry and the Labor Party will be forming the<br />
Government. But that runs that considerable risk. Now<br />
he's created a quite false set of expectations as to what<br />
the Premiers' Conference is about. That he's going to<br />
come there an~ d talk about Aboriginal affairs, about<br />
ATSIC. Those Sort of things aren't on the agenda. It's<br />
important to note that every other Premier and Chief<br />
Minister is taking this Special Premiers' Conference<br />
very, very seriously indeed. In saying that I refer not<br />
merely to my Labor Party colleagues but I particularly<br />
and Specifically include Nick Greiner, the Liberal<br />
Premier of New South Wales. None of them are playing </p>
<p>politics with this. They're going in there, we've had<br />
significant discussions. we're going in there to try and<br />
ensure that constructively and cooperatively together we<br />
can deal with issues where there is overlap of functions.<br />
Deal with questions of microeconomic reform and so onl.<br />
Now not one leader in Australia has attempted to play<br />
politics with this except Marshall Perron. The people of<br />
the Northern Territory, I think, ought to be disgusted<br />
with the way in which in regard to this historic move,<br />
this Special Premiers' Conference, so regarded by my<br />
political colleagues and my political opponents, a very,<br />
very important move. All this man here can do is to play<br />
politics with it and in so doing, to some extent,<br />
PreJudice the interests of the people of the Northern<br />
Territory. A thoroughly despicable move.<br />
O JpOrUeRpNaArLeIdS Tt: o aMdrd rHeaswsk et, h e whiislseue yoouf ' rteh e hBearer unwgoau lds tyaotue mebnet<br />
painting? PM: I've already done that. I've had the communication<br />
from those concerned. They've said it's appropriate that<br />
it should be kepot in Canberra.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Perron has called for a relief to petrol<br />
Pticas in the Northern Territory.<br />
PM: When does t: his man stop playing politics. I mean he<br />
just happens to have an election coming up. So he sends<br />
me off a letter which everyone who knows anything about<br />
the situation knows is a stack of nonsense. We have a<br />
position where t: he price of crude oil is thoroughly<br />
volatile. It moved frqm US$ 20 per barrel before the Gulf<br />
crisis went up to over 40 now it's back down in the<br />
O of volatile Yporui cdeosn ' tl ikceo ndtuhcatt. ecTohneo mmiucc hp omloircey osne nstihbe lebasis<br />
approach to that is what has been adopted by my friend<br />
and ministerial colleague, Bob Collins. After<br />
consultation with his friends here in the Northern<br />
Territory to say well look there may be some questions<br />
about petrol pricing across the north of Australia<br />
generally would we be prepared to look at that. We have.<br />
We've got a comnittee there that he's now establishing of<br />
parliamentary representatives. All of them, of course,<br />
Labor Party because we represent the north of Australia.<br />
We'll look forward as a Government to the work of that<br />
committee to sea if there are some things that we may be<br />
able to do to fine tune policy in regard to petrol policy<br />
and help. That's the way to do it. Sensibly like that<br />
and not to play ridiculous politics like Marshall Perron<br />
is now.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Smith says he's calling, if elected,<br />
he'll call on the Federal Government to help support a<br />
railway from Alice Springs to Darwin.<br />
PM: If they want to approach us on that. We will always<br />
listen to what the Government of the Northern Territory </p>
<p>hiR Mn say. There have been approaches before. At the<br />
time when we were approached before it didn't, on the<br />
basis of the approach that was made to us, look to be<br />
viable. But there may have been some changes since then<br />
that Terry waints to put to us after assuming Government.<br />
I would always listen to what he had to say. For<br />
Instance, also, he's got some ideas about reducing the<br />
impact of electricity charges here in the Northern<br />
Territory. Perhaps by charging me and the Coummonwealth a<br />
bit more and his own Government facilities so that that<br />
could then bek hypothecated to reducing electricity.<br />
charges to domestic consumers. Now these sort of things<br />
together, may I say, with the idea of the form of the<br />
Treasury operations, which he's suggesting, shows an<br />
imaginative and vital approach to government for the<br />
Northern Territory. In regard to the Treasury<br />
Corporation Idea there what Terry is saying is that there<br />
are ways in which you can get significant savings over<br />
and above what's done now. Where each utility or<br />
facility goes about the business of working out it's own<br />
fundraising and then doing it through private merchant<br />
banks or the like. Now the Idea he has in mind Is<br />
imaginative and more in line with what's been done in New<br />
South Wales and Queensland. Where it would be done<br />
centrally and the Treasury Corporation would itself do<br />
the operation of raising those funds. In that way it<br />
could be a significant saving to the Territory. So all<br />
these sorts of things show that Terry and those around<br />
him have approached this question very seriously. You've<br />
got the great: contrast between Terry Smith and Labor.<br />
They're not trying to play politics in this election.<br />
They are saying you've had a long period of conservative<br />
Government here and it really has degenerated into a<br />
Pathetic sort: of Government over the years here. Against<br />
O tphoalti tiacnsd. wheIrnet rdoeduscpienrga terlayc e thienyt o ariet btyr yicnogm pltoe tepllyay<br />
misrepresenting the nature of ATSIC saying that ATSIC is<br />
the fourth tier of government. There's not a<br />
conservative politician round Australia who's said that.<br />
In fact, I pay credit to the other conservative parties<br />
around AustrEalia who have responded positively to my call<br />
to say let's be bipartisan in the approach to this<br />
fundamentally important issue of how constructively we<br />
deal with our Aboriginal friends. How we try and get a<br />
decent constructive effective relationship. But again In<br />
the whole political spectrum there's one man and one<br />
party that stands out. That's Marshall Perron and those<br />
around him here who've introduced this nasty element of<br />
racism into the election. For which they have properly<br />
received the rebuke of a wide range of unpolitical people<br />
in this country. Now that's the sort of choice you've<br />
got. A man and a party who are about issues how are you<br />
going to Improve the conditions of the people in the<br />
Territory andi those who are desperately, whether it be In<br />
regard to the Premiers' Conference, ATSIC, petrol prices,<br />
just treating Northern Territorians as though they were </p>
<p>6.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Elawke just on a lighter note. Who would<br />
you* be backing in the Caulfield Cup?<br />
PM: Very, very difficult. I'll tell you what I think<br />
the chances are. Then if you force me to I'll try and<br />
pick one. The chances I think are Sydeston, I think<br />
Sh~ zohra, Solar Circle and there's one down the list.<br />
It'l11 come to me in a minute.<br />
JOURNALIST: You know that you can bet on the Territory<br />
election at the races here today?<br />
PMO: No I don't bet I just help to get the result. I<br />
think Terry's a good bet. I confine my betting to the<br />
gallops.<br />
O hJeOrMeR AtLoI STTe: r ryW ewliln. n ihnogw tihmlpe oretlaenctt iodon ? you see your visit<br />
PM: I don't want to overstate it. They've been kind<br />
enough to say that it could be of some assistance. I<br />
hope it will be. Essentially what the people of the<br />
Northern Territory have got is a very clear choice<br />
between a tired Government. Proof of it's tiredness and<br />
laec of policies is, as I say, these red herrings. The<br />
introduction of race, the complete misrepresentation<br />
about the Special Premiers' Conference, the nonsense<br />
about petrol pricings. Those are the signs of a tired,<br />
irrelevant Government. Against that you've got a<br />
vibrant, imaginative group of people led by Terry who<br />
really are about wanting to deal with real issues. If in<br />
any way I can assist in getting those issues somewhat<br />
clearer in the miLnds of~ yoters well I'll be happy.<br />
