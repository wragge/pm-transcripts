MACQUAF. IE NETWORK WEEKLY BROADCAST<br />
BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON.<br />
WILLIAM McMAHON, C, MP<br />
EDUCATION AND CHILD CARE<br />
Interviewer: Paul Lynch 1.4 SEPTEMBER 1972<br />
Q. Prime Minister, in the Budget Speech of Mr<br />
Snedden last month, it was announced that the amount the<br />
Commonwealth Government will spend on education is to be<br />
$ 426 million, which is an increase of approximately<br />
per cent on the figures for the current year. First<br />
of all, why have you decided on such a large increase<br />
per cent -for education?<br />
PM: Because we give education very high priority in<br />
our social welfare programme and we think that every<br />
Australian in every Australian school is entitled to a<br />
decent education. That is why we agreed to the increase<br />
of $ 72 million in this year.<br />
Q. How is the extra $ 72 million to be spent?<br />
PM: In very many ways. Probably the first one I<br />
should mention is the universities and colleges of<br />
advanced education. That is, we make grants to the States<br />
so that assistance can be given in these two quarters.<br />
We are also giving very substantial assistance to the<br />
States relating to capital grants for school construction,<br />
secondary school science laboratories and libraries,<br />
technical colleges and teachers' colleges, and we are<br />
also giving ner capita grants for independent schools.<br />
Could I go back a little and just remind you that on May<br />
11, of course. we embarked on a totally new programme when<br />
we decided to give unmatched capital grants for the public<br />
schools and per capita grants of about.... oh, a substantial<br />
amount that would take up to 40 per cent of the cost of<br />
educating a child at a private school. / 2<br />

Q. Prime Minister, you put one fot in the pool of<br />
child care pre-school child care with this current<br />
Budget. You announced that you will spend $ 5 million to<br />
benefit children from low-income and other special need<br />
families. What is the thinking behind that?<br />
PM: We believe that people in need who have to go to<br />
work and who have children have a right to have those<br />
children looked after while they are at work. And, consequently,<br />
we have given priority for admission to kiddies who are in<br />
special need. That is in the case of single parent families<br />
and to the children of sick and incapacitated people. Mow!<br />
what we have done here e have given a subsidy so that the<br />
cost to the person sending the child to the school can be<br />
reduced. W-will give unmatched capital grants to non-profit<br />
organisations so that they can equip the schools and we will<br />
also provide staff subsidies. In other words, this is<br />
concentrating on the area of greatest need and to ensure that<br />
the kiddy is looked after.<br />
Q. Earlier I used the phrase " putting a foot in the<br />
pool," Prime Minister because it has been suggested by<br />
organisations such as the Women's Electoral Lobby that you<br />
could go much further in this area. Could you see that<br />
happening in future years and in future Budgets?<br />
PM: Yes, of course I could, but do you mean child<br />
care, or...<br />
Q. Yes, child care.<br />
PM: Child care... well, this is a good start, and so far<br />
as I can make out-and I was one of those who pushed this<br />
relentlessly to ensure that it came into the Budget-I believe<br />
it is a very, very good start, but of course we would only<br />
regard it as the beginning of a process.<br />
Q. P'. de Minister, the matter of giving State aid to<br />
private schools is still a controversial one. We have had a<br />
number of calls on this statbn from people calling in saying<br />
the Government should not do this because it steps over the<br />
margin of separation there should be between Church and State.<br />
What is your response to that?<br />
PM: I don't agree with that. My attitude is clear and<br />
so is the attitude of the Government. And I stated it a few<br />
moments ago. We believe in giving aid to all children,<br />
irrespective of their denomination or whether they go to a<br />
church school or not, whether they go to a public school or<br />
whether they go to an independent school. And why shouldn't we?<br />
They are Australian kiddies. They are entitled to be looked<br />
after. They are entitled to have a good education. / 3 1 </p>
<p>Q. Arnd you feel if there were no State aid for these<br />
children, they would in fact be penalised?<br />
PM: Well their fam~ ilies would obviously be severely<br />
penalised, and in many, many cases, the kiddies themselves<br />
would bc ponalised. But I ., onder if I can come back to one<br />
of the s'it-jects you mentioned earlier of what we were doing,<br />
because I think there are two areas where; it is not yet<br />
understood about the kind of assistance we are giving and<br />
the extent of it. And that is in universities that is,<br />
the scholarships at universities that we have increased to<br />
20,500 per annum, and in the case of secondary scholarships<br />
where we have increased them from 10,000 to 25, OO0per annum.<br />
I think more should be known abhout these scholarship because<br />
it will be of great help to the people who will be able to<br />
go, not only for the secondary scholarshipq but for the open<br />
entrance university scholarships, the later year scholarships<br />
and the advanced education scholarships. This is a wonderful<br />
reform. Prime Minister, thank you very much. </p>
