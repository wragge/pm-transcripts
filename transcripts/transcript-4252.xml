FOR PRESS SAT. 9 OCTOBER 1.976<br />
ADDRESS AT THE SPECIAL SESSION OF THE HOUSE OF THE<br />
PEOPLE'S REPRESENTATIVES OF THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA<br />
I am delighted to be here in Indonesia, at the invitation of<br />
President Soeharto, during my first year of office as<br />
Prime Minister of Australia.<br />
I am grateful for the honour you have extended to me, and<br />
through me to the Australian Government and peop. e, by your<br />
invitation to address you th-is morning. I am especially<br />
grateful as I believe that you have opened your present<br />
sitting early to allow me to do so.<br />
I am pleased to have the opportunity, : n addition to my<br />
important discussions with the President and other<br />
Government leaders, to meet with other representatives of the<br />
Indonesian people.<br />
Let me say to you at the outset that it is a fundamental<br />
foreign policy objective of the Australian Government to<br />
consolidate, to strengthen, and to develop further in the years<br />
ahead, a close, cordial and cooperative relationship<br />
between Australian and Indonesia. I personally place<br />
the highest importance on a stable and soundly based friendship<br />
bet:; een our two countries. Let me stress too that this<br />
basic objective, has, I believe, the strong support of<br />
the overwhelming majority of the Australian people.<br />
As a nation of 130 million people, with a rich cultural background<br />
and vast natural resources, strategically placed between<br />
the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, Indonesia is an important<br />
nation in global terms.<br />
We are neighbours by virtue of geography. But the quality of<br />
that relationship is the result of a commitment on both our<br />
parts to foster that well-established and mature relationship<br />
which has grown up a relationship which can contribute<br />
much to a peaceful and stable South East Asian region.<br />
Our two countries are very different in culture and history.<br />
Australia is a relatively developed continent of European<br />
origin and cultural traditions. Your country is a developing<br />
island ch: ian with its own deeply rooted culture. These very<br />
differences between oir two societies make possible rich and<br />
mutually valuable relationships. / 2 </p>
<p>Despite the obvious differences in our two countries<br />
we have a number of interests in common. We both have<br />
fundamental interests in maintaining the independence and<br />
territorial integrity of our countries. We both seek to advance<br />
the prosperity and further development of our countries<br />
to encourage conditions in which our people can build<br />
a decent life for themselves and their children.<br />
Both Australia and Indonesia share an important interest in<br />
stability in South East Asia. We both wish to keep great<br />
power competition out of the region, or at least to ensure<br />
that if there is competition it is limited to peaceful<br />
competition. We both have an important interest in a world<br />
economic environment which provides opportunities for<br />
all nations to develop their trade and grow in prosperity.<br />
A stable and prosperous Indonesia and a stable and prosperous<br />
Australia can make a major contribution to the stability and<br />
prosperity of the region as a whole.<br />
The recorded history of our contacts goes back for a long time,<br />
although it must be said that for large parts of this period,<br />
we remained rather remote neighbours. Your early<br />
seamen knew of Australia when it was still a mythical land to the<br />
Europeans and the explorer Matthew Flinders exchanged friendly<br />
greetings with a party of Makassar men voyaging in search of<br />
trade in 1802.<br />
The events of the Second World War served to bring home to<br />
Australians the importance of Indonesia as our closest<br />
neighbour. In July 1947 Australia de facto recognised<br />
the Republican Government of Indonesia. The Australian<br />
Foreign Minister at that time, Dr Evatt, worked to mobilise<br />
international opinion on behalf of Indonesia. The<br />
conditions were established for a transfer of sovereignty from the<br />
Dutch to the Republic of Indonesia on 27 December 1949.<br />
Australia recognised the new state on the same day.<br />
In a message of congratulations the Australian Prime Minister,<br />
Sir Robert Menzies, stated that as a new neighbour<br />
Australia had a deep and constant interest in the well-being<br />
and prosperity of Indonesia and looked forward to the most<br />
intimate and friendly relations with the new state.<br />
From these historical roots, Australians and Indonesians<br />
have grown to know one another with tolerance and understanding.<br />
Some 2,800 Indonesian students have studied in Australian<br />
universities and colleges, with the help of Australian Government<br />
scholarships provided under the Colombo Plan. During the<br />
last ten years, a further 2,000 private students came to<br />
Australia. They have learnt to know us well and we have learnt<br />
about your country from them. I hope they have also<br />
learnt to become good engineers, and teachers and doctors.<br />
Almost 900, including private students, are with us at the<br />
present time.<br />
With the growing awareness in Australia that our progress is<br />
linked with the progress of our neighbours, the South East<br />
Asian region has become a focus oF Australia's ' international<br />
cultural interests. Of the 1.1 cultural agreements which 1 </p>
<p>Australia has signed, four are with South East Asian<br />
countries--Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.<br />
As you will know I have recently visited Japan and China.<br />
These are two major powers to which Australia continues to<br />
attach importance. During my visit to Japan I was seeking<br />
ways to broaden further our relationship beyond our mutual<br />
economic interests and to develop 4i deeper understanding<br />
between Australia and Japan.<br />
On my visit to China I was seeking to expand communication<br />
and understanding between Australia and China after a<br />
generation of lost contact and suspicion. I also wanted<br />
to explore with Chinese leaders their attitude to South East<br />
Asia because it is my belief that it is in everybody's<br />
interests if China can be en,-couraged to widen its cooperation<br />
and its relations with the Governments of South East Asia.<br />
In our relations with Indonesia there has been no generation<br />
of lost contact to bridge as there has been with China.<br />
With Indonesia there has been no tendency-towards excessive<br />
emphasis on our economic links.<br />
Our objective in respect of Indones-ia is to cement the close<br />
relationship and the understanding which already exists after<br />
three decades of patient effort on both sides.<br />
The understanding which we both seek: and the close<br />
cooperative relationship of mutual confidence we both want,<br />
will not just' develop because geographically we are neighbours.<br />
We both need to work towards an irreversible relationship<br />
of soundly-based mutual understanding and friendship.<br />
The development of relationships and contacts in general in<br />
the areas that I have mentioned has not been without<br />
its problems. This was to be expected, given the differences<br />
in our history and our social and cultural backgrounds.<br />
But our shared interests and the will that exists in both<br />
countries to overcome these problems hais enabled us to settle<br />
issuesJ when they have arisen and to concentrate on<br />
improving our understanding of each other.<br />
So far as the Timor question is concerned, I do not wish<br />
to retrace the history of that issue now. The Foreign Minister<br />
has fully and clearly set out our viewpoint on a number of<br />
occasions. All I need to-. say is * that w-. e recognise that it is<br />
a complex question, greatly complicated by the rapid changes<br />
in Portugal and the breakdown in that country's control and<br />
administration of East Timor.<br />
The important thing now is to look to the future, and to<br />
alleviate, so far as possible, the human suffering w-. hich<br />
CiAne with the fighting and associated disruption in the territory.<br />
Auastralia has already indicated that it is prepared to help<br />
with this humanitarian task. We have already made over<br />
A$ 80,000 available through the Indonesian Red Cross and<br />
a further A$ 2S0, OOO will be made available as required. 14 </p>
<p>Another aspect of the human suffering caused by the conflict<br />
has been the plight of refugees, Many came to australia, often<br />
without their families. I am pleased that we have agreed<br />
that officials of our two countries will be meeting to discuss<br />
the question to see what should be done.<br />
As I see it, my discussions with your President have provided<br />
us both with the opportunity to air our views and explain our<br />
policy positions openly and frankly. That we have been able<br />
to do so in such a way is the real test of the muturity of<br />
the relationship between Indonesia andiAustralia.<br />
I am conFidetnt that future generations will benefit from the<br />
steady development between our two countries of our enduring<br />
relationships of mutual understanding, respect and friendship.<br />
Australia aindIndonesia share certain vital foreign policy<br />
objectives, especially the objective of a stable and secure<br />
South East Asian region, increasing in prosperity, and the<br />
objective of a widening network of contacts between our two<br />
countries. We have learned that we should net take each other<br />
for-granted.<br />
I would like to see my visit in the context of our close and<br />
cooperative relationship based on mutual respect and common<br />
interest in regional stability and progress.<br />
I have read President Soeharto's address to this body<br />
on 17 August. In that address President Soeharto spoke<br />
of the sacrifices and the triumph of independence and of the<br />
enormous challenge of attaining the ideal of a just and<br />
prosperous society, which by stages will provide progress<br />
and a just and equitable well-being" to all. Ile also spoke<br />
of this society as one in which all groups could work<br />
together in harmony and with mutual respect, as part<br />
of one great national family. Your President pointed<br />
to the real achievements which have already been made<br />
in rural development, in communications, in education,<br />
in health, in family welfare. These achievements have<br />
provided a solid base for future development.<br />
I noted in your President's speech that Indonesia looks to<br />
the generation of sufficient domestic resources to enable<br />
a significant reduction in the role of foreign economic<br />
assistance in the future.<br />
We appreciate your aim ultimately to support your development<br />
from your own resources. Until you feel that that time has<br />
arrived, Australia as a friend and neighbour is certainly<br />
willing to support your efforts through continuing economic<br />
assistance. Our assistance to Indonesia has a high priority in the<br />
allocation of development assistance resources. You will know<br />
that despite continuing pressures on Australia's financial<br />
resources, we have been able to increase development assistance<br />
to Indonesia over the three year period which commenced last June<br />
to A$ 86 million. This is an increase of nearly 25 percent<br />
on the A$ 69 million pledged for the three year period<br />
which ended last June. </p>
<p>Wle appreciate Indonesia' s wish to invest in development<br />
without placing too heavy a burden of debt on future<br />
generations. For our part, Australian assistance to<br />
Indonesia is all in grant form.<br />
The transfer of capital, technology and expertise<br />
between Australia and Indonesia occurs not only at the official<br />
level, but is also promoted by private : investment.<br />
The Indonesian Government has approved 46 Australian proposals<br />
for joint ventures which togcther represent a joint commitment<br />
of some A$ 156 million. I am happy to see that most of<br />
these are working orn a joint venture basis in cooperation<br />
with an Indonesian partner in sectors which are important<br />
to Indonesia's economic development. In our owna development<br />
we. have made it clear to investors in other countries that<br />
joint ventures are particularly welcome.<br />
Economic cooperation between our two countries has also<br />
grown in the area of commodity trade. We are both major<br />
exporters of commodities and this is-a subject on which<br />
vie might usefully exchange views more fully in the future<br />
than we have i-n the past. The Australian economy, like<br />
Indonesia's relies to a large extent on the export of certain<br />
raw materials and we have a common interest in stable world<br />
markets and appropriate prices for these commodities.<br />
Trade is increasing* between our two countries although<br />
there are areas in which each side may need to exercise<br />
measures of regulation to safeguard domestic interests and<br />
employment. In the-field of communications, our<br />
contacts will, I hope, continue to develop.<br />
1 am pleased that our two airlines, Qantas and Garuda, have just<br />
agreed to raise to six the number of flights each airline<br />
operates each week between our two countries. A year ago,<br />
there were only eight frequencies operated by Qantas and Garuda.<br />
Now there are already twelve.<br />
Another of our joint concerns is for the peace and security of<br />
the South East Asian region of which we are both a part.<br />
Defence cooperation with Indonesia has now a considerable<br />
history and dates back for more than a decade. Our interests<br />
have been to strengthen and broaden. ties between our two<br />
countries and the programme of cooperation has progressively<br />
developed s ince the first three year programme.<br />
This programme was given a major impetus when I was Minister<br />
for Defence in 1969. In that time,, the Australian Government<br />
approved a range of detailed proposals to expand our defence<br />
cooperation with Indonesia.<br />
The new proposals included not only a wide variety of<br />
training but also exchange visits of service officers,, staff<br />
colleges anid naval vessels, and notably the Indonesian request<br />
for assistance in the mapping of West Kalimantan the first<br />
large project which Australia undertook in Indonesia, and<br />
one which led to subsequent Mapping Project--covering<br />
Sumatra and Irian Jaya. ./ 6 </p>
<p>The previous Australian Government undertook to establish<br />
a second three year programme. This is now being<br />
undertaken by my Government with a budget of A$ 25 million.<br />
The main th-rust of this new prograi-ine is to assist<br />
Indonesia in i. ncreasing its mnaritiimie surveillance capability.<br />
It is a programme which is in our continuing joint interests.<br />
have said enough, I am sure, to leave you in no doubt<br />
about the importance of the Australia/ Indonesia relationship,,<br />
and the desire of my Government to expand and enhance ta<br />
relationship. My Government bases its fundamental approach to relations<br />
with Indonesia on the fact that it is essential for both<br />
nations to maintain a close cooperative and solidly based<br />
relationship with each other.<br />
Indeed, the need to sustain and cultivate such a relationship<br />
has become, after three decades, what might be described,<br />
as a constant factor in our foreign policy. This need is<br />
unlikely to diminish with the years, nor is it likely to<br />
be denied by any political party in Australia. My Government<br />
regards it as one of the most important and substantial strands<br />
in the whole complex web of Australia's foreign relations.<br />
Indoneszia has an important stra" Legic position between -the<br />
Indian anc' the Pacific Oceans. The Malacca and the Sunda<br />
Straits, are major international waterways.<br />
These links between the Oceans are of great significance<br />
to Indonesia, and the), are also of great significance to<br />
many other countries. We believe it is important that<br />
adequate passage rights should be guaranteed through these<br />
waterways. The reassurances your Government has given us on this<br />
point have made it possible for us to support the Indonesian<br />
'? archipelagic concept" during the recent Law of the Sea Conference.<br />
South East Asia, because of proximity and historical associations<br />
has long been an area of close Australian concern and<br />
involvement. Because of this strategic significance, it is<br />
of great concern to many nations. It is in both our<br />
interests that South East Asia should not become in the future<br />
an area of great power rivalry, that relations between states<br />
should be peaceful and cooperative, and that political changre<br />
in South East Asia should not provide occasions for the-assertion<br />
of a dominant role in South East Asia by any country.<br />
The ASEAN proposals for a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality<br />
were born out of a desire to avert the possibility that<br />
South East Asia might become an area of great power rivalry.<br />
The proposals aimed to create conditions in which the countries<br />
of the region can achieve peaceful development, regional harmony an<br />
stability. We strongly support the basic objective of the region to<br />
prevent its domination by any major power.<br />
Australia's policy in the South East Asian region will be<br />
guided by ro.; ponsible and1 respon1sive approach to the region.<br />
By responsible I mean the Australian Government will take<br />
account of the interests of the countries of South East Asia 7 </p>
<p>in formulating policics which might affect its ncightbours.<br />
By responsive I mean that we shall be sensitive<br />
to the developmental and other needs of the countries of<br />
ASEAN in their effo-rts to consolidate regional stability.<br />
From Australia's perspective, the creation of ASEAN<br />
an orgnisation which has grown out of the South East Asian<br />
region itself, in response to its own needs and experiencehas<br />
been one of the most important developmenls in South East<br />
Asia to occur in the last decade.<br />
In a relatively short time, ASEAN has shown its vitality.<br />
ASEAN has demonstrated the political will to forge further economic,<br />
social and cultural links among-its m'embers, and at this<br />
year' s Bali conference, the framework was established<br />
which will give firm support to ASEAN's aspirations.<br />
ASEAN undoubtedly has a capacity to develop and make its own<br />
contribution to the stability of the South East Asian region<br />
as a whole.<br />
The changes that have taken place in South East Asia have<br />
inevitably brought a period of uncertainty and anxiety.<br />
Australia would hope that the emergence of new tensions<br />
and division in South East Asia can be avoided. For this<br />
reason,. we welcomed the constructive and forthcoming way<br />
in which the members of ASEAN showed their readiness to<br />
establish friendly -relations with -the new Governments of<br />
Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia last year. We, for our part,<br />
have contributed aid to recovery in this area. We have<br />
however been disappointed at the lack of understanding certain<br />
Indo-China states have of ASEAN's basic objectives.<br />
We would like to see the three countries o: E Indo-China drawn<br />
into a peaceful and cooperative role in our part of the world.<br />
Australia will seek to play a constructive role in the<br />
reduction of tensions and the resolution of disputes<br />
should they occur.<br />
The South Pacific region, which borders on South East Asia,<br />
is also of major importance to Australia. Wle are glad to see<br />
that the process of decolonisation in much of -the area is now<br />
well advanced. We hope that this process will continue and be<br />
accompanied by moves towards closer cooperation between<br />
the peoples who inhabit the region. In order to play our part<br />
in assisting the countries and territories of the South Pacific<br />
progress in their economic development, my Government has<br />
increased its aid to them.<br />
The new nation of Papua New Guinea occupies an extensive<br />
place in our relations with this part of the world and in<br />
Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and Australia have a mutual neighbour. / 8 </p>
<p>My own Government attaches great importance to assisting<br />
PalpuLa New Guinea in the process of nation building.<br />
Indonesia's strong support for P'apua New Guinea's<br />
independence and national unity closely accords with our<br />
own attitude. We welcome too the cooperation which has<br />
developed between You Mid your common neighbour, both before<br />
and especially since Papau New Guinea attained its independence.<br />
The future peaceful development and security of our region will<br />
inevitably be affected by the state of global relations<br />
between the superpowers. It is important that there should be a<br />
relaxation of tensions among the great powers. Unfortunately<br />
great power rivalry is still an element in world politics,<br />
and any shift in the global balance could have far reaching<br />
implications.<br />
There has been a widespread concern, expressed by a number<br />
of countries including the U. S. and all other NATO Powers<br />
that iTI. recent years some nations have built up their<br />
military capabilities beyond uses justified for defensive<br />
purposes. It is clear that some of the military activities<br />
in the Indian Ocean are part of this emerging pattern.<br />
As a result, and while the proposal for a neutral zone in<br />
the Indian Ocean is a noble ideal,, the reality is that it<br />
has little chance of success when viewed against the shift in the<br />
strategic balance in the North West sector of the Ocean.<br />
It would certainly not be in Australia's interests to see<br />
an uncontrolled build-up of naval forces in this region,<br />
and, what we advocate is a policy of balance and restraint<br />
the achievement of a balance at the lowest practical force<br />
levels. It is in this context that my Government has supported the<br />
expansion by the United States of Diego Garcia as a naval facility.<br />
In this way, we would hope to contribute to restoring the balance<br />
in the Indian Ocean.<br />
There are many complex economic problems that face today our<br />
countries domestically and internationally. Amongst these<br />
problems the major one is inflation.<br />
I know that Indonesia has in the past had' to grapple with<br />
inflation on a great scale. Although the policies followed by<br />
your Government under President SoehaIrto's leadership have<br />
reduced your rate of inflation dramatically, I am aware that<br />
the difficulty is not yet fully overcome. In Australia we<br />
have been suffering from the same problem.<br />
The eradication of inflation is one of the most urgent, if<br />
not the most urgent, tasks ofE my own Government.<br />
Internationally and domestically, inflation has had the samie<br />
effects. As business confidence and conditions deteriorated<br />
world trade declined and the economic recession slowly worsened. / 19 </p>
<p>The effects have been bad enough in Australia but in certain<br />
respects they were more keenly felt in the more vulnerablc<br />
economies of the developing world.<br />
The fail of commodity trade and prices of commodities reacted<br />
upon exporters of commodities in developing countries<br />
as well as those in developed countries such as Australia.<br />
Investment projects in all countries were held back or<br />
deferred because of the decline in business conditions<br />
and in confidence for the future.<br />
The extent to which our concerns are shared in this field<br />
are reflected in our common membership of certain international<br />
organisations. We are both members of organisations such<br />
as the International Bauxite Association the<br />
Inter-nationIal Tin Council and the Association of<br />
Copper Producing Countries<br />
Australia has long supported the idea of commodity<br />
agreements which could contribute to greater stability -in<br />
international commodity trade. Wle recognise the need for<br />
improvement in the conditions of world commodity trade, and<br />
have been disappointed with past efforts of the international<br />
community in this direction.<br />
Today, there is a call for a changed international economic<br />
system. We believe that there has not been sufficient analysis<br />
of the effects that some contemplated changE! s to the system<br />
might have. The re is a need to understand that the system is<br />
one thing, national policies another. We might find, on<br />
closer analysis, that the problem really lies with national<br />
policies rather than the system. If so, our conclusion must be<br />
that it is policies which require to be charged, not the<br />
international economic system itself.<br />
The kind of analysis I am talking about is of enormous<br />
importance because we must avoid the danger of raising hopes<br />
and expectations which cannot be fulfil1l. ed, If people<br />
believe that all problems can be solved by a simple change to<br />
the system, the failure of such an approach may lead to frustration<br />
and disillusion.<br />
We believe that the essential elements of the present economic<br />
system continue to, hold the greatest hope for economic progress.<br />
The Australian Government supports changes in economic<br />
policies affecting the international. economic system, which are<br />
both practical and viable, which serve the interdependent<br />
interests of both the developed, and the developing, nations.<br />
In our view, fundamental change of the sys; tem inoiy not always<br />
produce the desired results. The problems faced by the contemporary<br />
international economic system, are not basically caused by the<br />
system itself, but by some of the policies nations pursue<br />
within the system. it is these policies which should be changred,<br />
not the system itself. It seems to us that the first<br />
and foremost economic tLask is to s-cLure a return. to stale<br />
growth in real world output and employment. </p>
<p>In this way, developing countries will directly benefit<br />
from the upturn in world economic activity both as a<br />
result of an increase in trade and economic activity<br />
as well as in the improved ability of the<br />
developed countries to provide development assistance.<br />
We hope to see a cooperative approach to efforts to<br />
improve the international economic situation and to fulfil<br />
the aspirations of the developing countries. Your Government<br />
and mine are both pledged to participate fully in the<br />
international negotiations and discussions to this end.<br />
In conclusion, I would like to express my appreciation for<br />
-your invitation to me to address the House of People's<br />
Representatives today. I have greatly appreciated the<br />
generosity of the hospitality we have received, and for the<br />
opportunity to establish on this visit, a warm personal<br />
relationship with your President.<br />
President Soeharto and I have covered a very broad range<br />
of subjects in our discussion. Our talks have been valuable<br />
and very successful. They have affirmed once again, the<br />
strength of the friendship and understanding which exists<br />
between Australia and Indonesia.<br />
I look forward to being able to repay President Soeharto's<br />
hospitality in Australia, and continuing the relationship<br />
which has been established. I believe it will contribute<br />
to the lasting friendship Australia has with your country.<br />
Thank you for your courtesy today.<br />
