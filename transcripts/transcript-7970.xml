TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, RAMADA RENAISSANCE, SYDNEY<br />
16 MARCH 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: I have released today a paper which is proof<br />
positive of what I've been saying from the beginning of<br />
this campaign that a Party or a coalition which is not<br />
capable of governing itself is not capable of governing<br />
the country. We have the situation where after the last<br />
election I reduced the number of departments,<br />
Commonwealth, to 18 and now Mr Peacock is saying that<br />
he'll increase that to 25 or 26 he doesn't seem to be<br />
quite sure which. This is not an exercise in good<br />
Government. It is indeed the opposite. It is a<br />
reflection of the fact that the Liberals and National<br />
Party in a hypothetical government situation would not be<br />
able to live with 18 departmental situation because they<br />
could not cope with having a Minister, a senior Minister<br />
and a junior Minister from different parts of the<br />
coalition. The best proof of a way in which Mr Peacock<br />
and the Opposition have prepared to sacrifice the<br />
interests of this country, of course, comes from the<br />
critically important amalgamated Department of Foreign<br />
Affairs and Trade. Peacock's own words here are very<br />
revealing because he said of that amalgamation that he'd<br />
been an advocate of it beforehand and it's worked quite<br />
well, but he will abolish it. Why? Because historically<br />
you have a situation that the Liberals have always wanted<br />
Foreign Affairs and the National Party have wanted Trade<br />
and they simply did not have the strength, Mr Peacock did<br />
not have the strength to manage that situation. If<br />
there's ever been a time in which Australia's interest<br />
demands that the amalgamation continue, it is now of<br />
course, because trade issues are intrinsically bound up<br />
wifth our foreign relations and at this time in this year,<br />
1990, -we..-are-in-the final stages up-to-the end of 1990 in<br />
the important negotiations under the MTN Uruguay Round.<br />
These negotiations will determine the capacity of<br />
Australian industries to have access to freely, to<br />
international markets. And it is a time when it is<br />
absolutely imperative that the ministerial and<br />
bureaucratic structure of the amalgamated Foreign Affairs<br />
and Trade Departments be kept intact so that Australia's<br />
interests are advanced. It is an act of vandalism and<br />
politically criminal negligence to have a situation where<br />
because you can't control your own internal divisions you </p>
<p>2<br />
would dismember the bureaucratic structure which is<br />
necessary to advance Australia's interests. It's<br />
interesting that while Mr Peacock obviously doesn't<br />
consider that he would have the strength to handle this<br />
situation that Mr Howard seems to have a quite different<br />
approach. He'd previously, when he was Leader of the<br />
Opposition, welcomed the new arrangements and I refer to<br />
those in the Press release. He obviously regarded<br />
himself as strong enough to be able to contemplate<br />
managing the sort of situation, something, which<br />
unfortunately is beyond Mr Peacock.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, one week out where do you<br />
think you are? How is the campaign going? Are you going<br />
to win?<br />
PM: Well I feel that we have handled the campaign well.<br />
Obviously, Peter, in any campaign that you have if you<br />
could run every single minute of it over again, I guess<br />
there are some things that you may do slightly<br />
differently, but you don't have that luxury and I believe<br />
that, looking back over the campaign, we have handled it<br />
well. I have tried to discharge the two areas of<br />
responsibility that I see myself as having in this<br />
campaign. They are first, to explain to the people of<br />
Australia what are the policies that I and my Government<br />
and Party have for the future of this country and I've at<br />
all times tried to give that the emphasis. At the same<br />
time, secondly, I have also attempted to discharge the<br />
responsibility that I have to expose the inadequacies and<br />
indeed the fundamental dangers for Australia of the<br />
alternative policies of the Opposition. On the evidence<br />
available it seems to me that the sort of plan and<br />
program and tactics that I worked out before the campaign<br />
commenced with my colleagues is working. We have<br />
steadfastly adhered to those concepts that I've just<br />
mentioned and our program has been consistent in trying<br />
to do that. We haven't found it necessary now as we get<br />
to the final week of the campaign to press panic buttons,<br />
to change itineraries and to talk about having mass<br />
rallies which is what's happening on the other side. But<br />
having said that, let me say this, I still believe I have<br />
to work very hard and I will be doing that up until a<br />
week tonight and then it'll be a matter for decision by<br />
the electorate.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the level of unemployment's<br />
gone-up, -it!. s up.. to6.5-percent Is-this what you set<br />
out to achieve?<br />
PM: Well what I set out to achieve, Paul, was a lowering<br />
of the level of activity in this country because we were<br />
operating at too high a level in terms of the imports<br />
that were coming in. Let me go to the question of the<br />
employment figures so that we can have them in the<br />
appropriate context. What is happening is that there has<br />
been a further increase in the participation rate which<br />
has given us a record high of participation and we are, </p>
<p>however, experiencing a rate of employment growth of 3.2<br />
percent and we can compare that with a rate of some over<br />
percent last year. Now we expect employment growth<br />
this year of around about three and a half percent which<br />
is higher than two and three quarter percent which was<br />
expected at budget time and the expectation that I have<br />
in regard to unemployment, Paul, is that it will be about<br />
6.25 percent, the average for 1989/ 90 which is the figure<br />
which we put at the time of the budget.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will the level of unemployment in fact go<br />
much higher as we go into the next financial year?<br />
PM: I wouldn't expect that it would because you would<br />
expect these things to happen. Firstly, it is our<br />
judgement and the judgement of most commentators that we<br />
are, in the jargon of the economists, going to have a<br />
soft landing which means, simply this, that we will come<br />
down from the high rates of growth of product and of<br />
employment that have characterised the past, but we will<br />
still have an economy of economic growth and of<br />
employment growth. As there is a lowering in the level<br />
of activity you can be expected that there may be a<br />
decline in the participation rate and of course the move<br />
upwards in the unemployment rate has been a function of<br />
an increase in the participation rate. It is worth<br />
remembering again the statistic which I have advanced<br />
before and that is that if you had the same participation<br />
rate in Australia that I inherited when I became Prime<br />
Minister, you would have an unemployment level in this<br />
country of 1.2 percent.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the question of Ford, it seems that Ford<br />
Australia wants guaranteed protection 1992. Could<br />
you say what<br />
PM: No I can't, but let's get to this question of, of<br />
Ford directly. What you've had here is a blatant and,<br />
one can only assume, deliberate misrepresentation by the<br />
journalist in question. Now he's got his facts wrong. I<br />
mean, quite fundamentally wrong. First he didn't know,<br />
or if he did he chose not to state accurately, how many<br />
people in the meeting. He said it was two people. There<br />
was, in fact, three people there and the people that<br />
were there, the major parties, the Minister and the<br />
Chairman of Ford have in fact repudiated unqualifiably<br />
lire assertions in the, in the article of yesterday. And<br />
-with--a certain amount.-of . grudgingxetraction, the<br />
journalist in question has in fact this morning said,<br />
well I guess if I was rewriting it today I might phrase<br />
it a little differently. It would be hoped if he did, he<br />
might get somewhere near the truth and the facts are that<br />
the, that the Chairman of Ford, Mr Jack Nasser, has made<br />
the position quite clear and let me get it on the record<br />
as -to what he said. In specific terms, Mr Nasser<br />
categorically denied, now it's pretty straight,<br />
categorically denied that he'd told Senator Button that<br />
Ford was likely to quit fullscale local manufacturing </p>
<p>after 1992. Without reading the whole of his release,<br />
let me go to the other part. He said he'd had the<br />
discussion, the topics were far-reaching covering a wide<br />
range of subjects including Ford's already announced<br />
intention to invest about $ 1.2 billion in Australia over<br />
the next five years and you know what that goes to, Mr<br />
Nasser said. Our investment in the past and our plans to<br />
spend an average $ 250 million a year, over the next five<br />
years, which is relevant to the period of your question,<br />
show Ford's strong commitment to remaining a viable<br />
manufacturer in Australia and to continuing development<br />
of export markets. This investment has been underpinned<br />
by strong profit performance. In addition Mr Nasser<br />
strongly denied the claim in a news report that Ford<br />
wanted to become more or less an assembler in Australia.<br />
This is not an option that makes sense for Australia, Mr<br />
Nasser said and he also said, during recent years<br />
considerable progress in productivity and quality has<br />
been achieved. So let's have the facts right. What<br />
you've got is a beatup misrepresentation by a Melbourne<br />
journalist which has been repudiated by the people who<br />
were at the meeting and in the repudiation, the clear<br />
statement of intentions to invest $ 1.2 billion over this<br />
next five year period. Now as to the question of the<br />
context within which the, that is being done, it's also<br />
interesting to note in this area also find the<br />
comment by Mr Howard if I could I think I've got it<br />
here somewhere another area of difference where the<br />
Opposition is trying to latch on to there being some<br />
problem in this area. This is interesting, Mr Howard's<br />
comment earlier this week, I think it was in the<br />
discussion, it was, it was in the discussion he had with<br />
Senator Button I acknowledge the fact that the steel<br />
plant did a lot of good in that industry and I<br />
acknowledge the fact that the car plan brought a degree<br />
of certainty to that industry and that certainty was<br />
reinforced by the bipartisan support it largely received<br />
from the Opposition when it was brought in. In other<br />
words, we've had a situation in Australia where before we<br />
came to office, no certainty, the industry didn't know<br />
where it was going. We've brought certainty to the car<br />
industry, a fact acknowledged by Mr Howard and within<br />
that certainty you have Ford asserting now another $ 1.2<br />
billion investment intention. Now at the, as we will, as<br />
we've done everywhere in economic management before, so<br />
in this area, as we come to the next stage there will be<br />
dñ scussions with the industry, that is with the<br />
manufacturers,. there.. will-. be-discussions with the unions<br />
and that's the way we always do it and we will work out<br />
what is an appropriate environment in Australia for a<br />
continuing growth of the industry. Now that's how we've<br />
operated before and that's how we'll operate in the<br />
future.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: There is no suggestion to me that they asked for any<br />
such commitment and indeed you will see that what has </p>
<p>been said by the Chairman of Ford involves a repudiation<br />
of the story as it's been. I mean, it's a complete<br />
beatup. Obviously, obviously the manufacturers in the<br />
motor vehicle industry will want to have discussions with<br />
the Government about what are our plans for the future<br />
and those discussions, as I've said, will be held. But<br />
you can't, I mean, you will be battling like hell, Niki<br />
if you, I mean I know you're struggling to find something<br />
for support, you know, something in favour of the<br />
Opposition I mean, there's not much around but you<br />
will be drawing an extraordinarily long bow to beat this<br />
story up any further. It hasn't got any legs, my friend.<br />
It hasn't got any legs because the major participants<br />
have repudiated it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is continuing protection necessary to retain<br />
the viability of the car manufacturing industry of<br />
Australia post ' 92?<br />
PM: There will, some degree of protection post ' 92 will<br />
be necessary, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will that be a lower degree of protection.<br />
Would you in fact envisage that in the post 1992 plan you<br />
continue to scale down protection further?<br />
PM: As I've said before, Paul, I have a philosophical<br />
and economic commitment to lower levels of protection. I<br />
mean, I'm not now revealing a State secret. It's<br />
something that's on the record as far as I'm concerned<br />
before and what we have done in being the only Government<br />
in Australian history to effect significant tariff<br />
reductions without disruption in industry we're the<br />
only Government that's ever done it we've gone about<br />
the process of holding discussions with both sides of<br />
industry. So we're entitled on this issue to be examined<br />
on our record. What's the Hawke Government done? Answer<br />
significantly reduce the levels of protection in this<br />
country. Second question, how's it done it? It's done<br />
it by a process of effective discussion and consultation<br />
with both sides of industry and you get the comparison<br />
there with, you know, what happened in the ' 70s where the<br />
consultation didn't take place and you had so much<br />
disruption. JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PNM:. hat.. no-. tariff. on the . Australian.. tariff on the<br />
Australian motor vehicle industry by the end of the<br />
century? You would have to have a question mark in your<br />
mind about that. What is certain, Milton, is that what<br />
we will do will maintain a commitment to a, a gradual<br />
lowering of protection, but in the context where that<br />
will be done in consultation with the industry and both<br />
sides of the industry and in a way which is going to<br />
maximise benefit for the Australian community. I mean,<br />
that's what we've done, that's our record and we'll<br />
continue to do it. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, can you give us some idea of what<br />
your timetable will be for the Garnaut Report if you're<br />
re-elected? And secondly, who will be the Trade, special<br />
Trade Minister, given that Mr Duffy might be moving on to<br />
another portfolio?<br />
PM: Yes, well, I've answered I've had really both<br />
questions put to me before in slightly different form.<br />
As far as timetable is concerned I've answered it in this<br />
way which is the appropriate way that is that we've<br />
already initiated the processes of consideration of the<br />
range of recommendations of Ross Garnaut's report and I<br />
have indicated that I want those processes to be handled<br />
efficiently and as quickly as possible, as consistent<br />
with consideration of the recommendations and we have<br />
structure in the Structural Adjustment Committee to<br />
examine those. I would be receiving, with my colleagues<br />
on the Structural Adjustment Committee, the first reports<br />
of those various bodies that examining the range of<br />
recommendations this year and after we're re-elected and<br />
we'll consider those reports and then on the basis of<br />
reports, get into the negotiations with the various<br />
sectors of industry which need to be consulted. Now it<br />
would be, in those circumstances, it would be quite<br />
irresponsible for me to say, well, here's the, here's the<br />
timetable. All I can say is that, as we've demonstrated<br />
in the past, it will be an efficient consideration of the<br />
recommendations both at the ministerial and bureaucratic<br />
levels and then with industry. Now as to the second part<br />
of your question, well, I'd you know, like to give you a<br />
scoop, but I can't. I'm in the very fortunate position<br />
however that I've got a range of talent. What you can be<br />
sure of is that Australia's interests in the<br />
international trading area will be very, very effectively<br />
carried through. John Dawkins did an outstanding job and<br />
so has Michael Duffy and Australia's interests will<br />
continue to be well represented.<br />
JOURNALIST: But isn't it your position on this, not<br />
willing to nominate the Trade Minister now a<br />
criticism of the Opposition today about them splitting up<br />
the Trade department?<br />
PM: In what way..<br />
J" URNALIST: Well, I mean-<br />
PM: Not in a way that's obvious to me, please explain.<br />
JOURNALIST: there' s a great degree of uncertainty<br />
PM: There's not a great degree<br />
JOURNALIST: who your Trade Minister will be..<br />
negotiations. </p>
<p>PM: Not a great deal of uncertainty, not a great deal of<br />
uncertainty. We've got an election on and as a result of<br />
the election there will be some changes of portfolio. I<br />
have demonstrated, in seven years as Prime Minister, that<br />
in the decisions I make about the people I put in charge<br />
of portfolios and in charge of Australia's various<br />
interests, that we haven't put a foot wrong. And I mean,<br />
who's to say, I mean, let's be hypothetical about it,<br />
who's to say if the assumption you make about Michael's<br />
move it's assumed that I might move Michael Duffy to<br />
the Attorney-General's position. Now that's a, that's an<br />
intelligent sort of assumption, but it would be<br />
conceivable in those circumstances wouldn't it that I<br />
could have an overlap period where I would ask Michael<br />
Duffy, particularly as we now go to the end of this year<br />
in the MTN Uruguay Round, that I could request Michael<br />
Duffy to have an overlap period to take it through to the<br />
end of that period. Now it's something, if I were<br />
considering shifting Michael to the Attorney General, I<br />
think that's somethinglI would have in my mind.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Peacock with whom I talked yesterday<br />
in Launceston on the recent trade agreements<br />
concluded by your Government with the Soviet Union and<br />
second, the Soviet Union in the Asia Pacific Economic<br />
Cooperation. What's your position on this?<br />
PM: Well, one of the great misfortunes of the Australian<br />
political scene both in regard to domestic politics and<br />
international, the international aspect of our relations<br />
is that we have conservative parties who, as I've put it<br />
before, conduct themselves by looking into the rear<br />
vision mirror of history. Their attitude towards our<br />
international relations are still conditioned by some<br />
perception of, of a previous cold war situation. They<br />
find it difficult to come to grips with what Mr Peacock<br />
in other circumstances might describe as the harsh<br />
realities. And the harsh reality is, I might say to Mr<br />
Peacock, that the world we live in today is a different<br />
one and that one of the marks of my Government has been<br />
that while we have maintained and strengthened the<br />
alliance relationship with the United States, we've also<br />
developed a very effective relationship with the Soviet<br />
Union under its new leadership, Mr Gorbachev, now<br />
President Gorbachev. And I welcome the opportunity that<br />
I've had to develop those relations with the Soviet Union<br />
c -rd it is very important that as part of that<br />
-development,--we-should-extend . our-trading relations.<br />
Anyone who aspires for the political leadership of this<br />
country and is questioning the good sense of extending<br />
relationships with the Soviet Union condemns themselves<br />
out of their own mouth as being unfit, I think, to assume<br />
leadership in this country. Now as to the second part of<br />
your question about APEC, it is the case that the Soviet<br />
Union has indicated an interest in becoming involved with<br />
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation development for<br />
which I've been responsible. Now I think at this stage,<br />
it is premature to talk about the inclusion of the Soviet </p>
<p>Union in APEC. That by no means is an indication that at<br />
some stage their involvement would not be relevant as<br />
the Soviet Union is a country with a Pacific border and<br />
with interest in the Pacific and with legitimate<br />
interests, but I think it stretches the imagination at<br />
this point to classify the Soviet Union in the same<br />
degree of involvement in the Asia Pacific area as the<br />
countries who are foundationally involved. But I think<br />
it would not only be the attitude of Australia, but I<br />
think it would be the attitude of the other countries in<br />
the APEC forum that as time development, as time develops<br />
and particularly as the economy of the Soviet far east<br />
develops, and particularly as the development of the<br />
Soviet far east economy is a function of cooperation with<br />
countries of APEC, then in those circumstances it may<br />
become appropriate to think of some Soviet involvement in<br />
the forum itself.<br />
JOURNALIST: clarify this protection question again,<br />
Mr Hawke philosophical commitment in this area<br />
PM: I don't regard it as unclarified by the way.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well it's certainly unclarified to me.<br />
Given your philosophical commitment in this area, will<br />
you be speeding up in the next term, the rate of<br />
protection reduction?<br />
PM: The speed at which we will be doing it will be an<br />
outcome of a consideration of the, particularly of the,<br />
of the Garnaut report and of the consultation that we<br />
have with industry. My philosophical position and my<br />
position speaking as an economist, is that I am committed<br />
to the fastest possible rate of protection lowering which<br />
is consistent with optimum economic outcomes. So that,<br />
and that's not jargon because what we've had to do in the<br />
period up till now in achieving the very significant<br />
tariff productions that we have and which have been<br />
welcomed within Australia and internationally, that's<br />
W been an outcome, not only of decision making in the<br />
Cabinet room, but of discussions with both sides of<br />
industry. JOURNALIST: So the answer<br />
PM: The answer to the question is that we will be<br />
attempting to increase the rate of tariff reduction as<br />
quickly.. as-. possible.<br />
JOURNALIST: And does that apply to both the car industry<br />
and also the clothing and textile<br />
PM: It applies to all sections of, of industry. What<br />
we've done is in the approach of 1988 we recognised that<br />
in particular, the TCF area and the, and the motor<br />
vehicle which had its separate set of arrangements and we<br />
will be now in our fourth term, discussing with those<br />
industries as well, as with others, what is the, is the </p>
<p>maximum rate of lowering of protection which is<br />
consistent with the optimum economic output in this<br />
country. So, in other words, you've got a Government<br />
which has a philosophical commitment to tariff reductions<br />
and I don't think it can be made much clearer than that.<br />
JOURNALIST: The industry, the car industry would be<br />
unviable PM: It's not a position which I'm prepared to be<br />
dogmatic about. It's precisely the sort of thing that<br />
I'd want to talk with the industry about. I mean, good<br />
Government and good decision making is not about standing<br />
up on a platform and saying, oh someone said 15 percent<br />
are you happy with that? That's not the way you make<br />
decisions. What you do is to have your bureaucracy, your<br />
competent people, consider recommendations that are put<br />
before you, for instance, like Garnaut and say now come<br />
on, we want an analysis of what you think the best<br />
outcomes are. Then you have your relevant Ministers<br />
discuss these with industry, with manufacturers and with<br />
the representatives of employees in the industry and then<br />
you assume the responsibility at the end of that process<br />
of making a decision. Now my approach will be to try and<br />
have a tariff level which is at the lowest possible level<br />
consistent with the maintenance of a viable industry in<br />
this country. Now you can't be more specific than that.<br />
I mean, that's my philosophical framework, the lowest<br />
level of tariff protection which is consistent with a<br />
viable industry in this country.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you've endorsed Mr Keating's<br />
guarantee of real wage increases in each of the next<br />
three years, but you've also said you've got no inflation<br />
forecasts for years two and three. Does that mean that<br />
you're guaranteeing real wage increases regardless of the<br />
rate of inflation?<br />
PM: It means that we are making assumptions about what<br />
the likely inflation outcome will be. I mean, I noticed<br />
that you've got your knickers in a knot about this<br />
before. But it's a very, very simple proposition really,<br />
which does not, you know, doesn't require much<br />
intellectual capacity to follow. Where we have got so<br />
far in the negotiations with the ACTU has given us a<br />
position where the wages pipeline, a concept of which I<br />
tfrink you are familiar, coming out of the end of this<br />
. process. will . be smaller. than the.. one we inherited as<br />
we've gone into this one. On that basis we are assuming<br />
a lowering of the inflation rate. But it is not the<br />
practice it never has been when you get up at budget<br />
time and say what your inflation outlook is for the next<br />
year to say and for the next year it is going to be<br />
precisely that and the next year it is going to be<br />
precisely that. What you do is to say this is what our<br />
inflation outlook is for the next year and to give an<br />
indication of the way in which you think things will<br />
move. I believe as a result of the fact that we've </p>
<p>negotiated a sensible outcome with the unions, 7 percent,<br />
with which we associate a 6 percent inflation outcome and<br />
with which we associate a lower pipeline effect at the<br />
end of that, that it makes sense, Greg, to be talking<br />
about a lowering of the inflation rate. When the<br />
appropriate time comes we will put the figures on that<br />
for the next year.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, in answer to Niki Savva earlier<br />
you suggest that support the Opposition, do you<br />
PM: I didn't talk about editorial at all, I was<br />
answering a questioner.<br />
JOURNALIST: You said obviously you're looking for<br />
something PM: You said editorial. I was answering a questioner.<br />
JOURNALIST: Melbourne Herald<br />
PM: No I was certainly not. Have a look at the<br />
transcript dear boy, I mean, I think you are the one<br />
that asked me that question over in the docks in<br />
Fremantle too. I mean have a bad night.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke that we could well see<br />
increased political instability in PNG. What would you<br />
consider, would you consider some sort of escalation of<br />
our military or otherwise? What would you consider<br />
to be appropriate?<br />
PM: No I am not talking about an escalation of military<br />
commitment beyond what we have already, it's a matter<br />
of public record of what we have done in terms of saying<br />
that we would assist in the growth of numbers. But that<br />
was something which has been announced weeks and weeks<br />
ago. We have not considered anything beyond that. I had<br />
the opportunity of talking last night by telephone with<br />
the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Rabble Namaliu, a<br />
person I have known for very very many years and he<br />
assured me of these things. He assured me first of all<br />
that there would be no support for this drunken exercise<br />
of Tohian's by anyone within the PNGDF and only a very<br />
limited response from within the police forces. So he<br />
was saying to me, last night in the conversation, that he<br />
vs confident of support of the military forces for<br />
constitutional. oprocesses... hesecond thing that he told<br />
me was that as far as the Opposition was concerned they<br />
broadly supported the position of the Government on this<br />
issue, as they should. And therefore he anticipated no<br />
further trouble. I certainly said to him, of course,<br />
that I confirm the commitment of the Australian<br />
Government, confirm the commitment of the Australian<br />
Govlernment to proper constitutional processes in Papua<br />
New Guinea. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, just to get back to that<br />
earlier questions, I know you don't want to appear to<br />
be cocky or complacent, but what are the odds right now<br />
on Saturday<br />
PM: The only odds I will be thinking about in the next<br />
24 hours is if I get a chance to look at the Sportsman<br />
tonight, the ones that are running around in Sydney and<br />
Melbourne and see if I can work out perhaps a couple of<br />
good bets tomorrow. I don't think it is helpful for me<br />
to be putting odds on it. All I can say is that I think<br />
we have campaigned sensibly and well and<br />
constructively. The indications that are there seem to<br />
be that there has been, on balance, a favourable response<br />
to that. We have still got a week to go and I will be<br />
campaigning as hard as I can in that week. I am not<br />
putting odds on it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, back on the employment for a<br />
second, isn't it a fact that some of the increase in the<br />
participation rate has been due to women and housewives<br />
going out into the workforce seeking extra work to help<br />
pay off mortgages? Don't you concede that there is a lot<br />
of pain out there in mortgage belt and what will you be<br />
offering them over the next week to ensure they vote for<br />
PM: I won't be offering anything new over the next week.<br />
I will be reiterating what I have said during the<br />
campaign. Just let me get this point straight about the<br />
increase in the participation rate. It is true,<br />
obviously, that some women have gone to work because of<br />
their desire and what they perceive to be a necessity to<br />
meet added burdens that's a fact. But don't overlook<br />
the fact that we are also undergoing in this country, and<br />
we have been since 1983, the quite fundamental<br />
restructuring of the labour force in the sense that we<br />
have deliberately moved as a Government to remove<br />
inhibitions and discrimination against women being in the<br />
workforce. You have got to understand that very many<br />
women want not just as a matter of economic necessity,<br />
but as a question of personal fulfilment to be in the<br />
workforce. I mean, don't let's have ourselves bound down<br />
by some historical precept that all women regard their<br />
fulfilment of their desires as simply being in the home.<br />
There are many who do, many who do, and their position is<br />
t~ tally respected by this Government. But it is also the<br />
fact.-in this -country. and in inany... nthers. -that women<br />
increasingly see their fulfilment, not just in the home,<br />
but as being part of the workforce and that is why we<br />
have deliberately as an active Government done everything<br />
we can to ensure that all areas of discrimination and<br />
barriers are removed. And within the education system<br />
may I say, also are doing everything we possibly can to<br />
ensure that the education system is structured in a way<br />
that all vocations are open to girls as well as to boys.<br />
Now, you say what will I be saying in this last week to<br />
those who particularly have gone to work to help the </p>
<p>family meet added burdens? I will be saying these things<br />
to them, as I have been saying during this campaign, that<br />
I am neither sadist nor masochist as I have been saying<br />
before. Hawke is an intelligent Prime Minister who<br />
hasn't had a tight monetary policy because he thinks it<br />
is clever or smart to do it just for the fun of doing it.<br />
The simple fact is that in the previous year we had 8<br />
percent increase in consumption, a 4 percent increase in<br />
production with a gap being filled by imports in a way<br />
which was not sustainable into the future. Therefore<br />
where we had tight fiscal policy, no argument about that,<br />
four successive years of real reductions of Commonwealth<br />
outlays cumulatively representing 8.1 percent, the<br />
tightest fiscal policy in the history of this country,<br />
tight wages policy. Now in all those circumstances we,<br />
with the growth and consumption that took place, had to<br />
tighten the other arm of monetary policies. I will then<br />
be saying that that tightening of monetary policy is<br />
working, no-one is now arguing that it is not working and<br />

where interest rates can fall, mortgage rates, that that<br />
is a judgement which on the evidence is shared by the<br />
banking community and with a continuation of our policies<br />
of fiscal rectitude and wages predictability that after<br />
the 24th of March those people can be certain that<br />
mortgage rates will fall. They can have no such<br />
confidence, indeed the opposite must be their expectation<br />
if Mr Peacock were to be made Prime Minister. Why? For<br />
two simple factual reasons and not questions of opinion.<br />
GoiLng both to fiscal rectitude and to wages, you cannot<br />
possibly avoid an explosion of interest rates in this<br />
country and a collapse of the economy if you have these<br />
two things. Firstly a wages explosion, and I remind you<br />
that we are now one week from the election and you still<br />
have utter confusion on the part of the Opposition about<br />
wages policy. The only certainty about it of course is<br />
that you must have a wages explosion, because, if you are<br />
going to have the position where you just throw it open<br />
V. to negotiation by the employer and the employee then<br />
wages must explode. Under their policy the pilots would<br />
have got their 30 percent and then that would have blown<br />
through the community and under a Peacock Government that<br />
is exactly what would happen. So wages would explode.<br />
The fiscal surplus would also be dissipated, the fact is<br />
that you have this $ 7 billion unfunded bribe. It's there<br />
aild they still go into this last week with no attempt to<br />
answer-that-proposition. -Aqhere-is the money coming from?<br />
Now there is one of two things that can happen in regard<br />
to this person who is suffering some difficulty. They<br />
either blow the surplus, therefore interest rates go<br />
through the roof, or they cut services by about $ 7<br />
billion if they are going to maintain the same budget<br />
surplus. Well what sort of impact are you going to have<br />
on this person and her family that you are talking about<br />
with a cut of $ 7 billion in services? I mean, they will<br />
be knocked to smithereens. So you have got those<br />
outcomes. An increase in interest rates and as well, as </p>
<p>part of it, a cutting of services, because they couldn't<br />
cut services to the tune of $ 7 billion there would be a<br />
blowing of the surplus and that taken is a wages<br />
explosion must mean a rise in interest rates. So, that's<br />
the message.<br />
JOURNALIST: about the raid on campaign offices in<br />
Melbourne? PM: The raid?<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes, selling bottles of wine and port<br />
PM: Well, I am not aware of any raid on my offices. I<br />
mean, this seems to me to be rather emotive language,<br />
with respect. All that I've heard is that some police<br />
people visited my office, which you in your colourful<br />
language talk about a raid. I mean great reporting mate,<br />
O wgarye aty our eproerptoirntg , i s buitt ? hardly accurate. I mean that's the<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well it's the language you used. Did you use the<br />
language, a police raid on my office. I mean, perhaps my<br />
hearing is going. I don't think so. I think that's what<br />
you said. So your colourful language about a raid on my<br />
office I reject. I understand that some police officers<br />
went there. I know nothing about the background to it.<br />
It seems to be that some of my people were going to sell<br />
some port or wine. It may and some character in the<br />
area who is a wine merchant has raised the question as to<br />
whether that's appropriate for them to do it and whether<br />
they've got the appropriate licence. I've simply said to<br />
my people when they raised it with me today, and that's<br />
my staff, I said simply tell my office that they are to<br />
do nothing which is not within the law. Now those are<br />
O rtahied . facts about your colourful question about the police<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Beg your pardon?<br />
JOURNALIST: You've said in the past Mr Keating would be<br />
a good deputy Prime Minister, have you given any more<br />
thought to that in the last two weeks and Brian Howe?<br />
PM: I've given no thought to it at all. I'm in the<br />
fortunate position, Amanda, that I have a range of very<br />
capable people and I've seen one report that Paul has<br />
said he would not be interested in being Deputy Prime<br />
Minister. discuss that. If that were his view and he<br />
weren't a candidate and Mr Howe was a candidate, there's<br />
no doubt that Mr Howe has got the qualifications to be an<br />
excellent Deputy Prime Minister. There may be other<br />
people that would throw their cap into the ring. But see<br />
the great good fortune that I have, and it is one of the, </p>
<p>4 14<br />
if I can borrow Mr Peacock's phrase, it's one of the<br />
harshest realities of this last week that I have, one, a<br />
totally united team of extremely capable people against<br />
an increasingly disunited Opposition. Look at today's<br />
Press. They're fighting one another on the question of<br />
the multi-function polis. They're fighting one another<br />
on wages policy. Just about any issue you want to look<br />
at they are in total disagreement. So that is the<br />
harshest reality of this last week a united Labor team<br />
where Prime Minister Bob Hawke has the great good fortune<br />
of a number of people who have the capacity to fill that<br />
job. Against that a totally divided Opposition, where at<br />
the beginning of this week you have Mr Howard with that<br />
remarkable, remarkable interview. Let me share it with<br />
you. He was being interviewed by Mr Chipp. He was asked<br />
a very simple question do you believe, do you believe<br />
Mr Peacock a very simple question do you believe Mr<br />
Peacock, Mr Howard well, you know, not really going to<br />
answer that, saying there' s only one inference you<br />
0 cbaenl idervaew Mrf roPme actohcek . r eplSyo, I'Jmo hnq, u itaen d htahpapty iasb outth att hey oup rdoobnl'etm<br />
I've got on my side, that is the problem of a luxury of<br />
talent united together in their Party. Against that,<br />
that chaos on the other side. Last question.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you said this morning on radio<br />
that you would hope to within three years<br />
PM: I don't think that I either Paul or myself at any<br />
stage have said, have nominated an earlier period than<br />
that. But, just let me make the point about the<br />
stabilisation of debt. Again, in this final week, the<br />
Australian electorate has got to ask itself the question<br />
to the extent that debt is an issue, got to ask<br />
themselves the question, what is the range of policies<br />
available from Hawke which is relevant to the question of<br />
debt? What is the range of policies that Mr Peacock<br />
O pqruoefsfteirosn wofh icthhe iss tqaubeisltiisoanteido n anofd wdehbitc. h iAs ndr eltehvea natn swtoe r thies<br />
starkly clear. We have the policies. Let me nominate<br />
them. We have a wages policy which gives you a<br />
predictable outcome which will enable an increasingly<br />
competitive Australian manufacturing and services<br />
industry to increase its level of exports. That can<br />
happen under our wages policy as has been happening.<br />
54 percent increase in manufactured exports in the last<br />
fbur years. 69 percent increase in the exports of<br />
services._ That will continue under our wages policy.<br />
Against that, wages explosion and the disaster of the<br />
past under Mr Peacock. Secondly, fiscal rectitude. A<br />
position where, under Hawke, for the first time in<br />
history, surplus three years in a row, $ 17 billion, used<br />
to pay off Commonwealth debt so that the Commonwealth is<br />
a net international creditor to the tune of about S4<br />
billion. Against that, fiscal irresponsibility on the<br />
side of Mr Peacock and the conservatives which would blow<br />
the budget surplus and therefore reduce the area of<br />
domestic savings available to private industry. Third, </p>
<p>4 and very importantly, a plan for future savings in terms<br />
of superannuation. Facts. When we came to office, $ 17<br />
billion in funds, now $ 100 billion, and under our<br />
policies which make superannuation an award prescription<br />
of those funds growing to at least $ 600 billion by the<br />
end of the decade. Against that, an Opposition policy<br />
which is dedicated to stopping superannuation as an award<br />
prescription and which would therefore destroy that<br />
massive savings plan for the future. So, on the issue of<br />
debt, we are the ones who have the policies in place<br />
which can and are addressing that. If you look at the<br />
figures for the December quarter of balance of payments<br />
figures, look at the facts, there you have it that in the<br />
December quarter in real terms exports of goods and<br />
services up 3.7 percent. December on December, real<br />
exports up by 11.4 percent and imports were down. And<br />
you got the situation where you've got the current<br />
account deficit down from $ 5.8 billion in the September<br />
quarter to $ 4.4 billion in the December quarter a 24<br />
percent improvement. In other words, our range of<br />
policies are delivering, the alternative policies would<br />
blow the debt through the roof.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: As Paul has said, and I think I've said it myself,<br />
you can't necessarily go on indefinitely into the future<br />
having the same sort of order of cuts that have occurred<br />
in the past. I remind you, there've been four years in a<br />
row and that has represented about, in cumulative terms,<br />
not about, it's represented precisely 8.1 percent. Now,<br />
you can't keep on doing that. What we can ensure however<br />
is that, as we've demonstrated, in this election period,<br />
that to the extent that we want to fund new promises,<br />
that we have been prepared to continue to find savings to<br />
do that. We can promise the Australian people on our<br />
record. We don't, we haven't got any problem there.<br />
We're the only Government that's done it, never before<br />
been done. And we will continue to operate at a surplus<br />
and at a significant surplus. The other mob have got no<br />
chance of doing that.<br />
ends </p>
