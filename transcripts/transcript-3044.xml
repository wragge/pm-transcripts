SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
MR E. G. WHITLAM, AT THE<br />
SIGNING OF THE ALBURY-WODONGA<br />
AREA DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT<br />
JUST NINE MONTHS AGO, SIR ROBERT ASKIN, MR HAMER<br />
AND I MET HERE IN ALBURY-WODONGA AND AGREED ON A HISTORIC<br />
PLAN FOR A NEW AUSTRALIAN CITY IN THIS AREA. IT GIVES ME<br />
GREAT PLEASURE TODAY TO MEET THE PREMIERS AGAIN TO SIGN<br />
THE ALBURY-WODONGA AREA DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT.<br />
! ITH THE CONCURRENCE OF THE STATES THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT INITIATED THE MEETING IN JANUARY, BUT FROM THAT<br />
DAY IT BECAME A JOINT VENTURE. LET'S NOT IMAGINE THAT THIS<br />
IS AN AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT PROJECT EXCLUSIVELY FAR FROM<br />
IT, ITS SUCCESS DEPENDS ON CONTINUED'CO-OPERATION BETWEEN<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE STATES. THE THREE<br />
GOVERNMENTS ARE EQUAL PARTNERS.<br />
THE JANUARY MEETING WAS THE FIRST STEP. IT THEN<br />
BECAME THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MINISTERIAL COUNCI.<br />
MR UREN, MR FULLER AND MR BYRNE TO ESTABLISH AN AGREEMENT<br />
BETWEEN THE THREE GOVERNMENTS WHICH WOULD EMBODY OUR JOINT<br />
COMMITMENT AND PROVIDE A SOUND BASE ON WHICH THIS AREA CAN<br />
GROW IN HARMONY WITH THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
THEY HAVE DONE WELL, THE DOCUMENT WE HAVE BEFORE<br />
US TODAY IS EVIDENCE OF THAT, IT IS A CREDIT TO THEM AND<br />
TO THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED, IT REFLECTS A CONTINUING<br />
SPIRIT-OF CO-OPERATION AND PROVIDES A FIRST-CLASS EXAMPLE<br />
OF HOW THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE STATES CAN WORK<br />
TOGETHER TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THOUSANDS OF<br />
AUSTRALIANS OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES,<br />
THE PREPARATION OF THIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN A<br />
FORMIDABLE LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE TASK, IT HAS TAKEN ONLY<br />
NINE MONTHS, I KNOW THAT MANY MEMBERS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY<br />
WOULD LIKE MORE ACTION, BUT THE IMPORTANCE, THE SIZE AND<br />
THE. QUALITY OF THIS PROJECT CALL FOR A GREAT DEAL OF<br />
FORBEARANCE AND PATIENCE ON THE PART OF US ALL,<br />
A PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE AGREEMENT IS TO ESTABLISH<br />
A STRONG AND EFFECTIVE DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATION TO BE<br />
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GROWTH COMPLEX,<br />
EXPERIENCE OVERSEAS AND IN THIS COUNTRY HAS SHOWN CLEARLY<br />
THAT THIS IS AN ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT IN THE SUCCES) F F<br />
NEW CITY DEVELOPMENT ,/ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
DETAILS OF THE DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATION WERE<br />
ANNOUNCED AND WELL PUBLICISED BY THE MINISTERIAL COUNCIL<br />
ON 4 JULY, To REFRESH YOUR MEMORY CHARTS HAVE BEEN<br />
CIRCULATED AND I HOPE THEY WILL BE WIDELY BROUGHT TO THE<br />
NOTICE OF THE PUBLIC,<br />
AT FIRST GLANCE THE FORM OF THE ORGANISATION MAY<br />
APPEAR COMPLEX, BUT FUNDAMENTALLY IT IS NOT, IT IS A FULLY<br />
INTEGRATED ORGANISATION WITH COMMON MEMBERSHIP AND COMMON<br />
STAFF, THE THREE LEGAL CORPORATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO MEET<br />
THE CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE THREE GOVERNMENTS,<br />
IN PRACTICE, HOWEVER, THE ORGANISATION WILL WORK AS A SINGLE<br />
ENTITY RESPONSIBLE TO THE MINISTERIAL COUNCIL,<br />
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES OF THE<br />
ORGANISATION WILL IDENTIFY WITH ONE BODY AND ONE GOAL<br />
NAMELY THE CREATION OF A NEW GROWTH CENTRE WITH A HIGH-QUALITY<br />
ENVIRONMENT, IMAGINATIVELY PLANNED AND DEVELOPED,<br />
I WAS PARTICULARLY PLEASED TO'SEE THAT PROVISION<br />
HAS BEEN MADE FOR A CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL TO PROVIDE A VEHICLE<br />
FOR PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN THE PROJECT, OVER THE PAST<br />
NINE MONTHS THE INTERIM CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE, MADE UP OF<br />
REPRESENTATIVES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITY INTERESTS,<br />
HAS PLAYED A VITAL AND CONTRIBUTING RO'LE IN THE DEVELOPMENT<br />
SO FAR, ,/ 4 </p>
<p>THE AGREEMENT OF COURSE REQUIRES COMPLIMENTARY<br />
LEGISLATION AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE STATES ARE CURRENTLY<br />
DRAFTING BILLS, YOU HAVE MY ASSURANCE THAT THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT LEGISLATION WILL BE INTRODUCED WITHOUT DELAY<br />
AFTER THE SIGNING OF THIS AGREEMENT,<br />
YOU WILL ALSO BE AWARE THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
HAS ADVERTISED FOR A CHAIRMAN OF THE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION,<br />
WE SHALL MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT WE GET THE RIGHT<br />
MAN FOR THIS ALL IMPORTANT POSITION,<br />
YOU WILL ALSO BE AWARE THAT $ 9 MILLION HAS BEEN<br />
BUDGETED BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT FOR EXPENDITURE IN<br />
1973-74 ON THE FIRST PHASE OF THE ACQUISITION PROGRAM UNDER<br />
THE PROVISIONS OF APPROPRIATE STATE LAND PRICE STABILISATION<br />
LEGISLATION AND SELECTED PUBLIC WORKS, THIS IS ONLY THE<br />
BEGINNING IT WILL BE A CONTINUING COMMITMENT,<br />
AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF WORK HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE ON<br />
THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PLANNING STRATEGY, A FIRM COM1ITMENT<br />
HAS BEEN GIVEN, AND INCLUDED IN THE AGREEMENT, THAT AREAS TO<br />
BE ACQUIRED FOR URBAN AND ASSOCIATED DEVELOPMENT WILL BE<br />
ANNOUNCED NO LATER THAN 30 JUNE NEXT YEAR, THE MINISTERIAL<br />
COUNCIL WISELY DECIDED NOT TO WAIT ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF<br />
THE DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATION BEFORE PLANNING COMMENCED, </p>
<p>WE WOULD ALL LIKE TO SEE THINGS HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY,<br />
BUT IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE HAVE THE RESULTS OF THE VERY<br />
NECESSARY MAJOR STUDIES. THAT ARE UNDERWAY BEFORE THE OVERALL<br />
STRATEGY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT IS ANNOUNCED.<br />
I WOULD LIKE TO RECORD THE SATISFACTION OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT AND MY OWN PERSONAL SAT ISFACTION AT<br />
THE SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION OF THIS FIRST PHASE IN THE<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF ALBURY-WODONGA, IT AUGURS WELL FOR THE<br />
FUTURE AND, AS I HAVE SAID, PROVIDES AN HISTORIC EXAMPLE<br />
OF HOW THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE STATES CAN WORK<br />
TOGETHER IN THE INTERESTS OF THE TOTAL AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY.<br />
