FOR EJDUNIEA 1519 88<br />
Cabinet will meet in Geelong, Victoria on Thursday 7 July<br />
1988.<br />
The meeting is in response to a long standing invitation<br />
from the Geelong City Council and will be held in the City<br />
Hall. The Cabinet is looking forward to visiting Geelong, one of<br />
Australia's major provincial centres, which is celebrating<br />
its sesqui-centenary this year.<br />
My Cabinet has met away from Canberra on a number of<br />
occasions in the past and I intend that we will have further<br />
meetings in regional centres.<br />
I extend my thanks to the Member for Corio, the Hon. Gordon<br />
Scholes, and the Geelong City Council for the support and<br />
co-operation they have given in the organisation of this<br />
meeting. ' 718[-<br />
