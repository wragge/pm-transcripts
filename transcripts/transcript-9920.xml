SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
PRESENTATION OF THE AUSTRALIA DAY AWARDS<br />
OLD PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, 25 JANUARY 1996<br />
Thank you for coming to this 1996 presentation of the Australia Day Awards<br />
and thank you to the Australia Day Council for staging them. And thank you<br />
for inviting nfM along to present the Awards.<br />
Australia Day provides us with a chance to reflect on the country we live in:<br />
on the year past and the one which lies ahead.<br />
Because it falls just a few weeks after New Year it is, in a sense, a second<br />
chance. A chance, maybe, to make a few adjustments if not grand new<br />
resolutions. It is a day when all around the country Australians offer up their assessments<br />
of where the nation stands and what direction it should go.<br />
But on the whole, there is relatively little pomp and ceremony, and a great<br />
deal of general enjoyment.<br />
There have been various efforts down the years to give it more formal shape<br />
and meaning, but it has evolved as essentially an expression of our freedom,<br />
and a quite unselfconscious celebration of our way of life.<br />
At all sorts of sporting fixtures; in lounge rooms, gardens and backyards; in<br />
the bush, on beaches; in pubs and clubs and cafes; in city streets and<br />
country towns in a thousand different ways, we commune with each other<br />
and the continent.<br />
And no amount of official direction or attempts to invest the day with more<br />
formalities can resist the popular sentiment and nor should they. </p>
<p>Perhaps across the country we should all stop at a prearranged moment,<br />
pause for a second or two, and give thanks to our fellow Australians of all<br />
generations. Because we do all depend upon each other.<br />
And, if we are to make the best of the great gifts and opportunities we have,<br />
we always will depend on each other.<br />
Few years in our recent history have demonstrated this as clearly as the last<br />
one. In many profound ways, 1995 was a great year for Australia. In economic<br />
terms, no country in the developed world did better. We made great strides<br />
among the countries of the region where our future largely lies. On this<br />
Australia Day there can be no argument that Australia has advanced our<br />
economy is a little stronger, our future a little more assured, our horizons a<br />
little wider. As a nation and as a society, we have made real progress.<br />
And there can hardly be a better reason to celebrate than that.<br />
Yet, I think the events of last year from which we have most to learn and<br />
most to celebrate occurred in a different sphere of our national life.<br />
H<br />
It was not in economics or any other area of national policy, or arts, or<br />
science, or sport, or any of the other things in which Australians continue to<br />
excel. It was in the area of what might be called the spirit the national spirit.<br />
Last year we celebrated a whole generation of Australians the Australians<br />
who loved this country and their freedom and cared enough about Australia's<br />
future to give everything, even their lives, in its defence.<br />
In celebrating them, we learned a lot about ourselves. Our children learned a<br />
lot about their parents and grandparents, and thus a lot more about what<br />
Australian means. They learned, and we were reminded, that we are all part<br />
of the same story.<br />
We all learned a bit more about Australia. And most gratifying of all we<br />
learned that the spirit which inspired that generation is alive in our own.<br />
The enthusiasm with which Australia Remembers was taken up all over<br />
Australia was a reassuring statement that all the great changes of the past<br />
fifty years have not dampened our affections.<br />
And, of course, in remembering the war we were also reminded that nothing<br />
about our freedom and the way of life we enjoy can be taken for ever granted.<br />
It was hard won and it will always have to be defended. </p>
<p>Similar lessons were there to be learned from the nation's response, to the<br />
worst drought in living memory.<br />
In rural Australia we saw scenes of environmental devastation and human<br />
hardship which most people in the cities certainly most young people<br />
never imagined possible in their own country.<br />
And, again, the response was overwhelming and immensely reassuring to<br />
anyone who might have doubted that the old spirit lives on. From one end of<br />
the country to the other, Australians pitched in to help farming families and<br />
farming communities to survive.<br />
It became a great national cause. And, as a result, when the rains finally<br />
came to most of the farms, most of the farmers had survived.<br />
In the process a lot of Australians learned something about the resilience of<br />
rural Australians. They leaned how much they had in common with them.<br />
Perhaps most importantly, we were all reminded again that our good<br />
fortune can never be taken for granted.<br />
That's why' ( think 1995 was such a very good year for Australia. It was proof<br />
of the spirit of the place: if you like, proof that the values of Arthur Boyd's<br />
generation, including his love of the landscape, still inspire us in this post<br />
modern, globalising, information age.<br />
It couldn't be more timely.<br />
If the lesson was that there are times when only our own collective effort will<br />
see us through, then the lesson is a good one for now because this is one<br />
of those times.<br />
I believe we have begun a whole new chapter in our history.<br />
It used to remind me of that earlier one, before the long overdue arrival of the<br />
Second Fleet when, cut off from Europe, unable to adapt to the environment<br />
and feed themselves, at odds with the Aboriginal people and unwilling to<br />
learn from them, horribly conscious that they were alone and adrift, the<br />
survivors of the First Fleet waited helplessly at Port Jackson for supplies.<br />
And while we are not in any way abandoned and starving, we are in every<br />
essential respect dependent on our own efforts and ingenuity.<br />
And, if we needed any reassurance, last year should have provided it we<br />
have learned the lessons of experience and we know what it takes.<br />
The challenge is to enter the next century economically strong and dynamic,<br />
at home with both the rapidly changing realities of technology and the modem<br />
world, and thoroughly engaged with that part of it in which we live. </p>
<p>And because, obviously, it will make us more able to succeed in this, the<br />
challenge is also to enter the next century strong as a community; confident<br />
that the cultural and social differences between us, like the physical<br />
distances, are no impediment to our common purpose.<br />
At the same time, and for much the same reasons, we need to come to just<br />
terms, once and for all. with the original inhabitants of this continent, the<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People.<br />
And also come to terms with the natural environment on which our future<br />
prosperity and our way of life significantly depends.<br />
In both cases, we need to repair the damage of 200 years. We need to find a<br />
way to live in harmony with the continent and the people who have lived on it<br />
for more than 40,000 years.<br />
These are challenging and exciting times. No previous generation of<br />
Australians ever had such an opportunity. No other country in the world has<br />
such an opportunity now.<br />
So long as ( e retain faith in ourselves, practise tolerance and reward<br />
initiative, we should be in no doubt about succeeding.<br />
That is why Australia Day is so important it is an expression of the essential<br />
things about our national life.<br />
And it is why Australians of the Year are such important people by their<br />
achievements they give us a clue to what we all can be.<br />
And it is now my great pleasure to announce that the Australian of the Year<br />
for 1996 is Dr John Yu. </p>
