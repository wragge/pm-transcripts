<p>E&amp;OE...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Good morning Prime Minister</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>How's that, is that better?</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>That's good. I've now readjusted the satellite.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Excellent. Well welcome to your new sojourn on the east coast.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>I'm not far from your house.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's right. You're in sort of Lavender Bay aren't you?</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Yeah well we're around Darling Harbour, the revamped Darling Harbour.</p>
<p> Lavender Bay's on the other side of the harbour.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I thought you were.....</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>We are, that's where we used to be over there. We're building</p>
<p> new premises over here.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I see. You've gone across market have you? I won't say up market</p>
<p> or down market, I'll just say cross-market.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Yeah well I got in one of those boats on the weekend, one of those Chinese</p>
<p> dragon boats that come across the harbour. There you go.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They're very attractive.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>They are indeed. All right, how are your ratings going? I'm pretty</p>
<p> interested in mine.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't know. The only rating I ever worry about is the one at the</p>
<p> time at the next election.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>When might that be?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's scheduled to be at the end of next year and I see no reason</p>
<p> to have it any earlier. Why would I?</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Do you fear that the GST's starting in might reduce your opportunity</p>
<p> for re-election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. Look the tax reform plan of course which is more than a GST that's</p>
<p> going to cut personal tax by $12 billion a year and is going to make fuel</p>
<p> in the bush a lot cheaper and make our exports more competitive, and give</p>
<p> the States more money for roads and public hospitals and schools, as well</p>
<p> as introduce a GST. The tax reform plan is a huge change and we're</p>
<p> obviously willing to help people with the adjustment process. We understand</p>
<p> that. But once it is in I believe people will see the enormous merit of</p>
<p> it but between now and then it's easy for the Labor Party to run</p>
<p> a scare a day, which they will. I fully expect that.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>And lots of other people too. But I mean would you agree at the moment</p>
<p> if an election were to be held now before the GST comes in and all these</p>
<p> you beaut things you're talking about are going to happen that you'd</p>
<p> probably get the boot?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look Howard, that is what I call an irrelevant unimportant question</p>
<p> because the election's due at the end of next year.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>No, I'm just asking......</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm not going to speculate because it's pointless.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>You wouldn't have a prayer at the moment.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Howard, we're not having an election at the moment. And I don't</p>
<p> ... look I don't accept anything. I don't ever turn my mind</p>
<p> to those things because I know and you know that that's just a wasted</p>
<p> question because there's election at the end of next year.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Yeah. All right now, well, the only reason I asked the question is because</p>
<p> you talked about petrol in the bush there but at the moment of course</p>
<p> it has risen significantly.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, but that's not due to the GST. That's got absolutely nothing</p>
<p> to do with the GST. It's got to do with the fact that the price of</p>
<p> crude oil coming....crude oil in this country has gone up because the</p>
<p> world price has gone up.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Yeah that oil parity pricing which Malcolm Fraser introduced was not</p>
<p> a good idea was it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it was supported by both sides of politics. It was a good idea because</p>
<p> what it meant was that you gave people an incentive to look for oil in</p>
<p> and around Australia, and it's meant that we've maintained a</p>
<p> higher degree of self-sufficiency than would otherwise be the case.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Mmm, all right. But I mean, again, it was a good idea, is it still a</p>
<p> good idea?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes it is still a good idea because in the long run we should be realistic</p>
<p> enough to price our fuel at world levels. And however unhappy all of us</p>
<p> are about having to pay more, the price of petrol in this country is dramatically</p>
<p> lower than it is in every other country in the world with exception of</p>
<p> the United States.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Yeah. All right, now I talked about your house. Why does Kirribilli House,</p>
<p> or why did need a new staircase and why does it need a coolroom instead</p>
<p> of the fridges you've got at the moment?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well as far as the staircase was concerned that was a recommendation</p>
<p> of the, you know, official establishments trust that it ought to.....</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Who are they by the way?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it is made up of a group of people including, one of them's</p>
<p> Penelope Seidler who's a very well qualified architect. Some of them</p>
<p> are people appointed by the former government, one or two people appointed</p>
<p> by us. But can I just make a point about these official establishments.</p>
<p> I'm not Prime Minister forever, nobody is. And when you keep a valuable</p>
<p> residence like Kirribilli House in good repair you are preserving an asset</p>
<p> for the whole nation. I mean it's only...it's of a very limited</p>
<p> period for any of us that we get anything out of it, and when I leave,</p>
<p> when I cease being Prime Minister whoever my successor is he or she will</p>
<p> use that for a period of time and then it will be passed onto the next....</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>You don't get to take the $4,500 chairs......</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Of course we don't. They belong to the public.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>That's a lot for a chair isn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well can I tell you the proposal coming from the aficionados on my understanding</p>
<p> it would have been even more. I at least opted for something that was</p>
<p> Australian made.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Yeah. All right....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I mean, all of these things cost money. I mean it's easy for either</p>
<p> side of politics to have a shot at the incumbent. But just let's</p>
<p> remember that they are public assets. And if you don't do anything</p>
<p> then you end up having a much bigger bill as you know some time in the</p>
<p> future when you have to keep these buildings in repair. And all old buildings</p>
<p> need work on them. We have to face that.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>So what do you think of the Carr State Government acceding to the request</p>
<p> of various Aboriginal industry people to close the Sydney Harbour Bridge</p>
<p> on May the 28th for nine hours to celebrate I guess a report</p>
<p> coming out on reconciliation? They reckon it's going to put a bit</p>
<p> of pressure on you. I don't know how. Are you planning to drive across</p>
<p> the bridge...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I'm not. I mean I just saw some reference to this and you know,</p>
<p> I'll wait and see whether they finally decide to close the Harbour</p>
<p> Bridge and so forth. I mean that's a matter for them to decide. But</p>
<p> in the end we decide these things on the merits and just because you do</p>
<p> that that doesn't of itself put any more or less pressure on me.</p>
<p> We are committed to a process of reconciliation, but reconciliation to</p>
<p> me is improving the day to day opportunities of Aboriginal Australians,</p>
<p> their health, their education, their employment.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>They're closing the bridge so people can march across it to celebrate</p>
<p> that report is not going to help them is it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm not expressing a view whether it helps or hinders. All</p>
<p> I'm saying is there's not going.....it's not going to</p>
<p> of itself alter.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>No, that's what I'm saying.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And some people may find that inconvenient.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Are you also going to feel, or do you feel any pressure, will you react</p>
<p> to the call to override the Northern Territory's detention laws because</p>
<p> of the death of that 15 year old boy the other day?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Howard, right at the moment there's a Senate committee looking</p>
<p> at that issue. Normally matters of sentencing and criminal law are the</p>
<p> responsibility of the States and Territories. The Senate is having a look</p>
<p> at the thing at the moment and I guess that we'll have a talk about</p>
<p> this issue in Cabinet later today.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>What, about that case?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sure it will come up. I mean it's very tragic. Any</p>
<p> death in custody is tragic.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Of course it's tragic but are they blaming the right people for</p>
<p> it? I mean what about his family, [inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hang on hang on. All I'm saying to you is that the death of any</p>
<p> young person is an awful tragedy, and he was a boy of only 15 and I feel</p>
<p> deeply sorry for his family and for all those people associated with him.</p>
<p> These things are difficult. I can understand why some people who are affected</p>
<p> by crime want mandatory sentencing and you have hard cases on both sides</p>
<p> of the argument.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right. The Queen's coming next month I think. Is that right?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's right. On the 17th of March.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Are we going to get a total breakdown of the cost of that to the Australian</p>
<p> taxpayers?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'll no doubt be asking. We'll provide it in the normal</p>
<p> way if we're asked.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>I'm asking now.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it will cost money. The precise amount I don't have in mind,</p>
<p> I'd have to check that. I haven't brought that with me. I don't</p>
<p> deny that. I would defend that. I mean, running a system of government</p>
<p> costs money. If we had a president, that president would want to go overseas</p>
<p> probably far more than the Governor-General does and that would cost us</p>
<p> money. You would still have Yarralumla. You would still have the cost</p>
<p> of maintaining the office of head of state. So...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>I didn't even mention the republic.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, but I know deep down that's what you are really getting at.</p>
<p> I think I understand you.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Do you now? All right. Now, just finally too, would you have handled</p>
<p> the National Textiles issue any differently had you had your time over?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I wouldn't have Howard. I think this is an incredibly hypocritical</p>
<p> performance by the Labor Party. What I have done, and my Government has</p>
<p> done, is to help 330 battlers in a depressed regional area of Australia...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>342 I think.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>342. And, you know, what's more...I have done exactly what Mr</p>
<p> Beazley implored me to do. The very day that we took the decision Mr Beazley</p>
<p> was on the picket line at Rutherford demanding that these men and women</p>
<p> get their full entitlements. He wasn't then saying that his request</p>
<p> was addressed to Mr Anderson, that I should stand aside. He was not saying</p>
<p> John Anderson should see they get their full entitlements, he was saying</p>
<p> John Howard should. And he only raised this question of a conflict of</p>
<p> interest after the media raised it. Mr Beazley did not lead on the issue</p>
<p> of conflict of interest, he followed, because he thought it might be a</p>
<p> cheap line after we looked after the workers to have a go at me. I mean,</p>
<p> I have got in front of me now a letter, a fascinating letter, written</p>
<p> to me on the 25th of January and it's signed by five Labor</p>
<p> members both federal and State in the Hunter Valley region of New South</p>
<p> Wales imploring me to honour my commitment to protect workers entitlements</p>
<p> by guaranteeing sacked workers at National Textiles receive every dollar</p>
<p> they are legally entitled to. Now, that letter made no reference to a</p>
<p> conflict of interest. That letter was not addressed to John Anderson,</p>
<p> it was addressed to me. And what they were begging me to do in this letter</p>
<p> is what I did. Having done it they are now attacking me for having helped</p>
<p> the workers.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Well, that's, you know, that's politics isn't it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I know, but it is politics and this attack that is now being mounted</p>
<p> and this questioning about whether I should or should not have been involved</p>
<p> is...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, let's make the other point and that is this, that none of the</p>
<p> money that has gone to these workers goes to the company or any of the</p>
<p> shareholders or any of the directors. The directors of the company, and</p>
<p> in particular the Chairman who everyone knows is my brother, I mean, everybody</p>
<p> has known that for weeks, it's been on the front page of the paper,</p>
<p> he gets absolutely nothing, absolutely nothing out of this.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Doesn't he get off the hook?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, he doesn't because he is subject to an investigation by the</p>
<p> Securities Commission and they have very extensive powers of prosecution,</p>
<p> of fining and so forth. He doesn't get off any hook. He's like</p>
<p> any other citizen he is subject to the law and I have got to make this,</p>
<p> you know, quietly but very firmly plain to you and your listeners, he</p>
<p> gets nothing out of this. He's not being protected, he's exposed</p>
<p> to a full investigation along with the other directors. I mean, I don't</p>
<p> personally believe he has done anything wrong but that is a matter that</p>
<p> has to be investigated in the normal way. But this monumental hypocrisy</p>
<p> of Labor. They hammer me, they, in fact, use the family connection to</p>
<p> try and embarrass me into providing help and help having been provided</p>
<p> they now try and use the family connection retrospectively to suggest</p>
<p> that I have behaved in some way improperly. I mean, that is rank hypocrisy</p>
<p> and I don't think it washes. I think people out there understand</p>
<p> one thing and that is we helped the workers because I felt sorry for them</p>
<p> and the Government felt sorry for them.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right. We'll probably find out in October next year the end</p>
<p> result of that. Prime Minister thanks for joining us first up here with</p>
<p> the Sattler file on the eastern seaboard and I look forward to having</p>
<p> you as a regular guest in the future.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Thanks for joining us.</p>
<p>[ends]</p>
