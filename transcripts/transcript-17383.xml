Prime Minister Julia Gillard today announced the new Ministry of the Gillard Government.</p>
<p>The Ministry will work together to deliver a stronger, sustainable economy and better services for all Australians.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said the Ministry includes experienced members of her Labor team remaining in Cabinet positions to continue their outstanding work in the most senior portfolios.</p>
<p>They will also work closely with the Independents and the Greens to deliver stable and effective government for all Australians for the next three years no matter where they live.</p>
<p>The Deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan will remain as Treasurer to continue to build our economy and bring the budget back into surplus by 2013.</p>
<p>This will provide Australia with economic stability at a time when many other developed countries continue to feel the brunt of the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>The Ministry will continue to have a sharp focus on job creation and improving skills and education.</p>
<p>As promised, the new Ministry will provide a new focus on regional Australia with a dedicated Department within my portfolio and a dedicated Cabinet Minister, who will be supported by Ministers and parliamentary secretaries across the nation.</p>
<p>The Ministry also delivers on the promise to develop a sustainable population policy approach and a sustainable Australia.</p>
<p>The Ministry will continue to deliver welfare reforms, better health services and continue the rollout of the National Broadband Network right around the country.</p>
<p>The new Ministry will be dedicated to the development of a national response to climate change driven by a deep and lasting consensus of the Australian people.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said the appointment of several new Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries would bring fresh ideas into the fold, creating a dynamic mix of enthusiasm, expertise and experience.</p>
<p>She said the addition of new faces in the ministry reflects the depth of talent in the Parliamentary Labor Party and demonstrates that the Gillard Government can deliver stable and effective government for the next three years.</p>
<p>The new Gillard Ministry will have a focus on openness and transparency and on finding common ground both within the Parliament and in the community to improve our nation's future.</p>
<p>This will further the consultative approach the Prime Minister has promised to deliver in this historic minority government in the 43rd Parliament of Australia.</p>
