PRIME MINISTER 22 FEBRUARY 1979<br />
From the Press Office<br />
SUMMARY OF ABC'S 7: 45_ AMNEWS_<br />
In a sudden and dramatic move last night, the Minister for<br />
Finance, Mr. Robinson, resigned from the Ministry. No reason<br />
was given by Mr. Robinson or the Prime Minister.<br />
Duncan Fairweather reports Mr. Robinson's resignation came<br />
without warning: According to those close to Mr. Robinson<br />
he had become increasingly disenchanted with Mr. Fraser's<br />
leadership. They explained this was probably brought to a<br />
head when the Prime Minister apparently agreed with<br />
Mr. Bjelke Petersen on a Queenslander Senate ticket favouring<br />
the National Party to which Mr. Robinson objected.<br />
Leader of the Opposition, MR. HAYDEN, said last night,<br />
Mr. Robinson's resignation amounted to a vote of " no confidence"<br />
in Mr. Fraser from a senior Minister. Mr. Hayden: " Mr. Robinson<br />
has resigned as a protest at the autocratic manner in which<br />
Mr. Fraser conducts the affairs of the Cabinet and of the country.<br />
Mr. Robinson is no longer prepared to be over-ridden on important<br />
matters of policy where it is his responsibility to provide<br />
advice and where the Prime Minister doesn't like it. In those<br />
circumstances it is clear Mr. Robinson feels he cannot share<br />
the collective responsibility of important decisions of the<br />
Prime Minister imposed on the Cabinet in the area of economic policy".<br />
Chinese troops are reported to have entered a second provincial<br />
capital in their invasion of Northern Vietnam. Reports say<br />
Chinese troops stormed into town of Cao Bang yesterday and fierce<br />

Federal Government has given the go-ahead for General Motors<br />
Holden to build its $ 210 million engine plant in Victoria.<br />
Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Lynch announced decision<br />
in Parliament last night. Has already been unfavourable<br />
reaction from the unions and the Opposition. ACTU has arranged<br />
a meeting of several vehicle industry unions in Melbourne today<br />
to discuss the plan. The Government's decision will mean changes<br />
to the local content plan. Federal Secretary of Federated<br />
Ironworkers Union, Mr. Laurie Short, said he believed the<br />
Government had acted with undue haste. GMH's Managing Director<br />
hailed the Government's decision as a milestone in the re-structuring<br />
of Australian manufacturing at large.<br />
Repco, biggest maker of car parts in Australia, has announced<br />
a 50 percent profit increase in six months to the end of last year.<br />

an Islamic Republic. Trouble continues in the country: reports<br />
of fighting and casualties. / 2 </p>

Branch of the ALP. Queensland's Labor Senator, Jim Keefe,<br />
told the Party's State Conference in Rockhampton he has<br />

Federal Executive. The charges allege the Queensland branch<br />
broke Labor Party rules when it stripped the Federal Leader,<br />
Mr. Hayden, of his right to appoint Senator Georges as his<br />
stand-in in the ALP's Queensland Administrative Committee.<br />
