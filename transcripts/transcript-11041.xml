<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is this the end of the GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will you make a revised offer to Senator Harradine?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No there's no point in us making a revised offer to Senator Harradine.</p>
<p> We had a very lengthy and focussed discussion yesterday and again</p>
<p> today. Senator Harradine made it very plain to me that his objection</p>
<p> is a fundamental one, it's not a question of quantum of compensation.</p>
<p> He acknowledges that the changes we propose to make are significant,</p>
<p> are generous, so it is not a question of further bargaining with him,</p>
<p> and in any event we have to preserve a sense of balance and proportion</p>
<p> about the additional compensation. We want to protect the surplus</p>
<p> and there are other calls on a budget surplus, and our position is</p>
<p> that this country needs taxation reform. We had the courage and the</p>
<p> honesty to take a plan to the people at the last election. We didn't</p>
<p> hold anything back. I mean you can't accuse us of that. We didn't</p>
<p> say in general terms look if you put it back we'll slip in a</p>
<p> few tax cuts. We actually spelt out in detail both the good and the</p>
<p> not so attractive elements of taxation reform and we made an honest</p>
<p> pitch and we won the election and we're persevering with this</p>
<p> because we think it is good for Australia, that's why we are</p>
<p> persevering with it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can I just take you back, just a day or so. You made an offer to Senator</p>
<p> Harradine that you would increase the compensation for people at the</p>
<p> bottom of the ladder. How much was that offer? It was about what $1.5</p>
<p> billion?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, yes. The offer that was put yesterday was ... it has four</p>
<p> or five pieces. One of these was that we'd increase the overall</p>
<p> compensation from 4% to 5% for pensioners. We'd increase from</p>
<p> 25% to 26% the average weekly earnings guarantee. Now, those two things</p>
<p> together on a full year basis cost about $800 or $900 million dollars</p>
<p> and they represent the permanent guarantee of compensation. The argument</p>
<p> that came up in the Senate hearings that in some way the compensation</p>
<p> might be eroded, we never thought that was a very good argument, but</p>
<p> this change ends that for all time because pensioners will always</p>
<p> be at least 26% of male average weekly earnings, and up front, the</p>
<p> 4% becomes the 5%. In addition to that, we intend to increase the</p>
<p> family allowance payments for large families, we are going to double</p>
<p> them for the fourth and subsequent children and in future it will</p>
<p> be for the third and subsequent children.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And you will still put those amendments to Parliament?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh yes. Having told Senator Harradine that we thought they were appropriate,</p>
<p> it would be quite improper to say well, they are only available if</p>
<p> Senator Harradine votes for the package. I mean we don't operate</p>
<p> that kind of Government, and every single proposal I put to Senator</p>
<p> Harradine will be moved as an amendment to the legislation in the</p>
<p> Senate. We will keep complete faith with everything we put up.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But Harradine won't vote for it, won't go along with it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, well he won't. He put it plain to me that he will vote</p>
<p> against the third reading, in other words, the final decision on the</p>
<p> bill as it comes out of the committee, that he will vote against.</p>
<p> Now if he and the Democrats and the Labor Party vote against it, then</p>
<p> it will go down, and the Greens as they've all said, it will</p>
<p> go down. Now I think that will be a tragedy for the economic future</p>
<p> of Australia and I think it will be a denial of the political process.</p>
<p> I mean, what more can you do Mike, whether you agree with me or disagree</p>
<p> with me on things, that's not the point, anybody can do that.</p>
<p> But I mean, how else are we meant to operate in this country. I mean,</p>
<p> people are always saying politicians don't keep their promises</p>
<p> and they mislead them at election time. Well, I didn't mislead</p>
<p> the Australian people at the election about the GST, and I want to</p>
<p> keep my promise, and I'm being prevented from doing so by a Senate</p>
<p> that will not accept the verdict of the Australian people.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is that your last offer on the GST. Would you at any stage now consider</p>
<p> exempting food from the GST...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, we are not going to exempt food because...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But you...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Can I say that there is a lesser case for exempting food now than</p>
<p> 24 hours ago, because we have increased the compensation. I mean the</p>
<p> whole idea of compensation is to look after low income people who</p>
<p> are paying the GST on items like food. Now by boosting the compensation</p>
<p> massively, well, significantly... by boosting the compensation</p>
<p> you actually reduce the argument for exempting food, you reduce it</p>
<p> quite dramatically.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So, every way I look at this, the GST is sunk  that you will</p>
<p> not get it through the Senate.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, if the package is rejected before as I expect the 30th</p>
<p> of June, well, we will return the legislation to the Senate again,</p>
<p> and we will try again. I mean, I do not intend to walk away from tax</p>
<p> reform. I mean I have been in public life now for 25 years...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On Tuesday.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>On Tuesday. I believe that tax reform is good for Australia. And I</p>
<p> thought the whole idea of electing people to public office was for</p>
<p> them to do things they thought were good.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Now, this is a shattering personal blow to you, if I can put it that</p>
<p> way, isn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it is not a shattering personal blow, I mean, I think it is a</p>
<p> great setback for Australia.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But you staked so much of your belief, of your career...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, well I know, but the game is not over, the play is not finished.</p>
<p> And I intend to go ahead with this because I believe in it and I think</p>
<p> I owe the Australian people the honesty of saying to them, I will</p>
<p> continue to persevere with it, I will continue to fight for something</p>
<p> that I believe is good for this country and which I told you about</p>
<p> before the last election. I have to keep going back to that. It's</p>
<p> so fundamental to the trust between politicians and people. I told</p>
<p> the Australian people what I wanted to do and I won the election and</p>
<p> I want to do it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>....majority of the vote...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah but I mean, Mike, I mean you know as well as I do that it's seats</p>
<p> that count and I mean on that sort of basis Bob Carr should not have</p>
<p> been the Premier at the last election in New South Wales. I mean,</p>
<p> break it down, you know how the system operates. We have won the election</p>
<p> and....</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible] and it's the seats that count, but you don't</p>
<p> have the seats in the Senate so there you go.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah, but I mean, we told people what we were going to do.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Yeah, entirely.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And if I now walk away from it people will say, well he didn't really</p>
<p> believe in it.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Now, I do believe in it and I am going to keep persevering.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>If you - nobody doubts your capacity to persevere - if you roll the</p>
<p> legislation, the bill up again the ...GST up again to the Senate,</p>
<p> presumably the [inaudible] and it's rejected again you'd have grounds</p>
<p> for an election, would you take them?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, obviously you and I both know how those double dissolution provisions</p>
<p> work and the answer to that question is, yes there would be. The question</p>
<p> of the timing of the next election is not something that I would dream</p>
<p> of entertaining at this stage. We just had an election. I heard the</p>
<p> tail end of Mr Beazley saying he doesn't want an election....</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>He doesn't.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think he does, I don't think the Australian people do.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But the Australian people do by and large think that if people get</p>
<p> to them and put down a platform and they get elected then they ought</p>
<p> to implement it. And we are going to persevere and keep trying.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But the rock hard reality is that you've got nowhere to go unless</p>
<p> you can somehow persuade Harradine to....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, let us, I mean, there is still water to flow under the bridge.</p>
<p> I mean, it hasn't yet been rejected the first time.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>It's a pretty thin trickle though isn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the omens aren't as good now as they were a day ago but all</p>
<p> sorts of things happen in politics. I think a lot of people in the</p>
<p> community are going to say: gee they have increased the compensation</p>
<p> a lot, it's an even fairer package.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You are relying on a popular uprising.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't know, I don't quite believe in popular uprisings. But</p>
<p> in the end, people have to listen to what the public says and thinks</p>
<p> and I will just persevere. I am not accepting that the thing is dead,</p>
<p> not accepting that for a moment. And, I mean, after all....</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>This is the fat lady sings theory then is it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't think that is entirely appropriate. I think it's always</p>
<p> expect the unexpected' thing.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>All right. But you have only got until the end of June and the new</p>
<p> Senate takes over and you haven't got a hope in hell of anything there</p>
<p> have you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it depends, I suppose, on the mood of the new Senators when</p>
<p> it actually gets down to the wire doesn't it?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Right. Has this ruined your weekend?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, it hasn't ruined my weekend. I would have rathered it went</p>
<p> otherwise but....</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Were you surprised that it happened today? I mean, Mr Costello's on</p>
<p> a plane, you are in Brisbane?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I was always coming to Brisbane because I had a post-Budget commitment</p>
<p> to fulfil. But I have been in this game so long that I don't get surprised</p>
<p> by these things anymore. And I am disappointed, I am quite disappointed</p>
<p> because I felt on all considerations of principle he ought to put</p>
<p> his hand up for it because he has normally respected the mandate of</p>
<p> the Government particularly if it makes the disclosure of its policy</p>
<p> before the election and I had that very much in mind when I went to</p>
<p> that last election. I knew that on his past track record Brian Harradine</p>
<p> always respected a government that actually disclosed what it intended</p>
<p> to do in full before an election. And I also felt that...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>In that sense you gambled and lost.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's not a question of gambling and lost. I mean, I did it because</p>
<p> I think taxation reform is good for the country. I didn't put taxation</p>
<p> reform up at the last election as some kind of gambler's fetish</p>
<p> I put it up because I thought it was good for the country. And it</p>
<p> still is and nothing has changed, it's still good for Australia now</p>
<p> as it was 24 hours ago. The fact that Brian Harradine has said he</p>
<p> won't support it doesn't remove its economic worth for the long-term</p>
<p> future of Australia and it doesn't alter the fact that we have an</p>
<p> old-fashioned ramshackle tax system. I mean, all those arguments are</p>
<p> still there and we are in the arena of ideas and political debate</p>
<p> and I am just going to go on arguing the cause because that is the</p>
<p> point of being in public life to do things that are in the long-term</p>
<p> interests of the country.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Right. Prime Minister, thanks very much for your time, I appreciate</p>
<p> that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
