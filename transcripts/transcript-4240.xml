ELECTORAL TALK<br />
A number of significant det. isions that effect the training and<br />
employment of thousands of Australians were made by the Federal<br />
Government this week.<br />
These decisions are in line wi ' ththe Government's commitment to<br />
expand emp-loyment incentives for manufacturers and businessmen.<br />
They also illh::. strate the Government's real concern about<br />
unemployment particularly among the young.<br />
First, employers are now# Thffered a $ 58 a week subsidy to train<br />
last year's unemployed school leavers.<br />
This ' on the job' training subsidy for private employers and<br />
public authorities is considerably greater than the normal<br />
subsidy payable for young people under the national employment<br />
and training scheme.<br />
Young people will qualify for training if they are between 15 and<br />
19 years old, have left school in the preceeding year and have<br />
registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service for six months.<br />
A special feature of the programme is that it provides for a<br />
training plan to be devised for each person. This will be tailored<br />
to overcome their particular employment problems and will guide<br />
their training on the job.<br />
The Governpment shortly will announce details of how and when<br />
young people can apply. Further information will also be available<br />
from Commonwealth Employment Service offices.<br />
This measure is an important initiative that reflects our genuine<br />
concern for the short and long term effects of unemploymentparticularly<br />
for young people.<br />
This week the Government also announced a number of improvements<br />
in the national employment and training scheme.<br />
Broadly, the scheme has been reformed in three main areas: I<br />
allowances for in-plant training and living away from home have<br />
been substantially increased; trainees, carrying out formal courses<br />
on a full time basis will in future be able to increase their<br />
earnings without affecting their allow ances. And finally, gr-aater<br />
opportunities will be availahle for part time training. Trhis<br />
initiative will be of considerable assistance to married women<br />
who are unable to take on full time training beca,: use of familyI<br />
responsibilities. 1 </p>
