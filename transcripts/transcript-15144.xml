<p>Thank you very much Michael. My colleague Julie Bishop, who is the Federal Minister for Education and of course a Western Australian and in the Federal Parliament, Principal, Deputy Principal, school captains Luke and Lauren, my fellow Australians both young and old. Way back in the 1950s I went to a school in Sydney not unlike Balcatta. I am a product of the public government education system of New South Wales and I am very, very grateful and I have remained so all my life for the education that that system gave me. </p>
<p>I left school in the middle of the 1950s, I know before just about everybody in this room was born, I am sorry about that. But it's an interesting thing to draw some parallels between the world that I faced in the middle 1950s and the world that those of you who will leave school at the end of this year and in the next few years will face in the early part of the 21st Century. </p>
<p>Your school motto is </p>
