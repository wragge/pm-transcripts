    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER TURNBULL: </strong><br />
Well, welcome Justin. It’s always good to get together. And we’ve got such strong ties and such a long history of cooperation in peace and wars. Strategic, economic – a lot to talk about.</p>
<p>Big political challenges in your neighbourhood, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU: </strong><br />
Indeed, indeed. That might come up but mostly we’re going to talk about ways we continue to work together both on strengthening our economic and cultural ties for our citizens, but also how we continue to play a strong positive role, not just in the region in Asia, but around the world. We have lots of collaborations on security and other issues around values and human rights and we’re going to continue to.</p>
<p>strong&gt;PRIME MINISTER TURNBULL:<br />
Yep, our cooperation in the battle against terrorism is growing all the time. It’s a global challenge and as part of the Five Eyes we have the closest and most intimate cooperation.</p>
<p>Great to see you and we’ll have a good chat.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU: </strong><br />
Thank you.</p>
