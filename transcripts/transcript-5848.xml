AUST'I I. A<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY JULY 4 1982<br />
MR HAYDEN'S POSITION ON NORTH WEST CAPE AGREEM. 4: NT<br />
Mr Hayden last week once again raised doubts about his real<br />
commitment to the Australian-US alliance. Early last. month,<br />
Mr Hayden stated a policy which meant that no US, British, or<br />
French Naval vessels could visit Australian ports. Australia's<br />
ability to co-operate under the ANZUS Treaty would have been<br />
p shattered. After talking with the US Deputy Secretary of State,<br />
Mr Stoessel, Mr Hayden said he supported ANZUS and would<br />
allow the ships of allies into Australian ports, although<br />
his statements were at all times equivocal.<br />
Then last week, Mr Hayden apparently repeated his statement<br />
of last year that Australia must be able to veto all US<br />
orders initiating military action which might go through<br />
the joint communications facilities at North West Cape.<br />
Why, only days after claiming to support ANZUS, did he revive<br />
his North West Cape policy which would so damage AlNZUS and<br />
Australia's defence co-operation with the United States?<br />
The ANZUS treaty commits Australia and the US separately and<br />
jointly, through continuous and effective self-help and mutual<br />
aid, to maintain and develop their individual and collective<br />
capacities to resist attack. One of the steps we took together<br />
against the background of ANZUS was to set up the North West<br />
Cape facilities for defence communication.<br />
The North West Cape agreement provides for consultation at the<br />
request of either government concerning the station and its<br />
use. It is a relay station, a way of ensuring that information<br />
can always be transmitted to submarines, even underwater.<br />
The most urgent messages would concern US response to an<br />
aggressor. In such a situation, Mr Hayden's proposed veto<br />
would be absurd. In requiring the US to n k the Australian<br />
Government whether it w.: iF hed to in terpose a veto, Mr l-i'yden<br />
must know he is demandi rgq the ipmpoisible.<br />
It has always been known that the North West Cape facilities are<br />
part of the United Stn '. etc: r rcnce system:. Mr Ha ' den's position<br />
would seriously weoaken I-. e e' f-, t iveness oc the US deterrent to<br />
nuclear war, which is ;: iportan; to Aut:-in's security and to<br />
the security to a. 1Wo'.' r S ni! 1O' ./ 2 </p>
<p>Noctrh West Cape is a joint fac lity for the benefit of Australia<br />
and the US as independent and co-operating allies. Australia<br />
uses it to transmit lmessages to our ships. We would not accept<br />
any interference in imeieages we send. Ncr would we expect to<br />
dictate to the U; what cssag; e. it could or could not send.<br />
The North West Cape agreement c( ontains no idea of control,<br />
by either government, of the messages which the other might<br />
send through the facility. Successive Labor Defence Ministers<br />
in the Whitlam Government accepted the operations of the<br />
facilities. They recognised that there could be no veto. With<br />
that experience behind him, why does Mr Hayden now call for a<br />
veto? It is because he wants to shut the facility down, as he<br />
has threatened to do? If that is what lie wants, then the<br />
community ought to know, because closing it down would weaken<br />
the US and Australia significantly.<br />
Mr Hayden's renewal of his veto demands, after the ANZUS conference,<br />
and after his discussions with Mr Stoessel and his subsequent<br />
statements, raises serious questions about what his real<br />
position is on defence co-operation with the United States.<br />
It raises basic doubts about what he means when he talks<br />
about support for ANZUS. How can Mr Hayden say that Labor<br />
" will do nothing to undermine" ANZUS when he wants to impose<br />
these impossible demands on the United States? Australia's<br />
relations with the US would inevitably be damaged if these<br />
demands were pursued. Mr Hlayden must know this. Why then<br />
has he renewed them? After his equivocations on admitting<br />
nuclear armed ships to Australian ports, why is he now insisting<br />
on a North West Cape position so much more acceptable to the<br />
socialist left? </p>
