<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard will host the Government's 40th Community Cabinet meeting in Ringwood on Wednesday 17 April.</p>
<p>This meeting will be the fifth Community Cabinet to be held in Victoria, and will provide a unique opportunity for members of the community to meet federal government ministers face-to-face.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister and Member for Deakin Mike Symon today encouraged local residents to register to attend the meeting, which will be held at the Norwood Secondary College.</p>
<p>âEveryone is welcome to register to attend the meeting, with opportunities available to meet ministers face-to-face or ask a question at the forum,â said Mr Symon.</p>
<p>Ministers are looking forward to discussing the Government's plan for Australia's future at the forum â ensuring every child gets a world-class education; delivering Disability Care Australia; creating new jobs; and investing in infrastructure like the National Broadband Network.</p>
<p>Registrations open from Tuesday 2 April to Friday 5 April, but may close earlier if capacity is reached.</p>
<p>If people want to attend the public forum only, they can register online at <a href="http://www.pm.gov.au">http://www.pm.gov.au</a> or by calling 1800 088 323.</p>
