PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTERt, THE HON PJ. KEATING MP<br />
Business Council Of Australia Annual General Meeting<br />
Sydney, 15 October 1992<br />
Our partnership with the Business Council is now almost a decade old.<br />
It dates back to the heady days of the Economic Summit of 1983 and the realisation by<br />
the business community at that time that there was a need for a ncw organisation to<br />
meet the times.<br />
There was a need for a sophisticated business viewpoint different from the narrow<br />
sectional views of the past.<br />
With the Government clearly interested in building a community-wide commitmecnt<br />
for change and reform, business wanted to be part of that commitment, part of that<br />
change. For the Government's pait, we welcomed this dcsire by the business community to be<br />
included and we were pleased at the decision to establish thc BCA in 1983.<br />
There have been the occasional celebrated squabbles over the years.<br />
But we have continued to work together and talk together.<br />
We have been able to co-operate with the BCA in a range of ways.<br />
I am glad that we are keeping the lines of communication open because that is a<br />
hallmark of this Labor Government.<br />
I have always believed that a solid partnership with business should be a central plank<br />
of a successful Labor Government.<br />
Without a confident, profitable, expanding business sector Australia will not be able to<br />
build the basis for a successful society or a successful nation.<br />

Without it wo will not be able to generate-. b<br />
Without it, we will not be able to cut unemployment and give hope to those who<br />
would otherwise face a barren future.<br />
Without a successful business community we will not be able to achieve a better<br />
environment, or better social infrastructure,<br />
Wc will not be able to look after peoplc as we would wish.<br />
With this Government, success with business is the starting point of a virtuous circle<br />
which underpins a successful society.<br />
And all my public life I have been of thc view that building a successful business is a<br />
complex and difficult matter.<br />
This realisation came to me as I tried to help businesses in my electorate of Bankstown<br />
cope with the debilitating years of the 1970s.<br />
It was reinforced by my experience of the 1980s.<br />
When I became Treasurer in 1983, the view at the time was that the key to building<br />
successful businesses was for the Government to take steps to boost profits, get rid of<br />
the so called " real wage overhang", cut back the size of the public sector, reduce<br />
public borrowing and cut inflation.<br />
At the time this hardly seemed enough to me and I added the need for more<br />
competition by international islng the economy and deregulating the financial markets.<br />
I also saw the importance In establishing and developing a dialogue with the Trade<br />
-Uipflrnoveincnt and with talking to business and other groups at the Economic<br />
Summit. This was not just to rebuild profits after the bleak Fraser years but to build a<br />
commitment for workplace and community change.<br />
Having made remarkable progress on these fronts, we then took on the task of<br />
microeconomic reform.<br />
We embarked on reforming aviation, the ports, shipping, land transport,<br />
communication and the rest.<br />
I mention all of this to make the point that thcre are no simple text book solutions to<br />
building succesful businesses.<br />

3<br />
The agenda for governments must of necessity be a long one and must be addressed<br />
with dexterity and with a feel for all thc inter-relationships that exist within a society.<br />
Take for example the Government's commitment to boosting business investment in<br />
research and development by maintaining the R D tax concession at 150%<br />
indefinitely.<br />
This is part of a deliberate strategy to accelerate the speed with which Australian<br />
industry improves the sophistication of its products.<br />
This Is what we must do if we are to make our way in the world.<br />
The cost of the R D concessions is worth carrying on the budget to help structural<br />
change and expand industries which will form the basis of tomorrow's job growth.<br />
Ukcwise, the ooeaieRsac Centr&amp; es both a way of devcloping links<br />
between government funded resarch outfits and business and a means of spawning<br />
ncw industries.<br />
And we are having success.<br />
34 of these centres are now in place and this will increase to around 50 by the middle<br />
of next ye~ ar.<br />
Communications, agriculture, mining, manufacturing, medical research, the<br />
environment and others arc covered by these centres.<br />
Frequently it is industry that is taking the lead as is the case with Hawker de Havilland<br />
and Asta which were instrumental in setting up the centre for Aero, Space Structures.<br />
Also, the centres cut across a wide, range of industries BHP, Carlton and United<br />
Breweries, Qantas and CAA are all involved in the centre for intelligent decision<br />
systemns. The centre for waste management and pollution control is supported by many<br />
companies including Brambles, ICI, BliP, ADI, the Water Board and so on.<br />
The whole of Australian. inds is becoming much more focussed on innovation and<br />
research. In 1990, for instance, Australians registered twice as many patents overseas as they did<br />
in 1983.<br />
Providing accelerated depreciation for new equipment investment is also part of a<br />
deliberate strategy to boost investment and grow new industries. </p>
<p>TEL: 15. Oct. 92 16: 55 No. 006 P. 04/ 13<br />
4<br />
These new schedules announced in One Nation mean that our tax rules for investment<br />
will be more than competitive with comparable countries.<br />
Increasing the depreciation rate for tourist-related buldng from 2 1/ 2% to 4% was<br />
also designed to play to our strengths.<br />
The decision to fund a major expansion of vocational training. and to develop a new<br />
national training system more relevant to industry, will help young people get jobs<br />
and is also playing to our strengths.<br />
It Is training, research and development and new investmnt which will create the<br />
industries and the jobs relevant to Australian needs.<br />
They will be industries and jabs which will enable us to take advantage of the growth<br />
prospects in our region.<br />
These are the natural, sensible, creative things that Governmnent should be doing.<br />
And what this Government believes in.<br />
We do not believe in Government withdrawing from its responsibilities.<br />
Nor in simplistic solutions which deny a role for governmcnt.<br />
in effect I am saying beware of those who come before you with simple nostrums<br />
promising salvation.<br />
At this point you probably think I am about to become a little political.<br />
And you are right.<br />
In the next six months or so Australia and Australian businesses have to make a<br />
choice.<br />
They have to decide whether they will embrace Dr Hcwson, and the doctrinaire<br />
narrowness of the E!&amp; ghtback package.<br />
Or whether they will continue to participate with a Government that has a clear reform<br />
agenda but believes in developing partnerships with people.<br />
T'hey will have to decide whether they will embrace the nostrums of Fightback with its<br />
massive dislocating tax shuffle.<br />
They will also have to consider whether they accept the simplistic belief that business<br />
should deal with their employees through intimidation and not through cooperation. </p>
<p>TEL: 15. Ot9 NoUUb~ 5 F U57'Ã±<br />
it is as if Dr HieWSon has been caught in a time warp.<br />
it is as if he has learnt nothing from the succsss and the setbacks of the 1980s.<br />
He remains committed to the text book ' Solutions' that he learnt in the 1970' s and<br />
which Malcolm Fraser stopped him from Introducing.<br />
Can business really be expected to believe, for instance, that it has been the $ 6 billion<br />
state payroll tax and the $ 7 billion excise on petrol that has been the major factor<br />
holding them back all thewe years.<br />
Can they really believe that the removal of these two taxes would unleash a business<br />
surge that would enable them to conquer new markets in Asia or develop a new<br />
product. Life is rnot like that.<br />
T7hey should also consider that the payroll tax is a State tax and that thc States will not<br />
be properly compensated by Fightback for its abolition.<br />
As a result of Fightback, the States will suffer a cutback of rno less than $ 1.4 bil lion in<br />
Commonwealth funding.<br />
Consequently they will be looking for new revenue sources, most of which are likely<br />
to impact on business.<br />
Business should also realise that Fighthack is committed to $ 13 billion of income tax<br />
cuts it can't properly pay for.<br />
Consequently any Coalition government at the Commonwealth level will also be<br />
looking for extra revenue.<br />
Doubtless through higher road user charges or some such.<br />
It is an unplcasant fact of life that one way or another the books will eventually have<br />
to add up.<br />
People have to accept that Fightback cannot at the same time be a major benefit to<br />
business without hurting households.<br />
Some one is going to miss out.<br />
But most Importantly, business should have every reason to disregard any benefits<br />
from the changes to payroll tax and the petrol excise because they would be funded by<br />
a $ 27 billion GST which is a tax on everything they produce. </p>
<p>TEL: 15. Oct. 92 16: 55 No. 006 P. 06/ 13<br />

A tax equal to over half of the current income tax.<br />
And why tax everything?<br />
Why tax the output of an expanding industry like the tourism industry, which is where<br />
the jobs and our future lies?<br />
Particularly when a GST on domcstic tourism will make it relatively cheaper for<br />
Australians to take thcir holidays overseas.<br />
Why drive Australians offshore?<br />
Why tax food?<br />
It can only be an ideological obsession with the GST itself.<br />
In 1985 believed in a GST.<br />
But upon later reforming the income tax system I realised it was not worth the<br />
macrocconomic dislocation.<br />
I do not believe In a GST today and I haven't believed in one for many years.<br />
It's too big a price to pay for too little return.<br />
On the other hand, Dr M-cwson ploughs on regardless.<br />
And it is not only the mirage and dislocation of the tax shuffle that business should be<br />
concerned about with Fig~ htback.<br />
They should also be deeply worried about the change that will occur in their<br />
relationship with their employees.<br />
Gone will be the developing commitment to change that the workforce has embraced<br />
over the past decade.<br />
And as many in this room today will appreciate, with that commitment to change has<br />
come a degree of co-operation that has enabled a quite amazing transformation of<br />
industrial practices in this country.<br />
Every day I am being reminded of this by busincss leaders as I go around the country.<br />
In its place will come suspicion, intransigence and a determination to Protect<br />
entrenched entitlements. </p>
<p>TEL: 15 . Oct .92 16 : 55 No0.00G6 0i1<br />

With a l-ewson Government all subsequent progress on workplace reform will be<br />
fought out in that same old culture of conflict which debilitated this country for so<br />
long. Companies who have made existing arrangements work well for thenmselves and for<br />
their employ= e, and who have seen major improvements to work practices and<br />
productivity, will see all that progress dashed,<br />
And for what?<br />
To satisfy an inflexible, anachronistic dogma that refuses to accept that great progress<br />
has been madc in the way Australians do business.<br />
Fightback and Dr Hewson refuse to accept that co-operation can bring big rewards if a<br />
Government accepts its responsibility to promote reform and make it happen.<br />
And, as anyone who has tricd to run a business knows, it is the culture of management<br />
and the employees who in the end determine whether a firm is successful or not.<br />
Dr R-ewson threatens to destroy the great progress we have made over the past decde<br />
in building a productivity culture amongst the workforce.<br />
The successful economies of the world are those that have built up employee<br />
commitment to productivity and invariably this has centred on a cooperative approach<br />
with management.<br />
Dr HewSon's approach to industrial relations will rip all of this apart.<br />
The reform agenda that this Government has overseen is impressive but, most<br />
importantly, it will continue.<br />
It will continue because the Government has locked into place a process that demands<br />
change. We have learnit all of us that change breeds change.<br />
Australia can no longer stand still.<br />
The system now demands that we all make progres.<br />
This is not fully understood by those who believe that Governments should be<br />
constantly inflicting change on the community in some self righteous frenzy.<br />
Governments have to make hard decisions, and I can assure you all that I have<br />
participated in many. </p>
<p>TEL: 15. Oct. 92 16: 55 No .006 P. 08/ 16-<br />
But it is better to also create a community commitment for change and to design a<br />
system which rewards progress and makes it impossible to stand still.<br />
This is what this Government has done by making co-operation and dialogue a key<br />
factor in dealing with change.<br />
But most importantly, by internationalising the conomy we have set forces in train<br />
that are requiring all of us to be competitive with the rest of the world.<br />
Firms that have to deal with the world are dez~ anding that their suppliers are<br />
competitive and that their services are efficient.<br />
The BCA itself has served a useful role in promoting the needs of business and in<br />
being an agitator for reform.<br />
And as I have said the progress is there.<br />
To take a few examples:<br />
On the waterfront, by October this year the stevedoring workforcc will be half of what<br />
it was three years ago. Our reforms have doubled the number of containers handled<br />
per man and the average ship turn around time has fallen by 39%.<br />
Most importantly thc waterfront now works reliably.<br />
We have more than achieved what we said we would do when we set out on this task<br />
In 1989.<br />
Our ports now compare favourably with best practice overseas.<br />
Stevedoring charges for ncw business and contract renewals have fallen by 25% over<br />
the last year, providing clear evidence that the benefits of reform are being passed on.<br />
In shipping. the Govcrmcnt has also Introduced a new coastal voyag permit syster.<br />
and the number of foreign vessels operating on the Australian coast has increased<br />
rapidly with 48 such voyages in 1988-89 rising to over 200 in 1991-92.<br />
in the last three years crew sizes have fallen by a quarter, to equal the average crewing<br />
for OECD ships visiting Australia . saving industry $ 50 million per year. As a result<br />
ship owners have spent nearly $ 2 billion on 22 new ships about a third of the fleet.<br />
These important changes have been brought about with very little industrial disruption<br />
simply because all parties the Government, shipping companies, the unions, the<br />
shippers all worked together.<br />
Of course more can be done and more is being done. </p>
<p>TEL: 15. Oct. 92 16: 55 No. 006 P. 09/ 13<br />
9<br />
Senator Cook has been working with all parties on the next stage in shipping reform<br />
and we will be announcing that shortly.<br />
By dec&amp; 4ain domestic aviation we cut fares by around 23% in the first eighteen<br />
months; in the twelve months ending March 1992 airfares. fell by a further 14%.<br />
In * 1991-92 a record 17.9 million passengers were carried by domestic carriers, a<br />
massive 30% above the previous peak in 1990-91.<br />
Lower fares have been critical to the success of the tourist industry and we have no<br />
intention of letting competition in aviation wither away.<br />
The Government has also orchestrated a revolution in Australia's international aviation<br />
services.<br />
Ansett will now be able to compete with QANTAS and other international carriers.<br />
To ensure that Anscit has the opportunity to develop into a successful regional airline,<br />
the Government is re-negotiating our air service agrecments with other countries to<br />
provide for multiple designation and additional capacity.<br />
The National Rail Corporation, incorporated in September 1991, will reduce the<br />
average cost of providing rail freight services by 45% in real terms, and will improve<br />
labour and rolling stock productivity by 35-45%.<br />
The number of unions with coverage of national rail employees will be reduced from<br />
over 20 to 2 and these unions are currently negotiating an enterprisc agreement with<br />
thc Corporation to deliver these productivity gains.<br />
National Rail will commence operations in February 1993, following completion of<br />
the entcrprise agreement and the passage of all relevant State legislation.<br />
The Corporation will turn around Interstate rail freight from losing around $ 320<br />
million pa to financial break-even in 1995-96, and profitability by 1996-97.<br />
Along with the One Nation spending on rail infrastructure, this will produce an<br />
effective national rail network and create a national standard gauge system for the first<br />
time in our histor-y.<br />
All of this would have been unheard of a short time ago when most assumed our rail<br />
system was heading for extinction.<br />
On roads, all national road projects funded by the Commonwealth are now subject to<br />
tender, doubling the level of funding put to tender since 1988. </p>
<p>T1EL5:. Oct. 92 16: 55 No. 006 P. 10/ 1,<br />
Heavy vehicle mass limits have increased, yielding large cost savings to Australian<br />
industry. Conventional vehicles payloads and productivity have increased up to 20% since the<br />
mid 1980' s.<br />
All of this has led to an unheralded but major advance in transport efficiencies.<br />
National introduction of B-doublcs ( a large artijculatcd vehicle) will allow further<br />
productivity gains of up to 40% which can reduce national transport costs by up to<br />
$ 200 million.<br />
In co-operation with the States, we have established the National Road Transport<br />
Commission to develop and maintain a national systcm of uniform regulations for all<br />
vehicles and a fair system of heavy vehicle charges.<br />
This initiative has been strongly supported by the Road Transport Industry.<br />
And the Industry Commission has estimated that gains to GDP from reforms along<br />
these lines to be in the order of $ 190 million each year.<br />
T'here will be full competition In telecommunications in 1997. As part of this process<br />
we have alrcady introduced a second network carrier with provision for three mobile<br />
phone scrvicci.<br />
The Government has also put in place price control arrangements on charges for<br />
AOTC services to ensure that AOTC do not misuse their existing miarket power, and<br />
that new technology and cfficiency gains are reflected in lower prices to consumers.<br />
As a result, the average price for AOTC's main services has fallen by 4% per annumn in<br />
real terms over the past three years.<br />
For the next three years this price cap has been set at 5.5% below the rate of inflation.<br />
The improvcd profitability and lower prices achieved by AQTC is illustrative of what<br />
is now happening with many government business enterprises.<br />
,_ gMznonwcalth GBE dividends have increased from around $ 100 million in 1987-88<br />
to over $ 440 million in 1991-92 through improved productivity rather than higher real<br />
pricm. But as I said earlier, the agenda moves on.<br />
Ralph Willis will shortly be announcing mecasures that will see the Commonwealth<br />
GBEs operate on a still more commercial basis with realistic relationships between<br />
the GBE's and the Governuent, as shareholder, established.<br />
TEL: </p>
<p>TEL: 15. Ot9 1: 5N. Ub l-. 11' 1-, Y<br />
And the State GBE's are also being subjected to,' and responding to, closer<br />
examination. But the most interesting new development is the National Review of the Trade<br />
Practices Act to be conducted by Fred Hilmer.<br />
Following this review, we the States, Territories and Commonwealth will have the<br />
opportunity to establish a national competition policy.<br />
That is a policy which should support the development of Australia as one competitive<br />
market for our industries, not a sct of divergent regulatory regimes.<br />
Competition policy in the future will need to be consistent with removing unnecessary<br />
barriers to comipctition and a reduction in complexity and administrative duplication.<br />
The significance of these principles and their potential impact is great.<br />
TFhe specific focus of the Review will bc on sectors and industries exempted from the<br />
current Trade Practices Act.<br />
Such as:<br />
State business cntcrprises like electricity, gas ( in some states) and water<br />
unincorporatcd bodies such as partnerships including professions<br />
statutory marketing authorities such as Egg Boards, dairy marketing and fruit and<br />
With the States we arc also committed to making major improvements in electricity<br />
generation and distribution.<br />
Because of our abundance of low cost coal and other energy resoures, electricity<br />
should be a key part of any industrial strategy for this country.<br />
With the States the Commonwealth will be working to make sure that the electricity<br />
generating and distribution industries are efficient and that we make the best use of our<br />
rcsourcc-S.<br />
While the States have primie responsibility in this area we must work for a national<br />
approach. Wo have already secured agreement to the development of an Interstate transmission<br />
network and to genuine separation of distribution and gencration. </p>
<p>TEL: 15. Oct. 92 16: 55 No. 006 P. 12/ 13<br />
12<br />
Work is continuing on this subject through the National Grid Management Council<br />
and will be taken further with the Premiers.<br />
Customers and final users of electricity including members of the BCA also have<br />
an interest in the reform process and I will be discussing with the Premniers how input<br />
from these groups can be given greater prominence.<br />
Let me restate. We value our partnership with you.<br />
For example, in 1984, more than 20 BCA member companies participated in a pilot<br />
program for thc Governmernt's Affirmative Action for women legislation.<br />
More rcently, 5 BCA members have joined with the Governnien to develop practical<br />
ways to address work and family issues in the labour market.<br />
And following a request from your Equal Opportunity Council, I have asked the<br />
Office of the Status of Women in my department to provide peak employer and union<br />
bodies with access to Its Register of Women, which should assist you in locating<br />
qualified women for appointment to boards and senior management positions.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, it is a gentle irony I supposc that the Busincss Council of<br />
Australia has never known a conservative govermecnt.<br />
It's a bit like those of us who lived through the twenty three years of the Menzies<br />
&amp; 0vcrnrncnt.<br />
But this is no reason to believe that it is time for a change.<br />
I think that, notwithstanding the ground we have lost in this recession, our<br />
achievements Australia's achievements in the past decde have been remarkable.<br />
Thc changes have been remarkable the structural changes and the attitudinal ones<br />
We do things differently and we think differently.<br />
And so long as we take the people with us on these things, so long as we involve<br />
people In the change, so long as we stick to those principles of consultation and<br />
consensus, the process will go on.<br />
It could only bo reversed by throwing out the cooperative culture that has developed<br />
over the past decade, and the institutional arrangements and supports which are at<br />
once agents of the change and guarantees of continuity.<br />
Ladies and gentlcmen, I believe we now have a great opportunity. It is one we have<br />
earned all of us. </p>
<p>TEL: 15.0ct. 92 16: 55 No. 006 P. 13/ 13<br />
13<br />
It has been hard won and we are still not there. But we would be very foolish to throw<br />
it away. Very foolish to change the course which is changing Australia.<br />
Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you this afternoon. </p>
