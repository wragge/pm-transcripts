<p> BARTLETT:</p>
<p> Prime Minister Howard, thanks for coming in this morning.</p>
<p> Good morning to you.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well, very good to be with you and it's good to</p>
<p> be back in Perth again.</p>
<p> BARTLETT:</p>
<p> I know you are here for a couple of days . . .</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Mmmm.</p>
<p> BARTLETT:</p>
<p> Three days all up, but do you have any plans to tour</p>
<p> country WA as you did last week in other states?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Not on this visit, but I have visited country WA quite</p>
<p> a lot already. I was the first Prime Minister to visit Kalgoorlie for</p>
<p> almost twenty years. I've been up to Port Hedland and I'll be</p>
<p> visiting country WA again in the course of visits later this year. You</p>
<p> can't go everywhere in a state as big as Western Australia on every</p>
<p> visit. But I have in fact, as I say, spent a lot of time in country areas</p>
<p> of WA and I'll be spending time in country areas of other states</p>
<p> as well as the time I spent in New South Wales and South Australia a couple</p>
<p> of weeks ago. But it's a big country to use that old clich. And</p>
<p> the suburbs of the big cities are important. I was in the outer suburbs</p>
<p> of Perth last night, Joondalup and that's the second, or first ,</p>
<p> it's either the fastest growing or the second growing area in Australia.</p>
<p> It competes with the Albert Shire in Queensland. So, the challenges and</p>
<p> the needs and the concerns of people in the outer suburbs are also important.</p>
<p> I try and make a fair and equitable distribution of my time, I don't</p>
<p> try and focus on one area of the country to the detriment of the other.</p>
<p> I take great care to see that I visit representative areas of the country</p>
<p> as regularly as I possibly can.</p>
<p> BARTLETT:</p>
<p> The reason I ask that question, a lot of pundits are</p>
<p> saying that the next election will be won and lost in the bush. Do you</p>
<p> agree with that?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well, I think the bush is important irrespective of the</p>
<p> election. I think there are problems and challenges and difficulties in</p>
<p> the small country towns and in areas of Australia that have been heavily</p>
<p> dependent on wool and wheat and beef, the traditional commodity exporters.</p>
<p> And they need understanding and help quite separately from any electoral</p>
<p> or political considerations. I don't go to the bush for political</p>
<p> reasons. I go to the bush because I am concerned about some of the problems</p>
<p> Australians living in the bush are facing.</p>
<p> BARTLETT:</p>
<p> Prime Minister do you think on the electoral subject,</p>
<p> do you think Richard Court has anything to fear electorally from the introduction</p>
<p> of the GST on July 1?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> No, I don't. To start with of course it is a, it's</p>
<p> a federal measure. It's been driven by the Federal Coalition and</p>
<p> people do decide federal elections on federal issues, and state elections</p>
<p> on state issues. But more importantly than that, the GST is very good</p>
<p> news for Western Australia. It is very good news for state services, because</p>
<p> for the first time ever, the state of Western Australia will have a growth</p>
<p> tax, and this is something that the current Premier and his predecessors</p>
<p> both Labor and Liberal have always wanted. All the GST goes to the states.</p>
<p> A lot of people lose sight of this fact, they think all the GST is going</p>
<p> to be collected by the Federal Government. In fact, every last dollar</p>
<p> of the GST will be dedicated to the states and the states will have over</p>
<p> time more money for public hospitals, for government schools, for police</p>
<p> services and so forth.</p>
<p> BARTLETT:</p>
<p> When will the confusion stop about the GST? When will</p>
<p> we stop talking about things like used car prices and tampons and such</p>
<p> like?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well, there's no confusion about tampons. Tampons</p>
<p> are going to be included in the GST. But of course people buying them</p>
<p> will have tax cuts.</p>
<p> BARTLETT:</p>
<p> Will cars be cheaper or dearer.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well, cars will be cheaper than they would otherwise</p>
<p> have been without the introduction of the GST. That's always been</p>
<p> the case, there is no confusion about that. That was the case, that was</p>
<p> the case when I announced the tax policy in September of 1998, it's</p>
<p> still the case. As a result of the GST, cars will be cheaper than they</p>
<p> would otherwise have been without the GST, because you will have a 10%</p>
<p> GST replacing a 22% wholesale sales tax. And therefore the end price to</p>
<p> the consumer, if you replace a 22% wholesale sales tax with a 10% GST</p>
<p> must be cheaper than it would otherwise have been.</p>
<p> BARTLETT:</p>
<p> The Australian Taxation Office has admitted today that</p>
<p> less than 20% of Australian businesses have so far registered in the lead</p>
<p> up to the GST. How confident are you that there won't be mass confusion</p>
<p> come July the 1st?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well, people always put things off. It is human nature</p>
<p> and Australians are no different. They say, oh new tax system, that's</p>
<p> next July I'll get around to that after Christmas. And . . .</p>
<p> BARTLETT:</p>
<p> You think that's all it is?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> I do, I do. We're starting a major advertising campaign</p>
<p> tomorrow, to encourage people to register to get their Australian business</p>
<p> number and it is very important that any business that's going to</p>
<p> be caught by the GST and that's ones with a turnover of more than</p>
<p> $50,000 have got to register. Then really you should, you should do it,</p>
<p> otherwise you will not really be part of the system and you'll find</p>
<p> carrying on business a lot more burdensome. But I believe that as we get</p>
<p> closer that that number of people who've registered will rise very</p>
<p> sharply.</p>
<p> BARTLETT:</p>
<p> Have you had any discussions with Richard Court about</p>
<p> how to handle the electorate strategically after the 1st of</p>
<p> July?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Not particularly, because I mean he is a seasoned politician</p>
<p> and he knows that the next state election will be determined on whether</p>
<p> or not the West Australian people want his Government to continue or they</p>
<p> want a return of Labor which has a terrible record in Western Australia.</p>
<p> BARTLETT:</p>
<p> But you've talked about it with him obviously?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Not in great detail no.</p>
<p> BARTLETT:</p>
<p> Just informally?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well, I don't think we've had a discussion</p>
<p> about this for some weeks, I mean we talk a lot about general political</p>
<p> issues. But Richard is a strong supporter of tax reform. The other reason</p>
<p> why it's good for Western Australia is that Western Australia is</p>
<p> a great export state and GST is very good for exporters. Exports will</p>
<p> be cheaper under the GST to the tune of about 4, 3 to $4 billion a year</p>
<p> at least. Because you take all of those embedded wholesale sales tax out</p>
<p> of the cost of preparing goods and services for exports.</p>
<p> BARTLETT:</p>
<p> The input costs.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> The input costs. Now I know a lot of people, exporters</p>
<p> say I've got a wholesale sales tax exemption, but that doesn't</p>
<p> cover the embedded taxes and of course fuel will be cheaper. Not only</p>
<p> are we going to cut the price of diesel, for the mining industry and for</p>
<p> many others, but on top of that you will be able to get, you'll be</p>
<p> able to get a rebate of the GST paid on any fuel that you buy for a business</p>
<p> reason.</p>
<p> BARTLETT:</p>
<p> It would want to be cheaper though, wouldn't it?</p>
<p> I mean today it's hit a dollar. And for the . . .</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Yes, yes.</p>
<p> BARTLETT:</p>
<p> And in a couple of north west town of Western Australia</p>
<p> it's hit a dollar a litre.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Yes but Liam that's got nothing to do with the GST.</p>
<p> That is due to the world price.</p>
<p> BARTLETT:</p>
<p> Yes, but there's understandably nervousness about</p>
<p> what is going to happen to the price.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well, there is. We made a commitment that the price of</p>
<p> petrol need not rise as a result of the introduction of the GST. And we</p>
<p> intend to honour that commitment. But world oil prices going up or down</p>
<p> are in no way related to the goods and services tax.</p>
<p> BARTLETT:</p>
<p> Prime Minister, ten days ago, if we can just move onto</p>
<p> something else. Ten days ago, your Government indicated they would be</p>
<p> writing to the Northern Territory Government and also the WA Government</p>
<p> to request that they review mandatory sentencing laws. Now those letters</p>
<p> have still not be sent. How serious are you about intervening?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well, we take the view that traditionally sentencing</p>
<p> and criminal law matters are matters for state governments. And there</p>
<p> would have to be a very exceptional circumstance to use the external affairs</p>
<p> power, foreign affairs power to intervene. And, I mean there are a lot</p>
<p> of things that state governments do that I may as an individual disagree</p>
<p> with. There are probably things that I, that my government does that the</p>
<p> people in state governments disagree with, but we do run a federation</p>
<p> in this country and criminal law is one of those fundamentally state issues.</p>
<p> BARTLETT:</p>
<p> Well were you just filibusting when you talked about</p>
<p> . . .</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> No, I wasn't filibusting and the Attorney-General</p>
<p> is writing. There's no filibuster. But you have to understand that,</p>
<p> a couple of things, that traditionally this is a state area of state responsibility</p>
<p> and the other thing that seems to have been overlooked is that there has</p>
<p> been no formal finding that the mandatory sentencing laws of Western Australia</p>
<p> or the Northern Territory are in breach of Australia's international</p>
<p> obligations. There seems to have been an assumption made that they are</p>
<p> in breach. Now some people are alleging they're in breach, but I</p>
<p> sought advice on this from the Attorney-General's Department. And</p>
<p> there has been no formal determination. The UN body which sort of adjudicates</p>
<p> on the compliance by party states to international conventions, has not</p>
<p> made a finding that these laws are in breach. Now they may, people may</p>
<p> not like them, there may be people in the UN who have reservations about</p>
<p> some aspects of them but there seems to have been an assumption that there</p>
<p> is an open and shut case on legal grounds for federal intervention, quite</p>
<p> apart from any of the other considerations. Now . . .</p>
<p> BARTLETT:</p>
<p> So, can we just clear that up? Will you still be asking</p>
<p> them to review it?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Yeah. The Attorney-General will be expressing some concerns</p>
<p> about the application, in particular, the application of it to people</p>
<p> under the age of 18. But . . .</p>
<p> BARTLETT:</p>
<p> But it was said with much fanfare. Ten days is a long</p>
<p> time to send a letter.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> I don't think, I think it was said very calmly and</p>
<p> very logically. Look this is a difficult issue and I think most Australians</p>
<p> take the view as I do that these are matters to be resolved by Australia</p>
<p> inside Australia. And can I just make the point that the Secretary General</p>
<p> of the United Nations spent an hour with me and he didn't raise the</p>
<p> matter. And he made it very clear, very clear indeed in his speech to</p>
<p> the National Press Club that he did not regard Australia as being in any</p>
<p> way out of line . . .</p>
<p> BARTLETT:</p>
<p> But you did launch a pre-emptive strike a few days before</p>
<p> . . .</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well . . .</p>
<p> BARTLETT:</p>
<p> And told him basically to butt out of it anyway.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> But hang on, I mean hang on if we are clearly in breach</p>
<p> of, irrespective of what I said, he would have, he would have put a view.</p>
<p> But he actually said that Australia was a model member of the United Nations.</p>
<p> Now I think this whole thing has got out of proportion. I know there is</p>
<p> a concern about the application of these laws to people under the age</p>
<p> of 18. I know everybody is justifiably very distressed about the death</p>
<p> of that young man in the Northern Territory. But, you have deaths in custody,</p>
<p> you have suicides of young people quite separately and apart from the</p>
<p> application of any sentencing laws and I don't think it can be credibly</p>
<p> argued that that was the only cause in the, of that very, very tragic</p>
<p> incident. And I don't know that you can make the leap that because</p>
<p> it occurred than automatically mandatory sentencing laws should go.</p>
<p>  Now I have views on a lot of things states do. I mean</p>
<p> I don't for example agree with heroin injecting rooms, but I do accept</p>
<p> that ultimately that is something that is going to be decided by the states.</p>
<p> And if states decide to go ahead with it, unless they're going ahead</p>
<p> with it is in direct breach of a federal law, and I am not aware at this</p>
<p> stage that it would be, then it's not really the sort of thing that</p>
<p> you intervene in. I mean we've got a federation in this country,</p>
<p> and if people don't like what the Western Australian Government is</p>
<p> doing, it should vote accordingly. If they don't like what my government</p>
<p> is doing, they should vote accordingly. But I think this constant call</p>
<p> on the federal government to get involved in every single issue that occurs,</p>
<p> and to use the foreign affairs powers to do so, I think that is bringing</p>
<p> an imbalance into our system of government that most Australians don't</p>
<p> want.</p>
<p> BARTLETT:</p>
<p> Let's move on to the phones and take some calls.</p>
<p> Hello Kevin.</p>
<p> CALLER:</p>
<p> Good morning.</p>
<p> BARTLETT:</p>
<p> Morning.</p>
<p> CALLER:</p>
<p> Is that Liam. It is Kevin Fay from the Park Owners Association</p>
<p> Liam. I would like to ask the Prime Minister a question on the GST.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Yes.</p>
<p> CALLER:</p>
<p> Mr Howard, why do permanent residents in caravan parks,</p>
<p> who own their own home, have to pay GST on their rent while the tenants</p>
<p> of residential properties do not?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well under the current law as passed, we have a situation</p>
<p> where people in those parks are treated the same as people in furnished</p>
<p> apartments and in long stays in hotels. And what happens is that there</p>
<p> is a five, there is an option as you know as an owner.</p>
<p> CALLER:</p>
<p> That's right.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> You can either, you can either charge a 5% GST and claim</p>
<p> all your input taxing, or alternatively you can chose to be input taxed,</p>
<p> in other words, no GST at all but you don't get your inputs back.</p>
<p> Right?</p>
<p> CALLER:</p>
<p> Mr Howard, I think you misunderstood me . . .</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> No, I haven't. I am sorry, but I haven't misunderstood</p>
<p> you at all. I know precisely the issue you're raising. And the point</p>
<p> I am seeking to make is that if you want to alter it which your question</p>
<p> implies we should do, that will not in anyway be to the benefit of people</p>
<p> who rent on a long term basis, caravans in caravan parks. They will be</p>
<p> no better off, and the idea that they would be better off if we did away</p>
<p> with that option is just wrong.</p>
<p>  CALLER:</p>
<p>  Mr Howard, with respect, let me explain again. I actually</p>
<p> and thousands like me actually own our home, we actually live in a park</p>
<p> for which we pay a rent on each week. So, we're not renting a caravan,</p>
<p> we're not . . .</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Yes, I understand that.</p>
<p> CALLER:</p>
<p> We own the dwelling. Now, what we're saying is that</p>
<p> we are being subjected to a GST when other residents, and residential</p>
<p> properties are not. We are not the same as furnished apartments, we are</p>
<p> not. This is our home.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Yeah, look, I do understand that but it doesn't</p>
<p> alter the fact that if we did what you want us to do, and that is to change</p>
<p> the existing arrangement, you would not be any better off.</p>
<p>  CALLER:</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Because the impact of the change you have in mind would result in the</p>
<p> people to whom you pay the rent being on an input tax bases and that could</p>
<p> have some impact on your rent and therefore you would be no better off.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>Lets move on, Derek, Good Morning.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning Liam, good morning Prime Minister. Welcome to Perth</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Not too bad. May I call you John?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Please yourself.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>John, in regards to the GST on the first of July (inaudible) income tax</p>
<p> cuts and the (inaudible) GST. Can you explain to me and the listeners</p>
<p> at the end of the day, that this achieves a revenue neutral situation</p>
<p> regards to the Federal Governments tax take. Will they actually be taking</p>
<p> less money from the people of Australia or what a lot of people believe</p>
<p> will it be a tax bonanza.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. The Federal Government will in fact be delivering a major reduction</p>
<p> in the tax burden. There will be less revenue collected. I mean one of</p>
<p> the things that has been overlooked about this whole tax reform is that</p>
<p> it will result in a reduction in the tax burden. There will be a twelve</p>
<p> billion dollar cut in income tax and the average family will be $47 a</p>
<p> week better off.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>So what are you saying Derek? You want to know if the Federal Government</p>
<p> is taking more or less?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I want to know if they take more or less. John is this policy taking</p>
<p> less?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>So what people of Australia will have to pay the price with regards services</p>
<p> in regards to hospitals, education and welfare and (inaudible).</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they will actually get better services because the states will get</p>
<p> over time, over time, over time, the states will get the benefit of the</p>
<p> rise of the GST revenue, but of course we have used some of the surplus</p>
<p> accumulated to help fund the tax cuts. We are not denying that. We have</p>
<p> never pretended otherwise but in the end if you build up surpluses, the</p>
<p> public is entitled to get the benefit of that surplus being returned to</p>
<p> them and we have done that in part in helping to fund the tax cuts.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>Alright Derek, thanks for your call. Denis good morning.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>Hello, how are you?, Go ahead.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning Mr Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, how are you? Derek is it?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>No its Dennis. I am talking to you today as the president of the wine</p>
<p> industry association.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes Dennis, how are you?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Very well thank you. I am sure you would be delighted that my question</p>
<p> is not about the GST. But it is however about another new tax.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You are talking about the wine industry are you? Well that is tied up</p>
<p> with the GST Dennis. Let's understand that. The change would not</p>
<p> have resulted were it not for the total tax reform package. So I think</p>
<p> it is a part and parcel of the same thing. So let's not be too coy</p>
<p> about that.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>It is a new tax. Anyway, my members are concerned that the basis you</p>
<p> have introduced it which is on value not volume is grossly inequitable.</p>
<p> It threatens their livelihood. It favours the twenty large companies in</p>
<p> Australia that produces 95% of Australia's wine against the 5, against</p>
<p> the 1,200 that produce the remaining 5%. You'll tell me that you</p>
<p> have introduced by the democrats that the three hundred thousand dollar</p>
<p> concession. Let me say that doesn't go with in a bull's roar</p>
<p> of ....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look I know. I do understand the argument and it's an argument that's</p>
<p> been addressed to us at great length by people in the wine industry. There</p>
<p> are a lot of views in the wine industry. In fairness to other listeners,</p>
<p> we are not going to spend all morning talking about one issue. What you're</p>
<p> seeking is a change away from an ad valorem approach to a volumetric approach.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I am not seeking that at all.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you could have fooled me.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Well I am sorry. I have written to you on this subject, if you answered,</p>
<p> you wouldn't have this confusion. I am asking and our members are</p>
<p> asking and it is supported by the liberal party and the national party</p>
<p> federal conference, the wine makers federation of Australia for an exemption</p>
<p> for the first million dollars of sale in Australia by wine producers.</p>
<p> Now to put that in perspective, two companies alone....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look Dennis, we can't. Look, everybody wants their own exemption.</p>
<p> I mean let's call a spade a spade. I know there are a range of views</p>
<p> in the wine industry. We have already provided in relation to cellar door</p>
<p> sales, quite a generous exemption. You say its not enough. Well there</p>
<p> are a lot of people. I mean I have people in the brewing industry wanting</p>
<p> a change.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Brewing industries are multinationals...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah, hang on, it's all very well to say they're multinationals</p>
<p> and use emotive words like that. The reality is that if you look at each</p>
<p> thing in isolation, you can mount a case of change. Of course you can.</p>
