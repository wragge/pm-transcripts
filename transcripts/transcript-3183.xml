PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 200<br />
8 March 1974<br />
TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE AUTHORITY AND INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE<br />
COMMISSION REFERENCES -MUSHROOMS<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, today announced<br />
that he had sent references to the Temporary Assistance<br />
Authority and the Industries Assistance Commission on the<br />
questions of temporary and long-term assistance for the<br />
Australian industry producing mushrooms and prepared or<br />
preserved mushrooms.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that both the Minister for<br />
Primary Industry and he had received representations<br />
from and on behalf of the Australian mushroom growing<br />
industry and after considering a report prepared by the<br />
Department of Primary Industry he had reached the conclusion<br />
that prima facie cases for the references had been<br />
established by the industry.<br />
Mr. Whitlam made the point that the reference to<br />
the Temporary Assistance Authority was the first to be<br />
sent under the Industries Assistance Commission Act 1973.<br />
Under the Act the Authority is required to report to the<br />
Government on the question of temporary assistance no<br />
later than thirty days from the date of the reference.<br />
