    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, today announced that he had sent references to the Temporary Assistance Authority and the Industries Assistance Commission on the questions of temporary and long-term assistance for the Australian industry producing mushrooms and prepared or preserved mushrooms.</p>
<p>Mr. Whitlam said that both the Minister for Primary Industry and he had received representations from and on behalf of the Australian mushroom growing industry and after considering a report prepared by the Department of Primary Industry he had reached the conclusion that prima facie cases for the references had been established by the industry.</p>
<p>Mr. Whitlam made the point that the reference to the Temporary Assistance Authority was the first to be sent under the Industries Assistance Commission Act 1973. Under the Act the Authority is required to report to the Government on the question of temporary assistance no later than thirty days from the date of the reference.</p>
