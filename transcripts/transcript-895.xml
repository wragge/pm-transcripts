FOR PRESS PoM. No. 17/ 1964<br />
BRITISH EXHIBIT: ON IN SYDNEY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
I am delighted to have been invited to act<br />
jointly with Sir Alec Douglas-Home as President of the<br />
British Exhibition. Aust'alia 1964+, and I am looking forward<br />
to opening the Exhibition in Sydney in September. My colleague,<br />
the Minister for Trade and Industry, has agreed to be Vice-<br />
President jointly with Mr. Edward Heath and Mr. Duncan Sandys.<br />
This will be the first British Exhibition to be<br />
held in any Commonwealth country and it will be the most<br />
ambitious British venture of its kind ever attempted anywhere.<br />
This is very gratifying.<br />
The objectives of the Exhibition, and its<br />
associated activities are to demonstrate and strengthen the<br />
close ties which exist between Australia and Britain, Those<br />
are indeed worthy objectives which I warmly commend9 I wish<br />
the Exhibition every success,<br />
CANBERRA, 23rd February, 1964. </p>
