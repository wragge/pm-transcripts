    <content><![CDATA[<p>Fire victims in Victoria's south-west are now eligible for extra financial assistance to help meet immediate recovery costs following a joint decision between Prime Minister John Howard and Premier Steve Bracks. </p>
<p>The Community Recovery Fund was established in December last year as part of a joint initiative between the Commonwealth and State governments in response to the severe impact of bushfires in Gippsland and the state's north-east. </p>
<p>It provides more than $700,000 to fire-affected regions on-top of support available through the Commonwealth Government's Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements and the significant recovery measures administered by the Bracks Government's Bushfire Ministerial Taskforce. </p>
<p>The fund supports a one-off Clean-up and Restoration Grant of up to $15,000 for primary producers, small business and charities to assist with clean-up and recovery not covered by insurance arrangements. </p>
