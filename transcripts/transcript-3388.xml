AUSTRALIA L PRESS STATEMENT NO.' 325<br />
12 September 1974<br />
REFERENCE TO INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE COMM\ ISSION<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, announced today<br />
that he had forwarded a reference to the Industries Assistance<br />
Commission on whether assistance should be accorded the<br />
production in Australia of soaps and other detergents and<br />
other related products.<br />
This reference has been forwarded to the Commission<br />
following the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Prices<br />
in its recent report on the Prices of Household Soaps and<br />
Detergents. The Committee recommended that as a further<br />
measure to increase competition the. question of the level<br />
of protection on household soaps and detergents be referred<br />
to the Industries Assistance Commission.<br />
The Committee stated that the insignificance of<br />
imports and the level of profits earned in this industry<br />
indicate that it is over-protected. It said that the removal<br />
of import duties may not have an immediate effect on competition<br />
in the domestic market because the major manufacturers are<br />
corporations who have manufacturing plants in countries<br />
such as New Zealand. However, the Committee considered that<br />
the removal of duties increases the potential for import<br />
competition from countries such as Japan and could have the<br />
effect of restraining price increases on the domestic market.<br />
The last comprehensive review of the level of<br />
protection for the soaps and other detergents industry was<br />
that by the Tariff Board in October 1963.<br />
