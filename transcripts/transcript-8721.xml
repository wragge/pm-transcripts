    <content><![CDATA[<p>I<br />ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />RECEPTION FOR THE PRIME MINISTER'S ELEVEN WELCOME TO<br />THE TEAMS, PARLIAMIENT HOUSE, 11 NOVEMBER 1992<br />Ladies and gentlemen.<br />Let me begin by saying that on behalf of the Government I<br />am delighted to welcome the West Indies and Australian<br />cricket teams to thiS reception in their hon'our.<br />in particular I am sure everyone here will want to join<br />me in welcoming the West Indies cricket team to<br />Australia. No doubt it is easier for me to say this than it is for<br />someone who has to play against them.<br />But Australian cricketers, being of the traditional mould<br />that enjoys a challenge, no doubt are looking forward to<br />the summer.<br />Because, lit ule as I know about the game, I know it has<br />to be said that playing the West Indies represents the<br />biggest challenge in modern cricket.<br />For sixty years they have produced legendary players.<br />in the last fifteen they have produced legendary teams<br />they have been consistently the world champions.<br />You might ask how someone who is not a renowned cricket<br />lover gets to know such things.<br />But how does a non-cricket person like myself get to know<br />about the West Indies?<br />I know because the West Indies are legendary you can't<br />help but know about them.<br />And you cdin't help but admire them. You can't be at the<br />top for so long without having something special about<br />you.</p>
<p>2<br />You can't come from behind like they did in Barbados to<br />beat South Africa without there being something special<br />about them.<br />All comparisons with the trend in national opinion polls<br />are, of course, totally invidious and out of order.<br />The thing about great sportsmen and women is that they<br />have something which goes beyond excellence and<br />commitment and belief in themselves they have spirit.<br />They lift the game to the realms of art. Ultimately<br />that's why everyone knows about the West Indies.<br />Great sportsmen and women can also lift a game to the<br />level of the contests Involved in life itself.<br />Contests between Australian and West Indies sides have<br />long been fierce and uncompromising.<br />I don't have any problem with that I have much the same<br />attitude to the Parliament.<br />It's where the game is won and lost, and if you're<br />serious about your profession and the country you're<br />playing for, you play seriously.<br />But you'll play better if you love the game.<br />If you take pleasure in it.<br />If you've got a sense of humour about it.<br />And I hope that we see these things this summer dead<br />serious but uplifting and inspiriting.<br />Now I haven't said anything about my side yet.<br />A lot of you probably don't think I had much to do with<br />the selection of it.<br />Not true. I insisted that _ Allan Border was in it.<br />I can tell you now that I said to the member of my staff<br />responsible for cricket is Allan Border in it, mate?<br />And he said -of course he's in it.<br />And I said -just as bloody well.<br />There's no need to thank me now, Allan. I wans't going to<br />let them leave you out<br />I said, if Allan's in it we're in with a show aren't<br />we? I said before that to stay at the top for a long time is<br />the mark of someone special.</p>
<p>3<br />There is really nothing more to be said about Allan<br />Border. I mean, like the West Indies, even I not only know who<br />Allan Border is, but I feel like I know something about<br />him. He is the definitive Australian cricketer of his ere,<br />which is to say that he's more than the best over the<br />period he's the cricketer who has done more than any<br />other to describe us to the world and to ourselves.<br />You can say about Allan that when he's in it we're 811<br />in It.<br />We're all out there with him, and the best thing about it<br />is, we're only speaking metaphorically.<br />Now I won't hold you up any longer.<br />I welcome both sides and wish them luck tomorrow and in<br />the coming series.<br />To the West Indies team I say I hope you enjoy your stay<br />in Australia. You know you are always very welcome.<br />To the Australian team I say good luck, you know you have<br />the nation behind you.<br />To both sides I hope it's a great contest played in<br />great spirit, and that tomorrow's match sets the pattern<br />for the whole series.<br />I'll be out there tomorrow to tos$ the coin and check the<br />weather and put the key in the pitch and all those other<br />things you have to do before a cricket match.<br />Good luck to all of you.<br />Thank you.</p>
