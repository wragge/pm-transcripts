PRESS CONFERENCE HELD IN ADELAIDE, 66/ 223<br />
AT NOON, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 1966<br />
WITH<br />
THE PRIME MINISTER, RT. HON. HAROLD HOLT, M. P.<br />
INTRODUCTION:<br />
P. M. One thing I think I should clear up is the use the Labor Party,<br />
including the Leader, is making of views allegedly expressed by the late<br />
President Kennedy. They represent such a travesty and such a mis-statement<br />
of his own position that I am not prepared to have this perpetrated<br />
indefinitely. To deal first, though, with the cost of the Labor programme, I<br />
must take you first back to the document which was put out by Mr. Calwell<br />
on Sunday, October 30. Most of you will recall it quite clearly, but I<br />
will give you just the opening references, which I think will establish the<br />
grounds on which my criticism is to be made. He heads the document,<br />
" How Labor Will Pay", and the opening heading is " Cost". " In my Policy<br />
Speech on November 10, I will be announcing the full outline of Labor's<br />
programme for the coming elections. It will contain proposals relating to<br />
the Means Test, Social Services, Health, and other matters. Each item<br />
[ presumably this includes ' other matters' 1 has been carefully costed.<br />
The total cost of our programme in the first full year of office will be<br />
0300m." That is the ground work on which we start.<br />
I did earlier, in commenting on this document, point out that<br />
however specious, it contained fallacies inherent in it. In the first<br />
place it talked about natural growth and revenue as something which could<br />
be relied upon to finance this sort of programme; it made no reference<br />
whatever to natural growth and expenditure. The Treasurer has since<br />
pointed out and it was my own experience as Treasurer that natural growth<br />
and expenditure tended to outrun natural growth and revenue. If you are<br />
going to rely upon natural growth and revenue, you cannot turn your back<br />
on what expenditure increases are likely to be. Some of these are in-built.<br />
There is the natural growth of our payments to the States. There is a<br />
natural growth in our payments to roads as population grows; there are<br />
increasing bills for social services. Population growth means more<br />
hospital payments medicine and the like. You find that there is a<br />
substantial growth based on existing policies. Unless you strike particularly<br />
buoyant years of revenue, it tends to out-strip the revenue, and<br />
this has been reflected in the increasing borrowings we have made up to<br />
this year when with the Loan market less likely to provide the loan moneys<br />
we needed, we have had to budget for a substantial deficit in the vicinity.<br />
of 6270m. That deficit has been calculated after we have taken into<br />
account the natural growth we could expect in the financial year 1966-67.<br />
In the first place, we have a firm statement by Mr. Calwell before the<br />
Policy Speech is introduced that it will contain various proposals. Each<br />
has been carefully costed, and the total cost will be 0300m. in the first<br />
full year of office.<br />
When you come to the Policy Speech, on page 3, under Social<br />
Services, a number of figures are given as estimates of the costs in a<br />
full year. There are one or two of these which I suggest should be<br />
further examined against what I shall put to you, but the first of these<br />
was to establish a universal scheme of national welfare. Without going<br />
through all the detail of it, he puts a figure of 6j73m. on that, and no-one<br />
can check that figure precisely, but for my current purposes I am accepting<br />
the figure which he gives.<br />
The second item referred to is to provide a medical entitlement<br />
card for all persons of pensionable age, irrespective of income, and we<br />
believe he has under-stated this one. Even if you were to assume that the<br />
doctors and hospitals would give the same concessional rates to people<br />
regardless of income, and that would be a bold assumption in the face of the<br />
known views of the medical profession, the cost would be about more<br />
than his estimate of 014m. In other words, the minimum figure we would put </p>
<p>0<br />
* I.<br />
,1 </p>
<p>2. 66/ 224<br />
on it would be 019m. I have the Minister of Health here, and he tells me<br />
that the realistic view to put on this is to be taken against the known<br />
background of the attitude of the medical profession. On the face of it,<br />
why should the medical profession give a concessional rate of treatment to<br />
a very wealthy man who just happens to have reached pensionable age.<br />
If we were to put a bill on that one, in the light of the current attitude<br />
of the profession, we would get a figure of 033m., and not $ 14m. or 419m.<br />
whiLch we would regard as the minimum. Mr. Calwell proposed to provide<br />
half pensions for all persons over 70, and gives a figure of 072m. for that.<br />
Liberalised deductions of permissible incomes by deducting only<br />
one dollar on every two dollars earned above the permissible income for<br />
full pension entitlement. He puts an estimated cost of $~ 20m. on this.<br />
Social Services feel this cannot be checked precisely until the experience<br />
of it is gained, but a very much higher figure is regarded as a more<br />
realistic one. Increased payments for child endowment for the second and subsequent<br />
children $ 52m., and we don't challenge that.<br />
Double existing maternity allowances. He gives a figure of 07m.<br />
which is accepted.<br />
0Double funeral benefits. He has erred in the wrong direction<br />
here. One wonders how it could have been arrived at. The cost he puts<br />
at ve2Im.. The total cost last year was kl. 49m.<br />
Increased grants under the Aged Persons Homes Act. Three<br />
dollars for each dollar raised. He estimated the cost at 4152m. Again an<br />
easy calculation could be made there, and it is difficult to see why he<br />
should have been in error by under-estimating this one by ; 2j or 6~ 3m.<br />
Estimated expenditure for 1966-67 for Aged Persons Homes is 9m on a two<br />
for one basis. But it is not in the social services area that the failure to<br />
calculate appears, because there he has set out each of the items, and<br />
while anyone can query some of them as I have just done, it is significant<br />
that he omits any costing figure against the other items except a few of<br />
those that have been specified, e. g. he talks about establishing a joint<br />
parliamentary committee to review repatriation and its administration,<br />
particularly now that the value of repatriation benefits has in each<br />
inst~ ance fallen to a very low level. " We will enable all World War I<br />
returned men to be treated under repatriation whether their disabilities<br />
were war caused or not. " 1 We have moved for this in Parliament several<br />
times, and Government members have voted against it. " We will give the<br />
benefit of the doubt to Servicemen when medical opinion differs as to the<br />
origin of the disability. Wie will also grant medical benefits to the<br />
wives of TPI pensioners."' Again, no reference to the cost.<br />
The best stab the Treasurer has been able to make on that is<br />
to 010m. When we come to education, there are two items to which he makes<br />
specific reference. 920m. a year to State education departments, and a<br />
payment of qp22m. a year to lay teachers in non-Government schools.<br />
He talks of the adoption of the Martin committee's proposals for Commonwealth<br />
assistance to teacher training, but does not itemise cost.<br />
If the whole cost were to be met by the Commonwealth, this would require<br />
a maxi~ mum amount of $~ 56m. If the States were willing to share the cost,<br />
this figure would be reduced to $ 27m.<br />
Free hospital services as part of its national health scheme.<br />
Labor will, in the next three years, re-establish free hospital services.<br />
He gives no figure, but the firm estimate on this is 0~ 90m.<br />
He mentioned one particular tax matter. Country industry and<br />
consumers to be free from the sales tax levied on the amount by which the<br />
cost of goods and products is increased by certain charges. 015m. there. </p>
<p>3 66/ 225<br />
War Service Homes allocation to be restored to 075m. There is<br />
another 17m. He also speaks of the loan limit being raised to 010,000,<br />
and the rationing scheme to be ended. Either he means this to be done<br />
inside the Y75m. in which case there would be fewer people who could<br />
benefit or else this is additional to the 075.<br />
Industrial matters. Equal pay. In the Commo nwealth Public<br />
Service he talks about equal pay. If female employees' pay was brought<br />
up to the males' in the same employment category, the estimated cost would<br />
be 05m a year. If it means eliminating the difference between male and<br />
female basic wage, with some necessary adjustment to marginal rates,<br />
the estimated cost to the Commonwealth Public Service would be about 014m.<br />
in a year. Large additions to the National wages bill could be expected<br />
to follow because once the Government gives-this kind of lead, the tribunal<br />
is not slow to apply this to other categories.<br />
If four weeks' annual leave were given to the Public Service,<br />
it would not be long before industry would be pressing for a change also.<br />
Employment of additional workers to provide replacements would be necessary.<br />
The cost would be about $ 13m.<br />
Another big item he hasn't mentioned except as a policy intention<br />
is that all the Federal Tax paid by road users is to be spent on roads.<br />
There is 6~ 75m. a year extra in that.<br />
One per cent of national income to be devoted to foreign aid.<br />
Taking the difference between what we now spend and a full one percent,<br />
there is an extra<br />
On the items which the Treasury felt it could estimate with a<br />
reasonable degree of certainty, they got a total of between % 00~ m and<br />
6675m. a year, but this was exclusive of the following items which are<br />
mentioned to you.<br />
The policy on defence which Mr. Calwell mentions both in relation<br />
to equipment made in Australia in comparatively small volume which would<br />
certainly be much more costly than getting it from countries that are making<br />
it in much greater amounts, the reliance on our own resources very largely<br />
both of manpower and equipment. No-one can seriously imagine that these<br />
policies would keep our treaty arrangements intact, nor could we place<br />
anything like the same reliance upon them in the future. I have not<br />
known him at any stage to say the defence vote should be reduced. On the<br />
contr-ary, he rather suggests it should be increased. There is no provision<br />
in his statement for any estimate of increased cost.<br />
Rural matters. When that $ 600-946? 5m calculation was made, the<br />
rural items had not been announced, and there are further costs involved<br />
there. War on poverty has been declared, but there has been no figure<br />
indicated as to what this will cost, not even in a general sense.<br />
This has been put in as a nil factor, just as in the case of clhld endowment<br />
payments to be capitalised for home purchase. If any number of people<br />
were to take advantage of this, it becomes immediately a budgetary burden.<br />
This leaves open the question as to whether this was the way child endowment<br />
was to be employed. The whole basis was to make that payment direct<br />
to the mother in aid of the maintenance of the child in her care. Whether<br />
a lump sum payment could be used for the purchase of a house is a matter<br />
which. I would argue.<br />
Education. Items listed for which he suggests no cost.<br />
Taxation. To ensure taxation is levied and deductions are<br />
allowed in a more equitable manner. Some of the salient items of taxation<br />
increase or relief are: a capital gains tax, from which they would hope<br />
to secure some revenue, although I notice Mr. Calwell last night said<br />
this would not apply to the little people. Just who the little people<br />
are when a capital gain is involved, remains to be clearly defined. </p>
<p>S<br />
i I(-</p>
<p>recalled66/ 226<br />
It will be realdby any Canberra regulars that one item which<br />
is always pressed by the Labor Party when taxation legislation is under<br />
discussion is the relief or deduct'ion for taxation purposes of the payment<br />
of fares. That was not specifically mentioned, but it has been every<br />
time they mentioned tax legislation over recent years. There would be a<br />
cost of 653m. involved if that were adopted.<br />
Economic development. " The Labor Government will under-write<br />
provision of adequate capital and will improve existing administration."<br />
There must be a cost involved there.<br />
Housing. Adequate grants to the States to build homes at the<br />
lowest possible interest rate. Subsidies for tenants or purchasers.<br />
The homes finance division of the Commonwealth Bank to provide finance to<br />
a limit of Ãµ 10,000. The raising of these limits, both in the case of War<br />
Service Homes and housing finance under the Homes Finance Division,<br />
proposed to be set up, would inevitably have an effect on all other<br />
government schemes where a limit applies. It applies to housing in<br />
Canberra and in the Northern Territory and other places, and there would<br />
be a general reaction from this which would add considerably to the cost.<br />
These are not items, although they are set out in the Policy Speech, and<br />
iere taken into account in the Treasury calculation. These were regarded<br />
as being incapable of precise costing, but if given effect to would<br />
undoubtedly involve very heavy additional costs.<br />
I repeat that the original document which set out to say that<br />
the total cost of the programme each item carefully costed and<br />
covering Means Test, Social Services, Health, and other matters would<br />
be 0300m. was quite misleading and indeed one might use a stronger word<br />
than that to describe it.<br />
Most of you will have seen the publication " Eight Famous<br />
People Challenge you to Think". You will also have noted the reference<br />
in Mr. Citlwell's Policy Speech to the view of the late President Kennedy<br />
on Vietnram. " Labor views on Vietnam are supported by opinions expressed<br />
by the late President Kennedy and by other distinguished Americans like<br />
his two brothers, Senators Robert and Edward Kennedy and by Senators Fullbright<br />
and Mansfield and 24 other outstanding Senators."<br />
"~ The President and his two brothers voted against the appropriation<br />
for policies to be carried out in Vietnam.' As I understand the<br />
position, they supported the present President on that issue as their<br />
brother in his term supported the general policy of President Eisenhower.<br />
Source references are a letter that the late President Kennedy despatched<br />
dated March 3 1963 to a Mrs. Prendergras who had lost a brother in Vietnam.<br />
" Eight Famous People Challenge you to Think" contains a picture<br />
of the late President and a quote attributed to him was not sympathetic<br />
to the policies which were being followed in Vietnam. ' There was no<br />
source reference and no date mentioned.<br />
In the letter mentioned above, President Kennedy said " Americans<br />
are in Vietnam because we have determined that this country must not fall<br />
under Communist domination. Shortly after the division in Vietnam eight<br />
years ago, it became evident that they could not successfully defend themselves<br />
without extensive assistance from other nationa of the free world.<br />
A book by Sorensen on the late President Kennedy is accepted<br />
without challenge as an authoritative work, conveying the late President's<br />
views. On 2.8.61 President Kennedy said: The United States is determined<br />
that the Republic of Vietnam shall not be lost to the Communists.<br />
President Johnson has said " We have learned that retreat does<br />
not bring safety, and weakness does not bring peace." </p>

QUESTION: P. M. Will you be making any statement on the South Australian<br />
application for a loan to build a natural gas pipeline from<br />
Gidgealpa to Adelaide?<br />
I am seeing the Premier this afternoon, and cannot say<br />
anything before then.<br />
You said money could not be given before the next government<br />
came in.<br />
I said constitutional practice was that after Parliament had<br />
been dissolved, governments did not take substantial decisions<br />
on new matters of policy until the electiois had been determined<br />
and the in-going government could look at it. I also<br />
said this would be among the first business to be looked at.<br />
It was not practical to deal with the matter just before the<br />
dissolution of the parliament, and also the attitude of the<br />
other States is involved.<br />
Would you comment on the formation of the Basic Industries<br />
Group? I read about it in the daily press. There has been no<br />
mention made of it to me. I have tried to make my own<br />
attitude to our coalition government abundantly clear by<br />
public statement. Last week in Goulburn, the only electorate<br />
so far where I have spoken where there have been both Liberal<br />
and Country Party candidates seeking that seat which is not<br />
held by either at the present time both candidates were on<br />
the platform with me, and I said to the meeting that it was my<br />
wish that the best man should win.<br />
Does the Liberal Party accept the help that this group is<br />
offering?<br />
So far as the Liberal Party is concerned, our policies and<br />
attitude are expressed in statements by our official candidates,<br />
by the public advertisements, radio and telecasts, and under<br />
the authority either of a named member of the Parliamentary<br />
Party or the candidate or a specified official of the Party.<br />
Do you regard this new bid by this group as aiding the<br />
Liberal Party?<br />
When there is not a clear alternative government offering in<br />
the eyes of a great many people.<br />
What consideration has the Commonwealth Government given to<br />
Adelaide's request for a Festival Hall?<br />
This is not just a Festival which services Adelaide, but<br />
has a standing throughout the Commonwealth. I would look<br />
on this matter not unhelpfully.<br />
The Catholic Bishops recently sent you a letter pointing out<br />
the needs of the Catholic Education System. Would you comment?<br />
I have replied to that letter, pointing out what this government<br />
and the previous one had done in this field.<br />
We have done a great deal. </p>

QESTION:<br />
P. M.<br />
QUESTION: P. M.<br />
0 Has the Commonwealth any interest in determining the State<br />
boundaries regarding natural gas, and has any State Premier<br />
asked you to intervene in this?<br />
This falls within the administration of the Minister for<br />
National Development. I recall no particular request.<br />
I did receive a visit from representatives of the oil and<br />
gas interests who fe~ t that the contemplated legislation<br />
was too restrictive and was unreasonable in their eyes.<br />
There have been meetings between the appropriate State<br />
Ministers and the Commonwealth Minister, and he feels good<br />
progress has been made from these.<br />
The Australian High Commissioner in England has criticised<br />
the migration authorities there. Have you any comment?<br />
The High Commissioner is much closer to the problem, and he<br />
is a man who knows his own mind and is accustomed to speak in<br />
a very responsible way. I take his comments as being<br />
valuable comments from the Australian point of view.<br />
I do not involve myself in action at this stage.<br />
