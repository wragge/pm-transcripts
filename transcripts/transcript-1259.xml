FOR PRESS P. M. No. 17/ 1966<br />
FURTHER DROUGHT RELIEF MEASURES<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt.<br />
Although there have been some beneficial rains in many<br />
parts of the country nver recent weeks, the position of people<br />
suffering from the arought is still acute in many areas and the<br />
States of New South Wales and Queensland are still finding it<br />
necessary to continue measures to relieve the situation of those<br />
primary producers who are still affected by this unfortunate<br />
position. The Commonwealth Government made it clear some time ago<br />
that the Premiers of the two States could take it that Commonwealth<br />
financial assistance would cover whatever deficit they might have<br />
in their budgets as a result of drought relief measures their<br />
Governments might take.<br />
Both States set up several months ago schemes of concessional<br />
loans of up to $ 6,000 for essential carry-on purposes for drought<br />
affected primary producers who are in necessitous circumstances<br />
and are unable to finance their essential carry-on requirements<br />
from their own resources or through ordinary commercial channels.<br />
These loans are being made at 3 per cent. interest per annum and<br />
advances are repayabie over a maximum period of 7 years with<br />
repayment of interest and principal deferred for the first two<br />
years. In addition the Slates instituted other schemes which<br />
included advances through the banks for fodder purchases, grants to<br />
local councils for special purposes associated with drough<br />
problems in particular areas, ocal unemployment relief work and<br />
rebate and subsidy schemes for the carriage of fodder and stock<br />
by road and rail.<br />
The Premier of Queensland wrote to me recently saying that<br />
in addition to these measures, his Government intended to<br />
introduce rail and road concessions to facilitate the return of<br />
stock from agistment areas and the re-stocking of properties<br />
which have suffered from the drought, and he asked whether these<br />
measures would fall within the scope of the Commonwealth's<br />
assistance to the State on account of the drnught.<br />
I informed the Premier that the cost to his Government of<br />
these measures will be accepted as drought relief expenditure Under<br />
the arrangements for the provision of Commonwealth financial<br />
assistance to Queensland. I also advised the Premier of New South<br />
Wales that the advice I had given to the Queensland Government.'<br />
would apply equally in the case of his State.<br />
The Premier of New South Wales also took up with me the<br />
question of whether advances made for fodder purchased by the<br />
dairying industry will be accepted by the Commonwealth as falling<br />
within fhe scope of its offer of assistance and I assured him<br />
that this would be the case.<br />
We are looking forward hopefully to good Autumn rains and<br />
if these cnme, it will be a very encouraging beginning to what<br />
could be a record wheat snwing and the rehabilitation of drought<br />
affected pastoral areas. In the meantime, the new measures aken<br />
by the States with the financial baking of the Cnmmonwealth<br />
Government should assist in bringing some relief.<br />
CANBERRA, 23rd February, 1966. </p>
