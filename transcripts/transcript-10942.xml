<p>To the Premier of Western Australia, Richard Court and Mrs Court,</p>
<p>   to Kevan Gosper, to Mr Lawrence, to Tan Le, to the many other distinguished</p>
<p>   guests, ladies and gentlemen. Could I first of all say what a great</p>
<p>   idea it is that the Australia Day Council now takes the announcement</p>
<p>   of the Australian of the Year around Australia. Previously it used</p>
<p>   to just about always be announced in Sydney or in Canberra. I think</p>
<p>   it's a marvellous innovation that it's now going all around</p>
<p>   Australia.</p>
<p>I think it's a tremendous opportunity for all of us as Australians</p>
<p>   on an occasion like this not only as I normally do when I come to</p>
<p>   such a presentation, and that is to stand in awe of the achievement</p>
<p>   and the contribution of men and women of Australia to so many endeavours</p>
<p>   and so many walks of life in our country, and when you think of</p>
<p>   the breadth of experience and the breadth of contribution and the</p>
<p>   sacrifice of individual self for the good of humanity that is represented</p>
<p>   by so many of the people who are nominated for this award, it does</p>
<p>   rather make you stand in awe of the contribution of individual men</p>
<p>   and women to the building and the betterment of our country.</p>
<p>But it's also an occasion to reflect upon values that are</p>
<p>   particularly important to all of us as Australians, those values</p>
<p>   of optimism, those values of tolerance, those values of perseverance</p>
<p>   and those values of mateship and when I look back over the last</p>
<p>   year, I am reminded of so many examples of the living out of those</p>
<p>   values by Australians, and although not remarking on it as the only</p>
<p>   example of course, we are reminded of the tremendously uplifting</p>
<p>   experience of all those volunteers in the various disasters, particularly</p>
<p>   but not only at Thredbo, but also in the bushfires, and it's</p>
<p>   a true demonstration of that great Australian spirit.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I have enormous pleasure in announcing that</p>
<p>   the Australian of the Year is Cathy Freeman.</p>
