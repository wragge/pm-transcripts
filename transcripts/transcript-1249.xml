PUBLIC MEETING AT MACKAY, QUEENSLAND<br />
DAWSON ELECTION CAMPAIGN 16th FEBRUARY, 1966<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
Mr. Chairman, Ministerial and Parliamentary Colleagues:<br />
Mr. Fordyce and Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
I am, as my colleagues have expressed themselves to be, very glad<br />
to be able to take a personal and active part here in this electorate of Dawson<br />
in the by-election which is being contested on behalf of the Government parties<br />
by a splendid candidate to whom you were listening a little earlier in the<br />
evening. In John Fordyce we have the kind of candidate who can speak the kind<br />
of language and represent the interests which Dawson traditionally has hoped to<br />
see served in the national Parliament of the nation. He doesn't come to you<br />
as a crusader with a fanatical gleam in his eye, thinking of one topic only and<br />
regardless of the rest in which you are concerned. He comes from a background<br />
of diversified interests in the great industries and the varied activities which<br />
constitute this rich and diversified electorate and I am quite certain any of you who<br />
have not previously heard him in action have seen him in the flesh and heard him<br />
tonight, will feel that in John Fordyce, carrying the banner of the Government<br />
parties you have a candidate who will serve this electorate well for many years<br />
to come. Now I come to you tonight, not for the first time in Mackay and<br />
certainly not as a stranger to Queensland, and I am not speaking of interest shown<br />
in this State in more recent years, but it is perhaps appropriate that my first<br />
visit to Queensland should have been made as a young member of the Federal<br />
Parliament just thirty years ago when at that time Australia not being then so<br />
conscious of the problems we face today and certainly with nothing of the economy<br />
we possess at this time, concentrated on what we would regard today as perhaps<br />
as not such large issues on which to wage a political controversy, but I can assure<br />
that at that time the hottest issue in my own electorate of Fawkner as I then<br />
represented was the price of sugar to the housewives of Victoria. And so I came to<br />
Queensland to see for myself whether the people I represented were being<br />
exploited in the fixed price being charged to us for sugar from this State, and. I<br />
was able to see as I travelled North through the rich sugar areas and into that<br />
beautiful country which constitutes in my own judgment the most picturesque<br />
and attractive part of Australia. I was able to see that here were an industrious<br />
people working in tropical conditions which in past years it had been said that<br />
people of European race could not successfully handle, and here was the most<br />
efficient sugar industry in the world being developed by my fellow Australians<br />
under conditions which the rest of Australia should applaud. And since then I<br />
think I can fairly claim to have been a good friend of the industry and a good<br />
friend of this State. I am glad to say that this judgment anyhow is that held by<br />
my old colleague, Sir Arthur Fadden whom you knew so well in this city and by the<br />
present Premier and former Treasurer of this State, Mr. Nicklin and Mr. Hiley. </p>
<p>So I come to you as a friend and in confidence that what I have been<br />
able to do in the past and express on behalf of this State its development<br />
potential and the place it occupies in the national scene will have demonstrated<br />
my own good faith in what I have to say to you in the course of my remarks here<br />
tonight. I have come tonight also as the political head of the nation and I say<br />
that very proudly, and at the same time conscious of the sort of responsibility<br />
it creates in the holder of that office. Mr. Whitlam, I see, was reported in the<br />
press today as having said that the leadership had been handed to me on a platter.<br />
Well I can understand the envy in his tone having regard to the current problems<br />
but really what he was saying was that having served my distinguished leader<br />
loyally and with devotion to the policies and principles we had worked out<br />
together for some ten years, when he saw fit to retire, my party paid me the<br />
honour of electing ine unanimously. Now perhaps if Mr. Whitlam had exercised<br />
the same degree of patience, it might have been handed to him on a platter too,<br />
but you can't have it both ways and he' s trying to get it rather quicker than I<br />
sought to do. But I am sure that there can be few countries in the world in which<br />
the democratic tradition has become so firmly entrenched and in which over<br />
sixteen or seventeen years of office we have been able to build up a much more friendly<br />
and co-operative community spirit than existed in the early years when I first<br />
came into Parliament, that as a result of these things there has been as smooth a<br />
transition of political authority as any country could hope to experience. Here<br />
we are going along steadily much as we have before but with a new Government<br />
feeling it to be its own responsibility to turn its attention to the policies of the<br />
day to see to what extent these should be varied in the national interest.<br />
I want to talk to you tonight not just as the electors of Dawson, not<br />
just pointing to domestic or parochial issues and seeking to persuade you to vote<br />
for our side of government because you have responded to some direct appeal<br />
which goes to your own immediate self-interest. I don't decry that as a means<br />
of campaigning or indeed as forming an important part in the campaign now<br />
undertaken but I do believe from what I have read of the speeches of my colleagues<br />
that they have covered those aspects very thoroughly indeed before I came to the<br />
election. And I would therefore prefer to speak to you tonight as a fellow Australian<br />
interested in the large national questions, not academic questions but questions<br />
which bear on your own security, your own prosperity, your own position as a<br />
citizen in a country growing in stature, growing in influence, growing in prosperity<br />
and strength, and these things are of tremendous importance to us all, and it is<br />
fair for us to put it to you that if you believe that we have had any substantial hand<br />
as a government through our experience, through our judgment, through our<br />
capacities in bringing Australia to this level of eminence which has attracted the<br />
admiration of other countries in the world, then it is fair for us to say to you when<br />
the time comes, " Support the candidates we present to you" so that this process<br />
can be strengthened and so that it can continue to your advantage and to the<br />
national advantage. Now this is what we put to you in the course of this by-election.<br />
We can't say to you, " Look contrast what we are doing with what the Labor Party<br />
has been doing" because we have to go so back into the past in order to point to<br />
what the Labor Party did in that day and time that to many of you, particularly a<br />
younger generation of voters, it seems somewhat unreal. And yet there it was<br />
the record stands cn the board and I would hope that at times when you feel critical<br />
of your own government of the day, you will not be unmindful that we are facing up<br />
to situations and problems which earlier governments found themselves incapable of<br />
dealing with adequately. </p>
<p>If I may mention just one matter which I know troubles those of you<br />
who rely upon stable prices for competitive capacity in the export markets of<br />
the world, and we are grappling with this problem year in and year out. Not<br />
an easy thing in an economy t-hat seeks to maintain full employment for its<br />
people through every State in the Commonwealth, to keep a stable price level.<br />
We have to contend in Australia with conditions of drought, other climatic factors.<br />
We have to contend with the fluctuations that occur so dramatically at times, ' as<br />
you learnt to your loss in respect of sugar in recent periods. We have-to contend<br />
with these things and at the same time try to maintain some stability of price<br />
levels. I don't imagine that the Labor Party found this easy. When we took over<br />
at the end of 1949, the price level was rising at the rate of 10 per cent. per annum,<br />
and here for most of the period of recent years, we have been able to maintain a<br />
comparatively stable price level and it is only in the last year or so that these<br />
pressures have reasserted themselves, coming though, now, we believe, firmly<br />
under control. So we would put it to you that here is a government in office for<br />
seventeen years, not made up of the same people because we haven't clung<br />
to office as individuals. There has been a steady movement out of the Ministry<br />
with fresh faces and fresh vigour coming to build up the strength of the Cabinet<br />
that is left behind, and in point of fact there are only two members of the present<br />
Cabinet who were there when we first took office at the end of 1949. Those are<br />
the Deputy Prime Minister and myself. All the rest are men and in Annabelle's<br />
case, a very disti-nguished woman who have come to us since we came back into<br />
office ir. 1949. But there we've been. We are, as I say, a reinvigorated team of<br />
Ministers, refreshed by new recruits from time to time, for seventeen years, and<br />
no-one in their senses, if they had a successful business conducting their affairs<br />
and showing substantial profits year by year would think of tipping the whole<br />
management out in order to put in its place, a completely untried set of executives<br />
who have had no active experience of running that business at all. There is not<br />
one member of the Labor Party who will have administered a Government Department<br />
at any time over the past seventeen years, not in the national field at any rate,<br />
so that this we think is a matter of some importance.<br />
Now, let us look at this next question, as it has been presented in-this<br />
electorate, of development, but I am going to ask you to look at it also in<br />
association with defence, because if there is any area of Australia which has more caui<br />
to wish to see a strong and balanced defence programme, it is the community that<br />
lives in the north of Au stralia which is conscious as we all should be of the fact<br />
that we have 100 millions of restless neighbours to our immediate north, we have<br />
700 million Chinese at present led by a government devoted to a philosophy of<br />
world domination, and exeiting its pressures around South East Asia today to such a<br />
degree that we have had to meet it as a physical threat of war in the South Viet Nam<br />
area, and we years ago spent many years in Malaysia, trying to clean up the<br />
Communist guerrilla activity there. Now for Australia this problem has to become one<br />
of balance. It would be plainly, however serious we might regard our necessity,<br />
it woul d plainly be of great detriment to us to attempt to devote too large a<br />
proportion of our resources in the defence field, Of course, there has to be a<br />
substantial proportion going there, and Å 400M. and more of defence expenditure<br />
a year is no trivial figure for a country of this population to undertake. But<br />
development itself is defence in the long term because it is out of the growth of the<br />
nation, the growth of its population, the growth of its industries, that we draw the<br />
future strength in terms of manpower and resources for our own security and the<br />
contribution we make in this area in alliance with powerful friends for the peace<br />
and stability of the area as a whole. It is worth recalling that the United States of<br />
America in 1776 that's a long time ago the Declaration of Independence, had four<br />
millions of people, four millions only, and that was only twelve years before<br />
Australia ha its first settlement. Now in that period, they have grown from four<br />
millions to 19 3 millions, while we have been struggling to get up to 11 millions,<br />
and the secret of their success was instead of involving themselves in footling<br />
arguments about overseas investment, they took the people, they took the capital<br />
and they built the most powerful nation in the world in an area the same size as that<br />
of Australia and with resources certainly apparently greater than ours, but who are we<br />
to know at this point of time just what the resources of this continent will prove to be. </p>
<p>We have discovered in recent years literally treasure hou. ses of<br />
resources for this continent, and they wouldn't be developed today at the rate<br />
they are or to the extent they are unless there was capital coming to us from<br />
overseas, joining in part with Australian capital for this purpose, bit I know<br />
there are people who cover this problem with all sorts of emotional overtones<br />
and lose a sense of perspective about it. They ask, " What's the Australian<br />
equity in this kind of enterprise?" Let me tell you something of the Australian<br />
equity. In every million pounds that is made or say dollars that is made of<br />
profit by an overseas investor in Australia, we take $ 425 000 from that million<br />
in direct company taxation. Now in practice, a company having paid its tax,<br />
ploughs back half of what's left into its own further development; in other words,<br />
more equipment, more job opportunities, more development for the nation. Now<br />
let us assume that there was $ 575,000 of this $ lM. left and that $ 275,000 of it<br />
went back into the business, leaving $ 300,000 for remittance overseas. Now even<br />
on the most favoured terms, other than in the United Kingdom itself, the overseas<br />
inve stor will have to pay a withholding tax of 15 per ce nt. So out of that $ l1M.<br />
of profit, we would have attracted to the Australian Treasury just cn half a million<br />
dollars, some $ 300,000 or thereabouts would have been ploughed back into the<br />
business, creating more job opportunities for our fellow Australians and the rest<br />
would have gone in remittance overseas. Now, with what comes into us as a<br />
result of this enterprise we finance the business of goverrnment, defence expenditure,<br />
the social welfare expenditure, the payments to State Governments, the advances<br />
for roads, the great variety of things which the Commonwealth Government these<br />
days has to undertake. So whatever views you may develop about overseas<br />
investment, don't let anybody convince you that we don't have an Australian equity<br />
in every successful overseas enterprise which flourishes in this country. Ninety<br />
per cent, of all the investment we make in Australia comes from our own Australian<br />
savings, but there are important areas in which new techniques, new enterprise,<br />
new development in areas remote which have not experienced that development<br />
before. All these things add to the national strength and it is largely because in<br />
recent years we have been securing an investment of great dimension from the<br />
United Kingdom, the United States, and now to a growing degree from Europe<br />
and other parts of the world, that we have been able to sustain a migration<br />
programme which is giving us a population growth rate of 2 per cent, or more a year.<br />
Now, in England, it is less than one per cent. In the: United States, it is 1.3 per<br />
cent. and this extra percentage of population growth means we have to build more<br />
houses, and on the same scale, America, if it had our population growth would<br />
have to build an additional half a million homes a year; the United Kingdom<br />
170, 000 homes a year, and this is an indication of the sort of weight which rests<br />
on our own economy as we seek to cope with the problem of growth and with this<br />
great problem of defence. Now again, it calls for considerable experience, a great<br />
deal of judgment to maintain these things in reasonable balance so that the economy<br />
can move steadily forward and not become too top heavy in any one particular<br />
direction. Now as to the offer which comes to you from Mr. Fordyce's opponent<br />
that he will carry for Dawson the Labor banner as your representative for the future<br />
and I say for the future because I don't think that there are people in this electorate<br />
who would be so mean-minded as to say, " Well, we are going to take a poke at<br />
the Government this time. It doesn't matter very much, They won't be put out of<br />
office. It willkeep them on their toes" knowing that for Dr. Patterson to be<br />
elected on this occasion and then rejected when we come to the general election<br />
later this year would for him, at any rate, be virtually the ruin of whatever prospects<br />
he might have under the rules which apply of re-engagement in the Commonwealth<br />
Public Service. And, therefore, I say, if you are to be fair to him, if you elect<br />
him this time, you should be doing so with the thought i n your mind that you are<br />
going on to elect him at the end of this year. </p>
<p>Now, will he be able, if elected not merely now, but to continue<br />
as your representative, to give Dawson what Dawson wants in the national<br />
Parliament? In the first place, what private policy will he be able to express<br />
We have see illustrated vividly for us over recent days that no Labor Member<br />
of Parliament can regard himself as free to vote and act the way his own<br />
judgment tells him to do, not even the way that the Caucus, after discussion by<br />
majority decision determines to do, and s3 what confidence can he have whatever<br />
policy he wants to put up, even if he can persuade his Caucus colleagues, will he<br />
finally secure the endorsement of those outside the Parliament who dictate policy<br />
for it. When in the last election, we talked about 36 " faceless" men, the Labor<br />
Pa.-ty rejected our charge and said it was totally unfair and untrue. Mw we are<br />
told that there aren't merely the " 36 faceless men"; Mr. Whitlam has descr~ bed<br />
his associates as the 12 witless men" of the Federal Executive. Where is Dr.<br />
Patterson to go with them?"<br />
Now in addition, Mr. Whitlam went on record yesterday and this he would<br />
not deny because he said it quite deliberately, as declaring that he wanted t o be<br />
the leader and I quote his actual words " of a radical and socialist Labor party'.<br />
Now that's fair enough. If you want to be the Leader of a " radical and socialist<br />
Labor party" then it is a very proper thing to say so. It is about time that we<br />
did learn from the Labor Party just what it was that it wanted to be, but do you as<br />
voters in Dawson want a candidate I gather that Dr. Patterson has already<br />
thrown in his lot with Mr. Whitlam ( I hope I state that correctly) but do you want a<br />
" radical and socialist party' to be speaking for Dawson and putting before the<br />
community policies which reflect that radical and socialist spirit. I think most<br />
Australians today want policies which give them the opportunity co take advantage<br />
of all that Australia offers and what country has wider opportunities, more abundant<br />
and varied opportunities for the free expression of choice than we have in Australia<br />
at this time. The Australian people had a taste of regimentation during the wpir years.<br />
They've never wanted it again and any party which would seek to reimpose it on the<br />
Australian community is doomed to electoral disaster. But in these brave words<br />
of Mr. Whitlam, one finds echoes of the regimentation of the past. With the full<br />
choice of every other word he wanted to use, he declared that the party he wanted<br />
to lead was to be a radical and socialist Labor Party.<br />
And so when I read aboutMr. Whitlam fighting the Left Wing of the Australian<br />
Labor Party, I wonder where the Right Wing has got to. If he's the Right Wing<br />
then I think back to the time when he said that ideologically he was closer to<br />
Dr. Cairns than to the Right Wing of his own party. So there must be a bit of<br />
jostling in the Left if he represents the Right and Dr. Cairns, Senator Cavanagh<br />
and Tommy Uren represenL the Left Wing of the party. Now Dawson doesn; t<br />
want that kind of electorate representative, I am quite certain. You have in John<br />
Fordyce a candidate mh-can express the kind of policies which Dawson wants<br />
to see espoused and w'io will stand for the kind of Australian way of life which has been<br />
built up over these seventeen years and which has commended itself to the<br />
Australian people at every election held since that time. True, you gave us a narrow<br />
squeak particularly here in Queensland in 1961, but I hope that we have demonstrated<br />
since then that we too can learn from experience and that the Australia of today<br />
which stands so high in the rest of the world will stand equally high in the eyes<br />
of the electors of Dawson when they come to the poll on the 26th.<br />
Now ladies and gentleman, there are a great many things one can say,<br />
but you have certainly given me a very warm welcome here tonight and it must be<br />
becoming considerably warm even for those of you who are accustomed to the<br />
climate of this very delightful part of the world. My good friend, Ian Wood I<br />
haven't been here, I think, for ten years and at that time we had quite a bit of<br />
difficulty on the waterfront as some of you will remember it almost as vividly as I<br />
do, but I don't feel I've been away from you very long because you've got the<br />
greatest travelling salesman for Mackay in the person of your Senate representative<br />
that any city in the Commonwealth can hope to possess. </p>
<p>And so, ladies and gentlemen, the choice should not be a<br />
difficult one for you. Here you have a country proceeding vigorously with its<br />
national growth under policies of free enterprise, still providing three out of<br />
every four jobs in Australia. I will close, perhaps, just on one reference which<br />
comes back into my mind as I mention this. I said earlier that I made my<br />
first visit back in 1936, and I can remember the excitement I felt about this<br />
wonderful part of Australia which I discovered for the first time, and the<br />
amazement I sensed at what seemed to be the wonderful opportunities, the<br />
potential of what could be the richest State in the Commonwealth of Australia.<br />
And I went back to Melbourne and talked to some of the men I knew in business<br />
a nd commerce there and I said, " Look, here's this terrific State with all its<br />
potential. Why aren't you putting more of your resources into investment In<br />
projects in Queensland? And the answer I got was, " Not on your life. This is the<br />
highest taxed State in the Commonwealth and if you make a success of the<br />
business you stand a very godd chance of . having it taken over by the Government"<br />
Now that was the period when governments took over all sorts of things including<br />
butcher shops to try to run them as a State enterprise. But you had then the<br />
highest rate of tax applying anywhere in the Commonwealth, and this was under<br />
Labor Administrations of those days, and when you wonder now why you don't<br />
have as many employment opportunities in Cue ensland as in some of the other<br />
States, you have to go back to a period when the investors of that time were<br />
discouraged by the circumstances they found in the State discouraged from coming<br />
here and building the job-giving enterprises which they turned to other States to<br />
carry oat. Now I believe that Queensland is launched on a new wave of expansion<br />
because it is creating again a climate of incentive, a climate of attraction before<br />
people who are prepared to risk their capital and their skills in a State which offers<br />
much to them, and that climate will continue to exist while those who put their<br />
risk of investment here feel that there is a favourable environment, a favourable<br />
political stability. We are getting investment from around the world today because<br />
of the political stability people perceive in this country and when they come to<br />
individual States inside Australia, they look to the State which seems to them to<br />
offer the most attractive climate and the greatest area of political stability.<br />
Now you are achieving that and I would hate to see a vote in Dawson<br />
which could'nt be a true expression of the long-term political sentiment of this area<br />
being given to a Labor candidate just to teach the qovernment a lesson and certainly<br />
n1ot see it when you have a fine young candidate who will, I am sure, serve<br />
this electorate with devotion and ability if you will only get behind him and<br />
give him your support. We ask you to do so. </p>
