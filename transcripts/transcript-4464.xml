The Prime Minister added some comments during his address to<br />
the Tasmanian State Council at Ulverstone yesterday. They<br />
come in the text as issued yesterday, at the end of the third<br />
paragraph. " The recent proposals to spend $ 800 million are another example<br />
of Labor's strange approach to public affairs. When they were<br />
in Government they ended the RED Scheme because it was costing<br />
up to $ 250 million for about 30,000 jobs. Two or three days<br />
ago, they announced proposals which they said would provide<br />
50,000 jobs for $ 800 million. Does anyone really believe that<br />
that makes sense?<br />
They say that they want interest rates to come down, yet they<br />
propose to increase the deficit to $ 3 billion. They think<br />
that spending more and more money alone can solve Australia's<br />
problems. If the deficit were to increase in that way, there would be<br />
no hope of getting interest rates down; there would be no hope<br />
of providing a release of funds to small businesses through a<br />
reduction in interest rates as soon as our economic circumstances<br />
will allow. The help that would come to businesses<br />
would be completely denied if the Labor prescription were put<br />
into practice.<br />
We know precisely what it would mean to increase the deficit and<br />
to print more money. We know precisely what it means more<br />
inflation, less productivity and reduced employment. It was<br />
the most unrealistic thing I have seen out of the Labor Party<br />
since they had their leadership elections.<br />
Nothing has changed as far as the Labor Party is concerned.<br />
They think that you can just go on spending dollars and that<br />
in itself will solve Australia's economic problems."<br />
