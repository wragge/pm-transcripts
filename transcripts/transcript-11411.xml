<p>E&amp;OE...................</p>
<p>Well thank you very much Paul. To Sue Napier, the Leader of the Tasmanian</p>
<p> Opposition and Parliamentary Liberal Party in Tasmania, my Lord Mayor,</p>
<p> my Cabinet and Parliamentary colleagues, and citizens of Hobart. Can</p>
<p> I say how grateful I am Lord Mayor that you've made this magnificent</p>
<p> and elegant old building available for our meeting.</p>
<p>I understand this is probably the first time in 20 years or more that</p>
<p> Federal Cabinet has met in Hobart, and we are doing so in furtherance</p>
<p> to the policy I adopted when becoming Prime Minister of making certain</p>
<p> that when Parliament was not sitting Cabinet met on a regular basis</p>
<p> outside the triangle of Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne. And as a consequence</p>
<p> over the last three-and-a-quarter years we've held meetings not only</p>
<p> in the State capitals but also in major regional centres such as Longreach</p>
<p> in Queensland, all around Australia to drive home the point that we</p>
<p> are in every sense of the word, a government for all sections of the</p>
<p> Australian people and to try and express some understanding and sensitivity</p>
<p> towards the particular challenges and the particular problem of different</p>
<p> parts of Australia. And it's on that basis that my colleagues and</p>
<p> I are delighted to be here today to have the opportunity of continuing</p>
<p> the normal pattern of our meeting, and also to respond to and deal</p>
<p> with a number of issues that I know are of particular concern to the</p>
<p> people of Tasmania.</p>
<p>But before I come to one of those which is salmon, and I do want to</p>
<p> deal with that issue, I want to say something generally about the</p>
<p> health and strength of our nation. Australia's economic position generally</p>
<p> speaking at present is stronger than it's been for more than 30 years.</p>
<p> We have the lowest levels of inflation, the lowest levels of interest</p>
<p> rates. We have in just over three years turned a deficit running annually</p>
<p> at more than $10 billion into a very healthy surplus.</p>
<p>Of all the economic statistics that I can quote with pride, there's</p>
<p> none that I'm prouder of than the one that says that of the 24 nations</p>
<p> of the OECD, that is of the 24 industrialised nations, Australia has</p>
<p> the lowest government debt to GDP ratio of any country in the OECD.</p>
<p> In other words government debt is less of a burden to the Australian</p>
<p> taxpayers than it is in any of the major industrialised countries.</p>
<p> Now that is a pretty important statistic because it means something</p>
<p> for the future.</p>
<p>It means that we are bequeathing to future generations of Australians</p>
<p> a society that will be free of net Commonwealth debt. And I can say</p>
<p> to you that if we were able to sell the remaining just over 50% of</p>
<p> Telstra, by the year 2002 this country would be completely free of</p>
<p> net debt at a Federal level. And when you bear in mind the level of</p>
<p> accumulated debt that existed when we came to office we think that</p>
<p> is a pretty significant achievement.</p>
<p>And I have found in the time that I've been Prime Minister and I've</p>
<p> travelled around different parts of the world, and I was recently</p>
<p> in Japan and the United States, that the attitudinal change towards</p>
<p> this country over the last three years has been quite marked. The</p>
<p> first visit I paid to the Asian Pacific region I felt as though Australia</p>
<p> was the anxious outsider seeking admission to the rich club of the</p>
<p> Asian Pacific region. And in three and a bit years that's changed.</p>
<p> We are now seen as a very strong performer. We are seen as having</p>
<p> achieved the remarkable feat of staring down the worst downturn the</p>
<p> Asian economies have seen since World War II. Our performance surpassed</p>
<p> that of many of our critics and it also surpassed, I have to say to</p>
<p> you, some of the best predictions that were available to us in government.</p>
<p> We in fact performed a lot better on that front than people expected,</p>
<p> and I think many of us expected.</p>
<p>But in mentioning those things I do say them with a deal of pride</p>
<p> and satisfaction but in no sense of smugness or complacency. It's</p>
<p> not just a question of good luck. You make your own luck in government</p>
<p> as you do in life, and we've worked very hard as a government and</p>
<p> as a community to bring about those changes.</p>
<p>And we haven't just focused on economic issues, and I know that today</p>
<p> brings together a lot of representatives of the major welfare organisations</p>
<p> of the city of Hobart. And one of the many things that I've endeavoured</p>
<p> to do over the last three years is to build what I describe as a social</p>
<p> coalition in Australia. I've endeavoured to use the best talents of</p>
<p> the government, the business community, the welfare organisations,</p>
<p> and the willingness and the resources of individual Australians to</p>
<p> tackle social problems in a cooperative way. I don't see great organisations</p>
<p> such as the Salvation Army and the Society of St Vincent de Paul merely</p>
<p> being the dispensers of charity and human compassion and understanding,</p>
<p> priceless though they are in performing that kind of role. I also</p>
<p> see them as valuable contributors to policy making within our community.</p>
<p>And it's no accident that I've had as head of a number of the major</p>
<p> welfare activities of this Government, the development of welfare</p>
<p> policy by this Government, representatives of organisations like that.</p>
<p> The chairman of my advisory council on drugs is a Major in the Salvation</p>
<p> Army. The chairman of the Youth Homelessness Task Force like wise</p>
<p> is an officer in the Salvation Army. And I've had many representatives</p>
<p> of organisations such as Anglicare and the Society of St Vincent de</p>
<p> Paul involved in an advisory policy role. We need as we seek answers</p>
<p> to these problems to work in a very cooperative spirit, to recognise</p>
<p> that you can't as a government do it all on your own. You can't as</p>
<p> a government ask welfare organisations to shoulder a greater financial</p>
<p> burden, and nothing that I say about the social coalition implies</p>
<p> that for a moment. You can't leave it all to individuals and you can't</p>
<p> leave it all to the business community. But if you can get each of</p>
<p> them involved according to their own particular capacities through</p>
<p> a social coalition you can build a very effective result and a very</p>
<p> very effective outcome.</p>
<p>And we've been able to achieve the economic goals that I outlined</p>
<p> three years ago, and we've been able to see Australia stare down this</p>
<p> Asian economic downturn without a abandoning the social security safety</p>
<p> net. All of the things that were said when we came to government,</p>
<p> about how we were going to abolish all sorts of social security benefits</p>
<p> have naturally of course not materialised. We are not a government</p>
<p> that ignores our social obligations. We're a government that believes</p>
<p> that it's always been the Australian way to provide a decent social</p>
<p> security safety net to those in our community who through no fault</p>
<p> of their own need some help and assistance from their fellow Australians.</p>
<p> That has always been the Australian way and it will always be the</p>
<p> Australian way under this Government. The only rider I would add to</p>
<p> that is that in accordance with the principle of mutual obligation</p>
<p> we believe very strongly that if people are provided with assistance,</p>
<p> if they are able to do so they should be asked to provide something</p>
<p> back to the community in return for that assistance. And that of course</p>
<p> underlines the principle of Work for the Dole.</p>
<p>And I'm very interested to see over the recent months the emergence</p>
<p> within the community, not necessarily from within the ranks of the</p>
<p> Government parties, but from other parties and from other groups in</p>
<p> the community, a recognition of the importance and the value of this</p>
<p> particular principle.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I know that many people are here today, and</p>
<p> a number of people in the State of Tasmania are concerned about the</p>
<p> decision of the independent body AQIS regarding the importation of</p>
<p> Salmon. Can I say that I've had some discussion with a number of you</p>
<p> as I've moved around the hall today. We discussed the issue at Cabinet</p>
<p> this morning and I've asked the new Minister for Agriculture, Warren</p>
<p> Truss who's with us today, and the new Minister for Trade, Mark Vaile,</p>
<p> who's also with us today, I've asked both of them to have a meeting</p>
<p> with representatives of the industry and others who are concerned</p>
<p> about this issue within the next week at a time of their convenience.</p>
<p> Because I believe that there are some aspects of the decision that</p>
<p> has been taken by AQIS which have been the cause of misunderstanding,</p>
<p> but equally I recognise that it is an issue where legitimately, strongly</p>
<p> held different points of view can exist.</p>
<p>I want to make a couple of, I hope, objective observations about the</p>
<p> background of this decision by AQIS and the context in which it should</p>
<p> be seen. The first point I should make to you is that each year Tasmania</p>
<p> alone exports nearly $500 million worth of agriculture and seafood</p>
<p> products. Now therefore it's a very important source of income and</p>
<p> sustenance to this island State. It is very important that whenever</p>
<p> we talk about the conditions under which something comes into Australia,</p>
<p> be it into Tasmania or any other part of our country, we must also</p>
<p> have in mind the circumstances under which our exports go into other</p>
<p> countries. It is never never real life in this country to look at</p>
<p> trade as a one-way traffic. There is always a reaction. For everything</p>
<p> we do there can be an opposite reaction in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>You've had examples in Tasmania recently of the value of opening up</p>
<p> new markets. I was in Japan recently and I heard with great pride</p>
<p> the officers of Austrade and other representatives of Australia telling</p>
<p> me about how Fuji apples from Tasmania for the first time this year</p>
<p> had obtained access into the Japanese markets. And in recent years</p>
<p> as a result of our trading efforts, and inviting the disciplines of</p>
<p> the World Trade Organisation, we have been able to not only get apples</p>
<p> into China, we've been able to get live cattle to China and Mexico,</p>
<p> we've been able to get pig meat to Taiwan and Singapore. And can I</p>
<p> say something more about pork? You may remember last year when Cabinet</p>
<p> met in Queensland there was a very noisy demonstration, not from people</p>
<p> involved in the fishing industry, but there was a very noisy demonstration</p>
<p> from people involved in the pork industry. And we were told that the</p>
<p> assistance and the response that we gave to that industry was woefully</p>
<p> inadequate. And we were told by people in that industry that what</p>
<p> we had to do was to stop imports of pork coming into Australia. But</p>
<p> we were also told by people at the same meeting that if we stopped</p>
<p> imports of pork coming into Australia then the Canadians would stop</p>
<p> imports of sugar and beef and other things going into Canada.</p>
<p>So we resisted those entreaties a year ago, or less than a year ago.</p>
<p> And we provided on [tape break] export capacity. And now you have</p>
<p> the remarkable situation of where that industry has been turned around</p>
<p> in less than a year, and that in fact some of the pork exporters from</p>
<p> this country can't fill their export orders. And I ran into a couple</p>
<p> of them, ironically enough at the sheepvention in Hamilton in Western</p>
<p> Victoria which is a great gathering of the people in the wool industry</p>
<p> of Australia, and two or three of these pork producers came up to</p>
<p> me and said - look, we can't fill our orders. It's terrific the way</p>
<p> the industry has turned around.</p>
<p>Now I tell you that little story to make the point that trade is by</p>
<p> definition and in reality a two way thing. I have only one objective,</p>
<p> and I said this to my colleagues this morning and I don't mind repeating</p>
<p> it, I have only one objective when I apply my mind to international</p>
<p> trading issues. Not [tape break] of convoluted economic theory, about</p>
<p> free trade or protection or this or that. I have only one criteria</p>
<p> and that is what is in the national economic benefit of Australia.</p>
<p> That is the only thing that will ever govern and instruct the decisions</p>
<p> that the Government I lead make on these issues.</p>
<p>It so happens that in my sincere view expanding world markets are</p>
<p> of benefit to Australia. And the reason they are of benefit to Australia</p>
<p> is that we are a small country and it's in our interests because we</p>
<p> have a small domestic market and flowing from the fact that we are</p>
<p> a small country we have to export to survive.</p>
<p>We learnt that from lamb. I mean, the American decision on lamb was</p>
<p> absolutely indefensible on trading grounds. The President didn't even</p>
<p> try and offer me a detailed economic justification of what the American</p>
<p> administration had done. They decided for domestic political reasons</p>
<p> that they could slam an import tariff on our lamb. And because they</p>
<p> are big enough and strong enough to get away with it and they're big</p>
<p> enough and strong enough to get away with it with every country in</p>
<p> the world not just Australia they went ahead and did it.</p>
<p>Now, that is the brutal reality of trading with the Americans. The</p>
<p> other side of it I should mention is that last year although we had</p>
<p> trouble with lamb we increased our exports to the United States by</p>
<p> 34 per cent. And I actually had a couple of beef producers at the</p>
<p> same sheepvention in Hamilton yesterday morning come up to me and</p>
<p> say: hey, don't complain too much about the lamb they might knock</p>
<p> off some of our beef. And I said, I don't think that is very likely</p>
<p> and that wouldn't be defensible.</p>
<p>But I simply make the point is that what we are doing in all of these</p>
<p> things, and it's relevant to the issue of salmon, and its the sort</p>
<p> of thing that my colleagues are going to talk to your people in your</p>
<p> industry about is that in the long run you have to ask yourself the</p>
<p> question what is the best way of handling these things that promotes</p>
<p> the overall benefit of Australia. And if we are seen by the rest of</p>
<p> the world as blocking things coming to this country without any valid</p>
<p> reason at all, if we are just doing it for a particular local industry</p>
<p> advantage they are entitled to do the same thing to us. And all the</p>
<p> complaints in the world are not going to stop them. They are not,</p>
<p> I promise you. You can have all the fancy theories under the sun but</p>
<p> if domestic political pressure is applied in markets that we sell</p>
<p> to now that block out Australian products. The Canadians demonstrated</p>
<p> it last year in relation to the debate over salmon. There was a retaliation</p>
<p> there, they would never admit it but it seemed to have a remarkable</p>
<p> coincidence in relation to our beef industry. And we have always got</p>
<p> to bear that in mind.</p>
<p>And in the long run it is not in the interests of Australia to have</p>
<p> a contracting market for agricultural products. And the reason for</p>
<p> that is that we are a very efficient agricultural nation. We have</p>
<p> a very efficient industry, not only agriculture but the seafood industry</p>
<p> as well. And it is in the long term interests of this country that</p>
<p> we open up markets. And we have had a lot more success than the critics</p>
<p> would suggest. 30 per cent of the imported beef into Japan now comes</p>
<p> from Australia. And I can go around the world, particularly in Asia,</p>
<p> and give you example after example in order to support the proposition</p>
<p> that I am putting.</p>
<p>And I make the point that we export four times as much agriculture</p>
<p> as we import. We export 80 per cent of our agricultural produce because</p>
<p> we don't have a big enough domestic market to consume it and unless</p>
<p> we export it, we just won't be able to get any return on the investment</p>
<p> and the sweat and the hard work of our farmers and of our producers.</p>
<p>So I mention those things, ladies and gentlemen, not to think for</p>
<p> a moment that they directly answer some of the concerns that people</p>
<p> in your industry have. But I do mention them because they are relevant</p>
<p> to the way in which a national Government has to behave in relation</p>
<p> to these issues.</p>
<p>Now, there has been a decision taken by an independent body. And that</p>
<p> decision that has been taken, according to all the advice I've received</p>
<p> and all the information I've read, will apply in relation to all fish</p>
<p> imports greater stringency than now applies in relation to them under</p>
<p> present arrangements. And I understand that the decision is being</p>
<p> seen by those who've taken it, by those who try and look at these</p>
<p> things independently, as having been based on proper scientific grounds.</p>
<p>Now, there are people who will disagree with me and the purpose of</p>
<p> my Ministers' meeting you is to listen to those points of view. I'm</p>
<p> not going to make any wild promises about what their responses will</p>
<p> be. That would not be fair of me. It would not be honest of me. Because</p>
<p> I think it's very difficult to ignore the findings of a body such</p>
<p> as this, particularly against the background that I've endeavoured</p>
<p> to outline because if we can put aside the finding of a so-called</p>
<p> independent body that is independent then other countries can do the</p>
<p> same thing. And in the long run, if we sell overseas four times more</p>
<p> than we import from overseas it's a matter of common sense that in</p>
<p> a tit-for-tat, blow-for-blow, retaliatory exercise we will suffer</p>
<p> four times as much punishment as the benefit we have from such an</p>
<p> exercise. Now that, in the end, is what world trade is all about.</p>
<p> Because don't think Australia is the only country that looks at the</p>
<p> impact of imports on its own domestic industry, other countries do</p>
<p> the same thing. If the balance were the other way around, if we were</p>
<p> a nation of 200 million people, it might be different.</p>
<p>Now, this is not an easy message to get across because people quite</p>
<p> understandably look at a situation as it affects our own community,</p>
<p> our own country and our own industry. I understand that and I'm very</p>
<p> sympathetic to that. But I've got to look at the aggregate outcome</p>
<p> for Australia. And the aggregate outcome for Australia is that if</p>
<p> we get into a trade war on agriculture and seafood we will get murdered.</p>
<p> That is the brutal reality of it. We will be punished far more severely</p>
<p> than we will gain from that. And we should understand that that is,</p>
<p> when you strip of it all the verbiage and all the fine talk about</p>
<p> this or that argument, on a tit-for-tat basis we will suffer far more</p>
<p> from a trade war and retaliatory trade action in relation to agriculture</p>
<p> and seafood than we will gain from it. Now, I know that's not a message</p>
<p> that some people want to hear but sometimes, in my situation, I've</p>
<p> got to try and outline it as best I can and as candidly as I can and</p>
<p> with all the good will in the world, and with a profound sympathy</p>
<p> for the particular challenges of industries in different parts of</p>
<p> Australia.</p>
<p>Now, there are some things that we can talk to you about and I would</p>
<p> like Mark and Warren to have a discussion with the representatives</p>
<p> of your industry and I know that that's going to take place at a time</p>
<p> of your convenience in the next week or so. And we'll approach those</p>
<p> discussions with a great feeling of good will and a great sense of</p>
<p> trying to come to terms with your particular problems.</p>
<p>Finally, ladies and gentlemen, can I say that one of the real delights</p>
<p> of being in government and one of the - because it is much better</p>
<p> than being in Opposition and those 13 barren years of being in Opposition</p>
<p> were pretty ordinary and we're very happy to be back - but one of</p>
<p> the real delights of being in government is the opportunity that is</p>
<p> afforded to us of moving around different parts of Australia, of talking</p>
<p> to people in their local communities rather than seeing government</p>
<p> as just sort of an endless procession of representatives of an organisation</p>
<p> or industry going to Canberra and sitting in a sterile office and</p>
<p> putting their point of view to a Minister or to a Parliamentary committee.</p>
<p> And it's very important that all of us practise what we preach when</p>
<p> it comes to going out and meeting people and reaching people. And</p>
<p> we've certainly endeavoured to do that.</p>
<p>And, very finally, may I join Eric in expressing to you, Jocelyn,</p>
<p> the profound affection and admiration of all of your Parliamentary</p>
<p> colleagues for the difficult days through which you've passed in recent</p>
<p> times, the very fond memories we all have of Kevin and also and most</p>
<p> particular the tremendous contribution you make as the senior Parliamentary</p>
<p> representative for the Government from the State of Tasmania. You</p>
<p> are a magnificent Minister and you're doing an absolutely first class</p>
<p> job for the Australian community as a member of the Federal Cabinet.</p>
<p> And I know all of your colleagues feel that way and would want me</p>
<p> to say that on their behalf.</p>
<p>And also to my other Senate colleagues from Tasmania, I'm sorry it's</p>
<p> only Senate colleagues at present, and I'm delighted to hear from</p>
<p> Eric that you're working hard on making certain - now I know this</p>
<p> is not a political gathering so I won't say any more - but you're</p>
<p> working hard to see that there is a greater sense of balance in the</p>
<p> representation from the House of Representatives here from the State</p>
<p> of Tasmania. And I look forward to the fruits of that hard work, Eric,</p>
<p> whenever it may manifest itself.</p>
<p>But, ladies and gentlemen, my colleagues and I are delighted to be</p>
<p> amongst you. We find these gatherings of enormous benefit and once</p>
<p> again to you, my Lord Mayor, our thanks for your gracious hospitality</p>
<p> in this lovely old building.</p>
