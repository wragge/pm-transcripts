    <content><![CDATA[<p>National Science Week is Australia’s annual celebration of science and technology.</p>
<p>This year, over 1,800 events are registered online with activities being held across Australia, with a focus on the crucial role that science plays in supporting Australia’s well-being, improving our health and boosting our prosperity.</p>
<p>Our scientists have been responsible for some of the greatest discoveries of the modern era, from penicillin and the bionic ear to the world's first artificial pacemaker.</p>
<p>Australian science has helped to improve the lives of millions of people, not just in Australia but across the globe.</p>
<p>Science week is about celebrating these achievements and inspiring Australia's next generation of scientists.</p>
<p>Science, technology and innovation are key drivers of the Government’s plan for a stronger economy. They help generate jobs and higher living standards for all Australians.</p>
<p>In 2017-18 the Government invested $10.3 billion in Australia’s research, science and technology capabilities, underscored by a $1.9 billion investment to update our National Research Infrastructure in this year’s budgets.</p>
<p>We encourage everyone to get involved in an event near them and to celebrate the cultural and economic benefits science provides to us all.</p>
<p>As part of the CSIRO’s STEM in Schools, around 100 scientists from organisations such as CSIRO, Bureau of Meteorology and Defence Science and Technology Group will visit more than 350 schools tomorrow to speak with students.</p>
<p>Approximately 75 per cent of the fastest growing occupations will require STEM skills, so we want to get students engaged and excited about these subjects.</p>
<p>A STEM education already opens many doors, and will continue to do so in future, so we want to inspire all students to take up and stick with STEM subjects.  Encouraging STEM education from an early age is a key focus of the week. We encourage people to participate in as many events as possible.</p>
<p>National Science Week 2018 runs from 11 to 19 August. More information is available at <a href="http://www.scienceweek.net.au">www.scienceweek.net.au</a></p>
