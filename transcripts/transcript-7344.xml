PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 28 JUNE 1988<br />
The Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Noboru Takeshita, will visit<br />
Australia 1-5 July at the invitation of the Australian<br />
Government. Mr Takeshita will be accompanied by his wife, several<br />
Parliamentarians and a party including senior Government<br />
officials. This will be Prime Minister Takeshita's first visit to Australia,<br />
although I have met him in Japan on three previous occasions,<br />
most recently in December last year, soon after his appointment<br />
as Prime Minister. I am delighted that Mr Takeshita is visiting<br />
Australia in our Bicentennial year and will have the opportunity<br />
to visit Expo 88 in Brisbane, see something of Sydney and have<br />
discussions with me in Canberra.<br />
We welcome Mr Takeshita as the leader of Australia's major<br />
trading partner and of a nation whose regional and global<br />
importance continues to expand.<br />
Mr Takeshita will also hold discussions with ministers who have<br />
portfolio interests in Australia-Japan relations and will meet<br />
the Governor-General and the Premiers of Queensland and New South<br />
wales. 750,11 </p>
