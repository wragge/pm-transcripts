FOR PRESS 4 July 1976<br />
MEDIBANK STRIKE<br />
The A. C. T. U. Executive action is grossly irresponsible<br />
and directly against the national interest.<br />
Mr Hawke's statement that the Government wants confrontation<br />
is nonsense. He knows it is nonsense.<br />
The facts are plain.<br />
The Government recently asked the Trade Union movement to<br />
make representations regarding the administration of Medibank.<br />
The Government listened to the Trade Union movement's views<br />
and gave them careful consideration.<br />
The Government came to the conclusion that the Medibank<br />
proposals, as recently modified, were fair and equitable,<br />
and would provide the best possible health care for<br />
ALL Australians.<br />
The Trade Union movement seems to have forgotten that<br />
the Government has made a major modification to Medibank<br />
to enable Medibank insurance to compete with private health<br />
funds. The Executive seems not to have taken that into<br />
account at all.<br />
The Government's reformed Medibank scheme will also impose<br />
no cost on the poorer people in the community. Under the<br />
Government proposals everyone has to be covered.<br />
It will also provide genuine health care choice and<br />
allow freedom in the medical profession.<br />
The Trade Union proposals, if adopted, would not have improved<br />
health care and health insurance for Australians.<br />
Under the A. C. T. U. proposal, those thousands of two-income<br />
Australian families would pay twice.<br />
The A. C. T. U. proposals would have done nothing for the low<br />
income earner and would have kept the dispute between the public<br />
hospitals and the-doctors alive. ./ 2 </p>
<p>Wages lost during a 24-hour Medibank strike would go<br />
a long way to meeting the cost of the Medibank levy for<br />
many Australian families.<br />
Wages lost from one day's strike alone would have paid two<br />
months Medibank levy for Australians earning around the<br />
national average wage.<br />
For those on the lowest incomes because they don't pay the<br />
Medibank levy, the wages lost from the strike could only be<br />
a net loss.<br />
In other words, Mr Hawke is telling thousands of Australians<br />
to throw money away.<br />
When Mr Hawke finds himself in a corner he says the<br />
Government'wants a confrontation.<br />
He of all people knows that this is not true. His colleagues<br />
in his own office and other trade union officials who recently<br />
attended discussions with the Government also know that this<br />
is not true.<br />
What Mr Hawke knows privately, but will not admit publicly,<br />
is that this Government has been far more willing to cooperate<br />
with the trade union movement than Labor ever was.<br />
We have demonstrated time and time again that we are prepared<br />
t6 listen to union views and to change our proposals where it<br />
is in the nation's interests.<br />
The real problem facing Mr Hawke is that he is not prepared<br />
to stand up to those trade union officials who want strike<br />
action for purely political reasons.<br />
Mr Hawke will have to realise that there is only one<br />
national Government in Australia. 0<br />
