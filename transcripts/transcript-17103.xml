    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today I announced the biggest changes to our health and hospital system since the introduction of Medicare.</p>
<p>These reforms will deliver better hospitals and better health across the nation. They will create a single national hospital and health care system which is more responsive to local health care needs.</p>
<p>Funded nationally, and run locally, the National Health and Hospitals Network will:</p>
<p>     * Create a single national network of hospitals, instead of eight separate systems</p>
<p>     * Be nationally funded, with the Australian Government shouldering the majority of the funding burden, which means more money will be available to meet rising health costs</p>
<p>     * Make sure local doctors and nurses with local expertise are making the important decisions for our local hospitals.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p>Kevin Rudd</p>
<p>Prime Minister</p>
