EMBARGO: CHECK AGAINST DELIVFRY BROADCAST: 3HA 23 May 1976<br />

ELECTORAL TALK<br />
Last week I spoke with you about the direct relationship<br />
between excessive wage demands and inflation.<br />
This week, following the Treasurer's statement on social<br />
and economic reforms announced in the Parliament, I want<br />
to expand on that theme.<br />
Excessive and constant wage increases have forced Australians<br />
into higher tax brackets.<br />
My Government<br />
has always believed that Australians pay too much tax.<br />
And we are equally certain that Australians have not been<br />
getting full value for the taxes they do pay.<br />
In both instances, we have already taken measures that will<br />
halt the injustice.<br />
First, the ' Government's personal tax indexation reforms<br />
will genuinly protect the real value of future wage increases.<br />
As the-Treasurer announced, income tax rate scales are fully<br />
indexed according to movements in the consumer price index.<br />
This will exclude the effect of indirect taxes in the C. P. I.<br />
This great taxation reform will benefit every Australian taxpayer.<br />
But perhaps the single most important feature of the reform,<br />
is that it is not a once and for all measure. It will<br />
continue to have significant beneficial effects in personal<br />
income tax payments from year to year.<br />
Any future tax increases will have to be legislated for.<br />
Governments will have to justify spending the tax money<br />
of individual Australians. As I have said, repeatedly,<br />
this measure will again force Governments to become honest again.<br />

<p>2.<br />
It has been made possible for the Government to introduce<br />
full personal income tax indexation -largely as<br />
reclommended by the Matthews Report -because the<br />
Government has acted responsibly in other areas of finance<br />
management. On Thursday, the Treasurer also announced a system of<br />
family allowance destined to stand the test of time as.<br />
ponrees eonf tetdh e tos inthgel e Amuossttr ailimapno rtcoamntm rusnoictyi. al reforms ever<br />
Clearly, the family allowance scheme is a product of this<br />
Government's desire to direc. assistance to those most in need.<br />
SimDlyput, the scheme involves a redistribution of Government<br />
assistance in favour of poor and disadvantaged families.<br />
The scheme will bring a very significant improvement to the<br />
* living, standards of 300,000 low income families and their<br />
800,000 children.<br />
Until now, assistance to families has consisted of<br />
child endowment and dependent rebates. Families too poor<br />
to earn a high enough income to be taxed' were completely<br />
&amp; lebarred from the benefits of dependents rebates a totally<br />
unjust situation.<br />
The great-improvement in the position of low income families<br />
shiould be particularly welcomed by the trade union movement.<br />
1t was only in September of last year, at the ACTU Congress,<br />
that tradie unior. g made this decision in relation to its<br />
wage policy: u'ntil such time as social security payments<br />
are provided which adequately compensate for the differences<br />
in cost of maintaining the dependents of a family-unit, the<br />
ACTU will continue actively to support the concept of a<br />
minimum wage based on a family unit."<br />
My Government has provided just that compensation.<br />
I am sure our intitiatives in both family allowances and<br />
tax indexation will, accordingly, receive the support of trade<br />
unionists. In summary, indexation of personal income tax and our family<br />
allowance reforms Drovide far reaching social and economic<br />
benefits to the Australian community.<br />
They provide a genuine opportunity to restore self esteem<br />
and personal dignity to thousands of Australian familiesparticualarly<br />
the migrants, the poor and the unider privileged.<br />
They also give-th2 nation a real chance at breaking the back<br />
of inflation as the measures will play a significant part<br />
in easing constantly excessive wage demands. </p>

"" he measures prove that we are not just a. Government<br />
of words. We are a Government of action.<br />
We are a Government which provides opportunity for<br />
Australians and shows concern for those in need.<br />
This week, the Government again demonstrated its<br />
sincerity in solving Australia's economic and social<br />
problems in another practical way.<br />
Following my address to the nation during which I<br />
asked if the trade union movement would be prepared<br />
to modify its attitude to wages, a three day conference<br />
with the trade union leadership has been arranged.<br />
This conference, the first of its kind for many years,<br />
will bring Government and trade union leaders together<br />
for talks that I expect will pave the way for greater<br />
joi-nt cooperation.<br />
The Government wants cooperation with the trade union<br />
movement, not confrontation. I believe the trade union<br />
leadership share that attitude.<br />
Already, the Government and the trade union movement have<br />
demonstrated that this cooperative attitude can work.<br />
The-Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Street, has<br />
announced that the Government will move ahead and introduce<br />
its secret ballot legislation for trade unions in this<br />
session.<br />
That legislation has been marked as essential legislation.<br />
As a result of discussions that have already taken place<br />
it is better legislation, while at the same time<br />
it preserves our objective of secret ballots.<br />
Furthermore, following suggestions put to the Government<br />
by the trade union movement, we will not proclaim the<br />
legislation until after the three day talks. We acted<br />
in a responsible arnd common sense manner.<br />
This one example is plain evidence of our desire to get<br />
on with the business of good government and to get the<br />
country back on its feet again.<br />
