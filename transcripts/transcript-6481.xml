    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>24 September 1984</strong></p>
<p>The Australian Archives today is releasing the recordsÂ of the Royal Commission on Espionage, related CabinetÂ material and contemporaneous Prime Minister's Department Â files.</p>
<p>The release is the first major release under theÂ Archives Act 1983, which this Government brought intoÂ effect.</p>
<p>All Australians will recognise the high value to beÂ placed on the preservation of the nation's heritage, andÂ acknowledge the service performed by Australian ArchivesÂ in maintaining and making publicly accessible so much ofÂ our written history.</p>
<p>The Royal Commission on Espionage and the events that itÂ inquired into hold a particular place in modernÂ Australian history and continue to evoke strongÂ feelings. I have no doubt that the release of theÂ records will be met with keen and scholarly interest.</p>
<p>The timing of today's release has been determined hy theÂ need for Australian Archives to respond by 30 SeptemberÂ to the first valid request received under the ArchivesÂ Act for access to the Royal Commission records.</p>
<p>The Archives Act provides that a Commonwealth record isÂ in the open access period if a period of 30 years hasÂ elapsed since the end of the year in which the recordÂ came into existence. Many of the key documents in theÂ Royal Commission records are in this category, but theÂ bulk-of the records would not normally be releasedÂ before 1 January 1985 and 1986.</p>
<p>Rather than release key open access documents inÂ isolation from the ensuing Royal Commission records, theÂ Government decided that for public interest reasons,Â there should be an accelerated release, as a singleÂ package, of the full Royal Commission records, andÂ certain other supporting documentation.</p>
<p>The Royal Commission on Espionage was established on 3Â May 1954 to inquire into and report upon the informationÂ given to the Commonwealth by Petrov ( a defector fromÂ the Soviet Embassy in Australia) as to the conduct ofÂ espionage and related activities in Australia andÂ matters related to or arising from that information.Â When Petrov defected he handed Australian authoritiesÂ certain documents. These became known as the MoscowÂ letters ( six letters described as having been sent inÂ 1952 from Moscow to Petrov and lettered A-F by the RoyalÂ Commission) the G-series of documents ( a miscellany ofÂ documents written in Russian and numbered G1 to G18 byÂ the Royal Commission) and two English languageÂ documents identified by the Royal Commission asÂ documents 'H' and "J'.</p>
<p>The Royal Commission, over a period of ten months fromÂ May ' 1954 to March 1955, sat on 126 days, examined 119Â witnesses, entered over 500 exhibits and published Â almost 3000 pages of transcript of evidence. DuringÂ that period the Commission's Secretariat created aroundÂ 300 files largely concerned with administrative mattersÂ but also containing transcript of evidence taken inÂ camera, some of which was not published by the RoyalÂ Commission.</p>
<p>An interim report was presented by the Royal CommissionÂ in October 1954 and a final report of the findings ofÂ the Royal Commission was published in August 1955. BothÂ reports were tabled and debated in the Parliament. InÂ addition, a classified annexure to the final report wasÂ presented to the Government of the day but has remainedÂ unpublished.</p>
<p>All this material comprises the records of the RoyalÂ Commission on Espionage which -were transferred to theÂ custody of the Prime Minister's Department at theÂ conclusion of the Commission. They have been in theÂ custody of the Department since then, except for theÂ period September 1975 to May 1977 when the records wereÂ provided to the Royal Commission on Intelligence andÂ Security.</p>
<p>Access to the records has been strictly controlled sinceÂ 1955. On the basis of indexes accompanying them whenÂ they were transferred to the Depairtment, of cataloguingÂ and indexing by an archivist since 1977 and of recentÂ evaluation of the records by Australian Archives, I amÂ advised that a complete set is held of the individualÂ documents that together comprise the records of theÂ Royal Commission on Espionage.Â </p>
<p>Accelerated access is also to be given to closelyÂ related Cabinet material and contemporaneous PrimeÂ Minister's Department files. The GovernmentÂ acknowledges the ready co-operation o1: the Leader of theÂ opposition in agreeing to the accelerated release ofÂ 1954, 1955, and 1956 Cabinet material.</p>
<p>Extensive consultation has preceded the release of theseÂ records. Wherever necessary, material has been referredÂ to appropriate departments and agencies forÂ consideration and advice; and all foreign governmentsÂ affected by the release have been consulted.</p>
<p>At the end of this process, the Government hasÂ determined that only minor exemptions, on securityÂ grounds alone, should be made from the released package.Â Nothing that affects the integrity of the RoyalÂ Commission's records has been deleted; and nothing hasÂ been exempted fromr the documents handed over by Petrov.</p>
<p>The exemptions made which affect neither the substanceÂ nor the continuity of the records relate to:</p>
<ul><li>ASIOÂ file numbers;</li>
<li>names of ASI)Â officers where these names wereÂ not published by the Royal Commission onÂ Espionage or have not subsequently becomeÂ publicly known;</li>
<li>material in exhibits 300 and 301 which wouldÂ allow identifLication of ASIOÂ officers' names;</li>
<li>references in a few documents to a particularÂ ASIOÂ overseas post;</li>
<li>a few references to UK security serviceÂ officers; and</li>
<li>certain technical details concerning ciphersÂ which were provided by Petrov and entered inÂ exhibit 510.</li>
</ul><p>Considerable thought was given to whether materialÂ should be deleted from the records because its releaseÂ would involve the unreasonable disclosure of informationÂ relating to personal affairs. Documents and inÂ particular were closely studied.Â </p>
<p>Document 'H' contains pen-portraits most of them notÂ very flattering Â - ofÂ 45 journalists. The RoyalÂ Commission found that it was prepared by a then memberÂ of the Parliamentary Press Gallery, passed to a Russian,Â and then on to Moscow.</p>
<p>The Royal. Commission on Espionage report describesÂ document ' J'Â in the f'ollowing way. " Amongst many otherÂ matters, the document contains personality reports on aÂ great number of persons politicians of every colour,Â newspaper proprietors and journalists, business-men,Â etc. Many of the reports are scurrilous and grosslyÂ defamatory ( some of the allegations are of a filthyÂ nature)". Counsel assisting the Royal CommissionÂ alliteratively described the document as a " farrago ofÂ fact, falsity and filth"; and while that description mayÂ have depended on the community standards thenÂ prevailing, document IJ' nonetheless remains, in myÂ view, a very shabby document. And document ' H' is notÂ far behind it.</p>
<p>In these two documents, there are about: 250 individualsÂ mentioned. In considering whether the personal affairsÂ exemption, allowed for in the Archives Act, should beÂ applied, we had to ensure parity of treatmnnt for all.Â In other words, if there were to be any deletions onÂ this ground, there would have to be many and substantialÂ deletions. But to make eithar substantial or totalÂ exemptions for documents which were central to the RoyalÂ Commission, and which have a corresponding historicalÂ significance, would not in my judgement. have beenÂ tenable. The final decision was to release them withoutÂ exemptions, with consequential release of relatedÂ references elsewhere in the records. Release byÂ Archives does not authorise publication of the records,Â and in respect of this material media representativesÂ should have in mind that the ordinary laws protectingÂ individuals continue to apply.</p>
<p>As I have stressed, this decision rests on theÂ historical significance of the documents and on theÂ difficulty of exempting only parts of them. Release is.Â not designed to embarrass or disadvantage any individualÂ or section of the commnunity or political party. NoÂ precedent for future access decisions of the AustralianÂ Archives is being created, for it: is probable that someÂ of these references, if they had occurred in isolationÂ or in less consequential documents, would indeed haveÂ been exempted.</p>
