    <content><![CDATA[<p>
  <strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>  Good afternoon. I'm here with the  Minister for Justice, the Minister Assisting me on Counter-Terrorism, Michael  Keenan, and Andrew Colvin, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. </p>
<p>
  This morning, the Australian Federal  Police arrested a 42-year-old man in the New South Wales town of Young, in  relation to terrorism offences. This operation does not relate to any planned  terrorist attack in Australia. </p>
<p>
  Police will allege that the man  arrested has sought to advise ISIL on how to develop high-tech weapons  capability. This highlights that terrorism, support for terrorist groups, and  Islamist extremism is not limited to our major cities.</p>
<p>
  We've seen Australians arrested for  preparations to carry out terrorist acts, or providing financial assistance to  terror groups. We've seen Australians travel to the conflict zone to take up  arms for ISIL, become suicide bombers, and cannon fodder. We've seen  professionals, such as doctors, join the terrorist organisation. </p>
<p>
  Here, the police will allege that  this individual, in a regional centre, acted with intent to provide ISIL with  the capability, with the technical capability, and high-tech capability to  detect and develop missiles.</p>
<p>
  It once again shows that we all need  to be very vigilant. This is yet another example of the excellent work the men  and women of the Australian Federal Police and all our security agencies are  doing in identifying and disrupting alleged assistance to ISIL.</p>
<p>
  Now I'm advised, and the Minister  and the Commissioner will speak about this in a moment, that the evidence  uncovered to date does not involve immediate domestic attack planning. </p>
<p>
  But it is yet another reminder of  the enduring threat we face from Islamist terrorism. ISIL is being rolled back  in Iraq and Syria and the men and women of the Australian Defence Force are  playing a very substantial role in the defeat of ISIL in the field and the  destruction of their so-called caliphate. We should always be very proud of  their efforts, and grateful for what they do, putting themselves in harm's way,  in our nation's defence and standing up for our values.</p>
<p>
  However, as I've said before, in the  short-term, ISIL's weakness in the field could result in the terrorist group  attempting to carry out more attacks across the world, in an attempt to  maintain support. </p>
<p>
  As you know, the terrorism threat  level in Australia was elevated to ‘probable’ in September 2014 and it remains  at that level today. Since that time, we've seen four terrorist attacks in  Australia, 12 successfully disrupted terrorist attacks, major disruption  operations. 61 people have been charged as a result of 26 counter-terrorism  operations around Australia. </p>
<p>
  It seems almost daily that we see  around the world the global threat of terrorism, with recent attacks and  attempted attacks in Pakistan, Indonesia, Germany, Israel, Turkey, Jordan,  Egypt and elsewhere.</p>
<p>
  That is why my Government's top  priority is to keep Australians safe and to ensure our agencies have the powers  that they need to do so. </p>
<p>
  Islamist terrorism is a global  challenge that threatens us all. But we must not be cowed by the terrorists. </p>
<p>
  They want to divide us. They want us  to turn on each other. We will not let them succeed. </p>
<p>
  As always, the support and the  cooperation of Australian Muslim communities, the vast majority of whom are  law-abiding, patriotic Australians, is absolutely vital in our common struggle  against extremism and terrorism. </p>
<p>
  We will continue to defy these  terrorists. We will continue to go about our lives, as we always have, and  ensure Australia remains the most successful multicultural nation in the world.</p>
<p>
  Our security and police agencies  have again done their job. Their great work, continuing work, of investigation  and disruption, and we thank them, Commissioner, and all of your team in the  Australian Federal Police, the state and territory police forces, and our  security and intelligence agencies, working 24/7 to keep us safe.</p>
<p>
  We were able to bring this people to  justice using the counter-terrorism laws that have been strengthened by the  Coalition.</p>
<p>
  The Minister for Justice will speak  about that in some detail in a moment. </p>
<p>
  But let me finish by saying, just as  we should defy the terrorists by going about our lives in the normal way, we  should also be alert. If we see or hear something that is of concern, that  could be relevant to national security, call the national security hotline:  1800 123 400. Speak up. Let our security agencies, let our police agencies,  know. </p>
<p>
  We rely on good intelligence from  the community to enable those who work night and day to keep us safe to be  informed, to be able to do their job. </p>
<p>
  I will now ask the Minister to speak  about the way in which the Coalition has recognised the evolving terrorism  environment and strengthened our laws, so that our agencies can always be up to  date with modern laws, 21st century laws, that enable them to deal and defeat  these threats to our security. Minister.</p>
<p>
  <strong>MINISTER FOR JUSTICE:</strong></p>
<p>  Well, thank you, Prime Minister. Can  I join with you in commending the Australian Federal Police, today acting in  conjunction with New South Wales Police, for their swift action, which has,  again, kept the Australian community safe. Now, the arrest today is the  result of an 18-month-long operation. It reminds us that whether you are in a  capital city, planning an attack on home soil, or whether you are in a small  country town, trying to assist the terrorist state in the Middle East, you will  get caught. </p>
<p>
  We are  protected by the greatest law enforcement agencies and intelligence community  in the world. As a Government, over the past two and a half years, we have  acted hand-in-glove with them to give them what is required to protect us from  a resurgence of Islamic terrorism. </p>
<p>
  In the past two  years, we've provided the Australian Federal Police and other security agencies  with a record $1.3 billion worth of extra investment. We've also introduced  eight packages of counter-terrorism legislation, the most significant national  security reform in a generation, changes that specifically address the changed  operating environment that has resulted from the rise of ISIL in Syria and  Iraq. </p>
<p>
  These laws give  our agencies unprecedented power to prevent terrorist attacks. We've modernised  their ability to collect intelligence. We've stopped extremists, or we've made  it illegal for extremists to go and train and fight in overseas conflicts.  We've introduced a 10-year jail term for people going into declared areas  controlled by terrorists, in Iraq and Syria. We've strengthened the control  order regime which allows us to monitor and limit where suspects can go and who  they associate with. We've reduced the arrest threshold and this is very  important, because we've used it to stop domestic terror attacks. We reduced  the arrest threshold so our police can take action earlier. We've enabled the  police to access metadata for a period of two years, which is a vital  investigatory tool that they use. We've made it possible to cancel the  citizenship of convicted terrorists to exclude them from the country and most  recently we've introduced a regime of post-sentence detention, so for convicted  terrorists who still present a danger to the community, they will remain in  prison. </p>
<p>
  Now we can't  provide 100 per cent blanket coverage against terrorist attacks. But the  efforts here in Australia are a model for what a country should do to protect  its citizens in what is a deteriorating national security environment globally. </p>
<p>
  Now the charges  in this case, which are expected to be laid are serious foreign incursion  offences and because of the new tougher penalties we have, these charges will  now attract a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. </p>
<p>
  We will  continue to work hand-in-glove with the Australian Federal Police and with our  other security agencies, to give them what they require to deal with this  security threat in what remains a very difficult security environment for  Australia and a very difficult security environment globally. </p>
<p>
  I'm now going  to ask the Commissioner to give you a few more details about today's operation.</p>
<p>
  <strong>COMMISSIONER  OF THE AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE:</strong></p>
<p>  Thanks very  much, Prime Minister, thank you Ministers, good afternoon all. I'm joined, as  well, by Assistant Commissioner Ian McCartney. Ian is the Assistant  Commissioner in charge of counter-terrorism for the AFP.</p>
<p>
  As you’ve  heard, Operation Marksburg is an 18-month long investigation that we've done  out of our Canberra based counter-terrorism team and we've conducted it in  consultation and cooperation with New South Wales Police. Today it went to  partial resolution and we want to advise the public of those outcomes.</p>
<p>
  Following  search warrants at a residence in the New South Wales town of Young, we have  arrested and will charge a 42-year-old man. He will be charged with a number of  offences, which include two serious foreign incursion offences under the  Commonwealth Criminal Code which carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.  With these offences, we will allege he has utilised the internet to perform  services for ISIL, activities in the Syria and Iraq conflict, from Australia in  the following ways. </p>
<p>
  Firstly, by  researching and designing a laser warning device to help warn against incoming  guided munitions used by coalition forces in Syria and Iraq. Secondly, we will  also allege that he has been researching, designing and modelling systems to  assist ISIL's efforts to develop their own long-range guided missile  capabilities. </p>
<p>
  Now, there's a  couple of important messages that I just want to leave you with. It's extremely  concerning, of course, and disturbing for police that we're continuing to see  Australians seeking out and providing support to these violent extremist  groups. The charges we will lay today against this man are serious. However, as  you've already heard from the Prime Minister and the Minister, it's important  to note that we are not alleging that this man was involved in any domestic  attack planning here in Australia. </p>
<p>
  Unfortunately,  this arrest today highlights the global nature of terrorism and the importance  of community vigilance. We rely very heavily on the community to report any  information to authorities, to police, to our security agencies, so that we can  continue to break these networks apart. </p>
<p>
  Action today is  the result of very smart policing and good detective work over a long period of  time. I would like to thank the investigators involved in the work. They worked  very long hours to bring this matter to a resolution.  While the man will  today be charged for some very serious offences, the matter is still ongoing,  but I want to reassure the Australian public that all Australian police and our  security and our partners, work very hard to look after their safety.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  The very fact  that we are in the Blue Room, we have the Prime Minister here, we have the  Justice Minister and the AFP Commissioner. We trust that you are taking this  very seriously, but can you tell us about this man? Whether he had the ability  or expertise to indeed help ISIL overseas or whether he was just some sort of  misguided amateur? Did he work for a government agency at any point?</p>
<p>
  <strong>COMMISSIONER  OF THE AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE:</strong></p>
<p>  PM, I'll take  that. Firstly, no, we don't believe he has ever worked for a government agency.  The man is technically trained I believe, as an electrician. In terms of the  first part of your question, we will be alleging that the material that he was  intending to provide to ISIL, the research that he was doing, was credible.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  How  sophisticated was it? How advanced in the planning? You say the investigation  has been going on for 18 months and was there a tip-off from the public? Is  that how you got onto him?</p>
<p>
  <strong>COMMISSIONER  OF THE AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE:</strong></p>
<p>  Look it’s a  part of a much broader investigation so no, this was not a tip-off from the  public. In terms of the advice that he has been providing, we will allege it  was fairly sophisticated and well-planned, yes.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST: </strong></p>
<p>  Commissioner,  is the man a dual citizen, or is he Australian born or is he middle eastern  born?</p>
<p>
  <strong>COMMISSIONER  OF THE AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE:</strong></p>
<p>  Australian  born. Australian citizen.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  When and where  will he appear in court?</p>
<p>
  <strong>COMMISSIONER  OF THE AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE:</strong></p>
<p>  We expect he  will appear some time later today in Young local court.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  How do you  believe that the terror network in ISIL first made contact with him? Did he  reach out to them? Or, what was the nature of the communication? </p>
<p>
  <strong>COMMISSIONER  OF THE AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE:</strong></p>
<p>  Look, I want to  be a little bit careful. This is an ongoing matter and we believe he has  networks and contacts in ISIL - not necessarily just in the conflict zones but  in other parts of the world as well and he has been relying on them to pass  this information on.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  Are the people he is communicating  with who are in ISIL, were they Australians? Are they believed to be  Australians or hold dual citizenship?</p>
<p>
  <strong>COMMISSIONER OF THE AUSTRALIAN  FEDERAL POLICE:</strong></p>
<p>  No.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  Was he working as an electrician in  Young and did he have direct experience in laser technology or in missile  technology?</p>
<p>
  <strong>COMMISSIONER OF THE AUSTRALIAN  FEDERAL POLICE:</strong></p>
<p>  He worked as an electrician and no  direct experience to my knowledge.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST: </strong></p>
<p>  Commissioner, AFP officers at the  site have been seen using metal detecting devices, wandering around the  property, what exactly are they trying to look for on the property?</p>
<p>
  <strong>COMMISSIONER OF THE AUSTRALIAN  FEDERAL POLICE:</strong></p>
<p>  As you’d appreciate this is a fairly  technical offence and this gentleman is quite technically-minded so we will be  doing a complete, thorough, forensic examination of that whole property. It  could take hours, if not days, and we will leave no stone unturned in what  we're looking for.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  Commissioner, did you find any  weapons or missile parts or model missiles, model weapons, anything of that  sort. Did you seize anything? </p>
<p>
  <strong>COMMISSIONER OF THE AUSTRALIAN  FEDERAL POLICE:</strong></p>
<p>  The search warrant is still  underway. At this point, no, but I'm not going to go further into what we have  and what we haven't found.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  Are you aware as to whether he has  done any physical testing of these models that you talked about before?</p>
<p>
  <strong>COMMISSIONER OF THE AUSTRALIAN  FEDERAL POLICE:</strong></p>
<p>  That’s all going to be subject to  the investigation, and the material that we'll ultimately put before the court.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST: </strong></p>
<p>  Have you got video footage of him  doing any of this?</p>
<p>
  <strong>COMMISSIONER OF THE AUSTRALIAN  FEDERAL POLICE:</strong></p>
<p>  No I’m not going to comment on that.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  Prime Minister, you made some  emphasis of the laws that the Government has changed  - eight tranches of anti-terrorism laws. Can you just expand a bit on  what laws were relied on here, that the Coalition has done, which enabled this  arrest to occur?</p>
<p>
  <strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>  I'll ask the Minister to speak to  that.</p>
<p>
  <strong>MINISTER FOR JUSTICE: </strong></p>
<p>  Well, Mark in this case, they’re  very serious foreign incursions offences and we've changed the maximum penalty  for that from 10 years, to now life imprisonment. A lot of what I was referring  to has helped Australia be safe in what has been a very difficult environment.  Twelve domestic terrorist attacks have been thwarted over the past two and a  half years. That is in large part as a result of the fact that we've worked  with our agencies to listen to what they need, to deal with the way this threat  has evolved. </p>
<p>
  Terrorism today is different than it  was in 2013 and we needed to completely modernise the system, which will allow  our agencies to police it in this new way. That's what we've done.</p>
<p>
  <strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>  If I could just add to this. We have  our counter-terrorism laws under constant review. The threat that we face from  Islamist terrorism is increasingly sophisticated, as the use of technology - as  will be alleged in this case - and, indeed, the technology that has been used  in the field in Iraq and in Syria. </p>
<p>
  So we have to be very, very keenly  aware that our security agencies always have the right resources, the best  resources, and the right legislative tools to do the job. </p>
<p>
  They are constantly under review and  I want to thank the Minister and the Attorney-General and I thank the Federal  Police Commissioner, too, for the way in which they work so closely together to  ensure that Andrew Colvin and his partners in the state and territory police  forces and our intelligence agencies and security services, have the tools they  need to keep us safe.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  We’ve had a lot of debate in this  country about laws such as metadata laws. So could you say whether metadata  laws were useful in this case, in terms of tracking down this individual?  Secondly, was there any information shared from another Government that helped  in this case?</p>
<p>
  <strong>COMMISSIONER OF THE AUSTRALIAN  FEDERAL POLICE:</strong></p>
<p>  So on the metadata laws, I haven't  asked the question specifically about this investigation, because I am  absolutely 100 per cent confident that we would have used metadata as part of  our investigation. As I said at the time of the debate around that legislation,  it is an absolute fundamental principal tool for law enforcement activities.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  Commissioner, are you confident this  man was acting alone? Are you looking at any of his associates? And what about  the geographical region of Young? I understand that this has become an area  which police are increasingly looking at? Is there a de-radicalisation program  there at the moment?</p>
<p>
  <strong>COMMISSIONER OF THE AUSTRALIAN  FEDERAL POLICE:</strong></p>
<p>  We believe he has acted alone in  relation to these particular activities, and we don't hold any particular  concerns or unreasonable concerns about Young. So I think we should be very  careful drawing conclusions about Young.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  What ethnicity is he? </p>
<p>
  <strong>COMMISSIONER OF THE AUSTRALIAN  FEDERAL POLICE:</strong></p>
<p>  He was born in Australia; he is an  Australian citizen.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  You were talking about laser devices  to distract incoming munitions. What are you talking about? Are you talking  about laser pointers to distract incoming laser guided bombs?</p>
<p>
  <strong>COMMISSIONER OF THE AUSTRALIAN  FEDERAL POLICE:</strong></p>
<p>  So that's getting into the  technicalities of what we will allege at court so I would rather not talk about  that now.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  Was there a range on the missiles  that he was designing?</p>
<p>
  <strong>COMMISSIONER OF THE AUSTRALIAN  FEDERAL POLICE:</strong></p>
<p>  Not to my knowledge but that’s a  level of technicality that the court will need to put its mind to.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  Commissioner, were there any other  people at the house? Did he have family there or was he living alone?</p>
<p>
  <strong>COMMISSIONER OF THE AUSTRALIAN  FEDERAL POLICE:</strong></p>
<p>  No he had his family in the house.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  Children there as well?</p>
<p>
  <strong>COMMISSIONER OF THE AUSTRALIAN  FEDERAL POLICE:</strong></p>
<p>  Yes, there were children.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  Had he lived in the community for a  while?</p>
<p>
  <strong>COMMISSIONER OF THE AUSTRALIAN  FEDERAL POLICE:</strong></p>
<p>  I believe he has been in Young for a  while.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  Had he been receiving payments from  ISIL? Or any sort of financial benefit?</p>
<p>
  <strong>COMMISSIONER OF THE AUSTRALIAN  FEDERAL POLICE:</strong></p>
<p>  That’s also subject to the ongoing  investigation.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  And just on that question of David  Crowe’s, was there another government involved in the intelligence-gathering  process?</p>
<p>
  <strong>COMMISSIONER OF THE AUSTRALIAN  FEDERAL POLICE:</strong></p>
<p>  At this stage, I think it’s just  best we leave it at Australian-based investigation. We do clearly work with our  partners overseas but I don't want to go into details.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  Has the man ever been to Iraq or  Syria, that you know of or into the vicinity? </p>
<p>
  <strong>COMMISSIONER OF THE AUSTRALIAN  FEDERAL POLICE:</strong></p>
<p>  No. </p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  Does he have a passport?</p>
<p>
  <strong>COMMISSIONER OF THE AUSTRALIAN  FEDERAL POLICE:</strong></p>
<p>  I'm not personally aware if he has a  passport.</p>
<p>
  <strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>  Okay, thank you very much. Again,  the Minister and I, and the Government want to thank the Australian Federal  Police, their partners and state and territory police forces and the agencies  who look after our security and intelligence that do extraordinary work, just  as does the ADF in the field, in keeping us safe. </p>
<p>
  This threat of Islamist terrorism is  one of considerable sophistication, and we need to have the right tools, the  strong laws, and the most professional agencies - and we do - to keep  Australians safe. </p>
<p>
  Thank you very much.</p>
