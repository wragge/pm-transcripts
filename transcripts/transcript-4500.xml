FOR PRESS 25 SEPTEMBER 1977<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Last year, following a promise to the Australian community, the<br />
Government introduced its secret ballot legislation.<br />
In dffect, the legislation simply required secret postal ballots<br />
for electionsof senior trade union officials. The elections would<br />
be conducted in two ways either by the Commonwealth Electoral<br />
Office, free of charge, or by the union itself, at its own cost.<br />
The Goverm-ent introduced this * legislation because it was sick and<br />
tired of nien and women unable to have a real say in how their union<br />
was run. Generally, the system of secret ballots is now working<br />
well. Unions are making use of the electoral office to run their<br />
elections. In doing so they are saving thousands of dollars in<br />
election costs. Official figures show how well this system is<br />
being accepted.<br />
In the twelve months prior to August 9 last year, when the legislation<br />
came into effect, there were 178 applications for officially<br />
conducted elections. In the twelve months following that date, the<br />
number was 244 a 37% increase. This is an encouraging trend.<br />
However, it is still too early to assess fully the impact of the<br />
legislation, as many unions have not had to hold elections in the<br />
period. The Government b~ lieves that eventually the great majority of<br />
organisations will have their elections officially conducted.<br />
This can only lead to a continuing strengthening of a union members<br />
fundamental right and that is the right to have a proper say in<br />
how his own union is run. Unfortunately, some unions and union<br />
leaders are not playing ball.<br />
The Government has been advised that the Amalgamated Metal Workers<br />
and Shipwrights Union Australia's largest union has sought to<br />
conduct elections in an improper and illegal way. It is reported<br />
that the union has tried to go back to the old star night technique<br />
where iierbers are lucky if 2% of them get a proper opportunity to<br />
vote. As a result of information that has come to the Department of<br />
Employment and Industrial Relations, the Arbitration Inspectorate<br />
has carried out a very detailed investigation of this matter.<br />

<p>2<br />
If the Industrial Registrar confirms the breaches, there will<br />
then be only two courses of action left. New elections will<br />
be held or the union will be prosecuted for breach of the law.<br />
The Builders Labourers Federation has also sought to overturn<br />
the purpose and spirit of the secret ballot system. The<br />
Government has been advised that that particular union changed<br />
its rules for election of office bearers to exclude members from<br />
the right to stand for election.<br />
Accordingly, Tony Street is examining further amendments to the<br />
secret ballot legislation to make sure that the spirit of that<br />
legislation is given effect.<br />
We are determined that the rank and file trade unionist will<br />
not be run over roughshod by any power seeking union official.<br />
The right of men and women unionists will be protected.<br />
In essence, our secret ballot legislation seeks to give unionists<br />
and all Australians a better go, a fairer deal.<br />
It is working. It is giving unionists throughout Australia a<br />
fair chance to have their voice heard. In thousands of cases<br />
it gives them this right for the first time.<br />
The Government will make sure that this keeps happening, that<br />
thi~ s right is-maintained for all unionists. </p>
