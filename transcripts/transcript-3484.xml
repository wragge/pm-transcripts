STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AT CAIRNS AND MAREEBA, OLD.<br />
24 NOVEMBER, 1974<br />
1. THERE ARE FEW CITIES WHICH I VISIT MORE OFTENWHETHER<br />
FOR BUSINESS OR PLEASURE THAN CAIRNS. IN<br />
MAY I OPENED YOUR NEW CIVIC CENTRE AND CULTURAL<br />
COMPLEX SYMBOLIC OF THE GROWTH AND PROSPERITY<br />
OF THIS CITY AND YOUR REGION. SINCE THEN WE HAVE<br />
DONE A GREAT DEAL-MORE FOR THE WELFARE AND PROGRESS<br />
OF CAIRNS. WE HAVE MADE A GRANT OF $ 18,750 TOWARDS<br />
YOUR BASKETBALL STADIUM AS PART OF my GOVERNMENT' S<br />
DRIVE TO EXPAND SPORTING AND RECREATIONAL FACILITIES<br />
THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA. WE HAVE APPROVED THE FIRST<br />
DIRECT GRANTS EVER MADE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT COUNCILS<br />
BY AN AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT. UNDER OUR PROPOSALS<br />
CAIRNS CITY COUNCIL IS RECEIVING $ 176,000 AND<br />
MAREEBA IS* RECEIVING $ 180,000 ON THE RECOMMENDATION<br />
OF THE GRANTS COMMISSION. THESE GRANTS ARE GIVEN<br />
WITHOU T INTEREST; THEY NEED NOT BE REPAID. THERE<br />
ARE NO STRINGS ATTACHED. THEY CAN BE SPENT BY THE<br />
LOCAL AUTHORITIES AS THEY SEE FIT TO IMPROVE THE<br />
SERVICES AND AMENITIES AVAILABLE TO THE COMMUNITY.<br />
2. IT IS A GREAT PLEASURE IN THIS CAMPAIGN TO BE SUPPORTING<br />
RAY JONES, THE MEMBER FOR CAIRNS, AND BILL WOOD, THE<br />
MEMBER FOR BARRON RIVER. THEY WILL BE VALUABLE<br />
MEMBERS OF A NEW STATE GOVERNMENT LED BY MY FRIEND<br />
AND COLLEAGUE PERC TUCKER. As SHADOW-MINISTER FOR<br />
TRANSPORT, RAY JONEt WILL COOPERATE' WITH MY GOVERNMENT<br />
TO IMPLEMENT OUR PLANS FOR A COMPREHENSIVE<br />
NATIONAL HIGHWAYS SYSTEM 2 l </p>
<p>2<br />
3. UNDER LABOR'S PROPOSALS A HIGH-GRADE ALL-WEATHER HIGHWAY WILL<br />
LINK CAIRNS WITH BRISBANE AND EVENTUALLY WITH SYDNEY<br />
AND MELBOURNE. DESPITE OPPOSITION OBSTRUCTION WE HAVE<br />
PASSED THE NECESSARY LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE $ 1,126<br />
MILLION FOR OUR NATIONAL ROADS PROGRAM OVER THE NEXT<br />
4k THREE YEARS. WE ARE THE FIRST NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TO<br />
UNDERTAKE THIS ESSENTIAL PROGRAM. NO': STATE GOVERNMENT<br />
HAS HAD THE RESOURCES TO DO IT ALONE. No PREVIOUS<br />
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CARED ENOUGH TO DO IT EVEN THOUGH<br />
THEY HAD THE NECESSARY CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS. WE ARE<br />
USING THOSE POWERS. WE ARE GETTING ON WITH THE JOB.<br />
14. WE WANT TO SEE CAIRNS PROPERLY SERVED BY SHIPS OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL LINE. MR. BJELKE-PETERSEN, ALONE<br />
AMONG THE PREMIERS, HAS PREVENTED A. N. L. SHIPS OPERATING<br />
BETWEEN PORTS WITHIN HIS OWN STATE. QUEENSLAND CITIES'<br />
H'VE BEEN DENIED AN ESSENTIAL SHIPPING SERVICE SOLELY<br />
BECAUSE OF THE OBSTINACY AND PREJUDICE OF THE OUTGOING<br />
PREMIER, MR. BJELKE-PETERSEN' S ATTITUDE IS NOT SHARED<br />
BY THE AUTHORITIES IN-CAIRNS. MR. BORZI, THE CHAIRMAN<br />
OF THE CAIRNS HARBOUR BOARD, AND A FORMER STATE<br />
CANDIDATE OF THE NATIONAL PARTY ( AS IT IS NOW CALLED)<br />
,) ITD IN HIS 1973-74 ANNUAL REPORT:<br />
" THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL LINE'S WEEKLY CARGO<br />
SERVICES TO AND FROM THE SOUTH BROUGHT<br />
INCREASED TRADE AND REVENUE. UNFORTUNATELY<br />
THE BOARD S SUPPORT OF MOVES TO HAVE A. N. L.<br />
GRANTED THE PRIVILEGE OF CONDUCTING AN INTRASTATE<br />
CARGO SERVICE HAS NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL TO DATE." </p>
<p>EARLIER TODAY I WAS IN WEIPA, A CITY THAT HAS SUFFERED<br />
AS MUCH AS CAIRNS FROM MR. BJELKE-PETERSEN'S OBSTRUCTIONISM.<br />
WE HAVE SEEN THE FARCICAL SITUATION OF FOREIGN<br />
SHIPS CARRYING BAUXITE FROM WEIPA TO GLADSTONE BECAUSE<br />
AN. L, SHIPS WERE PREVENTED FROM DOING THE JOB.<br />
MR. BJELKE-PETERSEN HAS REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH US<br />
IN OTHER PROJECTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF QUEENSLAND<br />
AND THE BENEFIT OF HER CITIZENS. HE HAS SPURNED OUR<br />
OFFER OF FUNDS FOR LAND STABILISATION. HE HAS<br />
REFUSED TO HOLD DISCUSSIONS ON OUR OFFER OF FUNDS<br />
FOR ABORIGINAL ADVANCEMENT. MR. BJ'ELKE-PETERSEN HAS<br />
THROWN AWAY $ 50 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THIS<br />
STATE, HIS ATTITUDE IS AT ODDS WITH THAT OF ALL THE<br />
LIBERAL PREMIERS AND ON MANY ISSUES, SUCH AS ABORIGINAL<br />
LAND RIGHTS, WITH THE ATTITUDE OF A FORMER LIBERAL<br />
RIME MINISTER, MR. GORTON.<br />
6. ALTHOUGH RURAL ELECTRICITY COSTS : N QUEENSLAND ARE THE<br />
HIGHEST IN ALL THE EASTERN STATES, THE BJELKE-PETERSEN<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH US IN SEEKING<br />
WAYS TO REDUCE THESE COSTS. HIGH ELECTRICITY COSTS HELP<br />
v,' 4 UP PRICES OVER A WIDE RANGE OF GOODS AND SERVICES.<br />
THE BJELKE-PETFRSEN GOVERNMENT REFUSES TO USE ITS WIDE<br />
POWERS TO CONTROL PRICES AND RESISTED OUR ATTEMPTS TO<br />
OBTAIN COMMONWEALTH POWER OVER PRICES BY REFERENDUM. </p>
