MACQUARIE NETWORK WEEK~ LY BROA. DCAST<br />
By the Prime Miinister, thie Rt. Hon.<br />
William McMahon, CH, MP<br />
BUDGET MIEASURES<br />
Interviewer: Paul Lynch 6 SEPTEMBER, 1972<br />
Prime Minister you were reported in the Press some<br />
weeks ago as having said to members of your Party that they<br />
had a good Budget and now was the time to go out and sell it.<br />
It's quite obvious however, receiving calls at radio stations<br />
from listeners, that most people don't have a very' clear<br />
picture in their m'inds of just how good the Budget is for<br />
them. Why do you think that is?<br />
Pm. I think that the media in Australia doesn't give anywhere<br />
enough publicity to what has been done in a Budget and that's<br />
been a practice for years past. They're interested in<br />
contemporary news not in explaining what has been done in<br />
the past no matter how valuable it might be to the beneficiaries.<br />
So therefore if I could just continue this, I believe it is the<br />
responsibility of every member of Parliament, and of every<br />
responsible Denartment, and particularly of members, of the<br />
Cabinet itself to explain wh-at has to be done and to let people<br />
know how they can go about getting the benefit of the Budget<br />
itself.<br />
Q. Teien you announced income tax cuts these were really<br />
the only major cuts which were announced. How significant<br />
are those cuts?<br />
P! 1. W,, ell no there were others too, such as family allowances<br />
or the allowances for dependants and many others as well. But<br />
the cuts are pretty substantial. For example, you will not<br />
now have to submit a return if your income is below S1,041 per<br />
annum. Secondly with a person on an income of $ 2,000, his<br />
taxation will now be reduced by something of the order of<br />
$ 2.75 per week. So that his take home pay will be to that<br />
extent increased. But I believe also that it is a pretty fair<br />
Budget in that T~' e do concentrate on the lower and middle income<br />
groups. ./ 2 </p>
<p>0. There--has been a suacr-etion for Gorm. e time-that -the<br />
figure of .$ 317, -the incnme tax'allowance--for * a iAfe-i---hould<br />
be raised?<br />
P~. Yes, tha! t is alwayo * being raised. What we did do is to<br />
increase the allowances for all de endants and in this Budget<br />
we did increase thos; e allo-ances bly $ 52 per annum. That<br />
covers all dependants.<br />
Again its quite obvious nearing calls from people to<br />
open line progre-mmes that neorple anroaching nensionable age<br />
or nensioned neonle have very little idea of ' That your<br />
programme is a!) out easing and finally eliminating the means<br />
test.<br />
PM. Well 1,7ave said that we -yould abolish the means test<br />
within three years. That is clear cut and there can't be much<br />
doubt ab-out it. P~ ut if there is then advise everyone who in<br />
doubt to go to thei--r local , em! er or to the local Dep artment<br />
of Social Service! 3 anP,. have it clearly explained to them. On<br />
the -first part of the question you as,-ed that is, what we call<br />
liberalisingq the means test, I think this should be ex * plained<br />
because it is generous, it clives large benefits to an<br />
increasingi num. ber of People. I've just jotted down a few noten<br />
here and I think they igh behlpu because * try'v<br />
nroposed to do is to increase the limits of w,. hat we call the<br />
fremeans from $ 10 to 20 a -eelk in the ca~ e of a single<br />
nensioner and from '$ J7 to $ 34.5f) a week in the case of a<br />
married couple.<br />
0. That's immediate?<br />
That is immediate. Then That this means is that thie<br />
proposed rates of pension, full p. ens: ion ill be payable until<br />
the combined pension and means a3 assessed exceed douhle the<br />
nenoion. T'hat'-, 40 a '. eek in the case of a single nensioner<br />
and $ 69 a week for a married counle. And! we go further on this<br />
occasion and say that eligibility for a part pension Will<br />
not now cease until means as assessed reaches thiree times the<br />
pension. 71hat'r. $ rO a week for a single nerson and $ 103.50 a<br />
wTeek for marrieJ couples. " low w-hen w,, e look at the average<br />
earninga -ihich are now about $ 98 a -, reek we can see how<br />
generouq this chancre in nolicy is.<br />
0. Prime M11inister in recent months, ' 4r. TThitlam on this<br />
station and other critics have said there isi a fundamental flaw<br />
in our income tax system~ hecause neople on higher salaries,<br />
suclh as ' Ir. Mhitlam and indeed such as yourself, get larger<br />
rebates for necesiary expenses such as narticipation in health<br />
schemes than tVie neonle who earn much smaller salaries?<br />
Pi I don't agree w:-itlh hirm. I think our present system is<br />
a fair one b!: ut when you are answerin. 7 this you would ' have to<br />
look at each incqredient of the rebate svstemi or tlie<br />
concessional zystem. I couldn't give you a nroper ansNer to<br />
that unless you were exnlicit as to w~ hich area you were talking<br />
about. But I Ibelieve that our Budget this one that we've<br />
just introduceO.--ras not only humanitarian, but I 13elteve-it<br />
was fair. And T think it dealt witih-each section of t-he<br />
norulation on a fair basis. And that I think re. Futes<br />
! Ihitlam's argument at least in _ this area. </p>
