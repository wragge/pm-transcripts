    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that on Tuesday 23 August 2005 I will meet with a small group of Islamic leaders in Canberra to discuss what more can be done to eradicate from our community inflammatory exhortations to violence and intolerance.</p>
<p>  The Australian community has an important role to play in protecting our country and its people against terrorism and the London terrorist attacks have highlighted the need to remain vigilant.  I was very pleased to see many Islamic organisations immediately condemn those terrorist acts and call their communities to work together with the Government to address extremism.</p>
<p>  The meeting will include representatives from a mix of Muslim religious, community, cultural and academic fields and will also be attended by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, the Attorney General, the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs and senior officials.</p>
<p> It will focus on the identification of strategies to promote commitment to shared values and examine how Islamic leaders can assist in eliminating intolerance and the promotion of violence in this country.</p>
<p>  The meeting will include identification of strategies to promote a commitment to shared values and enhance social cohesion within the Australian community.  The meeting will also discuss what assistance the Government might provide to support the leaders of Australian Muslim communities to eradicate extreme views and prevent violence.</p>
<p> I look forward to the meeting and to working with the Muslim community to protect our country from terrorism.</p>
