<p>I thought I'd had my morning walk already but... Mr Leon Kempler, Mr Hugh Morgan, and Mr Solomon Lew, ladies and gentlemen.  And I thank you Solly for those very kind words of introduction, they were very generous and very, very, touching.  This is not the first time that I have addressed this Chamber of Commerce, and I do so in the spirit of unwavering commitment to the bilateral relationship between Australia and the State of Israel.  There are important economic dimensions to that relationship, and the contribution that the Chamber has made to building the strength of that bilateral economic relationship has been very important and I remember my visit to Israel in 2000 as Prime Minister at the height of the hopes that were then entertained about a settlement with the Palestinians, unfortunately those hopes were to be dashed, not through a lack of resolve and commitment on behalf of the then Prime Minister of Ehud Barak, but rather the intransigence of the Chairman of the Palestinian Council, but I do remember that visit very well, and I was accompanied by quite a number of members of the Chamber who are here today.  And the Government will continue to do all it can to expand and diversify that economic relationship, but the bilateral relationship between our two societies is deeper and broader than the economic one.  It is a relationship founded on common values, of the freedom and dignity of the individual, a robust commitment to democracy, and a determination to stand together against the forces of terrorism, and the forces in the Middle East that are determined to deny Israel the right to exist free from attack and molestation, and I take this opportunity of re-committing my Government to, not only a strong pursuit of a settlement in the Middle East based on the two-state solution, but also an unwavering determination to support diplomatically, not only through the United Nations, but in other ways, a proper protection of the legitimate rights of the State and the people of Israel. </p>
<p>Israel's courageous defence of her territorial integrity since the formation of that state back in 1948 has won the admiration of millions of people around the world, and millions of people in Australia.  We respect and recognise the legitimate aspirations of the people of Palestine to also achieve statehood and independence, but it must be on the basis of proper respect and regard for the rights of people of Israel, and the undoubted right of those people and those state to exist within secure, internationally recognised, and thoroughly defensible boundaries.  One would have to be a supreme optimist to believe that such an outcome is likely to be achieved in the near future.  But optimism is infinitely preferable to pessimism when it comes to the Middle East, and I want to make it very clear before this gathering, that my Government remains determined to persevere with our commitment to the people of Iraq, our determination to stay a good participant in the coalition until such time as the people of Iraq, through their own security forces, are able to provide reasonably for their own security future.  The alternative, and that is an outcome that would represent a perceived defeat for the United States and for the coalition in Iraq, would represent a devastating blow to the hopes of a stable future for the Middle East.  It would embolden the Iranians, it would unsettle and destabilise the more moderate elements amongst the Arab states in the region, and it would represent a monumental victory for the cause of international terrorism.  The idea that a coalition or American defeat n Iraq would be anything other than the most enormous boost to terrorism, not only in the Middle East, but around the world, the idea that it would be anything other than that, is very, very unsoundly based.  </p>
<p>Now it remains very much in Australia's national interests, as well as in the interests of the cause that we hold in common with other democratic nations around the world, the fight against terrorism, that the coalition's mission in Iraq, difficult though it is, be persevered with.  And to those who criticise our position, I pose a simple question, if it is legitimate and right to deny the terrorists a victory in Afghanistan, why isn't it legitimate and right to deny the terrorists a victory in Iraq? </p>
<p>It seems to me to be a very simple equation, but ladies and gentlemen, I have come here at your invitation to say something as I have about the personal commitment I have to the relationship between Australia and the State of Israel, and also of course to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the extraordinary commitment over generations that the Jewish community has made to the life and shaping of our nation, and it seems entirely appropriate that I should address this gathering the day after Anzac Day, because Australia has had no greater Jewish son than John Monash, and his extraordinary leadership skills rated quite rightly by Les Carlyon in his wonderful work on The Great War released only a few months ago, rated along with the Canadian General Arthur Currie as being the greatest Field Commander of World War I, a man that demonstrated extraordinary leadership skills, he is a metaphor in so many ways for the contribution that the Jewish community has made to the Australian nation.  </p>
<p>I also want to say something about the state of Australia, something about the mood, and the sense of hope and optimism that people feel about our country.  I thank Solomon Lew for the remarks he made about what has happened in Australia over the last eleven years.  We are enjoying the longest unbroken, economic expansion in our history, these are the best of times for the Australian economy but they are also times that cannot be taken for granted.  We don't have prosperity by accident, the prosperity we now have does not rest entirely as some would allege on the resources boom.  It is wrong to suggest that only the resources boom has given us our economic prosperity, it is of course as Don Argus in his classic capacity for understatement once said to me, </p>
