    <content><![CDATA[<p>I said pre-election on numerous occasions that I wanted the first overseas visit of the incoming Government to be this trip to Indonesia.</p>
<p>I have said repeatedly that I want our foreign policy to have a Jakarta, not a Geneva focus.</p>
<p>And I have said, and I mean, that while Indonesia may not yet be our most important economic or security relationship, it is in many respects our most important relationship.</p>
<p>So, I am pleased to be going. I am pleased to have with me the Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, the Trade and Investment Minister Andrew Robb.</p>
<p>I am also pleased to be accompanied by a delegation of some 20 senior Australian business leaders.</p>
<p>I want this to be the practice for significant prime ministerial trips overseas.</p>
<p>I believe these are a great opportunity to showcase Australia and to offer ourselves to the world on a mutually beneficial basis.</p>
<p>So, I am very pleased to be going to Indonesia, we will be covering a range of matters because this is an important relationship and it is important to get it right at the start of this new Government.</p>
