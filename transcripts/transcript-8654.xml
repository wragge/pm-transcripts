<p>E &amp; O E PROOF COPY1</p>
<p><strong>Journalist:</strong> 11.4 per centÂ unemplymcnt.</p>
<p><strong>PM: </strong>It s a veryÂ diappointing figure, very Â disappointing and the only light we can seeÂ on that horizon is the Increw in vacancies which seems to be goingÂ on now quitcÂ inexorably around the country. But the figuresÂ are volatile we had unemployment risingÂ by one per cent in Queensland in a month and fallingÂ one per cent in WesternÂ Australia in a month , and obviousl that's not happened.</p>
<p><strong>Journalist: </strong>The aggregateÂ figure is still going up isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>PM.</strong> But the aggregates areÂ going up and they areÂ notgoing to tum down unil theÂ growth weve got now does accelerate.</p>
<p><strong>Journalist:Â </strong>Do you think that you have missed an opportunity by not going early to anÂ election? You've let the Coalition off the hook.</p>
<p><strong>PM:</strong> No, no, the Coalition... just imagine, whatever probloma we've got today withÂ unemplotnant, what would we have if ther was a 15 per centÂ tax on everythingÂ or a $7 billionÂ cut to the Budget. They have got no policyÂ prescriptions and whatÂ Â John Hewson'sÂ proven this week is they dom'l even have courage in the one theyÂ believed in.</p>
<p><strong>Journalist:Â </strong> But they'veÂ got flexbility.</p>
<p><strong>PM: </strong>Thy got frightÂ that's it, they have taken fright, that's what has happened to them.</p>
