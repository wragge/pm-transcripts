Mr0 President, -adies and Gcntlemen;<br />
I nk I ou ghhtt o b eg i nn by m!, king ra persona. cxplna11tion.<br />
I am not really 2osponsiblc for these tw; ins. ( Laug hter) The reason<br />
YI asn1 her1 this moriing tha, st I v. as soim( ewhare els3. Tha" t's<br />
a vry sensible reason, I was opening the Colo bo Plcan Conference<br />
in felbourne, I viornt domw. n yes t erday. Just before I left tho news<br />
was broken to me about thse t;: ins, so vihen I . rrived in ~ Jlboune<br />
I drove straight dow., n to havo a look nt tlhm. I didn't r-cognise<br />
them in the picture in the ' ISun" this hiornizig or -lh. tevc-r paper you<br />
rcad. ( L= ughter) One of them in th-. t picture looks singularly like<br />
Jiinston Chuchill ( Laughter) The other one'Is features were not<br />
visible because he was bellolw; ing, but mj son assure-s me that he<br />
bears a striking resemblanc to Lindsay Haissett the cricketer<br />
( Laughter) So life is like -this and h-ving got over this shock, 1<br />
ocened the(' olem--bo Plan Confernc fnd here T jr<br />
I think I ought to begin by rnking one or two personal<br />
references, The-first I an sure you woulci a11 wish mc to make is to<br />
B3ob illoughby, Bob Tiilloughby is emost a-bloe aind devoted servant<br />
of this Party, ( hear, hoar) There's no doubt about tha,' t. Bu t in<br />
spite of the uncomfortable positicn he is in, he will go down. in<br />
historiy as the only dievoted and a-bl se-rvnt of the Liberal POnriy<br />
who ever wiont fishing on horseback. ( L-'-aghtcr) And I must say thiat<br />
I scize the opoortunity of speaking abou-t him in a friendly way because<br />
110,! s really been a very remark! able man for us ever since he wis a boy.<br />
The second thi. ng I ould like31 to say is a-bout the President<br />
one of my very oldest a1nd closest and stoutest political associatesa<br />
wondrrful man who lways pre-tends that he's not. That's Phil<br />
McBride. ( i_ pplusc) He vijas kind enough to send me an indication of<br />
what he was going to say, this morning and I cast my eye over it and<br />
I saw that with his swxl we. ll, 111 say no more7 than that he said<br />
that I VIoulcl say something to you about far-reaching events shaping tin<br />
history of the i.. orld at the mo-omnt. rfhaI;' a good assignment0<br />
( Lau. vghter) But I can say so-mething about some of them and perhaps in<br />
a chee-rful zay, because if' there's one * thing that stands out in this<br />
calndar year so far, it is that though our majority has been ; kctchy,<br />
our moralo hlas been good. ( Hear, hr) And I, mysl1f, fel that we,<br />
have made distinct progress in the politicl field in the last nine<br />
or ten months. Only the future can prcve whether that's true or fallse,<br />
but I feel i. t and I think ost of us at Canberra ;, ould feel that that<br />
Wa-s so, Our opposition hasn't been trmendously effective. It's been<br />

Thcrcefre, I can report to you most hopfully about our Federal<br />
political position,<br />
events shaping history, I won't endcavour to cover that<br />
ground but I -, would ] ike to say soofthing or or purhaps three of<br />
them, The first relates to recent cvcnt-t. s in relation to Cuba, w* hi ch<br />

<p>Vell, that's a gccd, forthright obsorvation. Th-n he goes on to say<br />
to himslf, " Now how did such wisdom emerge œ ron the L. L. P. at long<br />
last?" And he urvides the answer. " The A declaration is the<br />
result of years of action by the forces w:-rking for peace." ( You know<br />
who they aro) " Years of growing mass revulsion against the horror of<br />
nuclear war." Then he goes on to make a glancing reference, as we<br />
say in Parliament, to the r. massing and arching of hundreds in<br />
Canberr, and that's had a big effect on Federal politicions. And<br />
thereforc, he ends up saying, " These ideas are a part of Labor<br />
Party trodition as reflected in the Hobart decisi: ns cf 1955, in<br />
several suceches of Chifley and in the declaration against the use of<br />
Australian military fores in Malaya. It is an urgent question for<br />
the whole Labor movement that the AL. P. should ta. ke up the sanc stand<br />
on Viet Nam and the other South Eastern countries as it has traken up<br />
on Malaya0Now, here's a remarkable brotherhood of mind, dcn't you<br />
think, with tho Communist boys taking croedit for this glittering<br />
result. This well, this declaration and quite frankly, I am not<br />
going to use its extravagant language, I wi: uld regard as preliminary<br />
notice by the '.
cancel the NZzU S pact. It must me-an that if it means anything,<br />
unless scm. ey is f oolish enough to think that a great power like the<br />
United Stats, suppcsing it becomes involved in a great struggle, is<br />
going to allow its allies in the AZUS pact to retreat and say,<br />
" Nothing doing. You must not launch any of your powerful attacks<br />
from our soil." Ncw this is i serious natter, It is a iatter that<br />
I have, myself, had the opportunity of discussing in ,' ashingtcn It<br />
is not to be laughed off. Le. t the La. bor Party go into office and<br />
let them apply this policy and I venture to say that the relations<br />
that we have with the United States, so zealously built up over the<br />
last ten or twelve years, will suffer an irremediable blow.<br />
Now, Sir, * he next ma. tter th. t I thought I might say a word<br />
to you about is, end I sup ose it can't be avoided, the Common<br />
Market. Ian not going to encdeavour-say anything very fresh on<br />
this matter because there is nothing very fresh to be said. I think<br />
the outstannding dovelopment in the Common 1Market negotiations since<br />
the Prime Miinisters' Conference has becn that the Givernment of the<br />
United Kingdon has had an overwhelming vote in the Conservative Party<br />
in favour -f g: oing in and only the other dlay, had an overwhelming<br />
vcte in the House of Commons to support the stops that had been taken.<br />
Now you may, as I sometimes do mysclf, 1wVrhne-teh er that is a very<br />
good negotinting positin to be in. You nmay wonder whether it is a<br />
very strong positi, n t; be sa. ying t' the Six when you are negotiating<br />
with them, '" ell, look, we nust go in anyhow." I would have thought<br />
it was not, but still, they kniw their business better than I do.<br />
But I think we have now got a point when, in all probability not<br />
certain, of course; nothing is certain but in all probability, Great<br />
Britain is going in. Therefore, we will have to think of this matter<br />
increasingly as one of the facts of life. In all probability, within<br />
twelve months, Great Britain will be a meiber of the European<br />
o-munity. hat effect that xill have on the Comamnealth structure<br />
I have spoken about at grma-t length with c-nsiderable empha. sis and I<br />
don't want to argue about it. Personally, as you kno, I think that<br />
loose confederati. ons either bre-k up or they get closer. They end<br />
up by a dissolution of the idea or they end up as federations. That<br />
has been the history in the United States; it has been the history<br />
in the . e1st Indies where they began to think they had a federation<br />
but because the pulling-apart forces were too great, it broke up and<br />
now we h-ve a series of separate Conmonealth countries in thu ' West<br />
Indies. In the Federation of RLhoLesi-. and Nysaland, where Sir Roy </p>
<p>6-<br />
WplarnskXy Is struggling hard to pro-serve the Federation. though the<br />
odds appeav to be sli-ghtly, at any rate9 against him,, the pullingapart<br />
mrovement is on_-l Thersfore, .1 have rJesolved 01l th is<br />
cons titutional thning in my owrn mind by saying, 11' W'el1 yoru go into<br />
Euro-oe, you to" Ll us, and I believe you, tha t Iroi; don u want to go<br />
in-, to a federation, you don't want tGo become a-state-in a federation<br />
of Europe9 but you do want to got the advantages th-at can be got<br />
out of aon economic union, Out of an increased home market, oto<br />
-all t~ he prospect of grec er efficieoncy and lower costs and rruore<br />
things to sell -around the world. We]. oi I understand tGhat, but if<br />
you go in like that, you must want it to succeed, you mtust want<br />
to get the highest possible measure ofl economic unity and the more<br />
of that you get, the nearor you are to a political federation."'<br />
W~ ell 91 I hop-I will be wrcong on tha matr out as nobody would<br />
engage in the nonsense of going into the . nirope-on ComrmunitGy with<br />

many, many years' to corie, t~ qe vryc: Koart o-f' ou. r international<br />
economic existence. The second aspect of thnat matter is one that I made<br />
somae reference to this mo-. ning in Melbourne at the Colombo Plan<br />
Conference0It was greatly Cdiscussed in Ljondon at the Prime </p>
<p>7<br />
Ministers1 Conference, One of the ironies of the post-war world<br />
has been that great nations like the Unitod States of America<br />
and small nations like our own have, in varying degrees, found<br />
very large suns of money for the economic assistance of new nations<br />
in the world, particularly in Africa and Asia, particularly, in<br />
our case, in South East -sia, These great sums of money have been<br />
found and they are designed to help these countries someday to<br />
meet their political independence with a measure of economic<br />
independence, enable them to produce more things on their farms,<br />
in their fields and in such factories as they develop. But when<br />
all thatts done, what happens? Some of the great donor countries<br />
will then say " Sorry, we can't take your commodity, We have a<br />
tariff against it or we have some protection against it, and it's<br />
just too bad," The result is that, particularly the more undeveloped<br />
countries, but it also applies to us, have been living for<br />
ten or fifteen years on adverse terms of , rade in which they find<br />
the average price of their exported commodity falling and the<br />
average cost of the things they buy from the rest of the world<br />
rising, This is true of Australia, There has been a tremendous<br />
fall in the terms of trade so far as we are concerned it goes<br />
for a lot of these other countries that I have in mind and,<br />
therefore we have been advocating that rather than think of it as<br />
a mere master of money-in-aid the great industrial powers of the<br />
world ought to sit down with the rest of us and work out commodity<br />
agreements which will maintain a reasonable and. payable price and<br />
an adequate market for the things that are produced in the<br />
countries that get the aid,<br />
The old slogan not so very old now was<br />
" trade not aid" and for once it happens to mean something. If<br />
you could raise the prico and maintain the markets of the primary<br />
commodities produced in Colombc Plan countries by five per cent.,<br />
it would do more good than all the millions and hundreds of millions<br />
that have been paid to them. This is a very great problen in the<br />
world and we propose to continue to devote our efforts to it.<br />
Indeed, we have a selfish, a properly selfish interest in this<br />
matter in Australia because if the old traditional preferred<br />
market is to go, then we have a lively interest in having world<br />
commodity agreements which will enable the things we produce to<br />
pass into adequate markets particularly in the Old World, but to<br />
a large extent in the New,<br />
Now the last thing, Sir, that I want to say is<br />
this, We have been in office now for twelve years or more<br />
it's getting near thirteen years it's been a very remarkable<br />
period. In fact, the whole post-war opriod in Australia hs been<br />
very remarkable because so mrch effort has been directed and I<br />
don't say improperly to what I will call the redistribution of<br />
wealth, the whole social service structure, the whole taxation<br />
structur e These things have been designed, consciously,<br />
unconsciously, both in the direction of redistributing, of gebting<br />
rid of the acute chasms between great wealth and great poverty,<br />
and a remarkable job has been done in that field, But we are now<br />
reaching a point of time when ou:. great task is not just to think<br />
about redistribution as if the thing to be redistributed could be<br />
taken for granted; we are beginning a period in Australia in which<br />
our major task is to create to create wealth, to create more<br />
resources, to create trade, because to redistribute a static<br />
quantity with a growing population is, of course, the very<br />
definition of despair. It is a creative task, and this is the<br />
Party to engage in the creative task, Not a party that has old<br />
shibboleths of socialism hanging around it, but a party that really<br />
believes in its bones that the task of governmont, when it sets out<br />
to create, is to encourage the private citizen to create, to<br />
encourage him to have confidence, optimism, a conception of the<br />
