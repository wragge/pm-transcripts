SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF APPELLATE JUDGES<br />
SYDNEY<br />
The Government. is very pleased that this Second International<br />
Conference of Appellate Judges should be held in Australia.<br />
At this Conference, the papers which are to be delivered<br />
analyse -and discuss matters of fundamental concern to the<br />
judiciary and to the administration of justice.<br />
Much of what they deal with is focussed on the role which<br />
courts have in their community and on the relationship<br />
of courts to Government. These are critical aspects of<br />
the organisation of society itself. They are issues of the<br />
highest importance, in every community, and they are issues<br />
which may be discussed openly and without reserve in<br />
this country.<br />
We, in Australia, are pleased to know that that is widely<br />
recognised abroad, as the venue for this Conference shows.<br />
This Conference will be examining the role of national courts<br />
in various countries, over the years and at present, and<br />
the role of supra-national courts.<br />
I am not a laywer, and certainly no legal historian or<br />
expert in comparative jurisprudence. Lord Chancellor Ellesmere<br />
may have said of King James I that " The King is the<br />
law speaking". I have waited in vain for the High Court of<br />
Australia to say that " The Prime Minister is the law speaking".<br />
But we all have knowledge of the role of the courts in our<br />
own country and we all have beliefs about what a legal<br />
system should achieve.<br />
In Australia, we have two particular ideas about the<br />
judiciary and about the role of the courts and those two<br />
ideas are not really separable. We are committed to an<br />
independent judiciary and to the rule of law.<br />
It may indeed be said, that those concepts are imprecise<br />
and that their content must be defined that, in the<br />
countries in which the same things have been said, very<br />
different results have followed. ./ 2<br />

<p>-2<br />
Maybe, but a start must be made in words and the words<br />
used must try to convey central ideas or principles.<br />
By an independent judiciary I mean, in the first place,<br />
that our courts must be established as separate and must<br />
be seen by the people to be separate from Government that<br />
is, from the legislature and the executive.<br />
That must be true, regardless of political systems, if you<br />
are going to have what we regard as a court of Ia..<br />
Otherwise it is simply a modified arm of Govern:. ent.<br />
The judiciary must stand apart, and, if it does stand<br />
apart and is seen to do so, not only is that a strength<br />
in the fabric of society, but also it gives strength to<br />
the individual people in that society.<br />
But, secondly, those things will not be realised just<br />
by insisting on separation of the courts from Government,<br />
You must have, as judges, men and women of ability and integrity.<br />
If those factors are present, the administration of justice<br />
will produce lawyers conscious of the role of the courts,<br />
and the system will endure.<br />
In Australia, we have been fortunate to possess, both in<br />
Cormonwealth and in State Courts, judges who are strong and<br />
independent; who are impartial and fair; so that the<br />
community has faith in the administration of law.<br />
The rule of law means, in the first place, that you must<br />
have a body of laws, whether organised as a code or not,<br />
Dublished and ascertainable; and in the second place, that<br />
the courts will hear and determine every case which comes,<br />
before them by reference to those laws.<br />
Of course, the content of those laws will vary from country<br />
to country, reflecting the way in which the particular<br />
ccmmunity has come to be organised and the moral and<br />
religious beliefs of the community.<br />
It may be that the jurisdiction of the courts in any country,<br />
and the nature and limits of their power, will, accordingly,<br />
differ. What must be constant, however, is that the<br />
administration of justice consists in the application of an<br />
ascertained system of laws.<br />
That system must be applied without discrimination, as<br />
between one person and the next, by reason of race, means,<br />
or political or religious beliefs. It is implicit in that,<br />
that the system of laws to be applied does not itself<br />
discriminate in any of those ways. </p>
<p>3<br />
What I have said about those two pillars of the administration<br />
of law by the courts would not, I think, be essentially<br />
disputed by any of you here.<br />
But it is a foundation for discussion of the role of<br />
the courts.<br />
i kow that at this Conference such a foundation 4. implict,<br />
and the papers T-hich have been prepared forecast a<br />
discussion of more complex matters.<br />
But it is useful to remind ourselves of that foundation,<br />
and of the fact that there are many countries where even<br />
that has not been achieved.<br />
The people in a community must know, at least in basic<br />
outline, what the role of the courts is and what they may<br />
exoact from them.<br />
The courts must provide a stable framework for resolving,<br />
and for giving effect to, people's rights.<br />
But you cannot really define the function of the courts<br />
in wider way unless you exanine also the Constitution<br />
a-FA . o0lle<br />
For an essential ingredient in defining what the role of<br />
the courts is, is to ascertain the extent of their powers<br />
and the circumstances in which their powers may be exercised.<br />
When at this Conference you consider the relationship between<br />
Go. erniti-ent and the individual, you are discussing far more<br />
thn merely the role of the courts.<br />
You are then necessarily discussing the whole constitution of<br />
a country the relationship between the three elements of<br />
legislature, the executive and the courts, and, as well,<br />
whether there are definable basic rights of individual<br />
citizens and what they are.<br />
This Conference is also concerned with questions of what<br />
oo'.. ers the courts should have; in what circumstances they<br />
should exercise those powers; and, in particular, how the<br />
courts may give effect to basic rights of individuals.<br />
It must be noted that those two questions asked now, are, in<br />
a real sense, quite different in their implications from<br />
the like questions asked a hundred or two hundred or four<br />
hundred years aigo. ,/ 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Tho problems which Sir Edward Coke discerned in -the time<br />
ot~ c -King James I and -the problems which you discern today,<br />
may: appear similar or analogous; such as the preservation<br />
or assertion of individual rights where there is a strong<br />
ce-ntral law-making government. But the similarity or the<br />
analogy cannot be pressed too far.<br />
The need to preserve and assert those rights continues,.<br />
but there is, in constitutional terms, a crulf between the<br />
ci-rcumstances of kingly autocracy and the circumstances<br />
of representative democracy.<br />
The w. idening reach of government into the lives of its<br />
citizens is a common feature of ' contemporary societies.<br />
There are administrative laws for trade practices, price<br />
control, the marketing of rural products, and tow,. n-planning;<br />
there are welfare laws for health services, pensions,<br />
unemployment benefits and homes for the elderly; there<br />
is government provision or support for a variety of services<br />
in the fields of education, broadcasting and scientific<br />
research. All those laws have some effect on the individual citizen,<br />
and where the rights or freedoms of individual citizens<br />
are directly affected in the course of administering those<br />
law., s, it often becomes a live question whether there should<br />
be controls and what those controls should be.<br />
* But, at least in the Western-style democracies, the increase<br />
in Governmental administration has been a reflection of what<br />
has been seen as popular desire or demand.<br />
And even where, in truth, governments act on their own<br />
initiative, that has been done consistently with the<br />
concept of representative government directed to the cormmon good.<br />
In saying this I do not suggest that the political or<br />
constitutional theories which underlie the systems of<br />
representative democracy justify infringements of accepted<br />
individual rights. Indeed those theories include in<br />
their origins the assertion of those rights.<br />
But we have arrived at the present system of administration,<br />
through departments and agencies of government, by a series<br />
of logical extensions of the answerability of administration<br />
to the legislature and of the legislature to the electorate.<br />
Maybe those logical extensions need re-appraisal; maybe<br />
the welfare state is mutating into an administrative state. </p>
<p>5<br />
However that may be, when you are examining the-role of<br />
the courts in the context of individual rights, you are<br />
also involved in an examination of constitutional theory<br />
in its wider aspects. That that is so, emphasises the<br />
importance of the topics before this international Conference.<br />
So far I have been speaking of courts in a national concept.<br />
This Conference will also be discussing supra-national<br />
courts. Australia supports the establishment, by agreement amongst<br />
nations, of supra-national courts. I wish to underline<br />
the importance of the word " agreement".<br />
If a tribunal of whatever composition is to have jurisdiction<br />
extending beyond the boundaries of any one nation, the<br />
legitimacy of that jurisdiction must depend on the assent<br />
of every country in respect of whose citizens and interests<br />
it asserts jurisdiction. If disputes with supra-national<br />
elements are to be resolved, it must only be by courts<br />
so constituted.<br />
The assertion by a national court of extra-territorial<br />
jurisdiction is an assertion by it of supra-national<br />
jurisdiction. It is consistent with national jurisdiction that a<br />
national court have power to adjudicate upon matters arising<br />
within the nation and to assert its authority over persons<br />
who have a recognised connection with the nation.<br />
A person, not a citizen of a nation or, in the case of<br />
a company, not incorporated under its laws may reside or<br />
do business within the boundaries of that nation.<br />
The types of connection sufficient to give a national court<br />
jurisdiction have long been accepted. But when a court<br />
asserts authority over persons who arenot its citizens, and<br />
who have not resided or traded or done any relevant act<br />
within its borders, that is an assertion of extra-territorial<br />
or supra-national jurisdiction. And if that court<br />
declares that a national law empowers or obliges it to do that,<br />
then that court is declaring that its national legislature<br />
has arrogated to itself international power.<br />
There are cases where that has occurred, so that the national<br />
court concerned has regarded itself as obliged to claim<br />
that jurisdiction despite the general rule that a nation's laws<br />
have no extra-territorial oporation.<br />
I want to suggest to you that this is a matter closely linked<br />
with the subject of the courts and the preservation of the<br />
rights of individuals; and that it is a matter affecting<br />
the role of the courts, their integrity and independence. / 6 </p>
<p>6<br />
Suppose a person who has no such connection with a cou-ntry<br />
as is accepted as sufficient to give the courts of that<br />
country jurisdiction, does an act outside that coun-try:<br />
and suppose that that act is lawful where it is done.<br />
is it not an infringement of his rights for the courtCs<br />
of the country with which he * has no connection to assert<br />
jurisdiction over him and to make orders against him?<br />
I[ s that not as much against conceptions of natural justice<br />
as to deny a person the right to ba heard? The country<br />
of which he is a c-itizen may forbid him to comply with<br />
that order.<br />
If it is conceded that so to forbid compliance is legitimate,<br />
is not that conclusive of the argument? It cannot be<br />
in accordance with the fundamental conceptions of justice<br />
affecting the individual, which you are proposing to examine,<br />
that an individual be so placed that whether he does something,<br />
or refrains from doing it, he is equally to be declared<br />
subject to penalties.<br />
You are to be concerned in this Conference with the basic<br />
concept%-s 0oIf independence and integrity of the courts as<br />
institutions in society.<br />
I suggest that the proposition that a national court is<br />
limited in its jurisdiction, that it should not accept<br />
or enfocrce extra-territorial jurisdiction, is an element<br />
of that independence and integrity.<br />
If it impairs the standing of a national court that it<br />
countenances or cannot prevent infringement of the<br />
individual rights of citizens of that nation, it is at<br />
least an equal impairment if it acts to penalise the<br />
legitimate acts of those beyond its accepted jurisdiction.<br />
Supra-national jurisdiction is properly based on<br />
international agreement.<br />
I remarked at the beginning, that the topics of this<br />
Conference may be discussed openly and without reservation<br />
in Australia.<br />
I suspect that what I have said since may have convinced you<br />
of that, but it is the aim of a politician to get<br />
everyone to agree with him.<br />
Thank you for inviting me to be with you today. I welcome<br />
you all and wish you well in your deliberations.<br />
