    <content><![CDATA[<p>I'm delighted to invest Harriet Fulbright as an Honorary Member in the General Division of the Order of Australia.  Harriet Fulbright has dedicated more than five decades to serving in the fields of education and the arts.</p>
<p>The Fulbright Program was established in 1946 as an initiative of Senator William Fulbright.  Today the Program is the world's largest bi-national education program, operating in over 150 countries.  Harriet shares the vision of her husband and a dedication to the belief that promoting education and understanding plays a crucial role in building lasting world peace. She has continued his legacy with vigour and determination.</p>
<p>An outstanding teacher herself, she has tirelessly promoted the benefits of educational exchange throughout the world-most especially between Australia and the United States.</p>
<p>The Fulbrights have been great contributors to the people-to-people links between our two countries and the Program has been an outstanding success for Australia.</p>
<p>I warmly congratulate Harriet on her award.  </p>
