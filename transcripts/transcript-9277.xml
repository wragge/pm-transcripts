PRIME MINISTER5/ 9<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
I welcome the Democrats' contribution to the Republic debate.<br />
Like the Government, they have recognised the importance of this issue to<br />
the aspirations of the current generation of Australians, and to the legacy of<br />
appropriate democratic and independent institutions we want to leave for our<br />
children. We are committed to the course of action on the Republic debate we<br />
announced to the Australian public some time ago that the Australian<br />
people should be in a position to decide by refererjdum later in the decade<br />
whether Australia should become a republic.'--<br />
We have always believed that this decision is too important to be rushed,<br />
and, for that reason, the Government will formulate its position only after<br />
detailed consideration of the issues. We have set ourselves a carefully<br />
measured program:<br />
the preparation of a comprehensive options paper on how to achieve<br />
an Australian head of state ( the Republic Advisory Committee Report);<br />
the consideration of these options by a Cabinet committee with a<br />
report to Cabinet later this year;<br />
a parallel education campaign to raise the general awareness of<br />
governmental structures and operation.<br />
The Government will continue on the basis of this program.<br />
The contribution that the Democrats have made shows that the debate on the<br />
Republic that we sought is now taking place.<br />
I hope that others will join the debate in the same constructive way.<br />
CANBERRA 13 July 1994 </p>
