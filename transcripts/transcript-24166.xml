    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>DAVID KOCH:</strong></p>
<p>The Prime Minister joins me live from his Canberra office. Tony Abbott, good morning to you.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Morning, Kochie.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID KOCH:</strong></p>
<p>Why do you think you are so unpopular? Why has the electorate lost faith in you?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Kochie, today, is back to work. We had a bit of excitement last week but today is back to work and as far as I'm concerned, this year is all about a small business tax cut. It's about more affordable childcare with more money in parents' pockets and I'll be at a childcare in Sydney talking about the things that matter to the families of Australia. This is going to be a year thatâs all about jobs and families.Â </p>
<p><strong>DAVID KOCH:</strong></p>
<p>We know that but the polls are terrible. Why? Because you were such a popular opposition leader. Why has the electorate lost faith in you as a Prime Minister?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Kochie, Iâve always been someone who has been focussed more on getting the job done than on popularity. I never came into the Parliament to be âMr Popularityâ. I came into the Parliament to be get things done for the people of Australia and that in the end is what it's all about. It's not about me. It's not about you. It's about the people of Australia and that's who I'm focussed on. Everyday I'm focussed on the people of Australia.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID KOCH:</strong></p>
<p>It's also about being elected and staying in the job. If the polls don't improve, is there a point where you would personally conclude I'm unelectable and step aside for the good of the party?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Kochie, Iâm not looking at polls. I'm focussed on...</p>
<p><strong>DAVID KOCH:</strong></p>
<p>Tony Abbott, youâre a politician, of course you look at polls, your colleagues look at polls, theyâre driven by polls. Youâre driven by polls every day, that's how politics works at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Iâm not so sure that it should work that way, Kochie. As far as I'm concerned, I should be focussed on what matters to the people of Australia and that's more jobs and more help for families and so this year thereâs going to be a small business tax cut and thereâs going to be more affordable childcare with more money in parents' pockets. That's what I think the people of Australia want me to be focussed on.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID KOCH:</strong></p>
<p>I agree with you. But, theyâve been focussed on your policies over the last 12 months and they haven't worked. If your policies have been so good over the last 18 months that you have been in power, and the polls are so low, the message from the public is, we reckon youâre doing a crappy job.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Obviously there are some lessons in the last 12 months. I'm determined to learn those lessons. We will be a much more consultative and collegial government this year than we were last year. This year's budget is not going to improve the Commonwealth budget at the expense of household budgets. So, I'm more than capable of learning the lessons of the past. As I said, weâre knuckling down now. Weâre back at work. Weâre focussed on jobs and families and what I am on about today is a small business tax cut and more affordable childcare with more money in parents' pockets.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID KOCH:</strong></p>
<p>But every front page of every newspaper is about whether youâll survive or not in the job. There are reports this morning you asked Julie Bishop not to challenge when you met her on Sunday and she refused. Did you ask her not to challenge and did she refuse?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Kochie, I think people find all that insider Canberra stuff so boring â so absolutely and utterly boring. What theyâre looking for is politicians who are not endlessly naval gazing, not fighting amongst themselves, but are getting on with the government of this country and that's what I'm determined to be: a Prime Minister for the people who wants to get on with things.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID KOCH:</strong></p>
<p>I agree with you. I think the average Australian is sick to death of politics and just want to get on with their own life, but they want to know whether thereâs going to be stable leadership. If youâre having meetings with Julie Bishop and asking her for her support and not to challenge you and she refuses.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>I have meetings with Julie Bishop all the time.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID KOCH:</strong></p>
<p>Did you ask her not to challenge? Did you ask her not to challenge and did she refuse?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>And Kochie, the public elected a Government, the public elected me as Prime Minister to clean up Labor's mess, to end Laborâs chaos. Weâre not going to go back to the chaos of the Labor days. What weâre going to do is build a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia, and that means this year a total focus on jobs and families.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID KOCH:</strong></p>
<p>Ok, can you just answer me though: did you ask Julie Bishop not to challenge and did she refuse? Hereâs the time to clear the air â clear the air â because that's the report coming out this morning.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Kochie, Iâm not going to play these Canberra insider games. I think too many people for too long have been playing Canberra insider games. And, Kochie, you know that the public aren't interested. Why don't we just leave all that insider gossip to the Canberra insiders and get on, get back to work. That's my focus â getting back to work. This is going to be the year of the small business tax cut and more affordable childcare with more money in parents' pockets.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID KOCH:</strong></p>
<p>Ok, explain the backflip on paid parental leave?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, as you know Kochie, this is something that has been very important to me for a long time. I want to see a fair go for families. I want to see a stronger economy but just because somethingâs desirable, doesn't mean it's doable. In the current fiscal circumstances, I think there are better things that we can invest our money on and that's what weâre doing.</p>
<p>Weâre going to have much more affordable childcare with more money in parents' pockets and that's going to be good for families. I think that's probably the number one priority for families right now. The number one thing that government can do for families right now, and that's what we are cracking on with.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID KOCH:</strong></p>
<p>Cabinet meeting today â whatâs your message to your colleagues. What is the pep talk?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>It's a stock standard start of year Cabinet meeting. Iâve always had a slightly longer than usual Cabinet meeting at the start of every year. We did it in opposition; weâre doing it in Government. Weâll be talking about where the Governmentâs going, not just the big picture of where the Governmentâs going, but where weâre going portfolio by portfolio. Weâll have a good talk. That's what we do and weâll be a strong, determined, united Government working as hard as we humanly can for the people of Australia.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID KOCH:</strong></p>
<p>Ok, Prime Minister, thanks very much for joining us.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Good on you, Kochie.</p>
