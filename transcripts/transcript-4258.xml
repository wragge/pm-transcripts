PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS OCTOBER 20, 1976<br />
PARJIAMENTARY LUNCHEON FOR LEE KUAN YEW<br />
In welcoming you to Australia we all recognise that we are<br />
welcoming a most remarkable man. Through you, Singapore has<br />
built for itself a position in the region and beyond which<br />
larger states might well envy.<br />
We in Australia are now undertaking the difficult task of<br />
restoring a large and complex economy to prosperity. Your<br />
success in controlling inflation stands as a remarkable example<br />
of what can be done. Inflation in Singapore averaged 24%~ in<br />
1973 and 1974, but was reduced to under-in 1975.<br />
Through the period of your Prime Ministership Singapore has<br />
achieved high rates of growth in production and incomes, so<br />
that now per capita income in Singapore is second only to Japan<br />
in Asia. The economic strength of Singapore is one of the<br />
strengths of the region. This-is an achievement which might<br />
seem astonishing, for Singapore does not possess great natural<br />
resources. Its principal resource is the will, the energy,<br />
the capacity to work of-its-peonl-;<br />
In the years before you became Prime Minister Singapore had<br />
suffered from communist violence and was still facing immense<br />
social problems. Its prospects seemed grim. The great<br />
achievements of your Government have dissipated the concern<br />
that many felt at the time. Your Government has succeeded<br />
in creating the conditions in which the people of Singapore<br />
have been able to build one of the most prosperous communities<br />
in Asia.<br />
Singapore has recognised that true security for the people<br />
of a nation in the individual as well as the national<br />
sense derives from encouraging the enterprise, vision and<br />
work which makes prosperity possible.<br />
People have a sense of security in their own lives when they<br />
can be confident of finding a job, when they know that they<br />
can save and that these savings will not be eroded by inflation<br />
and when they can plan for their future with reasona~ le<br />
certainty and confidence. </p>
<p>It is when people have a secure independence to build theirN<br />
own lives that they develop the skills and confidence to \ 4<br />
master a fast changing world.<br />
These same conditions are also essential foundations of national<br />
security and national independence.<br />
Ultimately, the strength of any nation is the stature, the<br />
clear-sightedness, the vision of its people andth<br />
capacity to work to realise that vision.<br />
Political leaders have a responsibility to make clear the<br />
plain facts about the world that both prosperity and in<br />
the end national survival depend on a willingness to work,<br />
to give of one's best, to accept responsibility.<br />
Political leaders who promise the world for the price of<br />
a vote who pretend that worthwhile goals can be achieved<br />
without personal effort do their people no service.<br />
Singaporelias been fortunate to have found a national leader who<br />
is above all, ' a realist a man who has not hesitated to face<br />
difficult facts, and to do what he thought was right for his<br />
country.<br />
Under-your Government, Singapore has grown strong. It is today,<br />
one of the most technologically advanced countries in Asia.<br />
It is a great trading centre -open and competitive.<br />
Australia values its relations with Singapore.<br />
Our ties with Singapore exist at many levels.<br />
We value defence cooperation and will do what we can to assist<br />
Singapore in building an effective and self-reliant defence<br />
capabili-ty.<br />
Several of Australia's major companies have established joint<br />
venture operations in Singapore as a measure of their<br />
confidence in its stability and future growth.,<br />
There are regular interchanges at all levels of our societies<br />
and in a wide variety of fields. Thousands of Singaporeans<br />
have studies in our universities and other tertiary institutions.<br />
Last week in Jakarta, I reaffirme d in an address to the<br />
Indonesian Parliament, Australia's attitude towards ASEAN,<br />
which I said was one of the most important developments in<br />
the region in the past decade. ASEAN is an organisation which<br />
has grown out of the South East Asian region itself. </p>
<p>In a relatively short time, ASEAN has demonstrated its<br />
vitality. It is showing a resolute political will to.<br />
forge further economic, social and cultural links among<br />
its members. At this years' Bali Conference, the framework<br />
was established which will provide firm support for ASEAN's<br />
Aspirations.<br />
ASEAN is making a real contribution to the peaceful progress of<br />
the South East Asian region as a whole.<br />
The changes that have taken place elsewhere in South East<br />
Asia have inevitably brought a period of uncertainty and<br />
anxiety. It is imperative that all countries work to avoid the<br />
emergence of new tensions and divisions in South East Asia.<br />
For this reason, we welcomed the constructive and forthcoming<br />
way in which the members-of ASEAN showed readinessa to<br />
establish friendly relations with the new Governments of<br />
Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia last year.<br />
We would like to see the three countries of Indo-China drawn<br />
into a peaceful and cooperative-role in our part of the world,<br />
and the region free from domination by any great power.<br />
We all recognise that subversion feeds on injustice and human<br />
misery, and that conditions of permament peace can be<br />
established only when societies can offer decent opportunities<br />
to all.<br />
We in Australia will do what we can to contribute to the<br />
economic growth and national self-reliance of our whole region.<br />
As long as affairs of the region in the hands, of leaders<br />
having, the calibre and sense of purpose displayed by Prime<br />
Minister Lee Kuan Yew, we have every confidence in the future<br />
of South East Asia.<br />
We welcome you to Australia as an old friend, and wish you<br />
a successful and enjoyable visit. </p>
