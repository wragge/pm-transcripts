    <content><![CDATA[<p>EMBARGO: 10 p. m. Sunday 12 October 1969<br />1969 FEDERAL ELECTION<br />TELEVISION INTERVIEW GIVEN BY THE PRIME<br />MINISTER, MR. JOHN GORTON, FOR<br />" KEVIN SANDERS REPORTS" 12 OCTOBER 1969<br />Q. Mr. Prime Minister, judging from the tempo and the<br />pace of the campaign to date, it would seem that the Government<br />expects this to be a tougher fight than the 1966 election. Do you<br />expect it to be a tougher fight?<br />PM. I don't think the tempo and pace of the campaign are<br />any harder and tougher than the 1966 campaign was, so since the<br />tempo is approximately the same, let us hope, as I hope, that the<br />results will be the same.<br />Q. There has been already some fairly sharp verbal<br />exchanges between yourself and the Leader of the Opposition.<br />PM. Yes, I gather that is thought to be the case, although<br />when I used the word " meretricious", I was seeking to describe the<br />speech rather than the man.<br />Q. Well, isn't it true that the Labor Party has emerged<br />from its last Federal Conference with at least an appearance of<br />greater unity, led by a new Leader with a new image, articulating<br />new policies? Doesn't this represent a greater challenge to the<br />Government than say the 1966 Labor Party?<br />PM. I am glad you used the words " appearance of unity",<br />because, of course, there is not even appearance of unity as far as I<br />can tell on the significant matters of defence and foreign affairs.<br />There is an appearance of unity in other fields, although that<br />appearance is getting a little dented at the moment with the AWU in<br />New South Wales falling under Left Wing control and making people<br />wonder whether the New South Wales outside body which dictates to<br />the Labor Party might not become as powerful as the Victorian<br />Executive.<br />Q. But rightly or wrongly, don't you think more voters<br />feel more confident about the Labor Party now than they did in 1966?<br />PM. I will tell you on October 26: .9./ 2</p>
<p>2-<br />Q. Well, on one issue on which you and the Labor Party<br />are very distinctly divided on Vietnam isn't it the case that the<br />Labor Party's policy which is " out of Vietnam by the middle of next<br />year'" now reflects the public feeling in Australia as reflected by<br />Public Opinion Polls, whereas your policy to remain there is in<br />opposition to what most people in Australia feel?<br />PM. On Public Opinion Polls and on the feelings that most<br />Australians would have, I would agree that most Australians would<br />like to have the Vietnam war finished. But I don't think that they would<br />like us to betray our allies and in fact surrender and not seek to ensure<br />that a proper and just peace was negotiated and that the South Vietnamese<br />people had a right of choice. Now there is a difference between<br />wishing that a proper peace could be achieved and wishing thatthereby<br />Australians would not have to fight there is a difference<br />between that and between saying, " Well, whether a peace is achieved<br />or not, whether our allies are still engaged or not, whether our<br />objectives have been attained or not, we are going to just unilaterally<br />withdraw our forces". There is a difference, I think.<br />Q. Well, on the subject of Vietnam, while the Labor<br />Party's policy is quite explicit in regard to the middle of next year,<br />the Government's policy, it seems, is not quite as explicit. I<br />wonder if I could ask you is there some sort of time scale, however<br />broad, for an Australian withdrawal?<br />PM. No, there isn't. We would like there isn't with<br />a qualification which I will put in later. We believe that the objectives<br />of the South Vietnamese and of the United States and of Australia<br />because we think it is of interest to Australia should be attained and<br />we think that that objective is there should be negotiations which lead<br />to the people of South Vietnam having a chance to choose their<br />government free of terrorism and free of attack. This is what we would<br />like to see happen. Now if there should be a withdrawal of.. a<br />continuing plan for withdrawal of United States troops and I don't<br />believe there is, but if there should be then we would certainly<br />require to be phased in to that withdrawal and not stay there until the<br />f inish.<br />Q. You couldn't suggest any point at any American<br />withdrawal where Australia would withdraw?<br />PM. Not at this stage, no. Not at this stage. But we would<br />expect to be phased in with a withdrawal and not to be left there<br />amongst the last. / 3</p>
<p>3-<br />Q. On another issue on which the Government and the<br />Opposiion-are ver-y sharply divided, is this very complex question<br />of rival -heeit-h schemes. Now it could be, I think, conceded that the<br />Labor Party has come forward with, if not a winner, at least a much<br />better framed policy than it has had in the past and it has put it<br />forward fairly explicitly, very clearly and it could be attractive.<br />Now I know the big pro~ blem, of course, is costing. Without going<br />into too many details about the costing, what is it about the<br />Government's health policy which you would suggest would make it<br />more attractive than the Labor policy?<br />PM. Well, in the first place, I believe that it will be<br />cheaper. The Labor Party's requirements are for a 14 per cent<br />levy, not on tax paid, but a 141 per cent levy on a person's taxable<br />income. This is the base from which they s tart with a limit of<br />$ 100. Now, this is going to cost any single person who is earning<br />more than $ 40 a week, it is going to cost them more than they are<br />at present paying. And it is going to cost married people earning<br />$ 63 a week more than they are at present paying, so it is going to be<br />more costly fcr the contributor. Secondly, you say it is very explicit.<br />I am not sure that it is. It covers people to public ward standards.<br />People might well have a preference to be able to cover themselves<br />to intermediate standards or private ward standards if they are<br />prepared to pay a little more. As I read the alleged health plan<br />of the Opposition, it is intended to pay 85 per cent of doctors' fees.<br />We are seeking to reach a stage, and we will, where the most that<br />anybody would have to pay for doctors' fees would be And in the<br />case of a costly operation or something of that kind, this would mean<br />that the patient would have to pay only one or two per cent of his fees.<br />And, of course, the contributor would have the right of choice under<br />our scheme. He wouldn't have to depend on a Government Department.<br />He would be able to choose the Fund to which he wishes to go and from<br />which he thinks he will get best service.<br />Q. But if the Labor Party scheme is going to cost more,<br />isn't it also offering more overall, to more people?<br />PM. I don't believe it is. I can't see how it is offering more<br />overall. It is offering 85 per cent of doctors' fees to be paid and<br />accommodation in hospitals up to public ward standard. Now it is<br />going to cost the contributor more to get that than it is costing him<br />now, or will cost him to get what we are providing, and he will be<br />made to pay, and he will be made to pay to a Government Department.<br />Q. Another linked issue which is also a subject of division<br />between the Government and the Opposition is Labor's proposal for a<br />national insurance scheme. Now isn't it true that this scheme was<br />originally proposed by Sir Robert Menzies, very vigorously? a../ 4</p>
<p>4-<br />PM. Yes it is. How long ago Twenty-three...<br />twenty-four years ago, since when very close studies have shown that<br />it is virtually unworkable and not in the interests of the ordinary person.<br />It is very interesting that the Labor Party are proposing this scheme<br />of national insurance, but not putting any proposals before the people<br />at all as to what it would cost them. There has only been one costing<br />of this that I know of, and it was done by a professor, arid originally<br />the Labor scheme was said to be based on that. That would require<br />$ 1300 million a year in contributions, a 6 per cent levy on payroll<br />tax and an increase of a number of dollars a week on people earning<br />incomes of up to $ 90 a week. Of course, a self-employed man would<br />have to pay both. Now it is interesting that this has been dropped at<br />least for the purposes of argument during this election.<br />Q. Isn't it true that despite the complex problems of costing<br />which understandably could go over the heads of many voters, perhaps<br />it is only an economist who could really grasp these very complicated<br />issues, that the proposal for a national insurance scheme could be<br />very attractive to many voters?<br />PM. It could be attractive to a number of voters but would it<br />be attractive to people who are at present in superannuation schemes<br />and taking care of their future needs, particularly since we have<br />brought in a tapered means test which allows such people to get<br />pensions until they are receiving $ 80 a week? Would it be attractive<br />to a self-employed man who would have this money taken from him<br />instead of being allowed to invest it in insurance, if he wished to or<br />some other means of caring for himself? Would it be really of such<br />attraction to a worker to have to pay $ 3 or $ 4 a week more, in effect,<br />in tax, taken from him compulsorily. I doubt if it would. And because<br />I think it wouldn't, I think that is why the L-abor Party aren't costing<br />it for the Australian public.<br />Q. Your continuing criticism of most of the Labor proposals<br />in this election has been the rhetorical question: All right, where<br />does the money co~ me from? Couldn't Mr. Whitlam reply equally<br />rhetorically: The money would come from the same place as the<br />money to finance the, in many cases, quite expensive promises<br />that you have offered in your campaign speech?<br />PM. No, I don't think the promises that we have offered in<br />our campaign speech come within cooee of the promises that Mr.<br />Whitlam has made in his campaign speech. Nor do I think you could<br />justify the suggestion that they did. Would you care to try?<br />Q. Well, it is going to cost the Australian Government<br />more than had been budgeted for in the last Budget to implement the<br />schemes that you have promoted in the Policy Speech, isn't it, Sir?<br />Taxation...... 0.</p>
<p>PM. In the next Budgets, yes.<br />Q. $ 200 million, for example, in tax relief<br />PM. $ 200 million at the end of three years in tax relief;<br />$ 16 million from the Commonwealth on our health proposals as<br />regards to doctors; $ 100 million over six or seven years for atomic<br />plant<br />Q. These are substantial amounts, aren't they?<br />PM. But nothing like the $ 800-odd million a year which the<br />Labor proposals which can be costed propose..<br />Q. They challenge this costing, of course.<br />PM. Well, they can challenge it, but I can sustain that, and<br />that costing leaves out of account their proposals for a national<br />insurance scheme for which they give no cost at all but which the<br />professor suggested would be $ 1300 million a year. There is no.<br />costing for an unspecified grant for education. There is no costing for an<br />unspecified amount provided to buy land around cities. I am just<br />talking of the things that have actually been specifically said and can<br />be specifically costed.<br />Q. If we can move out of this complicated field of costing<br />and economics, Sir, and on to a probably equally complex subject of<br />foreign affairs. Now in your policy statement you seemed to ignore<br />completely the tone and emphasis in the now famous August 14<br />statement by External Affairs Minister, Mr. Freeth, and shift back<br />to a hard anti-communist line in regard to a Soviet presence in the<br />Indian Ocean. Do you concede that this can be interpreted as a<br />back-down under DLP threat?<br />PM. Yes, I think it could be interpreted that way but it isn't<br />that way, and I think the only reason it could be interpreted that way<br />was because Mr. Freeth's original statement was misinterpreted. He<br />never, for one moment, suggested that we might have a military<br />alliance with Russia, or that we would like to see Russian bases in<br />our North, or that we would like to see a Russian military alliance<br />with the countries in our North. Never for one second did he suggest<br />it, and therefore whatever interpretation may be placed upon what<br />I have said, I think it is due to a misinterpretation of what Mr.<br />Freeth said.<br />Q. Would you concede that in your policy statement,<br />however, you did ignore the subtle and sophisticated diplomatic<br />tone of Mr. Freeth's earlier statement? / 6</p>
<p>N. -6-<br />PM. Well, I don'tknow wlieV= a it was a subtle and<br />sophisticated dip lmtic Wile. Jx seemed to me to be a statement<br />which wartskel put of context and completely blown up and completely<br />misinterpreted.<br />Q. We will come to the Liberal Party itself now, Sir.<br />There have in the twenty months or so that you have been in office<br />been some strains in Cabinet, between the back bench and Cabinet<br />and between yourself and other members of the Party, inside<br />Parliament and outside. Do you think these strains and problems are<br />likely to damage the vote for the Government in the coming election?<br />PM. I wouldn't think so and I can't recall strains in Cabinet.<br />I can only recall newspaper people reporting that there were strains<br />in Cabinet, alleged strains between Mr. Hasluck and myself, which<br />never existed, or between Mr. Fairhall and myself which never<br />existed. But there have been new proposals put forward, new thoughts<br />suggested, suggestions of examining what previously were taken as<br />dogmas and this has, in the Branches of the Liberal Party which is<br />examining these things, caused what I think is a very satisfactory<br />dialogue, a very useful dialogue of examination of the pros and cons<br />of something which previously were taken to be sacred cows. I<br />think this is good rather than bad.<br />Q. Has this also caused some tension, though?<br />PM. I don't know that it has caused tension. It has caused<br />dialogue and discussion, and in some extreme cases, perhaps, it<br />might have caused some tension but that would be from the<br />ultra cons ervat ive.<br />Q. You referred to some of the reports, and there have<br />been widespread reports of conflict in Cabinet, and you have denied<br />these reports, but the fact that there has been such widespread<br />reporting of conflict within the Liberal Party, could this reporting in<br />itself have created an impression in the public mind that there is<br />disunity in the Liberal Party which could react against<br />PM. It might have because people don't know. They only<br />read what they read in the papers and they assume it is true, but so<br />it might have had that effect but if it did, thern it is an unjustified effect.<br />Q. Now, in your campaign speech, you seem conspicuously<br />to avoid reference to what in the Liberal Party is also the subject of<br />some disagreement, particularly between the Premiers and yourself,<br />and that is the thorny question of Commonwealth/ State finances. Why<br />did you deliberately sidestep this issue in your campaign speech?</p>
<p>7-<br />PM. I don't know that I sidestepped it as much as my<br />opponent did. I did point out, if you remember, in the policy speech<br />that all the promises made by the Labor Party, running into these<br />hundreds of millions made no provision whatsoever for such things<br />as defence, for such things as development and, specifically, for<br />such things as the increasing requirements of the States. And those<br />other promises didn't, so I did mention the need to think of the<br />increasing requirements of the States. Now the present arrangement<br />between the Commonwealth and the States on reimbursement grants<br />is running out and we will be meeting in February as the Prime<br />Minister and the Premiers we will be meeting in February to<br />negotiate a new agreement, a new arrangement for a period of time<br />ahead. That will be coming up and the work will be being done on that<br />quite soon. And in other areas, the Liberal Party itself is examining<br />the workings of the Constitution, and the power divisions under the<br />Constitution and both these things are in train. I don't know how that<br />would enable one to come into a policy speech on these matters, but<br />at least I did point out in my speech that the States would have<br />increasing needs, which needed to be taken into consideration and I<br />might remind you that our opponents didn't.<br />Q. Allow me to ask you to make a prediction about the<br />result of the coming election can I ask you how do you react to the<br />again widespread reports I don't argue that they are more than that<br />but the widespread reports that the Government is going to lose between<br />six and ten seats in the coming election? Has this affected Party<br />morale, or your morale?<br />PM. It hasn't affected mine and it hasn't affected the morale<br />of the people in the seats concerned. We have had a number of seats<br />which have been damaged as a result o~ f redistribution in Western<br />Australia, in Queensland, in Tasmania, in Victoria a number of<br />seats which have been made harder to win as a result of redistribution,<br />but I hope and expect that we shall win them.<br />Q. Do you think that the redistribution has worked against<br />the Government or against Labor?<br />PM. Not overall. I would think it was fairly even overall,<br />perhaps with a shade of disadvantage to the Government. But W~ erall<br />is one thing. Picking a number of seats is another, and there were at<br />least six seats quite severely of ours quite severely damaged by<br />redistribution.<br />Q. If you were to lose several seats overall in the election,<br />would you blame redistribution?</p>
<p>-8-<br />PM. Oh, it would depend on the general level of the vote<br />overall. If, for example, we dropped very much on the vote that we<br />had in 1966, one would say well, this is not entirely due to<br />redistribution. It is also due to a lowering in the general vote. I<br />couldn't answer that question until we had all the figures in.<br />Q. Well, if you dropped say, six or eight seats, as is,<br />I say, widely predicted, would this cause you to re-examine or alter<br />any of the policies that your Government has been so far pursuing?<br />PM. No, I don't think it would. I don't think it would cause<br />us to re-examine any because, we have, I believe, brought Australia<br />to its greatest peak of prosperity it has known, we have provided<br />completely full employment, we have provided unprecedented growth,<br />we have provided a situation where inflation is kept in check. When<br />I say we have provided we have provided the conditions under which<br />the Australian people can do this, and this, after all, is the end and<br />ultimate aim of government.<br />Q. Well, this is your first election as Prime Minister<br />and it has been widely seen as a test of your personal leadership.<br />If you do drop seats, do you think this might encourage any critics<br />within your Party, within Parliament, to try to replace you as Leader?<br />PM. I don't think so. But the position of Leader is always<br />in the hands of the Parliamentary Party as a whole. But I am not<br />worried about it.<br />Q. Thank you very much, Sir.<br />Note: This transcript has been released in Canberra only.</p>
