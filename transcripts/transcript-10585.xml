    <content><![CDATA[<p>It is regrettable that the national indigenous leaders should have cancelled, just before it was to begin, a meeting with me this afternoon which they themselves had requested.</p>
<p>I should make it plain that at all times I remain willing to talk directly to indigenous leaders about issues of concern to them and of importance to Australia's future.</p>
