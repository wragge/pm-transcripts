TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE WITH CHINESE JOURNALISTS<br />
19 SEPTEMBER 1984<br />
HAWKE: We are here today on the occasion of the inauguration<br />
of the air services between our tvo countriLes.<br />
This is more than just a mere formal expression to you<br />
because since the visit of Premier Zhao in April 1983 and my<br />
visit to your country in February this year, there has been<br />
a quite dramatic strengthening and deepening of relationships<br />
with our countries and this inauguration of direct air services<br />
is a very definite manifestation of that development and indeed<br />
a facilitation of it.<br />
I don't want to exhaustively list all those developments to<br />
which I refer, but let me say that we ar~ e particularly pleased<br />
with the very rapid progress which has been made in the<br />
integration plans for our iron and steel industries.<br />
That was formalised with the signing of the economic and technical<br />
/-co-operation agreement during Vice Minister Lin Hua's visit here<br />
last month.<br />
There have been many other elements of this integration plan<br />
both in enhanced export of some of our raw materials, the<br />
arrangements for technical co-operation in your country in the<br />
development of your steel industry and particularly the agreemen.' t<br />
that has been signed to conduct the feasibility studies into a<br />
joint venture iron ore mine between us in the Pilbarra.<br />
In the important area of agriculture we were also pleased that<br />
earlier this year an agriculture co-operation agreement was<br />
signed when my Minister for Agriculture was in China. I believe<br />
that will lead to important co-operation between us in that area.<br />
In the area of trade generally we have formulated the China<br />
Action Plan. The purpose of that is to try and assist the<br />
growth of your exports to Australia.<br />
And, as I said earlier, we are also developing our relations<br />
beyond the economic area in the fields of science and sports<br />
and culture. / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
So, you can appreciate that it is against the background of<br />
that very substantial and dramatic development in our<br />
relations in the economic and commercial, cultural, scientific,<br />
trading, agricultural fields it is against the background of<br />
those developments that the partnership now that has been<br />
created between your national airlines, CAAC, and QANTAS, our<br />
national airline to establish a direct link, assumes a very<br />
great importance. It is not merely the fact of the service,<br />
but as I said in my opening remarks, it will be a facilitator<br />
for the other important growing links between us.<br />
I'm going to conclude these opening remark~ s by saying that all<br />
these developments that I have referred to I hope confirm to you<br />
the fact that I and my Government attach the very highest<br />
importance to our relations with-China. We put them at the very<br />
highest category of Ufiportance as far as we are concerned. I<br />
have established warm personal relationships with Premier Zhao,<br />
my counterpart, and also with others in the leadership. And we<br />
will in the months and the years ahead do everything that we can<br />
to assist in the deepening and the broadening of that relationship.<br />
It will remain central to our development of our relations in<br />
the region and I believe that we share common aspirations for the<br />
economic development of our own countries we can help one another<br />
very significantly, and will continue to do that. And I believe<br />
together we can also play a role in trying to achieve a<br />
peaceful environment in our region which will be so important t~ o<br />
the plans which we both have to strengthen our economy and to<br />
improve the standards of living for our people.<br />
I ask you all to convey in the opportunities available to you<br />
to the people of China our warmest good wishes for their future!<br />
wellbeing. Q: The journalist from the Peoples' Daily wondered if you<br />
could just speak briefly about development~ s which will arise out<br />
of the opening of this new flight.<br />
HAWKE: I think we can really put it in two categories. Firstly,<br />
I hope that it will lead to an increase in people exchanges.<br />
We had, as I understand, last year 55,000 Australians visiting<br />
China. And in the discussions I had earlier with your leaders<br />
established the fact it is far and away the highest per capita<br />
visitation from any country in the world. While Japan and the<br />
United States have higher absolute numbers, on a per capita basis,<br />
with less than 16 million people here, our 55,000 represents<br />
the biggest level. Now we hope that with the inauguration of<br />
the direct air services that even more people from Australia will<br />
visit China and from China to Australia. And that will broaden<br />
and deepen the relationships between our two countries, that I<br />
alluded to before. The second category of importance, I think,.<br />
is that you will see from what I have said before, that there<br />
are very important economic relationships developing between us.<br />
We are hoping to be of assistance to China in the areas of<br />
technological assistance, particularly in the development of<br />
your iron and steel industry but in many other areas in<br />
agriculture and similarly we hope to draw upon your experience<br />
and market possibilities. And so the very fact that we have a<br />
direct air service now will mean that constant flow of people<br />
that we have in the area of commercial and economic development: / 3 </p>
<p>will be made easier and we see great benefits for both our<br />
countries in an increasing degree of integration between us<br />
not just in iron and steel, but in other areas and clearly<br />
therefore the emergence of a direct air link will facilitate<br />
those goals.<br />
4Q: This journalist is from the Guangdong Daily, a newspaper,<br />
part of Guangzhou. Of course Guangdong Province has special<br />
relations with Australia through its relations with the State<br />
of NSW and many Australians overseas Chinese come from Guangdong<br />
Province and now really opened paths and special economic<br />
zones in Guangdong. It is playing an important role in China's<br />
new open door policy. I wonder if you would like to make a few<br />
comments on China's open door policy.<br />
HAWKE: Yes indeed. From the time of my first meeting with<br />
Premier Zhao in April of last year I was struck immediately by<br />
the importance of the changes in policies that he was outlining<br />
to me then. And indeed I took it upon myself following those<br />
discussions I had with him to explain nol: only here in Australia,<br />
but overseas when I vient over to Europe and America a few mon-ths<br />
after that, to explain what I saw as the fundamental significance<br />
of these new developments. And my understanding of them was<br />
further enhanced when I had the opportunity in February of many<br />
hours of discussion with Premier Zhao. And I was able to be<br />
informed of the very great success of these new directions and<br />
economic policy in the first place of course in the rural<br />
areas and the dramatic improvements in, pr. oduction and incomes<br />
amongst the people of the rural areas of China. Those achievements<br />
in the last few years have been absolutely dramatic and with the<br />
development of these concepts gradually into the rest of the<br />
economy that is very important not merely for the people of<br />
China itself, but as you say, a part of the important part of<br />
these new directions is the opening up to the rest of the<br />
community the way which is very sensibly in my judgement<br />
being pursued by China for its benefit so) that you will be ab. le<br />
to have the advantage of technology from countries who are<br />
further down those paths. And of course it is a two-way benefit.<br />
While that is going to assist China in its modernisation plans,<br />
its new concepts of increasing the efficiency of production and<br />
the level of production. Of course at the same time that is of<br />
benefit to those of us in the rest of the world who are going to<br />
have the opportunity of being associated with you in these new<br />
directions. Now all that I have said in answer to your question<br />
so far has been put in economic terms, in material terms, but I<br />
think you should not overlook the importance to us all that the<br />
more we can have co-operation in economic and commercial terms,<br />
the more I believe that means we are going to be able to learna<br />
to understand one another, our different systems, if you like,<br />
our different backgrounds. And that, I believe, makes it<br />
important in creating a better environment for peaceful<br />
relationships in the world. So it has, if I may sum it up. I<br />
see the changes in China as being of fundamental importance for<br />
the future welfare of China. I am excited about changes that<br />
have taken place and are appearing. We want very much to be<br />
associated with them. And as I say, finally, we see them as<br />
important in economic terms but having that wider significance<br />
as well. / 4 </p>
<p>4.<br />
Q: Thank you very much for what you had to say. Of course,<br />
as you know, and have just explained, the special relationship<br />
between the people of Guangdong Province and Australia. I<br />
wonder if you have a few words which you would care to have<br />
conveyed to the people of Guangdong Province?<br />
HAWKE: Yes, I would simply say this to the people. If you would<br />
relay to the people of Guangdong Province my personal best wishe! s<br />
for the success of their developments plans and say that we are<br />
very pleased that there is this special relationship with the<br />
Province and that I will certainly give every encouragement to<br />
Australian enterprise being associated in whatever way is<br />
desired to assist in the plans you have for development in the<br />
province. Q: The gentleman isfrom-an economic paper....... and he was<br />
wondering if you could say perhaps a little more about development<br />
bilaterally, but also about Australia' s own plans for development<br />
because it is something' which his readers in China are very<br />
interested in.<br />
HAWKE: Yes, well I think as well as the bilateral relations arE!<br />
concerned, I have said already a fair amount about that. Perhaps<br />
it would be best if I concentrated on the second part of the<br />
question of what we have in mind here. We have a clear view in<br />
Australia that we have to develop our economy in a way which is<br />
going to enable us to integrate more effectively with the region.<br />
We live in a part of the world which has been experiencing and<br />
in our judgement will in the future continue to experience high<br />
rates of economic growth. And we expect Australia to also be<br />
amongst those growth leaders in the years ahead, as they are already<br />
starting to be. Now that means in Australi~ a we have to be prepared<br />
to make quite significant changes in our economic structure. Our<br />
first responsibility in getting into government was to arrest the<br />
general economic downturn that Australia faced and get the economy<br />
growing again. We have done that. Our rate of economic growth<br />
in the last twelve months was the fastest of all the OECD<br />
countries. But we have now to translate that turn-around in<br />
growth. We were able to create by a range of economic policies<br />
into a gradual re-structuring of our industry so that we can<br />
become more internationally competitive to develop those sorts of<br />
industries where we can create certain advantages. Now to<br />
illustrate to you that this is not merely words we have already<br />
taken action at this time in two of our important industries<br />
steel and motor vehicles. We have in co-operation with the major<br />
enterprise in steel that is Broken Hill Propriety and the<br />
unions and government developed a steel industry plan which<br />
involves more investment by the industry itself, greater<br />
co-operation for increased productivity on the part of the unions<br />
and governmental assistance in a way which is not going to<br />
increase the downstrength of steel products. Now in the event,<br />
the steel industry has been turned around from a position where<br />
it was a question whether it was going to survive into one where it<br />
is now productive, profitable and competitive. Now, in the motor<br />
vehicle industry we have looked at it and said it is not as<br />
presently structured relevant to either the best interests of the<br />
domestic market or our external competitive position. So we have </p>
<p>brought in a plan which will involve a gradual lowering of<br />
protection through to 1992. It will involve the rationalisation<br />
of the industry in a situation where there are some 13 different<br />
models being produced now down to a very small number of models,<br />
the reduction from five different manufacturing entities down to<br />
a lesser number. And in that way we believe that this industry<br />
will become more competitive and able to take a role in the<br />
of Australian industry in the region. Now I give those as<br />
examples of our commitment to change the strucdure of Australian<br />
industry in a way which will enable us to compete in the markets<br />
of the region and to do it in a way which, I think, is very<br />
important from your point of view to do it in a way which is<br />
not going to rely on high and increasing levels of protection in<br />
our community, to a gradual lowering of the levels of protection<br />
so that as we increase our own exports of primary products and<br />
raw materials as well as raw manufactured goods, we will also<br />
be more open to inports-from countries including China. Now, I<br />
apolgize if that is rather lengthy, but as : lengthy as the answer<br />
is, it doesn't do justice to all the details of our plans for the<br />
future, but I hope it gives you a basic indication of future<br />
thrusts of Australian economic policy.<br />
Q: This man is from the China Daily.........( inaudible)<br />
and a large portion of the readers of the China Daily are<br />
foreigners........ He was wondering if you could say some indication<br />
what are the sort of things that Australians most like to know<br />
about China<br />
HAWKE: That's a good question. According to my impression<br />
it may be that if you asked others they would have some<br />
different emphases, but I think if you look at recent experience<br />
you would have to say that there is a great fascination in<br />
Australia for the ancient civilisation of China. The exhibitions<br />
that have been brought to Australia recently have had a<br />
tremendous reaction. I believe that the statistic for the<br />
Australians who visited the entombed warniers exhibition was one<br />
in twenty I think that is correct. one in twenty of all<br />
Australians visited that exhibition. Now when you come to think<br />
of it that is a truly remarkable figure and it would lead me to<br />
suggest that that is an aspect of China's history what it has<br />
to offer that is particularly significant to Australians. I<br />
think if I can be quite direct about it as well, as we know from<br />
our relatively recent history that China was seen as if not an<br />
antagonist country and I go back to the experince * in Indo-China<br />
and the conflict there, there was a mystery, a separation between<br />
us and I think, as so often happens, once you have a bringing to<br />
an end of that position of non-recognition of actual potential<br />
conflict which was brought to an end with the election of the<br />
Labor Government here at the end of 1972, the actual people here<br />
in Australia were, I think, greatly relieved thatthis possible<br />
tension had been removed and they simply wanted to get to know as<br />
quickly as they could the country and its people in all its<br />
manifestations and so I think that explains why and if I could<br />
pay tribute to my predecessor the previous government under<br />
Mr Fraser took up the initiative and the attitude that was established<br />
by Mr Whitlam, and so Australians were encouraged to get to know<br />
China in respect not merely of cultural areas that I talked about,<br />
but in the areas of how you go about the business of running the<br />
/ 6 </p>
<p>economy of such a vast country. And I think Australians<br />
are fascinated by the fact that we're a country of just<br />
over 15 million people and we find it hard enough to run a<br />
country of 15 million people some find it harder than<br />
others I might say, or have found it harder than others<br />
but the sheer magnitude of administering a country of a<br />
billion people is fascinating to Australians. So I think<br />
one of the things that Australians are interested about is<br />
simply just how you do run the business of a country of a<br />
billion people. I am. sure that is one of the elements of<br />
fascination. But what we are seeing now is such a surge of<br />
interest and it is a fundamental I mean it is not merely<br />
there as a country we want to see as a touirist, but there is<br />
a fascination about how China functions. And I would say to<br />
you therefore that the ' sorts of aieas of interest that have<br />
been opened up in sport, agriculture, commercial relationships<br />
are to be seen, in my judgement, as part of a whole of a real<br />
interest in how you are-going about the business of meeting the<br />
needs of your one billion people how you do it in a technical<br />
administrative sense and how your people live and how they<br />
derive their happiness, their satisfaction that sort of thing.<br />
And that is why I believe that the changes that are taking place!<br />
in China that I referred to before are increasingly being<br />
watched with great interest by Australians because we know the<br />
difficulties that you have in looking after so many people and<br />
the challenges that confront you in the way you very successfull. y<br />
are seen to be meeting it is a matter of great interest to us.<br />
Q: This man is from the Beijing Daily -having come from the<br />
capital of China to the capital of Australia he wondered if you<br />
could say a few words to the people of China's capital.<br />
HAWKE: Yes, I would firstly like to convey my warm greetings to<br />
the people of Beijing and to say how much I, my wife and my<br />
colleagues appreciated the warmth of the reception that we<br />
received when we were in your city in February this year. I'm<br />
glad the people were warm because your climate. wasn't. Nevertheless<br />
we recovered from the weather very quickly because of the way<br />
which the people matched the warmth of Premier Zhao and the other<br />
leaders that we met. May I say that I was impressed with the<br />
way which there was evidence of work being done to improve the<br />
housing conditions of the people of Beijing. I would merely say<br />
to them that we here in Australia are excited about the opportunities<br />
that for us here in Australia to be associated with<br />
you in meeting the great challenges that you have in developing<br />
the standards of living for your people. We hope that in our<br />
small way we will be able to play a part with you in meeting those<br />
challenges. </p>
