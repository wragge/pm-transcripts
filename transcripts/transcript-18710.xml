I was here in February, and since then you've had a real triumph with the exhibition to honour Patrick White's centenary, which closed relatively recently on 8 July.</p>
<p>That was a vivid reminder that this building's life-force is drawn from words  -  millions and millions of them.</p>
<p>Words that make you think; words that make you wonder; words that may even change your life; words by Australian authors, many now long gone.</p>
<p>But our cultural institutions are not just collectors of heritage. They are part of a living tradition of artistic excellence.</p>
<p>They are home to artists and writers who believe in their work and who believe in their nation and its creativity.</p>
<p>They believe that our nation's very soul is our creativity.</p>
<p>In these awards  -  and in this the National Year of Reading  -  we're celebrating excellence in writing.</p>
<p>Writing is perhaps the loneliest of art forms, and one of the hardest.</p>
<p>Indeed it was Patrick White who said: 'I am constantly meeting ladies who say, âhow lovely it must be to writeâ, as though one sat down ... after breakfast, and it poured out like a succession of bread and butter letters, instead of being dragged out, by tongs, a bloody mess, in the small hours.'</p>
<p>So, writing a solitary and sometimes a frustrating pursuit.</p>
<p>We've all seen the films where the writer crumples up endless pages or faces a typewriter with a blank sheet sitting forlornly trying to get the words to come.</p>
<p>Today, that might be a computer screen or a tablet but the demands it imposes on the writer's creative resources are the same.</p>
<p>Fortunately for us, there are many âa-ha' moments and we are richer for it  -  that richness that comes from the intensity of the craft of writing.</p>
<p>It was John Keats who said, âthe excellence of every Art is its intensity'.</p>
<p>For writers, that means drawing upon your experiences and your emotions  -  something that can often be painful and even physically draining.</p>
<p>It's important for you to know how much we value what you do and how much we appreciate what your families go through as you do it.</p>
<p>The consolation lies in the fact that your words will still be here long after we are all gone.</p>
<p>They will have formed an indelible imprint capturing what mattered and what caught our collective imagination in the early 21stcentury.</p>
<p>Friends, the Prime Minister's Literary Awards are now in their fifth year and I'd like to think they've already become a tradition that will be nurtured and respected by all who occupy this office.</p>
<p>This year, of course, we've introduced a range of reforms to make the awards even better.</p>
<p>We've introduced a poetry category that has received an amazing 56 entries in its first year  -  and that's not surprising.</p>
<p>Because, a country that can produce the likes of Kenneth Slessor, Les Murray and Judith Wright certainly deserves a poetry prize and I'm very glad in these awards we now have one to celebrate Australian writing and Australian poetry  -  a very special addition.</p>
<p>This year too, at Minister Crean's insistence, we've split the prizes so the short-listed nominees all get a sum of money as well, and that's well deserved too.</p>
<p>We've also recognised Australia's great historians as part of the Literary Awards.</p>
<p>And, moving with the times, we've opened up the Australian History Prize to formats other than books  -  things like multimedia and videos.</p>
<p>In this age of tablets and smartphones, it's not the format that matters  -  it's the words.</p>
<p>The words that speak to us, inspire, anger, inform and challenge us and perhaps even make us cry.</p>
<p>If you can do those things  -  and the writers in this room most certainly do  -  then we live in a very fortunate country indeed.</p>
<p>To the winners and nominees  -  my warmest congratulations, you make us rich in the things that count the most.</p>
<p>And now it's on with the announcement of those winners.</p>
<p>Thank you very much. </p>
