FOR PRESS: 0~ AIb P. M. No. 38/ 1969<br />
ADDITIONAL DROUGHT RELIEF FOR QUEENSLAND<br />
Statement by the-Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Commonwealth Government has agreed to provide<br />
additional drought relief assistance to the Queensland Government.<br />
The Commonwealth appreciates that the drought situation<br />
in Queensland has become increasingly serious and that further<br />
Commonwealth help is required to assist the State Government.<br />
We will therefore meet the whole cost of any relief<br />
expenditure which the State may incur in 1968-69 in excess of<br />
$ 4 million. The effect of this arrangement will be to place an upper<br />
limit of $ 2 million on the expenditures which the State will need to<br />
finance this year under the current drought relief arrangements which<br />
are on a dollar -for -dollar sharing arrangement between the<br />
Commonwealth and the State.<br />
This dollar -for -dollar arrangement includes the following<br />
measures which the Commonwealth approved in March 1969:-<br />
* Rail and road subsidies on the transport of fodder and<br />
the movement of livestock to agistment:<br />
* Carry on finance for drought -affected farmers who are<br />
unable to obtain credit from normal commercial sources:<br />
* Grants to local authorities in rural areas to relieve<br />
unemployment caused by drought.<br />
The Commonwealth is prepared to confer with the State<br />
towards the end of June regarding the arrangements which might apply<br />
for 1969-70. The Commonwealth has now agreed that freight rebates<br />
on the movement of non-starving" stock from drought areas to slaughter<br />
will be treated as eligible expenditure for purposes of drought relief.<br />
My Government will also facilitate a scheme for the<br />
provision of wheat for stock feed on credit terms ( 12 months credit at<br />
42% interest). / 2 </p>

In addition to these financial measures, the Commonwealth<br />
has agreed to make available on appropriate conditions land at the<br />
Army's Shoalwater Bay training area for grazing drought-affected cattle.<br />
The Commonwealth has already provided approximately<br />
million to Queensland since 1965-66 as reimbursement to that<br />
State for drought relief expenditure. It has also given additional amounts<br />
totalling approximately $ 5 million for special revenue assistance to<br />
offset the effects of drought on the State's revenue.<br />
