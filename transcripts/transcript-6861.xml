PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR-MEDIA 7 March 1986<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE PREMIER. OF<br />
WESTERN AUSTRALIA<br />
The Commonwealth and Western Australian Government have agreed on<br />
new arrangements for completing the search for unexploded<br />
ordnance ( UXO) in the Warnbro area, south of Fremantle.<br />
Details were announced today by the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and<br />
the West Australian Premier, Mr Burke.<br />
Mr Burke welcomed the arrangements as a sensible cooperative<br />
measure. Land in the Warnbro area was used in World war II as an artillery<br />
range by the Army.<br />
The Commonwealth has funded searches for UXO in the area since<br />
1980, he said.<br />
As well as taking account of the growing pressures for further<br />
development of the Warnbro area, the new arrangements will enable<br />
the orderly and uninterrupted completion of the searching<br />
operations. Mr Hawke said that under the new arrangements the Commonwealth<br />
will fund the search of a minimum area of 394 hectares at an<br />
estimated cost of $ 940,000.<br />
Depending on the rate at which UXO is found during the searches,<br />
the Commonwealth will fund further searches up to a maximum area<br />
of 848 hectares in the Warnbro area, bringing the total project<br />
cost to around $ 2 million, he said.<br />
Mr Hawke said after the searches were completed in accordance<br />
with these arrangements, the Commonwealth will respond. as<br />
necessary to any subsequent UXO finds on the same basis as that<br />
applying elsewhere in Australia. </p>
