SPEAKING NOTES FOR THE VICTORIAN ALP DINNER DANCE<br />
MELBOURNE 27 JULY 1984<br />
Two WEEKS AGO THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY! s 36TH BIENNIAL<br />
NATIONAL CONFERENCE ENDED.<br />
THAT CONFERENCE WAS AS SUCCESSFUL AS ANY IN AUSTRALIA'S<br />
HISTORY.<br />
OUR GREAT PARTY, THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY, EMERGED WITH<br />
A RENEWED COMMITMENT TO REFORM, RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION.<br />
WE IN THE LABOR PARTY UNQUESTIONABLY HAVE THE POLICIES TO<br />
PILOT AUSTRALIA THROUGH JTHE 1980s AND BEYOND.<br />
WE HAVE THE VISION AND PURPOSE THAT AUSTRALIA NEEDS.<br />
WE HAVE THE PROGRAM THAT AUSTRALIA NEEDS,<br />
THE CHALLENGE WE FACE IS TO IMPLEMENT THAT PROGRAM.<br />
TO DO THAT, OF COURSE, WE NEED TO REMAIN IN GOVERNMENT.<br />
AND TO DO THAT WE NEED TO MAINTAIN THE SUPPORT OF THE<br />
PEOPLE. WE NEED TO KEEP THEIR CONFIDENCE, THEIR RESPECT,<br />
THEIR TRUST. -77 1 1 r e-</p>
<p>LABOR WILL ACHIEVE NOTHING LANGUISHING ON THE OPPOSITION<br />
BENCHES.<br />
THAT SIMPLE REALITY SHOULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN.<br />
LEAST OF ALL SHOULD WE FORGET IT IN THE MONTHS IMMEDIATELY<br />
AHEAD OF US.<br />
IN THE NEAR FUTURE LABOR WILL FACE A FEDERAL ELECTION AND<br />
A VICTORIAN ELECTION.<br />
IN THOSE TWO ELECTIONS LABOR HAS AN UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITYTHE<br />
OPPORTUNITY TO CONSOLIDATE IN POWER LONG-TERM LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENTS AT BOTH THE NATIONAL AND STATE LEVELS.<br />
VICTORY IN THOSE TWO CAMPAIGNS WOULD BE AN HISTORIC<br />
TURNING POINT FOR<br />
WE CAN PUT BEHIND US ONCE AND FOR ALL THE CONSERVATIVE<br />
LEGACY THAT HAS BEDEVILLED THIS STATE AND THAT HAS<br />
BEDEVILLED THIS NATION.<br />
IT IS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY FOR LABOR, AN OPPORTUNITY WE<br />
MUST GRASP WITH ALL OUR STRENGTH. j<br />
I -7 </p>
<p>3 3.<br />
FOR MY PART, I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO BOTH THESE CAMPAIGNSTO<br />
WORKING FOR THE RE-ELECTION OF JOHN CAIN AND HIS TEAM<br />
AND TO WORKING FOR THE RETURN OF AUST-RALIA'S NATIONAL<br />
LABOR GOVERNMENT.<br />
IHAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT THE OUTCOME OF BOTH THESE CAMPAIGNS.<br />
JOHN CAIN AND HIS GOVERNMENT WILL BE RETURNED AND OUR<br />
OWN FEDERAL LABOR TEAM WILL RECEIVE A RENEWED MANDATE<br />
FROM THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
BUT I WOULD ALSO WARN EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU THAT NONE<br />
OF US CAN AFFORD TO BE COMPLACENT.<br />
Too MUCH IS AT STAKE FOR THAT.<br />
IF WE MISS THIS OPPORTUNITY TO CONSOLIDATE LABOR IN<br />
GOVERNMENT IN VICTORIA AND NATIONALLY, I BELIEVE THAT<br />
OPPORTUNITY MAY NOT RECUR FOR YEARS TO COME.<br />
AND I WOULD ALSO SAY THIS: NEVER UNDERESTIMATE OUR<br />
POLITICAL OPPONENTS.<br />
YES, THEY ARE DIVIDED AND LEADERLESS.<br />
YES, THEY ARE DEVOID OF COHERENT POLICIES.<br />
YES, THEIR CREDIBILITY IS IN TATTERS. </p>
<p>BUT WHAT THEY STILL HAVE IN FULL WORKING ORDER IS THEIR<br />
WELL-KNOWN EXPERTISE IN DISTORTION, IN DIVISION, IN<br />
DECEPTION. THEY STILL KNOW HOW TO PLAY ON FEAR AND PREJUDICE.<br />
THEY STILL KNOW HOW TO OPEN OLD WOUNDS.<br />
THEY ARE STILL PAST MASTERS AT EXPLOITING CONFRONTATION<br />
AND DIVISIVENESS FOR THEIR OWN BASE ENDS.<br />
AND WE SHOULD ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT.<br />
OUR OPPONENTS, OF COURSE, ARE DEMORALISED.<br />
How COULD THEY NOT BE'I<br />
THEY ARE STARING DOWN THE BARREL OF YEARS IN THE<br />
POLITICAL WILDERNESS.<br />
BUT THERE IS ONE SURE WAY OF GIVING THEM NEW HOPE.<br />
THERE IS ONE SURE WAY OF BREATHING NEW LIFE INTO THEIR<br />
DEPLETED RANKS. </p>
<p>THERE IS ONE SURE WAY OF PUTTING THEM BACK ON THE ROAD<br />
TO POWER.<br />
AND THAT IS TO ALLOW DISUNITY TO GRIP OUR PARTY.<br />
WE IN THE LABOR PARTY SIMPLY GANNOT AFFORD TO GO INTO<br />
THESE TWO CRITICAL ELECTION CAMPAIGNS AS ANYTHING BUT<br />
A TOTALLY UNITED PARTY.<br />
HISTORY SHOWS HOW POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING THE ALTERNATIVE<br />
CAN BE.<br />
WE NEED UNITY OF PURPOSE, UNITY OF COMMITMENT, UNITY OF<br />
VISION. WE ALSO NEED THE RESTRAINT, THE SELF-CONTROL, THE<br />
DISCIPLINE THAT GOES WITH IT.<br />
WITH THAT UNITY, WE'LL SWEEP THE PEACOCKS, THE SINCLAIRS,<br />
THE HODGMANS OF THIS WORLD INTO THE DUST-BIN OF HISTORY.<br />
IN WINNING AND WINNING WELL IN VICTORIA AND NATIONALLY<br />
WE WILL LAY THE BASIS FOR A DECADE OR MORE IN POWER AT<br />
BOTH STATE AND NATIONAL LEVEL. .16/<br />
n r' r </p>
<p>AND MAKE NO MISTAKE: LABOR NEEDS THAT LONG IN POWER TO<br />
ACHIEVE ALL WE WANT TO ACHIEVE.<br />
WE CAN'T CHANGE THE NATION IN A TERM OF GOVERNMENT.<br />
WE CAN'T IMPLEMENT OUR ENTIRE PROGRAM IN TWO OR THREE YEARS.<br />
WE NEED A DECADE IN POWER TO ACHIEVE THE WIDE-RANGING<br />
REFORMS AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF AUSTRALIA THAT WE ALL<br />
WANT TO SEE.<br />
WITH THAT CONSOLIDATION OF POWER, LABOR WILL CHART A NEW<br />
AND FRESH COURSE FOR AUSTRALIA.<br />
THAT NEW DIRECTION WILL BE BASED ON THE-FUNDAMENTAL<br />
PREMISE THAT ACHIEVING SO MIANY OF LABOR'S GOALS WILL<br />
DEPEND IN TURN ON ACfiIEVING A HEALTHY, PROSPEROUS,<br />
GROWING ECONOMY.<br />
SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH IS CRITICAL AND NOWHERE IS IT<br />
MORE CRITICAL THAN IN THE TASK OF CREATING NEW JOBS.<br />
IGIVE YOU AND THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA ONE SOLEMN UNDERTAKING.<br />
IT IS THIS: THE NEW DIRECTION THE NEW VISION WE HAVE FOR<br />
AUSTRALIA WILL BE BASED FIRST AND FOREMOST ON THE CREATION<br />
OF NEW JOBS. </p>
<p>THERE ARE TWO NATIONS IN AUSTRALIA THE EMPLOYED AND THE<br />
UNEMPLOYED.<br />
UNDER LABOR THE UNEMPLOYED, THE FORGOTTEN PEOPLE, WILL BE<br />
FORGOTTEN NO LONGER.<br />
WE HAVE ALREADY MADE AN OUTSTANDING B-EGINNING.<br />
BUT IT IS STILL ONLY A BEGINNING.<br />
WE WILL BUILD ON OUR SUCCESS SO FAR AND CONTINUE THE<br />
TASK OF CREATING NEW JOBS WITH TOTAL DEDICATION AND VIGOUR..<br />
THE NEW DIRECTION LABOR WILL STEER WILL ALSO ADDRESS THE<br />
VITAL ISSUES OF INDUSTRY RECONSTRUCTION AND REVITALISATION.<br />
WE WILL ENSURE THAT A\ USTRALIAN INDUSTRY IS EFFICIENT,<br />
EXPANDING AND ABLE TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF THE BURGEONING<br />
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT OCCURRING ON OUR DOORSTEP.<br />
AS ALWAYS, WE WILL WORK VERY CLOSELY ON INDUSTRY POLICY<br />
WITH THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT AND EMPLOYERS.<br />
WE HAVE ALREADY SHOWN WHAT THIS COOPERATIVE APPROACH CAN<br />
ACHIEVE BY DRAMATICALLY RESTORING THE FORTUNES OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN STEEL INDUSTRY. I I </p>
<p>LABOR IS ALSO COMMITTED TOTALLY TO ADVANCING THE RIGHTS<br />
AND OPPORTUNITIES OF WOMEN, TO ENSURING THAT WOMEN ARE<br />
FULLY ABLE TO UTILIZE THEIR TALENTS AND CAPACITIES IN<br />
WHATEVER FIELDS THEY WISH.<br />
OUR SEX DISCRIMINATION ACT AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROPOSAL. S<br />
REPRESENT THE BEGINNING OF WHAT I BELIEVE WILL BE A NEW<br />
ERA FOR AUSTRALIAN WOMEN.<br />
ANOTHER VITAL PRIORITY WILL BE ENSURING THAT THE ABORIGINAL<br />
PEOPLE THE FIRST AUSTRALIANS HAVE THE FULL RIGHTS,<br />
ENTITLEMENTS AND OPPORTUNITIES OF OTHER AUSTRALIANS.<br />
WE CANNOT UNDO THE PAST.<br />
BUT UNDER LABOR WE CAN AS A NATION WORK TOGETHER TO<br />
ENABLE ABORIGINAL PEOPLE TO PUT BEHIND THEM THE<br />
DEPRIVATION AND DESPAIR OF THE PAST.<br />
FINALLY WE WILL DEDICATE OURSELVES AS A LABOR GOVERNMENT<br />
TO THE PURSUIT OF PEACE AND DISARMAMENT.<br />
THERE IS NO CHALLENGE MORE IMPORTANT FOR AUSTRALIA AND<br />
ALL COUNTRIES.<br />
WE ARE A SMALL NATION WITH A MODEST APPRECIATION OF OUR<br />
INFLUENCE. I I </p>
<p>V 9.<br />
BUT ON THIS ISSUE OUR VOICE WILL BE HEARD BY ALL THE WORL).<br />
IT WILL BE A VOICE OF REASON, OF MODERATION, OF HOPE.<br />
AND WITH A CLEAR MESSAGE THE IMPERATIVE OF DISARMAMENT,<br />
THE IMPERATIVE OF ARMS CONTROL., THE IMPERATIVE OF PEACE.<br />
WHATEVER ROLE WE CAN PLAY WE WILL PLAY AND WILL CONTINUE<br />
TO PLAY UNTIL PEACE AND DISARMAMENT ARE NO LONGER HOPES<br />
BUT REALITIES.<br />
THESE, THEN, ARE AMONG THE ISSUES LABOR WILL BE ADDRESSING<br />
IN THE YEARS AHEAD.<br />
AS A UNITED PARTY, WE WILL CREATE AN AUSTRALIA WHICH IS A<br />
FAIRER,, BETTER, MOREHARMONIOUS NATION IN WHICH TO LIVE.<br />
AND WE As AUSTRALIANS WILL PLAY OUR PART IN CREATING A<br />
WORLD WHICH IS A SAFER AND MORE PEACEFUL PLACE IN WHICH<br />
TO LIVE. </p>
