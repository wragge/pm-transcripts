WODONGA-MELBOURNE STANDARDISATI ON<br />
Message for " AGE" Supplement by the Prime Minister, the<br />
Rt. Hon. R. 6. Menzies<br />
The completion of the standard gauge railway link<br />
between Wodonga and Melbourne is an event of great significance<br />
for Australians everywhere.<br />
The immediate advantages which it confers on the<br />
industrial south-east of our great continent are apparent, for<br />
elimination of the break of gauge between New South gales and<br />
Victoria should considerably enhance the volume of commercial<br />
traffic and the speed of shipment and handling which are so vital<br />
to an expanding economy. Further, the convenience to inter-<br />
State travellers of an unbroken and restful journey between our<br />
two greatest cities should win unreserved approval and greater u.. a<br />
But beyond these benefits to travellers or to commerce,<br />
this consummation of a long-held dream is a symbol of the new<br />
Australia which lies in the near future.<br />
The Wodonga-Melbourne rail link is but one of a great<br />
number of development projects standardisation from Kalgoorlie<br />
to Perth is another designed to win from our country greater<br />
productivity to the greater good of all our citizens.<br />
I believe that if we see this event in that light we<br />
will have a truer appreciation of its importance. In the years Wc<br />
come, those of us who are lucky enough to be here will see changes<br />
wrought across the face of our land in which we will properly take<br />
immense pride, as I do in the project which this supplement<br />
celebrates. R. G. Menzies.<br />
