    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>...I thought it was a very emotional and very deserved farewell. I thought the innings was fantastic, I thought it was just right. It  was a great captain's knock to make certain that we didn't lose the game and the nicest moment was the crowd farewell. Steve said cricket is the people's game and cricket belongs to all Australians and all Australians shared today's farewell to a great player and a great captain and somebody who has made a great contribution to the game we all love.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
