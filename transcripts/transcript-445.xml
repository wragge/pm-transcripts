FOR THE PRESS DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS<br />
CANBERRA<br />
Released only in Canberra PR 16 h<br />
WEST NEW GUINEA STATEIENT BY THE I. IINISTER<br />
FOR EKTERNAL AFFAIRS<br />
The inister for External Affairs, Sir Garfield Barwick,<br />
referred today to reports claiming that the Australian Government<br />
was due to change its attitude on the West New Guinea issue. " These<br />
reports, acknowledged to be unofficial, are speculative", Sir<br />
Garfield said. " The Governnent's position in respect of the<br />
dispute was set out in a staterent made in Canberra by the Prime<br />
Minister on January 12 after Cabinet had discussed the natter.<br />
That statenent makes it clear that the government desires settlement<br />
of the dispute by peaceful reans and not under duress or<br />
threat of war. The Prime Iinister's statement also makes it clear<br />
that Australia pre-eminently desires that the Papuans of West New<br />
Guinea should, in due course, be given the right to choose their<br />
own future. The Government has made no other decision.<br />
In conformity with this unchanged policy, on the one<br />
hand steps have been taken to persuade the parties to go to the<br />
conference table, and on the other the Government has expressed its<br />
disapproval of resort to war or threats of war. Hovwever, the<br />
ultimate resolution of the matter is one for the parties themselves<br />
with the assistance, the Australian Government hopes, of<br />
the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Australia, not being<br />
a party principal to the dispute, is not itself involved in these<br />
negotiations. It has made it abundantly clear that it will<br />
respect the voluntary agreement of the parties in conformity<br />
with the principles of the Charter." </p>
