TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, SHERATON HOTEL, HOBART, THURSDAY, 16 JUNE 1995<br />
6&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: You might know that overnight I wrote to members of the South Pacific<br />
Forum, as the Chair of the Forum this year expressing Australias<br />
condemnation at the decision by the Government of France to resume<br />
nuclear testing at Mururoa Mtf and I have sinCe had communIcations<br />
back frorm Forum country leaders wishing to join with Australia In a formal<br />
statement and protest condemning France's decision to resume nuciea<br />
testing In the South Pacific.<br />
I proposed to the Forumn member countries and their governments that<br />
there be a delegation from Australia, that Is led by Australia, with the<br />
Forum mnembers to France seeking a meeting with the government of<br />
France to say that we think this decision is deplorable and should be<br />
desisted from. That Is, desist from any further program of testing of<br />
weapons. Can I say more generally, this Is not a necessary thng. I believe, for the<br />
government of France to do. It is a pity thot a country of such substance<br />
should needlessl undertake such a program when the thing that will<br />
protect the French people Is engagement with the rest of the world and<br />
understanding and not a 1990s version of the Maginot line. What will help<br />
Franoe most is enggement with bt neighbours In Europe end<br />
engagement Wth the rest of the* world which, in the peidsince the<br />
cestion of nuclear testing, France was seeking to do with some<br />
sccnmpishment That is, to engage other countries and to be part of the<br />
world dialogue, In doing this, in a sense, coming from that sort of Gaullist<br />
view of the world, that part of the role of the French government Is to<br />
protect the French people rings a little hollow now after the cessation of<br />
the Cold War and the fact that the problems now to be dealt with are far<br />
more complex such as remving the nuclear power stations in the old<br />

Soviet Union, taking that threat away from continental Europe, removing<br />
the stock piles of nuclear weapons, cleaning up nuclear sites all over<br />
Europe and northern Europe and eastern Europe. These are the things, I<br />
think, are more a danger to the French people than something which may<br />
be deterred through the further development of an offensive nuclear<br />
weapon capability.<br />
So, it is a wilful and regrettable decision and one which will do the French<br />
people and the French government no good. At any rate, we will be<br />
expressing our opinion forthrightly and directly and doing so in the<br />
company of Forum country representatives and Senator Evans will be<br />
leading that delegation.<br />
J: Prime Minister, what more could you say to those in the ALP, in particular,<br />
who are concerned about the perceived softness of the Government's<br />
original response especially by Gareth Evans?<br />
PM: I don't think it was soft. We said we deplored the decision. I said that we<br />
deplored the decision. Today we are saying we condemn it. There is not<br />
much more we can say than that. What we are saying is that the way to<br />
express our rejection of this notion of testing Is to do it in a way where we<br />
make our views clear, but at the same time and I think the government of<br />
France has made its position dear, that Is It is going to go its wilful way<br />
unless world community opinion changes its mind. Now, apparently, I<br />
haven't seen the text but President Chirac has said something about that<br />
sort of an approach this morning something negative but that will not<br />
deter us from sending a delegation there.<br />
J: Do you believe there Is any case for concrete trade sanctions against the<br />
French?<br />
PM: Well. you have got to remember, I think, and this is what the Foreign<br />
Minister has pointed to, what we want the French and all other people In Is<br />
a comprehensive test ban treaty. Now, the world is becoming a much<br />
nastier place. You have got a lot of ex-Soviet weaponry laying around the<br />
place. You have got a lot of nuclear scientists from the old Soviet Union<br />
wandering around the world with their wares. You have got the Soviet<br />
fleet, Pacific fleet, rotting away up in Vladivostok and all those reactors<br />
exposed to the atmosphere. You have got potential diversion of nuclear<br />
fuels to some now non-weapon states. What is going to matter to the<br />
world is getting a comprehensive treaty negotiated. President Chirac has<br />
said France will be In this. We want to hold the French to it. So, let's<br />
make sure our response is right and not a wrong headed response which<br />
really does damage to the one treaty that matters.<br />
I mean, when the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed in the 1960s people<br />
gave it very little hope of doing anything. In fact, it has been far more </p>
<p>3<br />
successful at containing weapons proliferation than many people ever,<br />
ever imagined. But now, we are reaching another difficult epoch in the<br />
nuclear story. That is, formerly the weapons of formerly nuclear weapon<br />
states and the spread and drift of these technologies are such that we<br />
need something more comprehensive than the NPT. That is what Is now<br />
in prospect. I think, this Is a great interational opportunity, even the<br />
French understand this. It is more the pity that they put their credentials at<br />
risk In doing this before hand, but still the commitment Is there. That is<br />
why, I think, Australia has the right response and to seek to move to trade<br />
sanctions which will have no effect on the French, in fact, may end up<br />
damaging Australian interest more than theirs Is not the right response.<br />
People have also said, ' oh well, we should undo any co-operative mlitary<br />
activity we have with them now', but a lot of that is about surveillance<br />
activities in the Pacific for the benefit of Pacific island nations. So, there IS<br />
not much sense In that either.<br />
So, I think, we have got the response as we should have it. but let there be<br />
no doubt In the minds of the French how wilful and unnecessary we<br />
believe this is. How much it files in the face of a sensible participation by<br />
France In a comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and how when the rest of the<br />
world has always looked to France for International leadership, and often<br />
has got it, this is not one of these occasions.<br />
J: Do you think the union movement then has over-reacted by calling for<br />
some bans on French companies and calling for consumer bans?<br />
PM: It is not a matter of whether they have over-reacted. It is a matter of<br />
whether one can deliver things that matter. Keeping the response<br />
proportional to what they have done is important It Is a measure of our<br />
maturity. And, can I say, that In many respects the relationship with<br />
France in the last few years has gone quite well. I personally restarted it in<br />
1988 with Premier Rocard and as a consequence of that I proposed to him<br />
that we reserve Antarctica as a wilderness park for the next half century.<br />
As you know, that actually happened and so while one can reasonably lay<br />
a charge of environmental vandalism at the French in Mururoa, you can't<br />
lay the charge to them about Antarctica.<br />
J: do you believe ( Inaudible)<br />
PM: Hang on, it is a news conference. It is not for you.<br />
J: So how big a set back Is this to our relationship with France?<br />
PM: It Is a set back because, I think, Australia Is developing an independent<br />
and quite strong dialogue with the French, but this must be true of many<br />
countries with France. But, President Chirac has put this at risk with this<br />
action which Is now receiving international condemnation as it should.<br />

J: But, does it soften our response, I mean he is not really worth putting at<br />
risk because he gets to have his cake and eat it too?<br />
PM: No, he doesn't get to have his cake and eat it too. This opinion will be<br />
registered, but nor do we want to see one of the weapon states of the<br />
world not be part of the comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and not be a<br />
participant In the problems. I mean, these are real problems. The<br />
problems that people In this country don't often think about like the rotting<br />
carcasses of those power stations in the Ukraine, like the rotting carcasses<br />
of those ships at Vladivostok. They are not on the lips of everybody, but<br />
they are on the minds of the Australian goverment<br />
J: Prime Minister, on a different issue, do you think that Bernie Fraser's<br />
statements of a day ago about interest rates dampen the likelihood of a<br />
further cut in the next couple of months?<br />
PM: I just think the Governor was saying that which was obvious. That is, that<br />
he was trying to warn markets of any notion of stampeding the<br />
Government or the Reserve Bank along. That Is against the context of a<br />
quite substantial fall In long term interest rates because you understand<br />
that the long bond rate the 10 year bond rate is set not with any<br />
reference to the Government, but in the market place and that has been<br />
set because of the Budget parameters. Not in any artificial way. I notice<br />
Mr Howard trying to glean some miserable political advantage from it<br />
yesterday, what's left of his political hide after his fiasco on the republic.<br />
Let me just say a couple of things about Mr Howard now that I have got an<br />
opportunity. Two major statements in a week: The headland speech one<br />
commentator described as mulch. The republic response completely<br />
indecisive and incoherent. The thing to know about John Howard is he<br />
stands for nothing. He looks pathetic because he stands for nothing. He<br />
is just the same character he was in the late 1980s when the Liberal party<br />
got rid of him as leader. A lot of people have been trying to reinvent him.<br />
He is not capable of reinvention. And then yesterday, he came out and<br />
said he is really for the Monarchy after all. Can you believe that? That<br />
anyone today who believes In this country, what it has become, the notion<br />
of what we think of ourselves, our complete right to be to independently<br />
represent ourselves that somebody proposing of himself that he should<br />
be the Prime Minster said ' oh no, by the way, I don't agree with that. I<br />
believe that our head of state should be the monarch of another country.'<br />
Can you believe that? That Is where he stands.<br />
Then, in that fiasco he walks out and then tries to say that any fall in<br />
interest rates will be politically motivated. The fall you see in interest rates<br />
to date over one percentage point on 10 year bonds came not from<br />
political motivation, but by the strength of a major economic change in the<br />
.-1J U . Z I O U I r </p>
<p>ID. Jun No. 017 P. O<br />
Budget. In other words, falls in interest rates In this country, whether they<br />
are ones we have had or any in the future, will come from the value of the<br />
public policy changes. Not by some manipulation of the Reserve Bank.<br />
These were empty charges which John Hewson used to make and that<br />
former Reserve Bank governor said that relations with the Government<br />
have been entirely proper, but he said you have got to be an insider to<br />
know that this was not always so. This was a reference to Mr Howard's<br />
period. So, what I would say to Australians is this: the Budget has eased the bond<br />
selling program by $ 15,000 million. That is one of the reasons why the<br />
long bond rate has fallen. It is one of the reasons why the fixed Interest<br />
rates have fallen and any falls in interest rates, whenever they occur, will<br />
come because of the soundness and quality of Government economic<br />
changes. Not by any political manipulation.<br />
J: Oo you think they will fall before the end of the year?<br />
PM: I am not here to predict interest rates.<br />
J: On the republican issue, what do you make of Ray Groom's move in<br />
Tasmania. Is he moving too soon?<br />
PM: I think it Is a refreshing change from the strait jacket which this<br />
obscurantist Mr Howard has placed In the Liberal party in and for a Liberal,<br />
in Mr Groom, to stand up and say that he believes it is inevitable that<br />
Australia should become a republic and that Tasmania will test this notion<br />
first In terms of the governorship, the replacement if you like, the<br />
relationship between Tasmania and the British Crown is something which,<br />
I think, is a position that the Liberal party in general should be taking. So, I<br />
certainty support Mr Groom on this.<br />
J; But is it reasonable for the State to go first?<br />
PM: The greater purpose will be served with the nation making such a change,<br />
but who are we to say and who am I to say ' oh no, Tasmanians have not<br />
got a right to express an opinion about it and make a decision, if you like,<br />
about'. They have and good on them.<br />
J: Mr Howard was down here two weeks ago and has promised a special<br />
package for Tasmania.<br />
PM: Yes, well do tell me, do tell me. He has promised a special package for<br />
Tasmania. Well, have a look at Tasmania under the hands of a Liberal<br />
government. the only employment growth in Tasmania has come from<br />
Federal Labor government programs. We have had this recovery on now<br />
for three years and the only growth in employment in Tasmania has come </p>
<p>6<br />
from Federal Labor government programs. In fact, the private employment<br />
base of the State has actually shrunk under a Liberal government in<br />
Tasmania. This morning I was at a Landcare project and discussing with<br />
some commonwealth officers in charge of Skillshare and some of the other<br />
labour market programs the importance of getting young people trained<br />
and into work. Could you Imagine Mr Howard gMng that any priority.<br />
These are the very programs he actually wants to cut. So, when he comes<br />
down here wandering around with his 1970s policies and his 1950s<br />
philosophy saying ' he will give Tasmania a package'. Say ' sure you will<br />
Johnny, sure you will'. Thank you.<br />
