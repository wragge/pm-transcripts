COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
RECEIPTS DUTY LEGISLATION<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 1 October 1970]<br />
Mr GORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
-by leave-As a preface to my statement<br />
on receipts duty legislation I point out to<br />
the House that I know of no dispute with<br />
any State Premier other than the Premier<br />
of Victoria on this question of payroll tax.<br />
Honourable members will recall that las,<br />
June legislation was introduced to impose a<br />
continuing Commonwealth receipts duty on<br />
business receipts. The Treasurer ( Mr Bury)<br />
explained that this was being done at the<br />
request of the States, and for their benefit,<br />
the purpose being to ensure that the States<br />
did not lose revenue as a consequence of<br />
the High Court decision which invalidated<br />
their own receipts duty legislation as it<br />
applied to certain types of receipt. The<br />
Treasurer also explained that the Commonwealth<br />
legislation would-again at the<br />
request of the States-apply retrospectively<br />
to 18th November 1969, the date on which<br />
the Commonwealth's agreement to introduce<br />
legislation for the benefit of the States<br />
was foreshadowed. Provision was made,<br />
however, for exemption from duty under<br />
the Commonwealth legislation, in respect<br />
of the period 18th November 1969 to a<br />
date to -be proclaimed as the end of a transitional<br />
period if duty, whether or not<br />
validly imposed, was paid under State<br />
legislation. 23116/ 70 The proposed legislation was approved by<br />
this House but failed to secure the approval<br />
of the Senate. Immediately after the resumption<br />
of the House following next<br />
week's recess, the legislation will be reintroduced<br />
in the House with inclusion of<br />
provisions under which the Commonwealth<br />
legislation will cease to apply to<br />
amounts received after 30th September<br />
1970. The overall effect of the new Commonwealth<br />
legislation will be that business<br />
receipts during the period from 18th<br />
November 1969 to 30th September 1970<br />
will be liable to duty under it at the rate<br />
of 0.1 per cent, but that this liability wil<br />
not arise if the provisions of State laws<br />
in this period-whether valid or invalidare<br />
complied with. One effect of this will be<br />
that, to the extent that receipts are specifically<br />
exempted or simply not dutiable under<br />
State law, they will not be dutiable under<br />
the Commonwealth law. Another effect will<br />
be that receipts which Queensland legislation<br />
has purported to make dutiable during<br />
this period will remain liable to duty at the<br />
lower rate of 0.02 per cent-provided of<br />
course, Queensland duty is in fact paid on<br />
the receipts or has already been paid.<br />
I add that, knowing of the Government's<br />
stated intention to proceed with Commonwealth<br />
legislation to impose, at the States' </p>
<p>request, a duty on business receipts, many<br />
businesses have continued to pay duty to<br />
the States even though the payment of an<br />
excise may have been involved. In 1969-70<br />
the States actually collected 85 per cent or<br />
more of the total amount they had estimated<br />
they would receive. The essential purposes<br />
of the new Commonwealth legislation will<br />
be to validate the collections already received<br />
by the States and, in the case of businesses<br />
that have refrained from paying receipts<br />
duty in respect of the period to be covered<br />
by the Commonwealth law, to require them<br />
to make such payments.<br />
The Government appreciates that the<br />
1970-71 budgets of the States have been<br />
framed on the assumption that the Commonwealth<br />
receipts duty legislation would<br />
have continuing operation and that the<br />
States would therefore receive the full benefit<br />
of the receipts duty revenue that would have<br />
been payable to them in 1970-71 if the Commonwealth<br />
legislation had continuing operation.<br />
The Government also appreciates that<br />
limiting the operation of the Commonwealth<br />
legislation to receipts up to 30th<br />
September 1970 will have a significant<br />
effect on State revenues for 1970-71 and that something will need to be done to protect<br />
the budgetary situation of the States.<br />
We propose that additional Commonwealth<br />
grants will be payable to the States in<br />
1970-71 so as to make good the reasonable<br />
losses of State revenue resulting<br />
from the termination of the Commonwealth<br />
receipts duty legislation on 30th September<br />
1970. As in the case of other arrangements<br />
for the payment of Commonwealth assistance<br />
grants to the States in 1970-71, our<br />
willingness to do this is on the basis that the<br />
arrangements resulting from the June 1970<br />
Premiers Conference will apply in their<br />
entirety. For the purpose of ascertaining such<br />
reasonable losses I am in touch with the<br />
Premiers with a view to arranging consultations<br />
between the Commonwealth and State<br />
governments as quickly as possible. We<br />
have in mind that at such consultations<br />
there will be discussed the question of the<br />
future of receipts duty in the non-excise<br />
area under State legislation against the<br />
background that the Commonwealth legislation<br />
will cease to apply to amounts received<br />
after 30th September 1970.<br />
