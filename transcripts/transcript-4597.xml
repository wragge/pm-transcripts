MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 16 DECEMBER 1977<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY PRIME MINISTER AND THE PREMIER OF VICTORIA<br />
HOSPITAL PINANCES<br />
We met today to discuss the situation of hospital finances in<br />
Victoria. We agreed that both Governments want a speedy and<br />
sensible solution to the financial problems facing Victorian<br />
hospitals. Officers will meet urgently to prepare a joint report to both<br />
Governments in January.<br />
We agreed that the following principles dhould guide their<br />
considerations: 1. The Commonwealth cmmaitment-to 50-50 sharing of<br />
agreed hospital costs stands firm and fixed.<br />
2. There-will -be no forced-re-ductions of services or<br />
S closures of wards as. a. result-of budgetary cuts,<br />
if these affected patient care. It is recognised<br />
that normal seasonal fluctuations may result in<br />
closure of wards and-reduction in demand for services,<br />
particularly at. this time of the year.<br />
S. 3. Hospital-expenditure is a-large-and increasing element<br />
in Commonwealth and State budgets and both governments<br />
accept the-need for firm cost containment in the<br />
hospital field.<br />
Both Governments will consider the Report as soon as it is<br />
available. </p>
