AUSTRALIAN SENATE<br />
CANBERRA. A C T<br />
2 June 1983<br />
Statement from Senator Susan Ryan, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on<br />
the Status of Women<br />
INTRODUCTION OF SEX DISCRIMINATION LEGISLATION<br />
The Sex Discrimination Bill was introduced into the Senate today by the<br />
Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women, Senator Susan Ryan.<br />
In introducing the Bill Senator Ryan said she was delighted to be able to<br />
move the introduction of a major piece of legislation on a matter which so<br />
deeply affects the rights of women and men.<br />
The Bill is designed to give effect to the provisions of the UN Convention<br />
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. The Government<br />
will ratify this Convention in the near future.<br />
Under the Bill discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status or pregnancy<br />
will be unlawful in the areas of employment, educat-ron, accommodation, the<br />
provision of goods, facilities and services, the disposal of land, the<br />
activities of clubs and the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs.<br />
The Bill will give people who experience discrimination in all these areas<br />
the opportunity of redress and it will be a significant deterrent for persons<br />
and organisations who indulge in discriminatory practices.<br />
The Bill will also prohibit sexual harassment in the workplace and in<br />
educational institutions so far as is possible.<br />
The Bill closely resembles the Sex Discrimination Bill 1981 introduced into<br />
the Senate by me as a private member's Bill. Following the introduction of<br />
that Bill extensive consultations were undertaken and the present Bill<br />
incorporates a number of very useful suggestions made during those consultations.<br />
Statistics on women's employment, unemployment, income levels and dependence<br />
on government social security benefits give clear evidence of deeply imbedded<br />
structural inequalities in our society. This Bill offers an opportunity to<br />
combat some of these inequalities and attempts to promote the recognition<br />
and acceptance within the community of the principle of equality between men<br />
and women.<br />
Commonwealth and State experience has shown that most di scrimi nation Occurs<br />
in the area of employment. In this regard the Bill makes unlawful discrimination<br />
against applicants for jobs and employees generally and also against persons<br />
who are commission agents or-contract workers.<br />
The Bill will afford protection throughout Australia as far as is<br />
constitutionally possible and will provide protection not only to the<br />
Commonwealth's own employees or applicants but to employees of other<br />
institutions such as trading or financial corporations.<br />
with regard to education, it will be unlawful for an educational authority to<br />
d 4 scrimiinate on the grounds of sex, marital status or pregnancy against a<br />
person applying for adm,, ission as a student or against a student. Single-sex<br />
educational insti tutions are exempted from the 1 eqisl ation. CO NTD) </p>
<p>Administationi of the Bill is vested in the Human Richts Coni;" ission. The<br />
functions of the Commission will include holding enauiries into and making<br />
deter-! i nations on, coi: plaints; hearing applications for exe'mptior. fron the<br />
Act; undertaking research and educational programs; and examination of<br />
existing and proposed legislation to ensure its consistency with the<br />
provisions of the Act.<br />
A major part of my earlier private member's Bill the part concerning<br />
affirmative action is not included in this Bill. The Government will<br />
issue a green paper setting out options for further legislation providing<br />
for the'introduction and implementation of affirmative action programs.<br />
It is clear that the benefits of affirmative action programs in employment<br />
are not widely understood and the Government recognises the need for employers,<br />
employees, unions, and the community generally to be better informed. The<br />
Government has therefore decided that it is more appropriate to generate<br />
public discussion and understanding of its proposals and to have wide<br />
ranging consultations in advance of the introduction of the legislation.<br />
The introduction of this Bill represents the initial step towards the<br />
fulfilment of the Government's major election commitment to women. The<br />
Bill will be debated early in the Budget Session. The Government hopes that<br />
further to the consultation that has already gone on with trade unions<br />
and employer and women's organisations, interested persons will use the time<br />
between now and the Budget sittings to examine the Bill carefully and to<br />
put forward constructive comments on it."<br />
