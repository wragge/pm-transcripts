I congratulate Ricky Ponting on being chosen to succeed Steve Waugh as the captain of the Australian Test Cricket team.</p>
<p>Ricky Ponting is a fine player whose great tactical understanding of the game will prove invaluable in his new challenge.  His batting ability has been a strong factor in the success of the Australian side in recent years.</p>
<p>All Australian cricket lovers will give him their support when he assumes the captaincy.</p>
