PRIM MUTAIAISTE<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELITVFRY EMBARGOED UJNTIL. DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF CHILDREN'S SERVICES COMMITTEE<br />
CANBERRA 15 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
First, let me welcome you and thank you for accepting my<br />
invitation to join Brian Howe, Neal Blewett and me here<br />
today. There are few more important social issues than that which<br />
brings us together for this meeting. We are here to talk<br />
about our children and the future they face as we enter the<br />
1990s. I know all Australian Governments share the Commonwealth's<br />
fundamental goal that our children should grow up in a<br />
socially, financially and emotionally secure environment.<br />
This is not simply a matter of natural concern for the next<br />
generation of Australians, though, of course, that would be<br />
motive and inspiration enough. Social justice for our<br />
children is also the best contribution we could possibly<br />
make towards a strong, compassionate, and productive<br />
Australia in the years to come.<br />
The goal, then, is not in dispute. And, together, we have<br />
the capacity to make the goal a reality.<br />
But vision and capacity are not enough. They must be<br />
focussed into well co-ordinated action.<br />
So far, this Government has put its major efforts into<br />
ensuring that low income families with children have an<br />
adequate, guaranteed, basic income. We have achieved this<br />
by raising all children's payments to a benchmark of<br />
adequacy and then indexing them. The introduction of the<br />
Family Allowance Supplement has enabled us to meet those<br />
benchmarks. Rent--assistanae -has-a-lso been substantially<br />
increased, and it too will be indexed from March next year.<br />
These initiatives have, as you know, have been warmly<br />
welcomed by distinguished workers in the field, such as<br />
Bishop Peter Hollingworth and the Institute of Family<br />
Studies. </p>
<p>These fundamental reforms have been complemented by the<br />
introduction of the Child Support Scheme itself an example<br />
of the States and the Commonwealth working together to<br />
improve the lot of Australian children. Thanks to our joint<br />
efforts we have gone from a situation where 70 per cent of<br />
non-custodial parents paid no maintenance to one in which<br />
per cent of Child Support Agency orders are complied with.<br />
Last April we introduced a $ 550 million family package that<br />
increased Family Allowance Supplement and Family Allowance<br />
payments enabling us to meet in full and indeed exceed, the<br />
benchmarks of adequacy we set ourselves in 1987. Moreover<br />
we have indexed these payments to ensure the benchmark<br />
payments are maintained over time.<br />
Our last Federal budget contained a $ 100m package to provide<br />
co-ordinated help to disadvantaged young people. This<br />
included: longer term accommodation; expanded labour<br />
market assistance; help in staying on at school; health<br />
services in high risk locations and improved access to<br />
information and services.<br />
The measure of our total commitment as a Commonwealth is<br />
that we now spend $ 3.5 billion on family payments compared<br />
to the $ 1.7 billion being paid in 1982-83. By any standards<br />
that is an unprecedented achievement.<br />
It's relevant, too, to consider improvement in the broader<br />
economy. Providing jobs attacks the greatest single source<br />
of poverty, so our creation of 1.6 million new jobs, and the<br />
opening up of these jobs to disadvantaged groups through<br />
schemes such as JET and NEWSTART, has greatly reduced the<br />
extent and impact of poverty and hardship in this country.<br />
Backing these measures is a whole range of services for<br />
children for which the Commonwealth has either sole<br />
responsibility or shared responsibility with the States.<br />
These services, which include income support, education,<br />
training and employment, health and housing, are documented<br />
in the yellow booklet which has been provided to you all.<br />
And it is clear that the States also put many resources into<br />
programs for children, both together with the Commonwealth<br />
and independently. I fully acknowledge your contribution<br />
a vital contribution under our Federal system. I'd like to<br />
thank you also for responding so thoroughly and promptly to<br />
our request for documentation on your programs. Your<br />
. response -is . yet -another--indicaticn-of our common sense of<br />
purpose and is, I hope, a portent of our fruitful cooperation<br />
on this issue in the future.<br />
This is not an issue that need divide the Commonwealth and<br />
the States and Territories. It is one which can and must<br />
transcend differences in the party political complexion of<br />
respective Governments. </p>
<p>The challenge for the future is to make sure that the<br />
services we are all providing for Australia's children are<br />
delivered to them in the most efficient and effective way<br />
possible. I have said on a number of occasions that our<br />
achievements to date are no justification for complacency,<br />
in what is a critical area one in which hardship still<br />
persists.<br />
What this means, in part, is making sure that children in<br />
need do not slip through the safety net that we jointly<br />
provide. Our services must reach the right people, at the<br />
right time, in the right place, and with the right back-up.<br />
I have commented before that anyone who visits the outer<br />
fringes of our larger cities or our provincial towns must<br />
confront and recognise the special problems caused by social<br />
isolation. It may be difficult to get to and from work, or to find<br />
adequate child care so parents can return to work, or to<br />
have a basic choice of schooling, or to ensure kids are<br />
cared for after school, or to get special services for drug<br />
dependency or alcoholism or marriage counselling or managing<br />
the family budget.<br />
These difficulties can put special pressure on families<br />
pressures with which some families simply can't cope.<br />
It's not a question of providing some specific new program<br />
to deal with a problem at crisis point.<br />
It's a matter of ensuring that families and children get the<br />
help they need before the crisis point before problems are<br />
too deeply entrenched.<br />
It's a matter of finding an approach that, as I have said,<br />
recognises the potential vulnerability of families<br />
throughout the life cycle marriage and the potential for<br />
breaking up; birth and child care; work and the possibility<br />
of injury or the threat of redundancy.<br />
It is the analysis and achievement of this large goal that<br />
is the task of this committee.<br />
Because a comprehensive approach must include the<br />
participation of all levels of government. Whether the help<br />
gets through to the children at risk in the most efficient<br />
-and-effective-manner-often-depends on people and<br />
organisations at the State level.<br />
And let's remember this fact. Understandably, families and<br />
children in need of counselling, health services, legal aid,<br />
emergency accommodation, child care, emergency financial<br />
assistance, or any other kind of help these families and<br />
children are unlikely to care which tier of government has<br />
the responsibility to provide such services. They expect us<br />
to work that out ourselves, and to work together. And they<br />
are right. </p>
<p>The real task is to do everything in our power to coordinate<br />
the delivery of those services; the division of<br />
responsibility behind the scenes should still present just<br />
one face to the family in need; and it should be a caring<br />
and efficient face.<br />
There is a growing feeling that together we've got the basic<br />
building blocks in position. It would be nothing short of a<br />
tragedy if we still failed some children because we did not<br />
take the time, effort and imagination to sit down together<br />
and co-ordinate the delivery of our considerable joint<br />
resources. It's not for me to foreshadow the detail of the work this<br />
committee has in front of it and I am not here today to<br />
announce new Commonwealth initiatives, although I do assure<br />
you that we are never going to be content just to sit pat;<br />
we will always have under review what we are doing and<br />
whether we can do it better or do more.<br />
This meeting today is not an end in itself, but the<br />
beginning of a process of hard but immensely practical and<br />
rewarding work. We've already made a good start in<br />
documenting what we do for children right now. I hope that<br />
your discussions today will identify areas of concern where<br />
our combined efforts can have an impact in the future.<br />
This committee is an important step towards a vital goal for<br />
all of us. Over the coming months I look forward to seeing<br />
the results of today's meeting and of future consultations.<br />
I am confident they will be worth the effort and pledge that<br />
my Government will attach high priority to considering your<br />
recommendations and to responding as positively as we can to<br />
them. I pledge my own continuing personal interest and<br />
involvement in the effort. </p>
