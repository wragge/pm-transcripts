    <content><![CDATA[<p>Itâs one hundred years since Australians and New Zealanders splashed out of the sea, right here.</p>
<p>So now we gather in the cold and dark before dawn; wondering what to say and how to honour those whose bones rest in the hills and the valleys above us, and whose spirit has moved our people for a century.</p>
<p>Year after year, we journey to whatâs now a peaceful coast to remember things that, normally, we might try to forget.</p>
<p>Year after year, from all over our country, from every walk of life, from every background, young and old make this pilgrimage.</p>
<p>We arenât here to mourn a defeat or to honour a success, although there was much to mourn and much to honour in this campaign.</p>
<p>We arenât here to acknowledge a legacy in this country, although Gallipoli shaped modern Turkey as much as it forged modern Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Few of us can recall the detail, but we have imbibed what matters most: that a generation of young Australians rallied to serve our country, when our country called, and they were faithful, even unto death.</p>
<p>Beginning here, on this spot and at this hour, 100 years ago, they fought; and all-too-often they died: for their mates, for our country, for their King and â ultimately â for the ideal that people and nations should be free.</p>
<p>The first Anzacs were tradesmen, clerks, labourers, farmers and professionals; they were from every conceivable occupation, from every rung in the ladder of society, and from every point under the Southern Cross.</p>
<p>Instead of landing here, they would have longed for the homes theyâd left behind, the times they might have shared with their families, the backyard sport they could have played with their mates.</p>
<p>But ordinary men did extraordinary things.</p>
<p>âThey lived with death and dined with diseaseâ because that was where their duty lay.</p>
<p>In volunteering to serve, they became more than soldiers; they became the founding heroes of modern Australia.</p>
<p>If they had not been emblematic of the nation we thought we were, Anzac Day would not have been commemorated from that time until this â in every part of our country, in every place where Australians gather, and in every military base where Australians serve.</p>
<p>If they were not still emblematic of the nation we think we are, none of us would be here.</p>
<p>But like every generation since, we are here on Gallipoli, because we believe that the Anzacs represented Australians at our best.</p>
<p>Itâs the perseverance of those who scaled the cliffs under a rain of fire.</p>
<p>Itâs the compassion of the nurses who attended to the thousands of wounded.</p>
<p>Itâs the conquest of fear, often through a larrikin sense of humour.</p>
<p>And itâs the greatest love anyone can have: the readiness to lay down your life for your friend.</p>
<p>Itâs this thatâs ennobled those Anzacs to all who have come after them: they faced the hardest possible test and they did not flinch.</p>
<p>The Gallipoli campaign was a failure, of course; the only really successful part was the evacuation.</p>
<p>But the survivors of Gallipoli and their reinforcements went on to become some of the worldâs finest soldiers.</p>
<p>The Australian and New Zealand mounted infantry spearheaded the British army that captured Jerusalem and Damascus.</p>
<p>In March 1918, it was the Australian army corps that held the last great German attack that had split the British from the French armies.</p>
<p>And it was Monash, the engineering genius and citizen soldier, the commander whoâd struggled at Gallipoli but succeeded in France, who pioneered the all-arms warfare that led to victory, by breaking the bloody stalemate on the Western Front.</p>
<p>Over the past century, the Anzacsâ descendants have honoured that tradition: in the Second World War, Korea, Malaya, Borneo, Vietnam, Iraq and â our longest war â Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Those serving on peacekeeping and relief missions have likewise kept faith with the original Anzacs.</p>
<p>Even now, our armed forces are serving in the Middle East and elsewhere, defending the values that we hold dear.</p>
<p>Today, all of us who have not been tested in war salute all of those who have.</p>
<p>Most of us have never worn our countryâs uniform.</p>
<p>We have not climbed the steep cliffs of Gallipoli.</p>
<p>We have not trudged through the snow of Bullecourt.Â </p>
<p>We have not struggled through the mud of Passchendaele.</p>
<p>We have not experienced the horrors of Hellfire Pass, or fought through the jungles of Kokoda or Vietnam, or shaken the Uruzgun sand from our clothes.</p>
<p>We have not risked being shot out of the skies over Germany or torpedoed in the Med or in the Pacific.</p>
<p>But we are the better for those who have.</p>
<p>Because they rose to their challenges, we believe that itâs a little easier for us to rise to ours.</p>
<p>Their example, we believe, helps us to be better than we would otherwise be.</p>
<p>Thatâs why weâre here: to acknowledge what they have done for us â and what they still do for us.</p>
<p>The official historian, Charles Bean, said of the original Anzacs: âtheir story rises as it will always rise, above the mists of ages, a monument to great hearted men; and, for their nation a possession foreverâ.</p>
<p>Yes, they are us; and when we strive enough for the right things, we can be more like them.</p>
<p>So much has changed in one hundred years but not the things that really matter.</p>
<p>Duty, selflessness, moral courage: always these remain the mark of a decent human being.</p>
<p>They did their duty; now, let us do ours.</p>
<p>They gave us an example; now, let us be worthy of it.</p>
<p>They were as good as they could be in their time; now, let us be as good as we can be in ours.</p>
