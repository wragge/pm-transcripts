Press Statement No. 197<br />
7 March 1974<br />
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY<br />
International Women' s Day will be observed tomorrow.<br />
It is an appropriate time for me to draw attention to the need<br />
for continued efforts to remove discrimination against women.<br />
It is a fundamental objective of the Government to ensure<br />
respect for civil liberties and human rights and for that reason<br />
the Government is committed to the promotion of ecsual rights<br />
for women. Since coming to office, the Government has removed<br />
discriminatory provisions against women employed in the Australian<br />
Public Service and has extended eligibility for social security<br />
benefits to many women formerly excluded on various discriminatory<br />
grounds. The appointment of an adviser on women's affairs to my staff<br />
also reflected the importance which the Government attaches to the<br />
improvement of the status of women in Australia.<br />
The Government is seeking the extension of the minimum<br />
wage to adult female employees in the National Wage Case presently<br />
before the Arbitration Commission.<br />
I welcome the United Nations decision to designate 1975 as<br />
International Women's Year in order to encourage equality of<br />
opportunity for women and improve their status throughout the world.<br />
The Government is preparing an official program for International<br />
Women's Year. I pay tribute to the work of women's groups throughout<br />
Australia in seeking to use * International Women's Day and International<br />
Women's Year to draw attention to the achievement of women and the<br />
need to raise their status of women in the community. / 2 </p>

The Government will ratify the International Covenant on<br />
Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on<br />
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as well as the U. N.<br />
Convention on the Political Rights of Women as soon as enabling<br />
legislation has been passed. Ratification of these legal<br />
instruments will be an important contribution to the enforcement<br />
of human rights in Australia, including the rights of women.<br />
Australia's ratification of the International Labour Organisation<br />
Convention III on Discrimination ( Employment and Occupation) in<br />
June 1973 highlighted the Government's adoption of a national<br />
policy to eliminate discrimination in employment and occupation.<br />
Committees have been established, in accordance with the Convention,<br />
to work for the ending of all such discrimination. A community<br />
education campaign will be launched soon to dramatize discriminatory<br />
attitudes and practices in Australia. This action, while seeking<br />
to ensure equality of opportunity in employment for d ll, wi-_]<br />
be of special significance to women in the workforce.<br />
