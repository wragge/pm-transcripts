    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Bob, and may I thank your company very warmly</p>
<p> for its sponsorship of this morning's breakfast. Can I acknowledge</p>
<p> the presence of the Premier of Queensland; the Deputy Premier, Joan</p>
<p> Sheldon; my many other State and Federal Parliamentary colleagues;</p>
<p> Tony Staley, the Federal President of the Liberal Party; Bob Carroll,</p>
<p> the Queensland President of the Liberal Party; many business observers</p>
<p> and participants; members of the diplomatic core and other guests.</p>
<p>I want to pick up a point that Bob made in his words of welcome. And</p>
<p> that is to stress the great importance my Government has placed, since</p>
<p> the day of its election, on the importance of continued communications</p>
<p> with the business community.</p>
<p>I made a very proud boast on the night of the election victory and</p>
<p> that very proud boast was that the Liberal Party was owned by no sectional</p>
<p> interest within the Australian community. The Liberal Party is a creature</p>
<p> of the Australian people and owes its allegiance to all of the Australian</p>
<p> people.</p>
<p>We are not owned by the business community. We're certainly not</p>
<p> owned by the trade union movement. And we're certainly not owned</p>
<p> by any elite, politically correct pressure group. What we are owned</p>
<p> by is a driving ambition to serve the interests of all of the Australian</p>
<p> people.</p>
<p>But having said that, can I emphasise that there are many points of</p>
<p> convergence and there are many areas of policy where the approach</p>
<p> of my Government, the philosophy of the Liberal Party and the philosophy</p>
<p> of the National Party is absolutely consonant with the goals and objectives</p>
<p> of all sections of the business community in Australia.</p>
<p>We agree not on all things but we agree on most things of overriding</p>
<p> importance to the economic future of Australia. And I've encouraged</p>
<p> all the members of my Ministry from day one to develop the closest</p>
<p> communication with the relevant sections of the business community</p>
<p> with which they interact. And I'm delighted that in so many of</p>
<p> those areas - and Bob touched on it this morning in his words of welcome</p>
<p> in the area of communications in which Richard Alston has done an</p>
<p> absolutely outstanding job in an area that's involved a great</p>
<p> deal of change and a great deal of development - that has been very</p>
<p> much to the fore.</p>
<p>I want to sketch a few thoughts with you this morning. I want to talk</p>
<p> about the goals we set ourselves just over two years ago when we came</p>
<p> into government, how we've gone in achieving those goals and</p>
<p> to state some of the goals for the Australian economy that I see ahead</p>
<p> over the next few years.</p>
<p>When we came to power in March of 1996, the biggest challenge we faced</p>
<p> was repairing the fiscal position of our Federal Budget. All political</p>
<p> rhetoric aside, the cold reality was that we were in the red to the</p>
<p> tune of $10.5 billion and that unless something were done about that</p>
<p> we wouldn't be able to do much else. Because if you're steadily</p>
<p> racking up debt, you're steadily going broke, your cash flow</p>
<p> is hesitant, whether you're running a business, you're running</p>
<p> a household or you're running a country, you really can't</p>
<p> do much by way of expansion unless you attend to that.</p>
<p>And we set about attending to it. We were criticised. We were criticised</p>
<p> by some of the economic writers, not by all of them. We were criticised</p>
<p> by the Labor Party. We were criticised by the pressure groups. We</p>
<p> were criticised by some of the media. And we were even criticised</p>
<p> by sections of the business community who said that we'd gone</p>
<p> too far and that really you needed a more moderate, a more modest</p>
<p> approach. And when I look back over that period of two years - and</p>
<p> I particularly set it against the impact of the Asian economic troubles</p>
<p> - I say every night to myself: thank heavens we took the action to</p>
<p> the degree we did, to the measure that we did, in the Budget of 1996.</p>
<p> Because if we had not got that budget deficit under control nothing</p>
<p> else would have been possible. If we had not got that budget deficit</p>
<p> under control we would not be grappling with the reality of some of</p>
<p> the Asian troubles affecting, in a very direct and profound way, Australia's</p>
<p> domestic economy.</p>
<p>Now, I don't pretend that we can argue that there won't</p>
<p> be any flow-through from what has occurred in Asia. But fundamentally</p>
<p> we have protected ourselves against the impact of that downturn because</p>
<p> of the action we took in 1996 in Peter Costello's first Budget.</p>
<p> And I say that defiantly, unqualifiedly, unapologetically and absolutely.</p>
<p> And it is the most important and enduring thing in the whole of the</p>
<p> economic debate in Australia at the present time.</p>
<p>It will cast the longest shadow of all in terms of the economic debate</p>
<p> over the next Federal election. Because our opponents will have to</p>
<p> argue to the business community of Australia. They'll have to</p>
<p> argue to the Australian people that somehow or other, having left</p>
<p> us with a legacy of a $10.5 billion deficit, having argued against</p>
<p> repairing it, having said every single measure we took virtually was</p>
<p> unfair or unnecessary and despite the impact of the Asian economic</p>
<p> troubles and despite having their own activities having already racked</p>
<p> up hundreds of millions, if not, billions of dollars of additional</p>
<p> spending promises, despite all of that and putting all of that together</p>
<p> they're still competent economic managers.</p>
<p>Now the reality is that all of those things can't be true. And</p>
<p> we have attended to what was the fundamental challenge and that was</p>
<p> to get the Budget in order. And it has given us a degree of domestic</p>
<p> stability and security that we haven't known for a long time.</p>
<p>And we do have the lowest inflation rate in the Western world. I know</p>
<p> it's an era of low inflation rates but ours is lower than anybody</p>
<p> else's and that's not a bad achievement. We do have the</p>
<p> lowest housing interest rates since the late 1960s. And we do have</p>
<p> business interest rates that are dramatically lower than what they</p>
<p> were two years ago. We still have a very strong level of private sector</p>
<p> business investment. Our economy is likely to grow this year at the</p>
<p> top of the rate achieved by the member countries of the G7. We have</p>
<p> made inroads into unemployment. We now have the lowest unemployment</p>
<p> rate at the moment that Australia's had for seven years. We would</p>
<p> like to go further because the human face of economic failure and</p>
<p> economic distress is always, of course, unemployment and it remains</p>
<p> a major social challenge for any government.</p>
<p>So our great and first economic goal was to get the Budget back in</p>
<p> order and we have done that and we have done that magnificently. And</p>
<p> it will be a very proud Treasurer who will be able to stand up on</p>
<p> the 13th of May and announce that after two years and after having</p>
<p> inherited a deficit of $10.5 billion, he can announce that the books</p>
<p> of the Commonwealth have been returned to an underlying surplus.</p>
<p>We also set ourselves another great goal. It was a goal that had been</p>
<p> dear to the hearts of many of us over a long period of time. It was</p>
<p> certainly dear to my heart and I know it was dear to Ian McLachlan's</p>
<p> heart because he'd had a few scraps along the way in the good</p>
<p> cause. And it was dear to Peter Reith's heart and it was dear</p>
<p> to Peter Costello's heart. That, of course, was the great historic</p>
<p> cause of industrial relations reform.</p>
<p>And once again we had our critics. And I think one or two of them</p>
<p> could even be found in the business community who said: oh, you've</p>
<p> whimped it out, you haven't gone far enough, you've only</p>
<p> scratched the surface, you've haven't touched the side,</p>
<p> you've just sort of fine-tuned it. Now, of course there were</p>
<p> a few changes made as the legislation passed through the Senate. But</p>
<p> the fundamental integrity of that reform package was maintained to</p>
<p> the very end. And you see the full fruits of just how far we have</p>
<p> gone in reforming the industrial relations system in Australia as</p>
<p> you see working out right at the moment this great historic, I believe,</p>
<p> exciting and defining change which is now occurring on the Australian</p>
<p> waterfront.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, the uncompetitive character of the Australian waterfront,</p>
<p> the bloody-minded attitude of the Australia wharfies is part of the</p>
<p> Australian folk law. There's that lovely story told about the</p>
<p> old lady at Charleville when we she was told that a cyclone was coming</p>
<p> and she better get ready for it and she said: don't worry dear,</p>
<p> the wharfies won't land it.</p>
<p>I mean, it's deeply embedded in the Australian psyche. It's</p>
<p> something that you learn virtually from the day you're born that</p>
<p> we've got inefficient wharves and, of course, it's true.</p>
<p> I won't bore you with too many statistics at breakfasts like</p>
<p> this but for containers, the crane rate across the Australian wharves</p>
<p> is 18 an hour, our Asian competitors it's 30 an hour.</p>
<p>I know a man in the Riverina district of New South Wales who runs</p>
<p> a stock feed business and he competes. He sells into Japan and he's</p>
<p> competing against an American company that exports off the West Coast</p>
<p> of the United States to Yokahama. He's very competitive on everything</p>
<p> except the cost of getting the product from Australia into Japan.</p>
<p> And his American competitor can do it at</p>
<p> 55 per cent - 55 per cent of the cost of what is involved in taking</p>
<p> it from Australia to Japan.</p>
<p>And what we did with that legislation was to change the legal monopoly</p>
<p> held by the Maritime Union of Australia. We made it possible for the</p>
<p> recruitment and use of non-union labour. We had no quarrel with members</p>
<p> of the trade union movement. We don't seek to smash any union.</p>
<p> But what we do seek to smash are union monopolies. They are wrong.</p>
<p> They are anti-productivity. They are against the interests of the</p>
<p> Australian community. They have destroyed jobs and they retarded and</p>
<p> deterred investment. And regional and rural Australia, the country</p>
<p> people of Australia, will benefit enormously from a reformed and more</p>
<p> productivity waterfront. I want to applaud and congratulate the courage</p>
<p> of the National Farmers' Federation of Australia for what they</p>
<p> have done.</p>
<p>But this is a defining change, it's a defining reform. It says</p>
<p> to the rest of the world that we are prepared to tackle those things</p>
<p> that have denied Australia's membership of the very top league</p>
<p> of the most productive and competitive nations in the world. Now,</p>
<p> I'm very proud that one of the great reforms that my Government</p>
<p> has introduced has been in the area of industrial relations.</p>
<p>And I want to record my gratitude to Rob Borbidge and to Joan Sheldon,</p>
<p> as the leaders of the Queensland National Liberal Party Government,</p>
<p> who have been absolutely uncompromising and absolutely and totally</p>
<p> supportive of all that we have done in this area. As people who represent</p>
<p> the most decentralised State in Australia, as people who lead a State</p>
<p> which is built very much on provincial cities and provincial towns,</p>
<p> they know the importance of that part of Australia - the importance</p>
<p> of that part of Australia of reform on the waterfront.</p>
<p>We also set ourselves a goal of reducing the costs of doing business</p>
<p> in Australia. That meant pressing ahead with micro-economic reform,</p>
<p> with competition policy. We honoured in full, as Bob acknowledged,</p>
<p> the promise we'd made abut the deregulation of the communications</p>
<p> industry in Australia. And many business surveys, as so many of you</p>
<p> here this morning know, will tell you that after rental costs, one</p>
<p> of the largest overheads of any average business in Australia is,</p>
<p> of course, the cost of communications. And the bonus for small business</p>
<p> out of a deregulated communication system is almost incalculable and</p>
<p> the way in which costs have dramatically fallen. No better illustrated,</p>
<p> I suppose, than something I read in The Economist a few months</p>
<p> ago that stuck in my mind. It said in 1930 it cost something like</p>
<p> $300 a minute to have a telephone call from London to New York. And</p>
<p> now, of course, it costs not more than a dollar or two. And it's</p>
<p> a dramatic illustration of how changes have occurred in that area.</p>
<p>We introduced specific reforms to help small business. We introduced</p>
<p> the capital gains tax rollover relief that means that now if you want</p>
<p> to sell your successful small business and rollover the proceeds of</p>
<p> the sale of that successful small business into the purchase of a</p>
<p> new one, you can do so without incurring any capital gains tax liability</p>
<p> up to the tune of $5 million. Now that represents the honouring of</p>
<p> an important promise that we made before the last election and it's</p>
<p> a huge benefit to small business.</p>
<p>We also promised that we would embark upon the largest privatisation</p>
<p> in Australia's history. And that, of course, was the sale of</p>
<p> one-third of Telstra. What a magnificent success on every front that</p>
<p> has been. And I want to congratulate John Fahey, the Minister for</p>
<p> Finance and the Minister in charge of privatisation, for the flawless</p>
<p> way in which he's handled the privatisation, not only of Telstra</p>
<p> but, indeed, of other assets that the Commonwealth has sold.</p>
<p>It has been a great success. And the thing that encapsulated more</p>
<p> than anything was the fact that 92 per cent, 92 per cent of the employees</p>
<p> of the company bought shares. I mean, they weren't too troubled</p>
<p> by the Labor Party's opposition. They weren't troubled by</p>
<p> the trade union movement's opposition. They liked the idea of</p>
<p> owning shares in the company that employed them. And that's a</p>
<p> magnificent idea, it's a magnificent ideal. And it's the</p>
<p> kind of thing that defines us and makes us different from our political</p>
<p> opponents and it's something that we'll always encourage.</p>
<p> Six hundred and two thousand Australians who've never owned shares</p>
<p> in their lives now own shares as a result of the Telstra float. It</p>
<p> was a booming, thumping, unqualified success which all of us as Liberals</p>
<p> can be proud.</p>
<p>On top of that, we've got $1.25 billion going towards the regeneration</p>
<p> of the Australian environment. And our opponents have got the nerve</p>
<p> to say: isn't it shocking that most of that money is going into</p>
<p> regional Australia. They're complaining about it going into fixing</p>
<p> the salination problems of the Murray Darling Basin. Well, it's</p>
<p> not surprising. You don't have salination problems in Killara</p>
<p> or Woollahra.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, of course the great environmental challenges</p>
<p> are to be found in the country areas of Australia and that's</p>
<p> why most of the money is going there. And if the Labor Party thinks</p>
<p> that's unfair they ought to set about trying to win a few rural</p>
<p> seats.</p>
<p>But we also set ourselves the task of further reforming the financial</p>
<p> sector. And Peter Costello said in the lead-up to the election that</p>
<p> we needed to do really a stocktake, an update of the Campbell Report</p>
<p> and we did that. And the Wallis Report was brought down and just about</p>
<p> every recommendation made by Wallis has been introduced including</p>
<p> measures that are going to bring far more competition to the Australian</p>
<p> financial system.</p>
<p>They are some of the goals that we set ourselves. And they are goals</p>
<p> that have been achieved on time, in full and in some areas, ahead</p>
<p> of schedule. And I'm very proud that in two short years we have</p>
<p> seen the greatest reform ever Australia's industrial relations</p>
<p> system. We have seen the most spectacular transformation of a budget</p>
<p> deficit towards a budget surplus. We have seen major reforms for small</p>
<p> business. We've seen a hugely successful programme of privatisation.</p>
<p> And in the process we have created a situation where this country</p>
<p> has bought itself protection and insurance against the ill-effects</p>
<p> of the Asian economic downturn.</p>
<p>But that is what we have achieved to date and any dynamic political</p>
<p> party never rests on achievements. It always looks to the future and</p>
<p> sets itself some more goals. And the goals that I have for my Government</p>
<p> over the next few years in the economic area will, of course, be dominated</p>
<p> by the great cause of taxation reform. It is the great area of unresolved</p>
<p> economic business on the Australian national agenda.</p>
<p>We have no hope of realising the full potential of this country in</p>
<p> the Asian-Pacific region as we move into the 21st Century unless we</p>
<p> have the guts to take on the challenge of taxation reform. It is difficult,</p>
<p> it is challenging. There'll be no shortage of people who say</p>
<p> it's too hard and there'll be no shortage of fear campaign</p>
<p> from the Australian Labor Party.</p>
<p>We are prepared to have a go. We are prepared to have a go because</p>
<p> we believe the present taxation system is fundamentally unfair. We</p>
<p> believe the present taxation system is imposing unnecessary burdens</p>
<p> on the Australian business community. We believe that the present</p>
<p> taxation system is out of date. We believe that the present taxation</p>
<p> system breeds resentment and envy because many Australians in the</p>
<p> middle feel that they are carrying all the burden. And a taxation</p>
<p> system that falls into public disrepute and into public contempt is</p>
<p> a taxation system that cries aloud for reform.</p>
<p>Now, I've been up a few hills and in a few valleys so far as</p>
<p> taxation reform is concerned. And as I look around the room there</p>
<p> are a few other people who are in that category. But the experience</p>
<p> of battle gives you knowledge for your future encounters and for future</p>
<p> combat. I've learnt the bit about the failures in the past on</p>
<p> both sides of politics. But there's nobody who takes the future</p>
<p> of our country seriously that in their most honest, private moments</p>
<p> can seriously suggest that we can go on indefinitely with the present</p>
<p> taxation system. It does need reform and we are prepared to embrace</p>
<p> that reform. And it will be historic and significant beyond the experience</p>
<p> of any other economic reform that has been undertaken in the time</p>
<p> that I've been active in politics.</p>
<p>We will need the support and the understanding of the business community</p>
<p> of Australia. I welcome very much the cooperation that has already</p>
<p> occurred. The constant contact between representatives of the business</p>
<p> community and my Government over the last few months - I want that</p>
<p> to go on. At the end of the day we will produce a plan that is fair,</p>
<p> that will encourage competition that business will find will encourage</p>
<p> investment, the Australian public will embrace as being fair and reasonable.</p>
<p> And it is a very, very important cause and it is one that I encourage</p>
<p> you very, very strongly to support.</p>
<p>We must, of course, press ahead with the process of fiscal consolidation.</p>
<p> Having done the hard yards and made the gains we have no intention</p>
<p> of dissipating them in profligate and unnecessary government spending.</p>
<p> But that doesn't mean that there isn't a social bonus out</p>
<p> of fiscal restraint. I made that observation yesterday when I announced</p>
<p> the contribution of $65 million out of the Federation Fund towards</p>
<p> the light rail proposal. The visionary concept of Rob Borbidge and</p>
<p> Joan Sheldon that was announced in November of last year here in Brisbane.</p>
<p> There is a social bonus if you get your economic house in order. And</p>
<p> that social bonus will be directed in areas of greatest return and</p>
<p> areas of greatest need.</p>
<p>But I have one or two other goals that I would like to see realised</p>
<p> as we move into the next century. One of those goals is to see Australia</p>
<p> become the second great financial centre of the Asia-Pacific region</p>
<p> after Tokyo. I believe that more and more people will see Australia,</p>
<p> the cities of Australia, the financial centres of Australia, as being</p>
<p> the place to locate their regional headquarters, as being the major</p>
<p> financial area after Tokyo.</p>
<p>We have an almost irresistible combination of attractions. We have</p>
<p> a strong economy. We have a stable political system. We have a benign</p>
<p> and friendly environment. We have a coherent legal system readily</p>
<p> understood. We speak the English language. And we have a banking system</p>
<p> which is sound and stable, prudentially regulated and regarded throughout</p>
<p> the world as being of high integrity. Now, you can't get a better</p>
<p> combination. You can't get a better brace of attractive conditions</p>
<p> for a financial centre than that. And one of the things to which I</p>
<p> commit my Government into the next century is to build Australia as</p>
<p> a great financial centre for the region. And there is no reason in</p>
<p> the world why by the year 2010 there can't be four great financial</p>
<p> centres of the world: there can't be London and New York and</p>
<p> Tokyo and Australia. And I'll leave it to the competitive spirit</p>
<p> of the financial community of Australia to decide which city will</p>
<p> be the financial capital of Australia.</p>
<p>Who am I to spoil a nice breakfast by saying anything about that.</p>
<p> Good luck to all of them. And that's one of the great advantages</p>
<p> of the Australian federation, you can have a bit of competition. Queensland,</p>
<p> incidentally, led the way in many areas of taxation reform. If it</p>
<p> hadn't been for Queensland we would never have, I think, as early</p>
<p> in the piece, we would never have abolished probate and succession</p>
<p> duties. So Queensland has an enviable record in setting the pace in</p>
<p> some of these areas. And they never let us forget and good luck to</p>
<p> them.</p>
<p>But, ladies and gentlemen, they are the goals, some of the goals that</p>
<p> my Government has. And I speak to you this morning with a mixture</p>
<p> of emotions, all very positive. I speak to you with the emotion of</p>
<p> pride that in two years we have done great things for the Australian</p>
<p> economy. We have given it a low inflation, low interest rate, high</p>
<p> investment environment. We have protected it against the worst effects</p>
<p> of the Asian economic troubles.</p>
<p>We have had some spectacular successes against all odds. Robert Hill's</p>
<p> triumph at Kyoto at the end of last year in relation to greenhouse</p>
<p> gases is one of them. We have given, through the industry policy statement</p>
<p> I delivered on the 8th of December last year and to which John Moore</p>
<p> made such a magnificent contribution, we have given a greater sense</p>
<p> of direction and a greater sense of certainty to the business community</p>
<p> of Australia. We have made some intelligently pragmatic decisions</p>
<p> in the industry policy area. This country has a very low tariff regime</p>
<p> by comparison with the rest of the world. And the decisions that we</p>
<p> took in the motor vehicle industry and the textile, clothing and footwear</p>
<p> industries are decisions that I will defend and support anywhere in</p>
<p> this country. Because they are decisions that have already returned</p>
<p> a lot in relation to the investment that has been made in those industries.</p>
<p>But that is what we have achieved in the past and I'm very proud</p>
<p> of all of those things. I'm very grateful that I have such a</p>
<p> strong team of economic Ministers. They are an outstanding group of</p>
<p> people. All of them for what they have achieved. Peter Costello has</p>
<p> done a superb job as the Treasurer of this country. I know how hard</p>
<p> that job is. I had it for a long time. It's a lousy job on occasions.</p>
<p> And he's done it very well and I thank him for it. And I thank</p>
<p> John Fahey, the Finance Minister, who supported him so well. And I've</p>
<p> spoken of the contribution that Peter Reith and Richard Alston and</p>
<p> others have made to our economic goals.</p>
<p>So I'm grateful as well as proud. But most important of all,</p>
<p> I'm excited about what lies ahead. In politics you keep renewing   </p>
