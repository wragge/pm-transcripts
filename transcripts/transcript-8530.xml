PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF A JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRIME<br />
MINISTER THE HON P J KEATING MP, THE HON RALPH WILLIS MIP,<br />
MINISTER FOR FINANCE, AND SEN THE HON BOB COLLINS MP,<br />
MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS, CANBERRA 2<br />
JUNE 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: My colleagues and I are here to announce a little<br />
bit of history. It's always Labor that makes the<br />
history and it's making it again.<br />
The Government has approved the sale of Australian<br />
Airlines to Qantas. It's also endorsed the sale of<br />
100 per cent of a combined airline subject to<br />
approval by the Australian Labor Party. These<br />
decisions were taken by the Cabinet last night and<br />
agreed to by the Caucus this morning.<br />
The main factors bearing upon the decision are that<br />
the Government believed that selling the two<br />
airlines separately, after we'd moved from<br />
expression of interests to indicative bids, that<br />
there was not substantial recompense to the<br />
Commonwealth in selling Australian Airlines alone or<br />
selling 49 one hundredths of Qantas alone, and that<br />
the benefits to each company of joining them making<br />
Qantas a more complete carrier with a domestic and<br />
international base substantially revalued, up-valued<br />
the value of the merge entity.<br />
So what will happen now a sale agreement will be<br />
signed tomorrow between Qantas and the Government<br />
under which Qantas will pay $ 400 million to the<br />
Government for 100 per cent of Australia Airlines,<br />
and then subject to the processes of the Australian<br />
Labor Party the Government will then propose to sell<br />
100 per cent of Qantas by a trade sale and a public<br />
float, retaining a golden share for the national<br />
safeguards which we think are appropriate for the<br />
dominant national carrier.<br />
As well as that, the Government will be establishing<br />
an independent Tribunal by legislation, which we </p>
<p>will introduce shortly, to allocate routes to the<br />
other domestic carrier Qantas. it would have been<br />
in terms of the ' One Nation' statement to the two<br />
domestic carriers Australian and Ansett, did I say<br />
Qantas I meant Ansett. As now the international<br />
routes associated wi-th Australian will be those of<br />
Qantas. Ansett or any other domestic carrier may<br />
apply to the Tribunal for international routes, and<br />
we would require as part of the legislation of the<br />
Tribunal the task of building a competitive<br />
international market for aviation from Australia.<br />
So that would see a second international carrier<br />
established and based in Melbourne.<br />
In all the Government is breaking down another<br />
micro-economic reform barrier to give Australians<br />
cheaper seats, better service, a better<br />
international airlines system, adequate financial<br />
compensation to the Commonwealth and the important<br />
and substantial recapitalisation of<br />
Qantas/ Australian of a very large sum and should<br />
return to the Budget over $ 1 billion.<br />
Again I make this point to you. Whether it be in<br />
the waterfront, in telecommunications, in road<br />
transport, in rail, in aviation, the only party that<br />
has made the micro-economic changes is the<br />
Australian Labor Party this Government.<br />
The last Government, the Government Dr Hewson<br />
advised, signed the two airline agreement in<br />
indecent haste, three weeks before the 1983<br />
election. We had to rely on this Government to<br />
deregulate that system in the late 1980s to now be<br />
able to put us in a position to produce a mature<br />
airline structure for Australia. So not only did<br />
the Coalition not take the moves to make the airline<br />
system better, it actually positively obstructed it<br />
by signing again, after the writs had been issued<br />
for an election, a two airline agreement. So I put<br />
to you, those of you who tend to write us off every<br />
three weeks because we haven't done hand stands,<br />
triple somersaults with pike, broken down fifteen<br />
other micro-economic barriers which no other<br />
Government did in 50 years, that again only this<br />
Government is changing Australia, only this<br />
Government knows how, and only this Government has<br />
got the courage to do it.<br />
J: Prime Minister, how quickly do you expect the Labor<br />
Party to respond to this fait accompli that you've<br />
presented them with?<br />
PM: It's not a fait accompli, but we are using the due<br />
processes of Caucus Committee, Cabinet, Caucus and<br />
then Party considerations and I'll be taking the<br />
issues up with the National Secretary forthwith. </p>
<p>3: Should there be another special party conference<br />
like there was last year?<br />
PM: Well that's a matter for judgement for us. Can I<br />
just say that any questions you'd like to put to<br />
Ralph who has overseen the assets sales process now<br />
for some time and Bob, who while just now Minister<br />
for Transport and Communications, was Minister for<br />
Aviation for some time and-has been wrestling with<br />
these issues for some time, both of them of course<br />
being entirely material to bringing this matter to a<br />
head.<br />
J: Mr Keating will the funds from this sale be<br />
earmarked in any special way, I think there was a<br />
resolution to that affect, wasn't there, at the 1990<br />
conference?<br />
PM: No, they are not earmarked, but again it would<br />
obviously give the Government more budget<br />
flexibilities than it would otherwise have?<br />
J: Is that billion dollar figure the net figure?<br />
PM: That would be net. Would you chaps like to say<br />
anything?<br />
RW: Just on recapitalisation, the billion dollars plus,<br />
which is referred to in the press statement, is<br />
after recapitalisation of the airlines. So in other<br />
words, that's all to us that the new owners will be<br />
in charge of the recapitalisation of the airlines,<br />
that's all cost to us.<br />
3: Didn't you have a figure written into the forward<br />
estimates already for an estimated sale, price for<br />
the airlines?<br />
RW: No, we had some figures in this year's budget, $ 500<br />
million for assets sales which included the<br />
airlines. That's obviously slipped. Now the amount<br />
that will be in the Budget for next year from asset<br />
sales will obviously be much higher.<br />
J: Isn't this in reality making a virtue of necessity<br />
that the asset sale program can become bogged down,<br />
frozen and this is really a text book case of how<br />
not to privatise. You've been changing policy I<br />
think 4 times now since you started this process.<br />
This is the sort of the inevitable conclusion of a<br />
lot of confusion.<br />
PM: The Sydney Morning Herald can always put the most<br />
negative connotation on the most positive outcome.<br />
If you didn't fly the flag Tom, ( Burton), of the<br />
sell of professional narks, I'd be disappointed in<br />
you. But could I just make the point that we have<br />
through this sought to see which is the best way we </p>
<p>could get flexibility in policy and at the same time<br />
maximise values. Now we've had these expressions of<br />
interests, you've got to ask people what they think<br />
they'll pay, not what some adviser thinks but what<br />
they'll actually write a cheque for, and then see<br />
what options are available to you. The main thing<br />
is getting the mail through, getting the job done.<br />
This is a substantial and large micro-economic<br />
change. In national political terms it beats the<br />
hell out of frightening old ladies, which is what Dr<br />
Hewson is about with his pamphlets.<br />
3: Prime Minister, it will carry through into-pay<br />
television as well?<br />
PM: We considered that last night, we are going to<br />
consider it again in the Caucus processes over the<br />
next day or so and then take it to the Caucus<br />
probably tomorrow.<br />
J: Are there any changes re some of the other areas<br />
such as foreign ownership, such as local content?<br />
PM: You'll hear about all those at the right moment.<br />
3: What's your assessment of the Caucus' view this<br />
morning Mr Keating, of selling 100 per cent of the<br />
merged entity?<br />
PM: The Labor Party has got a great attachment to the<br />
various Government Business Enterprises it has, but<br />
it also has a mature view about their long run<br />
benefits. Long run benefits for-Australia, and the<br />
long run benefits of them being properly set up.<br />
Qantas has been an undercapitalised business for a<br />
long time it's got 90 per cent debt and 10 per<br />
cent equity. This simple notion that people feel a<br />
warm inner glow about it, but give it no money is<br />
not doing it justice. And if we sit around the<br />
Cabinet table I think Ralph would bear this out<br />
because he and I have sat through all of the Budget<br />
rounds bar one for me over the years but if we<br />
said to any of them look social policy takes second<br />
place to a Qantas recapitalisation, there wouldn't<br />
be one element of the Caucus support it. Now there<br />
may be people fairly dewy-eyed, getting dewy-eyed<br />
about Qantas, everyone who is in that predicament<br />
had there cheque books shut as far as the Government<br />
was concerned, and Qantas they thought could live on<br />
implicit guarantees and debt. And in the end equity<br />
doesn't attract an interest rate and debt does, and<br />
in the lean times you've got to pay the interest<br />
rate.<br />
J: Will the name Qantas be retained?<br />
BC: Yes, by way of the golden share and Tom. Can I just<br />
say this about those policy changes. It's </p>
<p>absolutely true that there have been policy changes<br />
and you would have to acknowledge that every single<br />
one of those policy changes has enhanced the<br />
aviation environment, there is no question about<br />
that, and the tourist industry. And I have to say<br />
I'm personally delighted with Caucus support this<br />
morning for this latest one because it is going to<br />
further enhance the environment for the travelling<br />
public. I mean, these changes have been painful,<br />
there is no question about that. They've been<br />
difficult to make and a lot of people have felt the<br />
pain from it. They haven't been made for the<br />
benefit of the airlines, they've been made for the<br />
benefit of the national economy and the national<br />
good. Now I might also add this stands in very stark<br />
contrast, and I invite you to have a look at it, at<br />
what's been proposed by the Opposition in what has<br />
now become the most important export earner this<br />
country has got that's tourism, $ 7 billion a year.<br />
We've just provided a number of policy changes that<br />
have substantially improved the results that that<br />
industry is going to get. By contrast, " Fightback"<br />
have proposed an outrageous policy, and it is<br />
outrageous, where they are going to provide<br />
extremely valuable rights for a whole mass of<br />
international carriers with no reciprocal rights<br />
being negotiated for Australian carriers under the<br />
guise of this so-called open skies policy. Now this<br />
Is an outrageous aviation policy when you consider<br />
the value of these assets and how every aviation<br />
nation on this earth negotiates in this part of<br />
bilateral arrangements, but on top of that if that's<br />
not enough to kill of f our aviation industry,<br />
they're going to stick a 15 per cent GST tax on the<br />
best export earner the country's currently got, the<br />
only export industry that is not exempt from this<br />
tax. Now that's a great way for encouraging<br />
Australians to take their holidays overseas and<br />
providing a disincentive for people to come here.<br />
J: The view though you've ridden over party's own<br />
policy how do you explain that to traditional<br />
Labor voters?<br />
PM: No, that's not right. This Government doesn't usurp<br />
the prerogatives of the Labor Party. Now if you go<br />
in my case, when I needed to change the policy in<br />
relation to foreign banks I went to a Labor Party<br />
conference. When we needed to change the policy in<br />
relation to telecommunications we went to a Labor<br />
Party conference, to its procedures, to its<br />
Executive, to its forums. This will be the case<br />
now.<br />
J: Given that fact, Prime Minister, when do you expect<br />
to this process to be complete? </p>
<p>PM: Well early enough for the sales process to complete<br />
so as to tabulate and collate the proceeds into the<br />
figuring for the 1992-93 Budget.<br />
RW: So the trade sale which has been in place for some<br />
time will go on to the end of this year, it should<br />
be completed by the end of this year for the 49 per<br />
cent, or some part of that 49 per cent, by the end<br />
of this calendar year, and then there will be a<br />
float in the first half of next year of the 51 per<br />
cent, which is not in the trade sale and any part of<br />
the equity in the trade sale, which isn't sold as<br />
part of the trade sale.<br />
J: The next step, Mr Keating, that you go to the<br />
National Executive and determine whether you can bypass<br />
a special conference or you need a special<br />
conference, is that how you now proceed?<br />
PM: We'll open discussions with the National Secretary<br />
and the National Executive.<br />
J: Will the proceeds from this sale be used to reduce<br />
the Budget deficit Mr Keating, or to fund additional<br />
spending?<br />
PM: You're asking me is it to be devoted. We couldn't<br />
say now what the Cabinet's spending priorities will<br />
be. Whatever the proceeds are they will diminish<br />
the budget deficit in the final analysis by that<br />
figure. That's not to say though that the proceeds<br />
themselves, if one were to look at the actual block<br />
of funds, would be devoted exclusively to lowering<br />
the budget deficit, they may not.<br />
J: Mr Keating what would you say to members of the<br />
public who think this Government had a $ 2 1/ 2<br />
billion deficit blow-out a few weeks ago? Now we<br />
have got all this sudden urgency to sell-off the<br />
airlines.<br />
PM: Well, I would say that if they had followed the<br />
debate and the process from the last National<br />
Conference of the Labor Party in late 1990, they<br />
would know that this process has been running at<br />
least since then.<br />
3: But why the sudden urgency? You were talking 70 per<br />
cent on Sunday.<br />
PM: Well the sudden urgency is that the expressions of<br />
interest period has ceased, the indicative bids have<br />
been lodged, the Government has now got to make a<br />
decision about moving to the next stage which is a<br />
due diligence on the part of the bidders of the<br />
assets in question, and then for binding bids to be </p>
<p>made. I mean, the urgency is the process which is<br />
now at that point.<br />
J: But why did you have 70 per cent on Sunday?<br />
PM: Well that was an option, 70 or 100.<br />
J: Why didn't you annunciate the 100 on Sunday?<br />
PM: I did. I said 70 or maybe more, 100.<br />
J: What's a golden share, and how does it work?<br />
BC: It's a standard provision that's found around the<br />
world in a whole different number of aviation<br />
environments. It is well understood by the business<br />
community now, I mean Malaysian Airlines, Singapore<br />
Airlines, KLN, a whole range of airlines have been<br />
sold. Fundamentally it is a contractual condition<br />
which is placed on the sale by the Government with<br />
whatever conditions attached to it, the Government<br />
determines appropriate to preserve the national<br />
interest provisions. But at the same time, not so<br />
onerous as to depress the price.<br />
J: On the Paye TV issue, are you prepared to stick to<br />
the 45 per cent proposal<br />
PM: Well we have considered this matter last night and<br />
we will consider it today and tomorrow, and I think<br />
then is the appropriate time for me to speak about<br />
that.<br />
3: Senator Collins won't the State of Qantas' business<br />
value be subsumed by the international interests<br />
within the trade sale?<br />
BC: Well that's not possible because for a start, in<br />
terms of foreign interest, we are constrained not<br />
simply by our own rules, but by the I. C. A. O. rules,<br />
as you know, which means that an absolute maximum of<br />
per cent of the airline can be owned by foreign<br />
interest, otherwise it loses its designation as an<br />
Australian national carrier. And by process of a<br />
trade sale, and a public float, I think that<br />
ultimately the lion's share of the airline, in fact,<br />
is going to rest with the public.<br />
PM: Before you continue, we have got question time on at<br />
so we have only got time for a few more.<br />
3: Won't then Qantas lose some routes?<br />
BC: No, in fact, under the proposals that are ancillary<br />
to this, in terms of the Aviation Tribunal<br />
legislation, which Caucus I might add approved this<br />
morning, and it will be introduced into the Senate<br />
this week. All of Qantas' existing entitlements are </p>
<p>protected, arnd of course they are public assets, arnd<br />
as you know those entitlements are very valuable<br />
assets, as the way it should be. So Qantas doesn't<br />
stand to lose anything by this deal, it in fact<br />
stands to gain considerably.<br />
J: What measures have been put in place to create a<br />
competitive market? You indicated you wanted to try<br />
and grow..<br />
BC: Yes, those matters are layed out very thoroughly and<br />
Tom ( Burton) I am happy to show them to you later,<br />
they are contained in some detail in the<br />
Government's policy statement which is enforceable<br />
under the provisions of legislation. They are the<br />
things that the Tribunal has to have regard to in<br />
making decisions, and it is a pro-competitive set of<br />
criterium that are being used.<br />
J: How can you be sure fares will be cheaper, if you<br />
talk about domestic and international? Can you put<br />
any sort of figure on it?<br />
BC: Well I personally haven't even raised the question<br />
of cheaper airf ares.<br />
3: The Prime Minister has.<br />
BC: Well it will inevitably have the same result, you<br />
can never put a figure on it, that's determined by<br />
the market. And in fact, it was interesting<br />
watching in the early hours of this-morning, the<br />
Chief Executive of American Airlines talking about<br />
the situation that does exist in the deregulated<br />
market where he said that the whole market is<br />
basically hostage to any irresponsible operator. I<br />
mean, these are the down-sides of a deregulated<br />
market, but the up-sides are enormous. And if you<br />
doubt that just have a look at the tourist figures<br />
in what has been a booming market in the face of an<br />
otherwise flat economy. There have been enormous<br />
benefits from domestic deregulation, the same<br />
benefits are going to be delivered by opening up the<br />
international area. But I will just make the<br />
obvious point, that is already a highly competitive<br />
market of course, we are talking about additional<br />
Australian carriers in what is already a very<br />
competitive international market.<br />
J: And the second international carrier will have to be<br />
based in Melbourne?<br />
PM: No, but if it's Ansett it is based in Melbourne, and<br />
Sydney Airport is of only limited size and the<br />
Qantas Jet Base is there, and its headquarters are<br />
there, and it simply couldn't stand physically<br />
another major carrier as a base. </p>
<p>BC: I might also add while this has been going on we<br />
have of course been advancing negotiations with the<br />
New Zealander's. The New Zealand Minister for<br />
Transport was over here last week for a second round<br />
of negotiations. Those discussions are proceeding<br />
very positively and both Governments are confident<br />
we will be making a joint statement in the near<br />
future about that.<br />
J: What's more likely to be the second international<br />
carrier, Ansett or Air New Zealand?<br />
BC: That is why we are establishing a Tribunal, which<br />
will be a publicly accountable process. So that it<br />
won't be the Government picking winners in this<br />
sense, it will be a process which is open and<br />
accountable.<br />
PM: Thank you. </p>
