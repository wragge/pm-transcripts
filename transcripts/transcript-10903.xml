<p>Thank you, thank you very much. To Peter Costello, thank you for</p>
<p>   that very warm welcome. To Tony Staley; to Tim Fischer, the Deputy</p>
<p>   Prime Minister of Australia; State Premiers; Chief Ministers; my</p>
<p>   Cabinet and Ministerial colleagues; other Parliamentary colleagues;</p>
<p>   ladies and gentlemen. It is an enormous privilege to be with you</p>
<p>   this morning to deliver this National Convention address, to reflect</p>
<p>   upon the heritage and the values of our great party, to record the</p>
<p>   achievements of the past two years and to outline our goals for</p>
<p>   the years ahead into the 21st Century.</p>
<p>Above all, the Liberal Party is a party that belongs to all Australians.</p>
<p>   When I accepted the mandate of the Australian people on that exhilarating</p>
<p>   night of the second of March 1996, that none in this room will ever</p>
<p>   forget, I said the proudest thing about being the Prime Minister-elect</p>
<p>   of Australia was that I led a party that was owned by no one section</p>
<p>   of the Australian community, that it was a party for all Australians.</p>
<p>   It wasn't owned by the business community. It wasn't owned</p>
<p>   by the noisy elites. It wasn't owned by political correctness.</p>
<p>   It certainly wasn't owned by the trade union movement. It was</p>
<p>   owned by the ordinary men and women of Australia and I remain immensely</p>
<p>   proud that we have demonstrated that in Government.</p>
<p>We are a party with a great history but an even greater future.</p>
<p>   We remember the great inheritance of Sir Robert Menzies, our founder,</p>
<p>   remember those long, uninterrupted years of social and economic</p>
<p>   stability after 1949 when we had an unemployment rate that was the</p>
<p>   envy of the rest of the world, when we welcomed in their millions</p>
<p>   the peoples of Europe and the Middle East, whether they came like</p>
<p>   Alex Somlyay's parents from </p>
<p>Budapest or whether they came from Italy or from Greece or from</p>
<p>   the Baltic States or from Poland or Czechoslovakia. We welcomed</p>
<p>   them in their millions and they have all become, every last one</p>
<p>   of them, wonderful Australians and we thank them and we respect</p>
<p>   them for the contribution they have made to our great nation.</p>
<p>We also remember the inheritance from Menzies of great social reform.</p>
<p>   We remember the trail-blazing reforms of the Fraser Government.</p>
<p>   We remember the fact that it was the Holt Government and not the</p>
<p>   Whitlam Government that ended the inequity of the white Australia</p>
<p>   policy. We remember the family allowance changes brought in by Malcolm</p>
<p>   Fraser, and of course we also remember the 13 barren years under</p>
<p>   Hawke and Keating. </p>
<p>Our Party has always been rooted very firmly in principles. We</p>
<p>   believe, above all, in the supremacy and the sovereignty of the</p>
<p>   individual. We believe that the family unit is the bedrock of our</p>
<p>   society. We believe in the work ethic. We believe in rewarding hard</p>
<p>   work and achievement. We believe in the principle of mutual obligation.</p>
<p>   Those in the community who are down on their luck are entitled to</p>
<p>   our assistance and our compassion but we as a community are entitled</p>
<p>   to ask in return where it is reasonable that people who receive</p>
<p>   Govenrment help give something back to the community. That is the</p>
<p>   principle of mutual obligation and that is the principle that is</p>
<p>   enshrined in our Work for the Dole policy which has the overwhelming</p>
<p>   support of the Australian community.</p>
<p>We are a party that believes passionately in the place and the</p>
<p>   role of small business in our society. I have often spoken very</p>
<p>   feelingly and proudly about my own background as the son of a garage</p>
<p>   proprietor in the inner suburbs of Sydney. I have never forgotten</p>
<p>   the upbringing I received. I have never forgotten what I was taught</p>
<p>   about the value of starting with nothing and building something</p>
<p>   by the dint of your own effort and your own achievement and I long</p>
<p>   for an Australia where every man and woman who wants to do that</p>
<p>   can do it without hindrance or without interruption.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, we are also, above all a party that believes</p>
<p>   in tolerance and racial equality. We have welcomed people from the</p>
<p>   four corners of the earth. We have welcomed people of different</p>
<p>   religions and of different colour and of different ethnic backgrounds.</p>
<p>   We admire and we respect them all and they are all equal and entitled</p>
<p>   members of the great Australian family.</p>
<p>Peter Costello in his introduction spoke of the achievements that</p>
<p>   we have marked up since our election in March of 1996. We have achieved</p>
<p>   an historic turnaround in the economic fortunes of Australia. Whatever</p>
<p>   they may say to the contrary, nothing can conceal the fact that</p>
<p>   Paul Keating and Kim Beazley left to the incoming Coalition Government</p>
<p>   a huge deficit of $10.5 billion and in two short years we have turned</p>
<p>   that around so that we have in prospect the announcement in May</p>
<p>   of this year when Peter Costello delivers his third budget that</p>
<p>   this country will once again be in the black. We will once again</p>
<p>   be a country that is paying its way and that is a huge historic</p>
<p>   achievement in just over two years.</p>
<p>We took many decisions in our first budget and our second budget</p>
<p>   that people didn't agree with. There were some complaints,</p>
<p>   even outcries, but let me say, I don't apologise for any of</p>
<p>   the decisions that we took because, without question, if we had</p>
<p>   not set about getting the books in order, the economic troubles</p>
<p>   that had swept through the Asia-Pacific region would have gone close</p>
<p>   to engulfing and undermining the Australian economy. If we had taken</p>
<p>   the Beazley advice, if we had simply been swallowed up in the Beazley</p>
<p>   inheritance of debt and deficit we would not have been able to fireproof</p>
<p>   the Australian economy against the worst ravages of the economic</p>
<p>   downturn in Asia. It will remain forever to the credit of my Govenrment</p>
<p>   that it was prepared to take the tough economic decisions that have</p>
<p>   brought Australia protection and insurance against the worst effects</p>
<p>   of what has happened in Asia and I remain immensely proud of that</p>
<p>   and I will defy any of my critics on that because every single thing</p>
<p>   we did to get our economic house in order has meant protected living</p>
<p>   standards for the Australian people. </p>
<p>It has meant that the potential economic dislocation that has swept</p>
<p>   through Indonesia and Malaysia and Thailand and Korea is something</p>
<p>   that will never come to Australia and it was my Government with</p>
<p>   my Treasurer and my Deputy Prime Minister and my Cabinet colleagues</p>
<p>   and my Parliamentary Party that had the courage and the foresight</p>
<p>   to do that and we should always be immensely proud of that achievement.</p>
<p>We have delivered in the process a major social bonus. We have</p>
<p>   not only kept those great promises we took to the last election,</p>
<p>   the family tax initiative, the health insurance rebate, the relief</p>
<p>   for small business, the relief for self-funded retirees but our</p>
<p>   interest rate reductions, which are worth $300 a month to the average</p>
<p>   home buyer in Australia. Now that, my friends, is the equivalent</p>
<p>   of a wage rise of $100 a week to the average wage and salary earner</p>
<p>   in Australia. Let me say that again. The equivalent of $100 a week</p>
<p>   increase in the average wage of the ordinary worker in Australia.</p>
<p>All of that has been achieved in the face of fierce opposition</p>
<p>   from the Labor Party because every measure that we took to reduce</p>
<p>   the deficit and thereby make it possible for interest rates to fall</p>
<p>   was opposed by the Australian Labor Party, and what is more, if</p>
<p>   they get back into office, those interest rate cuts will disappear</p>
<p>   because they will once again lapse into deficit and debt and once</p>
<p>   again interest rates will go up and nothing could be more certain</p>
<p>   than if Labor were to win the next election, that $100 a week wage</p>
<p>   rise that is the benefit of our economic policies will disappear</p>
<p>   very quickly. </p>
<p>Of course, ladies and gentlemen, one of the other great achievements</p>
<p>   of my Government is that we have fundamentally changed the character</p>
<p>   of industrial relations in this country. We are now watching the</p>
<p>   unfolding of one of those great defining moments in the economic</p>
<p>   and industrial history of a nation. What is now occurring on the</p>
<p>   Australian waterfront is a defining moment in Australia's industrial</p>
<p>   relations history. It will benchmark for all time the attitudes</p>
<p>   of the Liberal Party and the National Party on one hand and the</p>
<p>   attitude of the Labor Party and their mates in the trade union movement</p>
<p>   on the other hand. What we have done is not to smash a trade union.</p>
<p>   We have no desire to smash a trade union and we have no desire to</p>
<p>   smash trade unionism. What we have done </p>
<p>by our legislative changes is to smash for all time the trade union</p>
<p>   monopoly on the Australian waterfront. </p>
<p>Let me say again that I applaud the courage and the leadership</p>
<p>   and the guts and determination of the National Farmers' Federation.</p>
<p>   They are taking advantage of the legal changes that we made. It</p>
<p>   needed a Liberal Government to make the changes. It needed a Liberal</p>
<p>   Government to break the monopoly. It needed a Liberal/National Party</p>
<p>   Government to give the National Farmers' Federation the opportunity</p>
<p>   and the incentive to do what it is now doing and I notice on one</p>
<p>   of those programmes this morning that Mr Beazley has said that if</p>
<p>   he wins the next election you know what he's going to do about</p>
<p>   the waterfront? He's going to have a meeting. Going to have</p>
<p>   a meeting. That's not the half of it. He's going to have</p>
<p>   a meeting at which Bob Hawke is the ringmaster. I mean, he's</p>
<p>   going to have a meeting on native title. I mean, the last time the</p>
<p>   Labor Party had a meeting on native title it produced the wretched,</p>
<p>   unworkable Native Title Act that we are trying to fix up. So heaven</p>
<p>   preserve us from another meeting under Labor Party leadership on</p>
<p>   the native title. </p>
<p>No doubt, he will have a meeting also on taxation reform. I predict</p>
<p>   now that the Beazley policy on taxation reform, when it is finally</p>
<p>   revealed will involve having a meeting. The mind really boggles</p>
<p>   when you think about a meeting about the waterfront. The last time</p>
<p>   a Labor Prime Minister had a meeting on the waterfront it cost you</p>
<p>   and me and the rest of the Australian taxpayers $420 million and</p>
<p>   there was zilch improvement in productivity. So bad was it that</p>
<p>   some of the people then made redundant about six or seven years</p>
<p>   ago are still working on the waterfront. It's a bit like some</p>
<p>   kind of long-running Labor soapie. Perhaps there will be some cameo</p>
<p>   appearances from Laurie Brereton and Paul Keating as well.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, our reforms have not been limited to repairing</p>
<p>   the budget deficit or, indeed, for getting rid of debt. But our</p>
<p>   reforms have also included the creation of </p>
<p>100 000 new apprenticeships in the last 12 months. We've delivered</p>
<p>   the lowest unemployment rate for seven years. We have introduced</p>
<p>   a Work for the Dole scheme. We have demanded new standards of literacy</p>
<p>   and numeracy throughout Australia. We have reduced rorting and welfare</p>
<p>   cheating to the tune of $28 million a week and that </p>
<p>$28 million a week is redirected to the most needy people within</p>
<p>   the Australian community. And we have also correctly rebalanced</p>
<p>   the direction of Australian foreign policy. We have recognised that</p>
<p>   Australia occupies a unique intersection of history, geography,</p>
<p>   culture and economic circumstances. </p>
<p>We are the only nation in the world that is a projection of western</p>
<p>   civilisation in this part of the world with profound and enduring</p>
<p>   links, not only with Britain and Europe but also with North America,</p>
<p>   and we have replaced the obsessive Asia-only policies of the Keating</p>
<p>   Government with the more balanced and mature Asia-first approach</p>
<p>   of my Government. Instead of us appearing as we sometimes did as</p>
<p>   an anxious outsider wanting admission to the Asian club under the</p>
<p>   Keating Government, we are now seen as a proud participant, a respected</p>
<p>   regional mate, a country that is prepared to help our </p>
<p>Asian friends in their hour of need and along with Japan, Australia</p>
<p>   is the only country that has contributed to the economy bailouts</p>
<p>   of Indonesia, Korea and Thailand and I am very proud of those decisions</p>
<p>   because they are in Australia's interests. They will guarantee</p>
<p>   Australian jobs. They will guarantee Australian exports. They will</p>
<p>   protect Australian firms' future in those particular countries.</p>
<p>But they are some of the things that we have achieved. But politics</p>
<p>   is never static. It is never something that involves looking back</p>
<p>   in retrospect all the time. It is something that involves being</p>
<p>   proud of your past and your heritage and what you believe in and</p>
<p>   what you stand for. But you must always throw to the future. And</p>
<p>   ahead of us lies the great piece of unfinished economic business</p>
<p>   in Australia and that is to fundamentally overhaul and reform the</p>
<p>   Australian taxation system. We have a taxation system in this country</p>
<p>   which is increasingly seen as unfair and inequitable and that is</p>
<p>   why we want to change it.</p>
<p>We want to give to the ordinary Australian wage and salary earner</p>
<p>   in the 21st Century a fairer and more equitable Australian taxation</p>
<p>   system. We want to end the evasion and the rorting at both ends</p>
<p>   of the spectrum. We want to reform the business taxation system.</p>
<p>   We want to make our firms more competitive as a result in world</p>
<p>   markets. We want to address some of the problems of Commonwealth/State</p>
<p>   financial relations and we certainly want to respect the overall</p>
<p>   need for fairness and equity.</p>
<p>Now this is not an easy task and I don't pretend that we won't</p>
<p>   be opposed and bitterly attacked, not only by the Labor Party but</p>
<p>   by other groups in the community. But I say to you my friends, what</p>
<p>   is the point of holding the reins of national office, what is the</p>
<p>   point of having a mandate from the Australian people, what is the</p>
<p>   point of being in Government? It is not being there just to enjoy</p>
<p>   what is involved in some kind of sense of prestige or importance.</p>
<p>   What is really important about being in Government is to do good</p>
<p>   things for the people of Australia and doing good things for the</p>
<p>   people of Australia involves tackling the problems identified by</p>
<p>   the people of Australia. And deep down, all Australians know that</p>
<p>   our present taxation system is unfair, is crumbling and is in need</p>
<p>   of root-and-branch reform.</p>
<p>The Labor Party knows that. They knew it back in the mid 1980s</p>
<p>   when Keating tried his Option C. They knew it in 93 but for</p>
<p>   sheer political opportunism, they lied their way through the election</p>
<p>   campaign. And then to rub insult into injury, they did, in Dawkin's</p>
<p>   1993 budget, in the greatest piece of political betrayal I have</p>
<p>   seen in my 24 years in politics, they did the very thing that they</p>
<p>   attacked us for allegedly wanting to do. And we all remember the</p>
<p>   scandal of the dishonoured L-A-W tax cuts. We all remember the huge</p>
<p>   increases in sales tax. </p>
<p>And my message to the Australian people is, that whatever anybody</p>
<p>   says about taxation, always remember that whatever Labor says about</p>
<p>   taxation in an election campaign, it will do the direct opposite</p>
<p>   when it gets into government. And that ought to be remembered by</p>
<p>   all Australians.</p>
<p> So taxation reform is one of our great goals and it's</p>
<p>   a goal that will need the support of everybody in this room and</p>
<p>   all our friends and supporters throughout the nation if it to be</p>
<p>   realised. And another great goal is to fix the deplorable native</p>
<p>   title inheritance that we received from the Keating-Beazley government.</p>
<p>The Native Title Act of 1993 has delivered very little justice</p>
<p>   to Australia's indigenous people. It has been a bitter disappointment</p>
<p>   for them. And it has, in addition, delivered extraordinary delays,</p>
<p>   extraordinary degrees of cumbersome regulation and extraordinary</p>
<p>   doubt so far as the mining and pastoral industries of Australia</p>
<p>   are concerned. </p>
<p>My critics say I that I should sit down and have yet another meeting</p>
<p>   in relation to my 10 Point Plan and in relation to the legislation</p>
<p>   that is now in the Parliament again. Can I say to you, ladies and</p>
<p>   gentlemen, I've had no less than 15 to 20 meetings over the</p>
<p>   last 12 months with the major stakeholders. I began meeting on the</p>
<p>   native title issue with the Premiers and Chief Ministers of Australia</p>
<p>   at Kirribilli in January of last year. I then met the indigenous</p>
<p>   leaders, the leaders of the mining industry and the pastoral industry.</p>
<p>   We have already compromised. We have already made concessions. We</p>
<p>   have already protected the fundamental rights of the indigenous</p>
<p>   people of Australia.</p>
<p>The Native Title Amendment Bill now before the Australian Parliament</p>
<p>   is a fair and balanced compromise representing the interests and</p>
<p>   respecting the interests of all of the Australian people involved</p>
<p>   in this very, very difficult issue. And the proposition that we</p>
<p>   should compromise further is a call to surrender. It is not a call</p>
<p>   to compromise. I mean, what is being asked for amongst other things</p>
<p>   is to say, in relation to pastoral leases, that we will give to</p>
<p>   one section of the Australian community a right to negotiate that</p>
<p>   we will not give to another section of the Australian community.</p>
<p>The right to negotiate was never intended for pastoral leases.</p>
<p>   It was put there in an extraordinary late night meeting - once again</p>
<p>   these meetings under Labor governments - an extraordinary late night</p>
<p>   meeting that represented a compromise in the negotiations that were</p>
<p>   then going on. It is a right unknown to the common law of Australia.</p>
<p>   It is not a right enjoyed by any other section of the Australian</p>
<p>   community. </p>
<p>I simply want to say to all of you and to the Australian Senate</p>
<p>   and to all the members of the Australian Senate: the Australian</p>
<p>   people are sick and tired of this issue. They want to put it behind</p>
<p>   them. They want us to get on with our future and they expect you</p>
<p>   to do your constitutional duty and pass that legislation without</p>
<p>   delay.</p>
<p>We have many others goals for the future. Those goals include,</p>
<p>   of course, continuing the assault on the still too high levels of</p>
<p>   youth unemployment. They include continuing to protect the budget</p>
<p>   surplus that I believe we can deliver in May of this year. They</p>
<p>   also include, as I said yesterday, the opportunity of making Australia</p>
<p>   the second great financial centre in the Asian-Pacific region after</p>
<p>   Tokyo. So that as we move into the 21st Century we'll have</p>
<p>   four great financial centres in the world - London, New York, Tokyo</p>
<p>   and Australia. We have the climate. We have the legal system. We</p>
<p>   have the political </p>
<p>stability. We have the prudential banking system. We have the respected</p>
<p>   money market systems to deliver that goal. And I believe it's</p>
<p>   one of the many opportunities that are there to be grabbed hold</p>
<p>   of by the Government of this country and by the Government of the</p>
<p>   States of Australia.</p>
<p>But there is another great goal that I have for the future. And</p>
<p>   just as Robert Menzies made Australia the greatest home-owning democracy</p>
<p>   in the Western world, so it is my goal that my Government will make</p>
<p>   Australia the greatest share-owning democracy in the world.</p>
<p>Already we have sold one-third of Telstra and we're along</p>
<p>   the way towards that goal. Ladies and gentlemen, we can and should</p>
<p>   go further. And I therefore announce today that we have made a firm</p>
<p>   policy decision, that if re-elected we will proceed to allow the</p>
<p>   people of Australia, the men and women of Australia, to buy the</p>
<p>   remaining two-thirds of Telstra.</p>
<p>This is how we will do it. We will not wait until after the election</p>
<p>   to introduce the legislation. We will introduce the legislation</p>
<p>   to give effect to this goal into this session of Parliament. The</p>
<p>   proclamation date of the legislation will be a date not earlier</p>
<p>   than the return of the writs after the next Federal election. So</p>
<p>   that in accordance with the undertaking I gave to the Australian</p>
<p>   people before the last election, the Australian people will have</p>
<p>   an opportunity at the next election to decide whether or not they</p>
<p>   agree with our policy. If they throw us out, then presumably the</p>
<p>   legislation won't be proclaimed by the Labor Party. Did I hear</p>
<p>   somebody say, Commonwealth Bank.'</p>
<p>But they re-elect us, as I believe they will, we can then proceed,</p>
<p>   without lead or hindrance, to allow the men and women of Australia</p>
<p>   to buy into this great Australian company. And let me remind you</p>
<p>   that in the first float of one-third 92 per cent - 92 per cent of</p>
<p>   the employees of Telstra bought shares in that company. Six hundred</p>
<p>   and two thousand Australians bought shares for the first time in</p>
<p>   their lives. And I know that out there, there are men and women</p>
<p>   who will applaud this decision. Because they will see it as an opportunity</p>
<p>   to buy shares in a great Australian company. And I can't think</p>
<p>   of a better way of enhancing Australian ownership than to let Australians</p>
<p>   buy something. I mean, this notion that in some kind of indirect,</p>
<p>   surrogate way the Government is best placed to own something on</p>
<p>   your behalf - it's never worked in practice and that's</p>
<p>   not surprising.</p>
<p>This particular decision will enable us to retire about 40 per</p>
<p>   cent - let me say that again - about 40 per cent of the Federal</p>
<p>   Government debt left to us by Paul Keating and Kim Beazley. </p>
<p>As was the case of the first one-third, the overwhelming bulk of</p>
<p>   the proceeds will, of course, be used to reduce our debt. But we</p>
<p>   will reserve the right, as we did in relation to the first one-third,</p>
<p>   to provide a specific social bonus out of the capital proceeds of</p>
<p>   the sale of the remaining two-thirds.</p>
<p>Good economic policies, sound and prudent fiscal management always</p>
<p>   return a good and useful social bonus. And that has been the case</p>
<p>   with our interest rate policies and our budget policies, so it is</p>
<p>   the case in relation to our privatisation policies. And John Fahey</p>
<p>   and Richard Alston will be, this morning, releasing a joint press</p>
<p>   statement detailing some of the other aspects of that particular</p>
<p>   announcement.</p>
<p>But, ladies and gentlemen, they are but some of the achievements</p>
<p>   and some of the goals for the future. That is what we have done.</p>
<p>   That is what we believe in. And that is some of what we will do</p>
<p>   in the future. And what is the alternative? The alternative is a</p>
<p>   negative party that has lurched back in the area of industrial relations</p>
<p>   to the 1950s and the 1960s. The alternative is a Labor Party that</p>
<p>   refuses to admit it was wrong.</p>
<p>As William Hague said on Friday, one of the first things that I</p>
<p>   said to him when I met him in London last year after he'd been</p>
<p>   elected Leader of the Conservative Party, was that he had to demonstrate</p>
<p>   to the British people that he changed. In other words, it was a</p>
<p>   different party from the party that had been thrown out. But the</p>
<p>   only thing that has changed about the Australian Labor Party is</p>
<p>   that they no longer have Paul Keating as their leader.</p>
<p>Their policies have not changed. In many respects, they have got</p>
<p>   worse. They are more interventionist, they are more profligate,</p>
<p>   they are more irresponsible than what they were in government. They</p>
<p>   would revisit the scene of every political and economic crime they</p>
<p>   committed in their 13 years if the Australian people were to re-elect</p>
<p>   them. They would drag us back to deficit and debt. They would send</p>

<p>   have said it. They are totally opposed to our industrial relations</p>
<p>   reforms. They even want to go back to the 1950s and reinforce the</p>
<p>   full rigour of the award system. There'd be no NFF at Webb</p>
<p>   Dock under a Labor government. John Coombs would become the plutocrat</p>
<p>   of the Australian industrial relations scene if the Labor Party</p>
<p>   were elected. </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, Labor in government again would be an immense</p>
<p>   risk. The Australian people threw them out after 13 years because</p>
<p>   they were fed-up with their approach. Their Hobart Conference demonstrated</p>
<p>   that they had done no serious policy work in Opposition. They have</p>
<p>   not developed new ideas. They have opposed for the sake of opposing.</p>
<p>   They have been negative in the extreme and they offer no hope, no</p>
<p>   inspiration, no leadership and no alternatives to the</p>
