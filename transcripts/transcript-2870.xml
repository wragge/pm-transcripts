THE PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
TUESDAY, 27 MARCH, 1973<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Ladles and gentlemen, because it was<br />
anticipated that the statement on political terrorism would<br />
be made in the two Houses at the ordinary time at which I give<br />
this Press Conference on Tuesday I'd arranged with you to give<br />
the Press Conference at 3.30 p. m. There was a procedural<br />
change in the Senate and so I've therefore waited until<br />
the statement was concluded in the Senate before coming down<br />
here. Nevertheless, this will probably have to be fairly<br />
brief because I've made other engagements on the basis that<br />
I'd be seeing you all at 3.30 p. m. and I've put off everything<br />
as long as I can, but I have got other commitments.<br />
There will be a few statements, some of them I think<br />
already given to you, about visits that I'll be making<br />
overseas. You probably know that I'll be visiting Apia<br />
for the South Pacific Forum I think that's already been<br />
announced hasn't it in the week before Easter all the<br />
Commonwealth countries. Then over Easter, I'll be visiting<br />
England. There will be a press release given to you within<br />
the next few minutes. It might even come while we are still<br />
here. The essence of it the chief points in it are that<br />
I'm to stay at Windsor on Good Friday night. It's the Queen's<br />
birthday the following day, and I'm seeing Mr Heath on the<br />
Tuesday and there will be other appointments made in that week<br />
after Easter.<br />
Then I mentioned to you earlier that I was hoping to be<br />
able to accept Mrs. Ghandi's invitation to visit India. We've<br />
pursued those arrangements and I'll be making the visit from the<br />
4-7 June. There is a statement which Foreign Affairs has put<br />
in your boxes already. I think I mentioned to you previously<br />
that this is the first time that an Australian Prime Minister<br />
has visited India since 1959, so it's certainly long overdue.<br />
Perhaps I might add that it will be the seventh occasion that<br />
I have been there in that time.<br />
I'd like to point out that in visiting Indonesia and now<br />
India1. I'm not overlooking the ASEAN countries to which we<br />
continue to attach the greatest importance. Tun Dr. Ismail,<br />
the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia has just made a very<br />
welcome visit to Australia and New Zealand. The Foreign Minister<br />
of Singapore and the Foreign Minister of the Philippines are<br />
also expected to visit Australia this year. I'm hoping to<br />
visit the ASEAN countries as soon as I can but, because of<br />
other arrangements of which you are already aware, it will<br />
be impossible to do so this year. Those are the things I<br />
wanted to mention: the South Pacific Forum, England and<br />
India. </p>
<p>When you go to Windsor, ill you discuss the future<br />
Governor-Generalship?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I saw it as a suggestion but I wasn't<br />
expecting to.<br />
Is it likely you will?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think so. I think any speculation<br />
on the Governor-Generalship is quite premature.<br />
Will you be taking a short list with you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. But it's quite premature to discuss<br />
the question of the next Governor-General.<br />
Would you as Prime Minister and leader of the country<br />
make a general comment on the statement that has just been made<br />
to Parliament by Senator Murphy and do you believe that there is<br />
a case to answer for the previous Government or Opposition, Sir.<br />
And in particular the Attorney-General, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Certainly it's a case to answer as I'm sure<br />
you will have noticed from the statement, but I don't think<br />
since both Houses will be discussing this matter I expect<br />
they'll be debating it not only today but possibly on other<br />
days I don't want to duplicate what will be said in<br />
Parliament maybe by me among others.<br />
When will legislation come in, Sir, to deal with ASIO<br />
the reforming or re-organising?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There was no mention in the statement about<br />
legislation on ASIO.<br />
No, but you said there would be Changes in the legislation<br />
in the law?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think it was referring to legislation which<br />
in fact was recommended to the previous Government to give<br />
Commonwealth law enforcement agencies the Police, for instanceauthority<br />
to investigate crimes under Commonwealth legislation.<br />
As you realise, the Commonwealth Police can only investigate<br />
crimes under Commonwealth legislation, and there are some<br />
particular crimes for which the Commonwealth could legislate<br />
and I expect there will be recommendations to Cabinet-on this<br />
as there were to the former Government.<br />
Was there any recommendation made today in Cabinet on this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
Were there any Cabinet decisions or referrals today, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The only matter discussed by Cabinet today<br />
was the statement that Senator Murphy has just made and which<br />
Mr Enderby will be making later. </p>
<p>Prime Minister, there has been a lot of speculation<br />
as to why the Attorney-General found it necessary to go to<br />
the ASIO headquarters in the fashion in which he did<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Now I said I will not duplicate ' anything...<br />
He made no mention of this, Sir. It was singularly<br />
absent from his speech...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I was asked questions about this in the<br />
House of Representatives today. There may easily be questions<br />
asked again on this matter. I don't propose to duplicate<br />
anything that can arise in the Parliament. This Press<br />
conference is not a substitute for the Parliament.<br />
If I could ask you about something, Sir, which you<br />
yourself said last Wednesday when you spoke before Mr Bijedic,<br />
the Yugoslav Prime Minister, you spoke of the possibility of<br />
the reorganisation of the Australian Security and Intelligence<br />
Services.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
Now did that mean ASIO, or did that mean what it<br />
literally said: that our security services and our intelligence<br />
services encompassing JIO and ASIS and other services?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I had in mind ASIO and the Commonwealth Police.<br />
Sir, on quite a different subject...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: By the way I was asked about OMEGA. Mr Jones<br />
has it in mind we didn't reach it today to recommend that<br />
we refer to the Joint Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and<br />
Defence which I'm told by Mr Bowen, who has the conduct of the<br />
matter on behalf of the Opposition, will not be opposed by the<br />
Opposition. We have it in mind to recommend that that Committee<br />
should inquire into and report upon any Foreign Affairs or<br />
Defence aspects of OMEGA.<br />
That Committee is not formed yet?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. But it will probably come up tomorrow<br />
tomorrow night. Mr Bowen asked that it come on tomorrow<br />
night. We've agreed. I asked whether he would be opposing it.<br />
He said he wouldn't.<br />
Mr Whitlam, has your Party chosen its membership?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. But we probably will tomorrow knowing<br />
that it will not be opposed.<br />
Sir, on another subject, in one of his more recent<br />
statements on Foreign Affairs, Dr Cairns, the Minister for<br />
Overseas Trade and Secondary Industry said that Australia would<br />
be represented in any fleet of ships which sailed into the<br />
French testing zone, and that he felt Australia should supply<br />
a tanker for such a fleet of ships. As Minister for Foreign<br />
Affairs, do you think Australia will be represented, or should<br />
send a tanker? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: I've not decided. The Government hasn't<br />
decided. I don't propose to make any statements on contingencies<br />
until after we know the result of the negotiations the<br />
ministerial discussions which will take place in Paris just<br />
before or just after Easter, and contingent on those discussions,<br />
proceedings in the Court.<br />
Although the next set of tests might well have taken<br />
place before the<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't believe they will.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, as you are going to Britain at Easter<br />
time, it won't be very hard to fly across to Paris. Will you<br />
do so?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'd love to, but I don't think I can....<br />
I don't think it's likely.<br />
Well the French Government is quite anxious to welcome<br />
you, Sir.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That's very nice.<br />
We got the cable this morning, Sir.<br />
Sir, on the question of the tests, are we to understand<br />
that the Government's not planning any direct action other<br />
than discussions and the I. C. J. case?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm not going to say anything more on this<br />
subject. I do this on a full consideration of the legal<br />
implications of anything that I say on occasions like this.<br />
I can assure you I will not be making any comment on this<br />
subject until after we know the result of the discussions in<br />
Paris or proceedings in the Court.<br />
Will you be going to Washington in the near future, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'll be in North America in August. It's<br />
very likely I'll be going to Washington and/ or New York.<br />
Would you be visiting the President in Washington, Sir?<br />
Do you have an invitation there?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well one would expect one would, but there<br />
have been no arrangements no approaches. </p>
