FOR PRESS: P. M. No. ! 9/ 1969<br />
" THANK YOU" FROM VICTCRIA<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton, has rpceive69<br />
the following letter from the Premier of Victoria, Sir Hen<br />
" I would be glad if you would convey to<br />
your colleagues the gratitude and appreciation felt by<br />
the people of Victoria, the government, and myself,<br />
for the wonderful co-operation and assistance given<br />
by Commonwealth authorities in the rail accident<br />
involving the Southern Aurora on the 7th February.<br />
In particular I would like to mention<br />
the prompt co-operation given by the Department of<br />
Civil Aviation, the Army, the Commonwealth<br />
Railways, and the Postmaster -General's Department.<br />
All of these contributed very materially to the<br />
successful operations which, I believe, prevented<br />
the disaster from becoming far worse than it was."<br />
