    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Government is preparing to contribute to an international coalition to counter the ISIL terrorist threat.</p>
<p>The Australian Defence Force will prepare and deploy to the United Arab Emirates up to eight Royal Australian Air Force F/A18 combat aircraft; an E-7A Wedgetail Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft; and a KC-30A Multi-Role Tanker and Transport aircraft.</p>
<p>In addition, the Australian Defence Force will prepare a Special Operations Task Group as military advisers that could assist Iraqi and other security forces that are taking the fight to the ISIL terrorists.</p>
<p>Australia will place Australian Defence Force personnel in the United States Headquarters to ensure close coordination with our alliance partner and to support planning and logistics.</p>
<p>We are not deploying combat troops but contributing to international efforts to prevent the humanitarian crisis from deepening.</p>
<p>The Governmentâs decision responds to a formal request from the Government of the United States to contribute specific Australian Defence Force capabilities to the international coalition.</p>
<p>In recent days, I have discussed the situation with President Barack Obama, with Iraqâs new Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi and with Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zaiyed of the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>These leaders share the Governmentâs grave concern about the situation in Iraq and support Australian participation in an international coalition to disrupt and degrade ISILâs ruthless advance.</p>
<p>The ISIL death cult threatens the people of Iraq, the region and the wider world.</p>
<p>The conflict has reached out to Australia, with at least 60 Australians fighting with ISIL and other terrorist groups and another 100 or so supporting these extremists.</p>
<p>This situation is as much a matter of domestic security as it is of international security.</p>
<p>It is right for Australia to do what it prudently and proportionately can to support international efforts to prevent the spread of ISIL, roll back its gains and alleviate suffering in Iraq.</p>
<p>Australia has already provided air-lift assistance to Iraq, including the movement of arms and munitions and two humanitarian aid drops to stranded people in Northern Iraq using a RAAF C-130J Hercules and C-17A Globemaster aircraft.</p>
<p>I am encouraged by the strong support President Obamaâs strategy has received, in particular from Iraq and many neighbouring countries, and the wider international community.</p>
<p>On 24 September, I will attend the United Nations Security Council to further discuss the international effort to counter ISIL.</p>
