PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
1995 NATIONAL SOCIAL POLICY CONFERENCE<br />
UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES, SYDNEY, 7 JULY 1995<br />
It's good to be at a policy conference.<br />
Policy is the stuff of government. It's why we are here. It's why we came to<br />
government in the first place, it's why we are still here, it's why we will be here a year<br />
from now.<br />
We are still governing because, from the beginning, we have led a decade of<br />
profound social, economic and cultural change.<br />
And our first policy principle in guiding this reform is inclusion. As Samuel Johnson<br />
said, " In a civilised society, we all depend on each other'.<br />
Strange as it may seem for Sam Johnson to be writing Labors slogans, I have not<br />
found a better broad definition of what this Government is about.<br />
We take social policy seriously. We put social into the democratic equation. We<br />
also put it into the economic equation at a time when other governments were<br />
leaving it out.<br />
Over the last 12 years, we have transformed the economic structure of Australia.<br />
We are well known for this. It has been well advertised. What is sometimes<br />
forgotten is that at the same time we transformed the social infrastructure of the<br />
nation. Let me run through just some of our achievements:<br />
the introduction of Medicare;<br />
payments for low income families increased by at least 80 per cent in real<br />
terms; an age pension set at the benchmark of at least 25 per cent of average<br />
weekly earnings;<br />
reforms to superannuation so that close to 90 per cent of the workforce<br />
receive superannuation compared with less than 40 per cent in 1983; </p>
<p>the introduction of the Job Compact which means that everyone unemployed<br />
for 18 months or more will be offered a job;<br />
the establishment of the Child Support Scheme;<br />
a more than five-fold increase in child care places, with a commitment to meet<br />
demand for work-related child care by 2001;<br />
the extension of Child Care Assistance and the introduction of the Child Care<br />
Cash Rebate;<br />
the recognition and protection of native title;<br />
more than 7 in 10 young people completing high school compared with only 3<br />
in 10 in 1983;<br />
more than 50 per cent increase in enrolments in tertiary education;<br />
the establishment of a national vocational education system under ANTA;<br />
a comprehensive network of community care services for older people and<br />
people with disabilities through the Home and Community Care Program;<br />
the enactment of the Disability Discrimination Act making discrimination on<br />
the grounds of disability unlawful; and<br />
the Government's landmark Sex Discrimination Act outlawing discrimination<br />
on the basis of sex, marital status or pregnancy.<br />
And in the last three months, the Government has brought the Budget back into<br />
surplus; introduced a Maternity Allowance; reached agreement with the ACTU on<br />
Accord VIII; significantly improved national savings and retirement incomes through<br />
increased superannuation contributions; and delivered the Justice Statement.<br />
I was interested to read in Stuart Macintyre's paper to this conference his<br />
comparison between the reaction of the Scullin Government to the Great<br />
Depression, and this Government's response to the recession of the early nineties.<br />
It is something some of us have long been aware of that, despite much popular<br />
opinion to the contrary, this Government is more " Labor" in most of its essential<br />
responses and initiatives than its fabled Labor predecessors.<br />
To Professor Macintyre's comparison I might add another one the famous post-war<br />
White Paper and the White Paper of last year we called Working Nation. It is<br />
enough to say. here that Working Nation was a document of at least comparable<br />
breadth and imagination. That is not to belittle the achievements of Chifley and<br />
Curtin, or underestimate the forces at work on Scullin. But it is to correct a common<br />
fallacy about modern Labor's commitment to social policy and social improvement. </p>
<p>It is a measure of our success, and a genuine reward, to think that in today's<br />
Australia no one under the age of thirty has spent a year of adult life without<br />
universal health insurance. It is part of the culture of this place. It is a tangible<br />
expression of our traditional social values. Can you imagine Australia without the<br />
new social infrastructure of the past decade without Medicare; without the Child<br />
Support Agency; without Home and Community Care; without a national vocational<br />
education scheme; without protection for women against discrimination.<br />
The work we have done over the past 12 years establishes our good faith with the<br />
Australian community. We don't think there should be an argument about that, but<br />
it's not the same thing as saying that there are not real problems still to solve.<br />
The policy process is a fascinating and challenging animal.<br />
We often talk about policy-making as being like painting on a broad canvas. We<br />
begin with a vision of what the picture will be: that is the first essential no<br />
imagination, no picture. No faith in your ability to realise it, no picture. And, like a<br />
painter with a vision and faith, you begin to fill the canvas in, step by step, layer by<br />
layer.<br />
And there the analogy ends because policy-making, unlike picture painting, is<br />
never complete.<br />
We can never finish the job of reform. We know that, with good policy, other<br />
problems will come along, often uncovered by the good policy itself. And we know<br />
that, with even the best policy, we won't solve all the problems.<br />
But we also know that we will get better answers if we pay attention to the views of<br />
people in the field.<br />
All of you here today, from your varying perspectives of community workers,<br />
lobbyists, public servants and academics, know this. You know your advice or<br />
action or arguments will be better if they are road tested, as it were.<br />
Forgive me for the political intrusion, but that is one reason why there should be a<br />
very strong objection to political leaders who say they will announce their policies<br />
only in an election campaign. That means the only consultation will be consultation<br />
with the Coalition's research groups. The only listening will be to the polls.<br />
Mr Howard has already said he will not be taking any notice of special interest<br />
groups. He has dismissed the role of consultation between governments and representatives<br />
of ordinary Australians as a legitimate part of the policy process. </p>
<p>Included in his coverage of special interest groups is the ACTU, which represents<br />
over two and a half million workers. If he dismisses consultation with the organised<br />
labour movement, what about with organised business such as the BCA; or groups<br />
such as ACOSS, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Aboriginal Land<br />
Councils, the Australian Consumers' Association, Women's Electoral Lobby, the<br />
Farmers' Federation, the National Catholic Education Commission, or the AMA?<br />
The Labor Government deals with interest groups, accords them status, learns from<br />
them, and acts in partnership with them. We know that in combination they<br />
represent almost every sector of the community.<br />
Research and consultation have been the basis of our major social reforms, such as<br />
Working Nation, the Social Security Review, the Child Support Scheme; the National<br />
Housing Strategy; and the National Health Strategy.<br />
Just now, in the research community and in the general community there is a lot<br />
of interest in income distribution issues. A look at the program for this conference<br />
confirms that.<br />
Let me start by saying that a reduction in poverty and inequality is one of the<br />
benchmarks against which the Government judges itself and will be judged.<br />
And the fact is that under Labor, real wages and household incomes have increased<br />
substantially and living standards have improved as a result. And Australia<br />
continues to have one of the fairest wage distributions in the developed world.<br />
We all know that unemployment is one of the greatest causes of inequality. An even<br />
more certain and profound truth is that nothing a government can do in the way of<br />
social services, or social policies of any kind, will so effectively distribute wealth and<br />
opportunity as employment. Nothing comes close. Nothing is as good as a job.<br />
And nothing increases the number of jobs like high, sustainable economic growth.<br />
Since April 1993, over 600,000 jobs have been created. Over the year to May 1995,<br />
the number of people out of work for more than a year dropped by 26 per cent. The<br />
ABS has recently published figures showing that in 1994 Australia out-performed all<br />
the world's major economies in reducing unemployment. That is a major contribution<br />
to equality, a major contribution to social justice.<br />
The most common measure of poverty in Australia is the Henderson Poverty Line,<br />
which is now more than twenty years old and generally accepted to have some<br />
misleading features. The Henderson Poverty Line is updated according to changes<br />
in household disposable income rather than the CPI or average weekly earnings.<br />
Since household disposable income per person has risen by nearly 20 per cent in<br />
real terms since 1983, in real terms the poverty line has been rising.<br />
Yet under Labor most social security recipients have moved from below to above the<br />
poverty line. </p>
<p>For example, since 1983, the income of an unemployed couple with one child renting<br />
privately has increased from 11 per cent below to 1 per cent above the poverty line.<br />
The income of a sole parent with two children renting privately has increased from 9<br />
per cent below to 2 per cent above the poverty line. The Social Policy Research<br />
Centre has estimated that, if the poverty line had been adjusted in line with prices,<br />
poverty would have fallen by nearly 20 per cent between 1983 and 1990. And this<br />
does not take into account the benefits of the social wage.<br />
The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling estimates that social wage<br />
benefits from health, housing, child care and education are worth an average of<br />
$ 195 a week for a family with two children. The research also shows that these<br />
benefits are worth far more for the lowest income families than they are for the<br />
highest income families and thus substantially reduce inequality.<br />
This is a very different picture from the one presented by the Opposition of the poor<br />
getting poorer. I'm sure that the social policy ministers would like to know that their<br />
hard fights within Cabinet have been worthwhile, but setting the record straight is not<br />
the main point of my discussion.<br />
It is important for all of us interested in income inequality to get a clearer<br />
understanding of what has happened and how the Government can help to reduce<br />
inequality. To better understand the issues and to tease out the implications for<br />
policy, the Government has commissioned research from the University of<br />
Melbourne on trends in income distribution. The research presented at this<br />
Conference will also add to our picture.<br />
These days, I am constantly getting into trouble for having the temerity to talk about<br />
John Howard's past. It is not something I want to do. There are much richer and<br />
more diverting historical excursions to take. But with Howard, we talk about the past<br />
because that's all there is to talk about. It's all we know about him.<br />
We know this present Opposition only by what they did when they were last in<br />
government and what they said they would do if they regained government at the<br />
last election. We know them only by their record and what we can infer from it and<br />
the record is, by any local or international measure, abysmal.<br />
The record shows that when they were last in government, with John Howard as<br />
Treasurer, the Coalition:<br />
abolished Medibank, after having promised to retain it, and left 2 million<br />
people with no health insurance;<br />
reduced the value of social security payments in real terms, so, for example, a<br />
single unemployed person renting privately lost $ 15 a week, an age<br />
pensioner lost $ 3 a week, and the most needy families lost $ 4 a week;<br />
slashed spending on health, housing and child care in real terms, reducing<br />
expenditure on the social wage by more than $ 5 billion or nearly $ 500 per<br />
person per year. </p>
<p>And remember if the Coalition had won at the last election, they were committed to:<br />
cutting a total of $ 10 billion from public expenditure, including $ 1 billion from<br />
social security, $ 400 million from public housing and $ 1.3 billion from public<br />
hospitals; introducing youth wages of $ 3 an hour;<br />
establishing a training system under which unemployed people could have<br />
been paid 70 per cent of the award wage with no requirement that their<br />
employer train them;<br />
full fees for university;<br />
the abolition of bulk-billing under Medicare for most people;<br />
a three week waiting period for unemployment benefits; and<br />
removing the sole parent pension when the youngest child turned 12.<br />
We don't know much of what the Coalition plans to do if they get elected next time.<br />
But type generally wins out. And John Howard is a Type A Tory. A Type A<br />
conservative of the eighties. He made friends with the New Right and that weird<br />
specimen of extremism the H R Nichols Society. He has opposed all but two of the<br />
wage rises since 1975.<br />
Over and over again he says he is pro family and over and over again he is anti<br />
wage-earners over and over again anti family support.<br />
We must remember that 16 out of the 19 members of the current Coalition Shadow<br />
Cabinet were members of John Hewson's Ministry.<br />
So nearly 85 per cent of the current Shadow Cabinet put their hands up for slashing<br />
spending on the social wage; for dropping unemployed people off unemployment<br />
benefits after 9 months; for abolishing bulk-billing; for cutting the award wages of low<br />
income workers. They put their hands up for policies which are Thatcherite in<br />
principle and substance and which were most memorably expressed by John<br />
Hewson when he said if we reach back for the weak they will drag us down.<br />
And now we are meant to believe that they care about the " battlers" that group of<br />
Australians they only discovered when their pollsters identified them.<br />
We can see the true colours of the Coalition have not changed when we examine<br />
the social policy areas where they have revealed their basic direction health policy,<br />
family policy and industrial relations. We see the same old signs of regression. And<br />
the policies fly in the face of the best research. </p>
<p>The Coalition's health policy is to provide tax subsidies for private health insurance.<br />
You would expect a Labor Government to be critical of this, but you don't have to<br />
take our word for it. It flies in the face of the research of health economists and<br />
analysts such as Jeff Richardson, Richard Scotton, Stephen Leeder, and most<br />
recently, Kevin Forde, a health economist at this university, who has published an<br />
analysis of the impact of subsidising private health insurance.<br />
In his Headland speech, Mr Howard says that private health insurance deserves<br />
subsidies because private hospitals are under-utilised and there are waiting lists in<br />
public hospitals.<br />
It is untrue that waiting lists are attributable to a contraction in the private hospital<br />
sector. In fact, over the past five years, there has been an increase in both privately<br />
insured hospital days in private hospitals and admissions to private hospitals as a<br />
total of all admissions.<br />
It is also wrong to suggest that people who take out private health insurance will only<br />
seek treatment in private hospitals, and thus free up public hospitals. In fact, many<br />
sophisticated procedures are only carried out in public hospitals. And most people,<br />
including Kerry Packer, when involved in an accident or an emergency, are treated<br />
in public hospitals.<br />
As the researchers point out, there is ample evidence to suggest that the policy of<br />
subsidising private health insurance to move patients from the public to the private<br />
sector does not reduce health care costs, but merely shifts them from the<br />
government to the patients.<br />
Overall health costs are also likely to increase with higher levels of private health<br />
insurance because of higher administrative costs, fewer controls on over-servicing,<br />
and the reluctance of the private health funds to encourage cost-containment in<br />
private hospitals. We would end up with more, not fewer, resources being spent on<br />
health care.<br />
And who would get the extra money? Private hospitals, specialists working in<br />
private hospitals and the health insurance funds.<br />
What people gain in tax deductions they lose in health insurance premiums and outof<br />
pocket expenses. The simple fact is that the Coalition's policy would mean that<br />
patients would pay more for health care.<br />
In short, what the Opposition proposes would be neither an efficient nor an equitable<br />
means of solving health care problems. The major beneficiaries of the subsidies<br />
would be tax-payers who already have private health insurance people we know<br />
are more likely to be higher income earners.<br />
The underlying danger of the Coalition's support for subsidies for private health<br />
insurance is that it is aimed at developing a two-tier health system: a rich, privately<br />
funded health system alongside a poor, publicly funded system. </p>
<p>We take the view that the solutions in health lie in improving the public health<br />
system. It is also where our responsibility lies. It is not our responsibility to spend<br />
over $ 1 billion subsidising the private health system and specialists at the expense<br />
of Medicare.<br />
It is a question of weight and priority. Put the weight in the wrong place and the<br />
whole social balance is upset. And that is precisely what the political equation is<br />
about. Family policy is another case in point.<br />
When it comes to family policy we give priority to low income families. Furthermore,<br />
we make sure the assistance is paid directly to the parent with the most daily<br />
responsibility for caring for the children, usually the mother.<br />
John Howard believes in income-splitting. He has believed in it since 1979. You<br />
have to admire his tenacity, but not his judgement or priorities even his own party<br />
won't take it on, and the tax and social policy experts reject it entirely.<br />
Most recently, we have heard from Professor Patricia Apps from the University of<br />
Sydney, who found income-splitting to be inefficient, regressive, anti-saving and<br />
sexist. Her work clearly shows that tax would increase on the second income<br />
earners in families, who are usually women. Conversely, the tax on the male<br />
partners would decrease.<br />
Dr Peter McDonald from the Australian Institute of Family Studies summed it up well:<br />
" If the aim is to provide very large benefits to wealthy families and to make it very<br />
difficult for women to work part-time then income-splitting is the right option."<br />
The evidence against income-splitting is overwhelming and has been for years.<br />
We know that it is regressive. The more you earn the more you benefit from incomesplitting.<br />
A family on $ 100,000 would have their tax reduced by about $ 7,000 a year<br />
while a family on $ 20,000 would actually pay about $ 200 more in tax under incomesplitting.<br />
And the policy would not come cheap income-splitting would cost about $ 3 billion.<br />
Or alternatively, as Professor Apps points out, if you wanted to introduce incomesplitting<br />
without any loss of revenue, you would have to increase all marginal tax<br />
rates by 3 percentage points.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition who uses the " family" as his own personal mantra;<br />
who says he is " pro-family", as if the rest of us were anti; and who now talks<br />
sanctimoniously about " battlers", in fact advocates a $ 3 billion policy which is<br />
regressive, which gives the greatest benefit to high income families, and under which<br />
many low income families would actually be worse off.<br />
When you look at John Howard's policy beliefs over the years it is a story all<br />
fractured and disjointed. And yet there are these unrelated and almost arcane<br />
elements consistently floating through it like odd socks. They are income-splitting,<br />
employment contracts, pulling Medicare apart and the monarchy. </p>
<p>This is John Howard's policy odd sock bag the ones he keeps in the hope that one<br />
day a matching one will turn up in someone else's drawer and make sense of it all<br />
and renew its purpose in life and, with it, the purpose in life of J. W. Howard.<br />
But as we all know, you only wait a certain time with your odd socks and then you<br />
hang them up at Christmas, or use them as dusters for your shoes, or stuff them with<br />
other odd socks and kick them round the lounge room.<br />
And to think that someone once said that politics is a contest of ideas a contest for<br />
ideas and values. John Howard has been hanging on to these ideas for the course<br />
of his political life, and, try as he might, he can't add to them unless it's to go back<br />
to tariffs, or to resist according the Aboriginal flag the same status as that of Norfolk<br />
Island. I am not opposed to all forms of conservatism. I like tradition Labor thrives<br />
on it but I hate regression. In the 1990s we simply can't afford it.<br />
The Labor Government's guiding philosophy is social democratic, by which I mean a<br />
democracy in which the concept of rights and liberties is extended to encompass<br />
both individual opportunity and social justice.<br />
There is no question that successful economies have been free market economies:<br />
it is scarcely less debatable that the most successful societies have been those<br />
which have combined this with democratic freedoms and sophisticated and<br />
integrated social programs.<br />
In saying this I do not mean that we follow any model European or American.<br />
We've developed our own. We do things a little differently, and I think a little better.<br />
It is a model that balances the need for economic efficiency and innovation, with the<br />
imperative of protecting and enhancing the material and social circumstances of the<br />
disadvantaged. It is a model that is seen most clearly in the unique Australian<br />
partnership with the union movement, the Prices and Incomes Accord, which<br />
recently evolved to its eighth stage.<br />
It is a model, incidentally, that shows some influence of academic research, and<br />
indeed, the Accord itself has become a major subject of social science investigation.<br />
It is now well understood by social scientists that countries face clear choices in<br />
industrial relations, and that the choice made has fundamental implications for<br />
macro-economic outcomes and income distribution.<br />
On the one hand, unions can be left to pursue their agendas and will naturally do so<br />
by bidding up the wages of their members, giving relatively little weight to the<br />
broader economic and social consequences of these actions. Research in this area<br />
has shown with great clarity that the results are high wage inflation and high<br />
unemployment. </p>
<p>On the other hand, countries without strong union movements typically deliver<br />
relatively high employment growth with low inflation, but such countries are more<br />
likely to offer less protection to the socially disadvantaged; this tends to be<br />
manifested in growing income inequality. The United States is undoubtedly the best<br />
example of such an arrangement.<br />
The US Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich, recently lamented the strong tendency to<br />
earnings inequality in that country and contrasted it with the social protection offered<br />
in many of the countries of Western Europe. Yet in these countries, critics typically<br />
point to poor employment performance and highlight the US as a superior model.<br />
The Accord represents a middle ground. Under the Accord the ACTU has delivered<br />
restraint in labour costs in order to ensure healthy US style employment growth.<br />
And since 1983 the Government has been able to deliver a real and improved social<br />
wage Western European style reflected in part in many of the policy<br />
achievements I have mentioned today.<br />
That term " social wage" is an instructive one. It makes the point that to go on<br />
talking about the " economic" and the " social" as if they were separate and distinct<br />
defies the reality. The social wage is both a social policy and an economic one. It<br />
serves both social and economic ends. It is an expression of the fact admittedly<br />
not recognised in some quarters that good economic policy has a good social<br />
purpose, that social justice and economic efficiency are not only generally<br />
compatible but generally complementary. This is why, I suppose, some of us grow a<br />
little short-tempered with those who tell us that we are concentrating too much on<br />
social matters, or cultural matters as opposed to economic ones or economic<br />
matters as opposed to these others.<br />
The fact is they are inseparable and properly so. In fact I sometimes think it is the<br />
essence of good policy to find the points at which they fuse that the convergence is<br />
very often disguised from us, and good policy means discovering where and how to<br />
make them meet. Consider how long it took us to recognise that inflation not only<br />
damaged our economic competitiveness but corroded social justice? And then<br />
consider that, perhaps alone among countries today, we have a trade union<br />
movement and the central bank working as one to the same low inflation ends.<br />
And I might say this: I think among our social policy people and our economic<br />
people it has generally been on the social policy side that the leap has been taken.<br />
Our social thinkers became economists far more often than the economists became<br />
social thinkers. That, it seems to me, puts a lot of our academic economists, market<br />
analysts and economic commentators, a little way behind the contemporary reality, a<br />
little way off the direction Australia is going.<br />
I think we can look back on the past decade or more and see a whole new story told<br />
in a whole new way. I think we can see the development here of a much more<br />
sophisticated national equation. We have fashioned a modern Australian social<br />
democracy: incomplete and imperfect, but a very good place to live and work, with<br />
traditions, a spirit and a future that will not be denied. </p>
