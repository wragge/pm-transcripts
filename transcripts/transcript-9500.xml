TRtANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J .( EATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, RAAF FAIRSAIRN ON DEPARTURE FOR SINGAPORE<br />
4 MARCH 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PMV: Principally, I am going to the opening of the exhibition the CeBIT Fair<br />
because Australia is the guest country, in Germany, because this is<br />
the largest electronics and... its the largest communications and<br />
electronics fair in the world. We have got 160 companies exhibiting<br />
150 to 200 companies. Ten years ago we would have had maybe 2 or<br />
3 companies only being able to be in this. I think this is a<br />
demonstration of the new Australia it's the way the world is going,<br />
and we are not being left behind. We are up there with the best of<br />
them, amongst the toughest competition, the most concentrated Fair of<br />
the new age the e' 1ectronic and computer age we are up there this<br />
week, and we are the host country, the guest country. So, that is why I<br />
am going in a sense to promote Australia, but also to celebrate our<br />
achievements, and to see that we are in the mainstream of these<br />
technologies.<br />
J: What are~ you trying to achieve at the World Summit for Social<br />
Development then?<br />
PM: To put Australia's view, to record the fact that we have put together a<br />
social democracy here I think second to none around the world a<br />
counl: y with high employment and a good social wage, where equity<br />
and 7-galitarianism are important milestones in ecz: nomic and social<br />
policy. They are things worth saying in this context.<br />
J: What do you hope to achieve through your talks with Helmut Kohl?<br />
PMV: Germany is the third largest country in the world, it is a very big trader<br />
with Australia, we have got substantial two-way investment I think we<br />
would like to improve that. Germany united is a much larger country<br />
it has now got probably an even greater destiny in Eastern Europe as </p>
<p>well as Western Europe, and it's simply an important relationship to<br />
keep going.<br />
J: It used to be our fourth largest trading partner, and now it's ninth<br />
that's slipped over the last five years....<br />
PMV: It depends on how much we have grown, and how much other<br />
countries have come in, but I think the point is that Germany is now<br />
focussing to the Asia-Pacific again after the reunification they are<br />
really getting their gaze on the Asia-Pacific, and I think a lot of<br />
companies think that Australia can be the platform where they launch<br />
themselves in the Asia-Pacific. And, of course, we agree with that.<br />
J: Just on another matter should Fred Many have been released from<br />
9aol?<br />
PM:, That's a matter for the New South Wales government it is not my<br />
affair. Can I just make this point, though let us record that this week<br />
a great milestone in Australian social history was agreed, and that was<br />
the Aboriginal Land Fund Bill. Because of the to-ing and fro-ing, it's<br />
now as if it's coming and going, hardly to be noticed. But let's<br />
understand, that because this Government decided that there will be<br />
justice for Aboriginal people, and there will be land for them which is<br />
central to the way they live the passage of the Land Fund was a great<br />
victory for Aboriginal people, and a great victory for the Government.<br />
it's a pity that John Howard, and the Coalition, couldn't have seen their<br />
way clear to agree to the original Bill, and know that stain is on them,<br />
and though they have tried to wash it away it remains. But, the happy<br />
part is that justice Was done, and the Aboriginal people will now have<br />
their fund.<br />
J: In the sense that it will ease some pressure off Mr Howard, are you<br />
disappointed to be leaving the country at this time?<br />
PM: No look, Mr Howard... I have got him on simmer. And when I come<br />
back to him, he will be just I'm sure warming along nicely.<br />
ends. </p>
