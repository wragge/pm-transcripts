FOR PRESS P. M. No, ! 6/ 1Q, 6<br />
REBUTTAL TO PAPUA/ NETW GUINEA STORY<br />
Statement by teh1 Prime niiseet er, the Rt Hon, R. G. 4enzies<br />
My attention has been directed to a story published<br />
in the Melbourne Herald on February 5, and also, I believe, in the<br />
Brisbane Courier Mail. I had not seen this article until today0<br />
It states categorically that Australia will try to<br />
give Papua/ New Guinea representative self-government by 1968<br />
and complete its political independence by 1972 at the latest.<br />
The story purports to be based upon inside knowledge<br />
of Government policy, Mr. Hasluck made a statement in Rabaul on<br />
Saturday, February 9, categorically denying this story and setting<br />
out in completely accurate terms the real policy of the Australian<br />
S Government which is " that we will stay in Papua/ New Guinea as long<br />
as the people of the Territory need our help, No-one other than<br />
the residents of the Territory can tell us when to go."<br />
Mr. Hasluck's full statement deserves to be read,<br />
It is entirely in accord with Government policy. The story about<br />
1968 and 1972 is one which I had never heard of until I read it<br />
today. It is a misohievous story because it may well create<br />
confusion, not only among the indigenous inhabitants, but also<br />
among the Australians who live and work in this Territory. I am<br />
quite unaware of any differences of opinion in the Government on<br />
this matter,<br />
