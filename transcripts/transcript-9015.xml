STAmMCi: NT BY THE PRIM NSTERK-r1 EliON P J KEATING, MiP<br />
MAISO AND LEADLRSIPI<br />
T hc Mabo issue has exposed again John Hewson's wantton lack of leadership.<br />
Threatened by his Western Auslralian Parliamrtrary suprorters, John Hcwson is failing<br />
absolutely to show ary leadership on Mabo while the Western Ausiralian Premier<br />
says he wiU legislate to actually extinguish native title, to abolish it.<br />
At the same time as Dr Hewson sits mute on tht issue, Pi. ter Reith attacks the<br />
legitimacy of the JBigh Court and thrieatens it, reportedly Sayulg if it contllues to<br />
behave this way it wiU be reformed, and arguing any preference for Aborigines in the<br />
Native Title Bill should be struck out.<br />
Keithl is sharply at odds with the Deputy Leader of the Iiberal Party Dr Wooldridge<br />
who has indicated his support for the High Court dCcision and its legislative<br />
rainifications.<br />
Dr Ilcwson is presiding over a divided Liberal Parry and a divided coalition on Mabo.<br />
Without a shred orcouragc or decency he is leaving the field to the Courts and the<br />
Reiths for fear of his owti job and the position Western A. usirdlian Liberads might take.<br />
Premier Court has challenged John -ewson to stick with him on Mabo and that means<br />
conniving in the wholesale extinguishunenr of Naiive Title.<br />
Wkhen will John 11cwson stand up and be counte.<br />
Is Dr Mcwson's only rolc to be that of spoiler a role he Is working hard to pci-feet.<br />
