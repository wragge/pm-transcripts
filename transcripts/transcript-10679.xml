    <content><![CDATA[<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Good morning Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Howard, how are you?</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Good. As I have been saying to a few people this morning, including</p>
<p>   the Opposition Leader, it would appear that the jigsaw is falling</p>
<p>   into place for a Federal election, would you agree?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the Constitution says we have got to have an election now</p>
<p>   every three years and we are into our last year of a three year</p>
<p>   term so there is obviously going to be an election sometime in the</p>
<p>   next ten to twelve months. When, I don't know.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>You're the only one who will know.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's right. It will depend a bit on how the Senate behaves.</p>
<p>   If the Senate is prepared to pass our legislation then the election</p>
<p>   might be a bit a later. But, look I am not going to spend the whole</p>
<p>   year speculating about when the election is going to be.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Telstra won't be a double-dissolution issue because you won't</p>
<p>   be putting that before the parliament before an election, will you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We'll be putting the legislation in, yes, but the operation</p>
<p>   date of the legislation won't be until after the election so</p>
<p>   that in accordance with a promise I made before the last election,</p>
<p>   if people don't like us they will throw us out at the next</p>
<p>   election and then the new government won't allow the legislation</p>
<p>   to come into force. So what it really does is to achieve a double</p>
<p>   effect of allowing people to pass judgement on the proposal to allow</p>
<p>   people to buy the rest. But at the same time, if they do approve,</p>
<p>   letting us go ahead as quickly as possible, without delay, if we</p>
<p>   are re-elected.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>OK. We talked to Kim Beazley just before you. Your direct opponent</p>
<p>   on this and it seems to him that it comes down to a numbers game.</p>
<p>   How many people can benefit from the sale of the other two-thirds</p>
<p>   of Telstra versus those who won't benefit and he seems to think</p>
<p>   that would be the majority because they won't be able to own</p>
<p>   shares.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that is an incredibly childish, that's an incredibly</p>
<p>   childish view.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>What he thinks is that those people who can financially benefit</p>
<p>   would naturally support the sale and those who have would be in</p>
<p>   that sort of category, but those who can't afford them, they'd</p>
<p>   vote against it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>So, in other words he is saying you can't ever support a privatisation</p>
<p>   unless more than 9.5 million Australians can buy shares in the company</p>
<p>   that has been privatised. I don't remember him saying that</p>
<p>   when he privatised</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>He reckons that the Comonwealth Bank and Telstra are chalk and</p>
<p>   cheese.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh yes. The only difference is that we're in government now</p>
<p>   and he was in government then. That's the only difference.</p>
<p>   We have had a consistent line on privatisation and what we are doing</p>
<p>   is allowing the Australian public, the men and women of Australia,</p>
<p>   to directly own the biggest company in Australia and that's</p>
<p>   what we're going to do by making this decision. </p>
<p>There was tremendous support from the Australian community for</p>
<p>   floating one-third of Telstra. More than 600,000 Australians bought</p>
<p>   shares in that float for the first time in their lives. 92 per cent</p>
<p>   of the employees of the company bought shares and once again we</p>
<p>   will offer a special incentive, a special inducement for the workers</p>
<p>   at Telstra to buy shares in the new float.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>I guess the irony there, and I have spoken to the union today too,</p>
<p>   they say they will be out there campaigning at the next election</p>
<p>   against the sale of the other two-thirds but their union representative</p>
<p>   admitted that a lot had bought shares.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Doesn't that just indicate how ideologically marooned both</p>
<p>   the Labor Party and the trade union movement is on this issue. They</p>
<p>   are just pathetically old fashioned and out of date. This is a proposal</p>
<p>   that contains all of the protection for people in the bush and there</p>
<p>   will be...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Can I just pick you up on that too because you are, in fact, broadcasting,</p>
<p>   we are, to the bush at the moment in Western Australia. How can</p>
<p>   you guarantee that a private company would keep the standards up</p>
<p>   to the most remote areas?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Because the law will compel them to do so.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>How will you judge that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Because we will pass a law and there is a regulatory authority</p>
<p>   to make certain they will do it.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>In default?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They will be in big trouble. They won't default, the law will</p>
<p>   compel them to do it.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>And how will the sale effect and improve the general living standards</p>
<p>   of all Australians, not just those who buy shares?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we will be able to reduce our Federal Government debt. I mean,</p>
<p>   the $100 billion of Federal Government debt that Mr Keating and</p>
<p>   Mr Beazley left us. We will be able to reduce that by this one single</p>
<p>   decision by about 40 per cent. 40 per cent.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>How many billions is that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And what that will do is reduce interest rates because the Government</p>
<p>   won't have to service as much debt and that will reduce the</p>
<p>   pressure on the money markets and that will inturn flow through</p>
<p>   to either lower interest rates or a maintenance of the existing</p>
<p>   level of interest rates. So it all ends up, everybody in the community</p>
<p>   benefits.</p>
<p>that will reduce the pressure on the money markets and that in</p>
<p>   turn will flow through to either lower interest rates or a maintenance</p>
<p>   of the existing level of interest rates, so it all ends up everybody</p>
<p>   in the community benefits ...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Well I would like to think they'd actually come down.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't know what's going to happen in the future</p>
<p>   with interest rates, nobody can ever be certain. But I do know this,</p>
<p>   that if the government is borrowing less money, if the government</p>
<p>   has a lower debt, then there's less pressure on the markets</p>
<p>   because there are fewer people competing for the available money,</p>
<p>   and that means that there's less pressure on interest rates.</p>
<p>   Now I'm not promising they're going to come down, but</p>
<p>   what I am promising you is that if you reduce debt you reduce interest</p>
<p>   rate pressures and they either come down or they stay where they</p>
<p>   are for longer.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Would you agree now that with this sort of card falling into place</p>
<p>   there's going to be very clear definition between what your</p>
<p>   side puts up to us at the election, and what Labor puts up. You've</p>
<p>   got this, you've got the native title legislation, you've</p>
<p>   got tax reform, and I imagine that includes a GST, and you've</p>
<p>   got industrial relations reforms. Are they going to be the four</p>
<p>   big issues?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They are four huge issues. And the other issue of course is that</p>
<p>   if Labor were re-elected it would go back to the policies it had</p>
<p>   in government. It would go back to the high interest rate, high</p>
<p>   debt policies it followed when it was in government, because every</p>
<p>   time we try and do something to reduce debt and to reduce interest</p>
<p>   rates, they oppose it.</p>
<p>Those four issues that you named will all be major issues in the</p>
<p>   election campaign and there are clear differences between us and</p>
<p>   Labor on each of them. We will reform the tax system, Labor won't.</p>
<p>   We'll let Australians buy into the rest of Telstra, Labor won't.</p>
<p>   We'll reform native title, Labor won't, and of course</p>
<p>   the daddy of them all in a sense is we'll fix the waterfront,</p>
<p>   Labor can't, because of its association with the trade union</p>
<p>   movement. Interestingly enough in relation to both the waterfront</p>
<p>   and Telstra, the Labor party can't move because it is shackled</p>
<p>   to the trade union movement.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Now while you're there Prime Minister, you've just announced</p>
<p>   a new Australian National Council on Drugs. What is that going to</p>
<p>   do to try and beat back the amount of drug trafficking, and we have</p>
<p>   got major problems in Western Australia, about that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I've done much more than that. I've also announced</p>
<p>   the commitment of an additional $100 million over and above the</p>
<p>   amount of $87 million that I committed last year and this money</p>
<p>   will go towards tackling both the law enforcement side of the drug</p>
<p>   menace as well as the rehabilitation side, and the very important</p>
<p>   good news for Perth and for Western Australia is that we'll</p>
<p>   be establishing three more mobile strike force teams of Australian</p>
<p>   Federal Police officers and one of those three new teams will now</p>
<p>   be based in Perth.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>So the lobbying on that one worked, because it looked as though</p>
<p>   we were going to miss out for a while?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we listened to what was put to us and we found the additional</p>
<p>   resources and I indicated to the Premier of Western Australia last</p>
<p>   night when I saw him in Brisbane, that I thought we would have some</p>
<p>   good news, and it's all fallen into place and I'm very</p>
<p>   happy to tell you for the first time in speaking to the Western</p>
<p>   Australian media, that one of the decisions will be the provision</p>
<p>   of $11.8 million to establish three task force teams, one in Brisbane,</p>
<p>   one in Melbourne, and importantly for Western Australia one of them</p>
<p>   will be in Perth.</p>
<p>Now these will be in addition to the three task force teams that</p>
<p>   I established in the first instalment of the Tough on Drugs programme</p>
<p>   but it's a very comprehensive commitment and what it means</p>
<p>   is that the amount of money being spent on the drug menace has doubled</p>
<p>   in the last year to eighteen months, and an independent expert in</p>
<p>   this area said at the launch this morning that this represents the</p>
<p>   greatest commitment to fighting the drug menace of any Federal government</p>
<p>   in Australia for more than a decade, and it has been very widely</p>
<p>   supported. It's $50 million to tackle the rehabilitation side</p>
<p>   of it, which promotes our zero tolerance philosophy and $50 million</p>
<p>   to tackle the law enforcement side of it, including the money I've</p>
<p>   talked about a moment ago for the task force but also $21 million</p>
<p>   for the National Crime Authority's Blade Taskforce that will</p>
<p>   specifically target organised crime coming out of South-East Asia.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>I'm glad you're going to go the source up there too.</p>
<p>   And the new National Council on Drugs, have we got any representatives</p>
<p>   on that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes you have got representatives on that and the Chairman of that</p>
<p>   is David Watters of the Salvation Army, who's had 23 years</p>
<p>   experience in fighting the drug problem.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Of picking up the pieces.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Picking up the pieces, and you've got the Deputy Chairman,</p>
<p>   Mick Palmer, who is the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police.</p>
<p>   It's a Council that brings together the government, the volunteer</p>
<p>   organisations, the law enforcement organisations, a group of people</p>
<p>   all of whom are knowledgeable in the area and all of whom are very</p>
<p>   committed. This is a major further commitment by my government and</p>
<p>   it fulfils the promise I made last year that what I announced last</p>
<p>   year was only the first instalment and we have more than doubled</p>
<p>   in today's announcement the additional resources that we've</p>
<p>   committed to fighting this absolute menace.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Well as I say, I feel all the pieces falling into place Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well this is a good policy and ...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>No I'm not knocking the policy. I'm just saying I feel</p>
<p>   an election in the wind. Now let's be honest about it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there will be an election at some stage.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Won't be next year.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Howard I don't have to go to the polls until March of</p>
<p>   next year.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Yeah, well I reckon December. A nice summer, the holidays coming</p>
<p>   up and all that sort of thing. A perfect time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Howard, I note what you say but in the meantime I'm getting</p>
<p>   on with good government and good government is about doing good</p>
<p>   things for the community and today is good for the community.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Yeah, all right. Well we'll see you across here shortly I'm</p>
<p>   sure.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You will, but I always visit Western Australia on a regular basis,</p>
<p>   elections or no elections, you know that.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Appreciate your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
