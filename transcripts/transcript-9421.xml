TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP ON ARRIVAL FROM INDONESIA ( APEC), FAIRBAIRN,<br />
16 NOVEMBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Mr Keating, will domestic politics be a little humdrum after the APEC<br />
summit?<br />
PM: Well, a bit humdrum, I think, a bit humdrum I'd have to admit. This was<br />
a tremendous outcome for the Asia-Pacific and for Australia. What<br />
struck me was the unrestrained co-operation and good will arraigned<br />
around that room from what just a few years ago was with the tension<br />
of the Cold War to this tremendous opportunity of North America<br />
coming to join Asia in a trade pact which we have never seen in the<br />
world before with developed and developing countries.<br />
J: Is the Australian economy in a position to take full advantage of the<br />
agreement?<br />
PM: Yes, absolutely. We couldn't have thought of this had we not taken the<br />
decisions 10 and 12 years ago to open Australia up and having<br />
opened it up we now can take this on with giant strides.<br />
J: What is ahead of Australia to be able to put the declaration into effect?<br />
PM: We are going to be down to an average level of manufacturing<br />
protection, trade weighted tariffs of about three per cent by the year<br />
2000. So, the task for us is largely behind us. The task is really to try<br />
to organise the best possible set of arrangements next year in Japan<br />
and to let the countries of the Asia-Pacific get themselves ready<br />
those with high tariffs and non-tariff barriers get themselves ready.<br />
But, what this means is more jobs for Australians, more wealth, more<br />
interesting jobs and opportunities for a generation that I never had<br />
when I was young, particularly for young people. </p>
<p>2<br />
J: The Opposition says to reap the full benefit of this you are going to<br />
have to get very serious about deregulating the labour market.<br />
PM: Well, they were the people who gave us increased tariffs through the<br />
1970s. They were the people who had us with a managed exchange<br />
rate. They were the people who saw foreign policy in Washington and<br />
in London. So, the truth about them is we'll leave them to the market<br />
as they say that's the political market and the big market.<br />
Thank you. </p>
