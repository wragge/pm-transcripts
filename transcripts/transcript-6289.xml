    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister has decide to lease his family home at Sandringham, in Melbourne, from later this month.</p>
<p>The experience of the last 9 months has demonstrated that it was only possible to spend a relatively few days in Melbourne and this could not justify the need for expensive and continuos security by the Australian Federal Police at the house. </p>
<p>On future visits to Melbourne Mr and Mrs Hawke will stay at a hotel where necessary.</p>
<p>Mr Hawke said the leasing of the house did not mean he would be spending any less time in Melbourne</p>
<p>SYDNEY<br />3rd January, 1984</p>
