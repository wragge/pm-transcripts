PRESS, RADIO AND TELEVISION CONFERENCE GIVEN<br />
BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. HAROLD HOLT, AT<br />
SOUTH AUSTRALIAN HOTEL, ADELIDE, S. A. MARCH. 1966<br />
MR. HOLT WWe ll, Nancy and gentlemen I am already heartened to<br />
find my very dear colleague here with me; I welcome her in her<br />
new capacity, but I ho e she won't be long separated from us.<br />
And I see some other od friends in Stewart and some of you that<br />
I think I have encountered in the course of campaigning or<br />
Treasury operations or something of that sort. But I didn't<br />
come here equiped to make any Iong nation-shaking utterance.<br />
I did want to take this opportunity quite early in my own Prime<br />
Ministership, of meeting representatives of the Press from South<br />
Australia, and while here give you the opportunity if you<br />
choose to exercise it of putting anj questions you may wish<br />
to me about current affairs. But I think rather than spend<br />
a great deal of time on matters which may not be of interest<br />
to you, I could leave the time to you, hoping there will be<br />
enough left from the two of us to enable mento partake of the<br />
refreshments with you.<br />
I may say that this is The first time that I have been<br />
to one of your Adelaide Festivals. Mrs. Holt and I are greatly<br />
loxKing forward to the remainder of the programme which we have<br />
before us. But I do regard it as a very happy circumstance that<br />
the visit enabled me to be at the very impressive opening this<br />
afternoon of Flinders University. Our own Government, as you<br />
know, he. s taken a very great interest. and my predecessor made<br />
it one of his prime concerns and personal interests to advance<br />
the university expansion programme throughout Australia, and I<br />
know it would have given him very great personal pleasure to<br />
be here today and see this wonderful example of the fruits of<br />
that policy of expansion.<br />
Now, there must be some questions bubbling up in your<br />
minds, so it is over to you.<br />
Q. ( Cockburn of the " Advertiser") Mr. Holt, you are reported as<br />
saying today that when the Government has full explained its<br />
reasons for its conscription policy for Viet am you are<br />
confident that the country will be behind you. Can you tell us<br />
why you haven't found it possible to disclose these reasons<br />
alrealy?<br />
MR. HOLT Well, I wasn't speaking of reasons in the sense of the<br />
broad purposes of policy. This has been done, of course, mnst<br />
admirably first by Sir Robert when he introduced the legislation<br />
relating to the National Service call-up, and of course in<br />
relatioñ to South Viet Nam itself, there have been statements of<br />
Government policy on that for many years since the situation<br />
worsened so seriously there. But iwas thinking in particular<br />
of the operatinnal service aspect and my interview was taking<br />
place in the open air after an aeroplane flight. I wouldn't<br />
regard it as iny lack of competence on anyone's part, including<br />
myown, if the language emerged as a rather loose statement of<br />
what I was trying to put. But I think I can explain it perhaps<br />
clearly enough to you here. We have explained, in considerable<br />
dReetgauilla, r tAhrem yn, e aendd foIr wial ln agtoi oonvaelr setrhvait ceg rOcuonmdp onaegnatin wfiotrh ytohue in<br />
some detail if you would wish me to refresh your minds on it. s / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
MR. HOLT ( Contd.) I don't think it is so widely known to members of<br />
the general public and I don't think we are-bgin arcisted in<br />
making the need, the purposes, and indeed the limits of tne<br />
National Service participation, known to the publio by the campaign<br />
which is based on an apoeal to emotions even stirring the feelings,<br />
or running the danger of stirring some feelings of hysteria from<br />
the manner in which the Opposition has commented on these matters.<br />
It will have been noted that there has been no practical<br />
alternative proposed by the Opposition even suggestion that<br />
we might have offered more attractive terms to people in the<br />
hope that they might volunteer can be of course answered by the<br />
facts of what we aid. We did offer the most attractive terms<br />
I think I am correct in saying that in the lower ranks of the<br />
Australian Regular Army, our servicemen are the highest paid in<br />
that ranking of any army in the world.<br />
Q. Nevertheless, Sir, do you feel worried about the extent to<br />
which the Australian public" are not adequately informed and are<br />
not responding in perhaps the way you might wish. This new<br />
dimension of our commitment..........<br />
MR. HOLT Well, when you say am I worried, I am naturally concerned.<br />
I am not lacking in faith and optimism that when the facts and<br />
the need and the limits of what is proposed are carefully<br />
explained in the detail that will be necessary and perhaps on the<br />
occasions in number that will be necessary, there will be the<br />
kind of response from the Australian people that will be consistent<br />
with the responsibility that they have shown in these matters in<br />
the past. We have never been an isolationist people. We have<br />
recognised that our responsibilities in protecting freedom extend<br />
beyond our own shores, and indeed it is preferable to meet the<br />
challenge beyond our own shores if this can be done, but if I may<br />
gn to this degree of explanation I think that too many people<br />
see what is ahead in the terms of two world wars when Australia<br />
called for volunteers for expeditionary forces that were away<br />
from this country for long years in the period or in the course<br />
of that service. Now, this is a very different situation that Australia<br />
faces today. We have a Regular Army with tasks allotted to it to<br />
meet the commitments, the obligations which Australia has undertaken.<br />
We have become an adult nation. We can't rest comfortably<br />
with the protection of the British Navy which we enjoyed about the<br />
period of the First Wcrld War, or Just look to an automatic<br />
response say from the Seventh Fleet of the United States if we<br />
get into any trouble at any time. We can lonk confidently to<br />
the support of the United States of America, our tested ally<br />
bound to us by treaty in ANZUS and SEATO, but those treaties<br />
carry obligations for us as well as for our Allies, and I would<br />
not resgrd the response that we are making in South Viet Nam as<br />
excessive, having regard to our treaty alliances.<br />
Q. ( Scales of the " Advertiser") Mr. Holt, do you consider that<br />
South Australian representation in Cabinet or the Ministry is<br />
sufficient to safeguard its interests? There is no representation<br />
in Cabinet and only one in the Ministry.<br />
MR. HOLT: Well, this is so and it is a matter for regret fir me as<br />
I am sure it is for South Australia, but while we do attempt to<br />
arrange the representation in the Cabinet on a basis which will<br />
secure some representation in each of the States, we also have to<br />
have regard to capacities and to the suitability of particular<br />
persons for the posts that we have for assignment to them. If you<br />
look a little more broadly at the matter South Australia with the<br />
Speakership, the Deputy Whipship and a place in the Ministry,<br />
isn't without representation at the official levels of the / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
MR. HOLT ( Contd.) Parliament. It so happens that at the moment you<br />
don't have a-Member in the Cabinet. We would hpve liked to have<br />
included one on the last occasion, but I am sure that Dr. Forbes<br />
himself would not have that his own limited experience at that<br />
point of time would have carried the day for him against the very<br />
much more experienced members &amp; f the Ministry who are now in the<br />
Cabinet. That is one reason in fact the principal reason why<br />
I arranged for him to take up the portfolio of Health rather than<br />
maintain that in the Army where he was doing a first-class job<br />
was that as Minister for the Army he was very much the Junior<br />
Minister operating under the general guidance of the Minister for<br />
Defence who was a Cabinet Minister. As Minister for Health he<br />
does have a domain of his own, and I am confident will show in that<br />
portfolio the qualities which will warrant promotion for him when<br />
opportunity offers later on.<br />
Q. ( Mrs. Nancy Buttfield of 5DN) This morning, the Governor of the<br />
Reserve Bank is reported to have said that the economy was nicely<br />
balanced in the state of uncertainty. If you agree that uncertainty<br />
is good for public confidence and therefore for the economy as a<br />
whole, do you anticipate that more may need to be done to help the<br />
economy other than what you have already done in extra money for<br />
housing and extra money for drought and immigration?<br />
MR. HOLT I am not sure what you have said puts quite fairly for<br />
him what the Governor had in mind. As I tried to explain to someone<br />
who put a similar question to me earlier if you think of a scale<br />
in balance the needle can hover around the mark which says balance<br />
and in that sense there is a little uncertainty if it hovers<br />
backvards and forwards from that balance mark. And this is the<br />
sense in which I am sure the Governor was using the term. In<br />
other words, the economy at the moment was neither moving strongly<br />
into inflation or moving strongly into recession. It was in a<br />
state of balance with certain factors working through which could<br />
affect the pace of growth. If we have good seasonal developments,<br />
if there is finally a breaking of the drought on what looks like<br />
being an enduring basis for at least some time in New South Wales<br />
and Queensland, then there is enugh steam in the economy to move<br />
steadily ahead. On the ether hand, if there are adverse developments,<br />
then I think the Government which has really given stimulus<br />
at various points its drought relief measures measures which<br />
are small but of a useful kind in relation to housing these things<br />
are just helping to keep the needle rather nicely balanced at the<br />
desired point.<br />
Q. ( Jeff Medwell of 5DN) Sume time ago, the A stralian Government<br />
announced that it was sending more troops to South Viet Nam at the<br />
request of the South Vietnamese Government. Just recently the South<br />
Korean Governmean announced that it was sending more troops to<br />
South Viet Nam in excnange for more economic aid from the United<br />
States, and at the request of the United States. Can you explain<br />
why one country sends troops at the request of America and the<br />
other sends troops at the request of South Viet Nam?<br />
MR. HOLT I wouldn't imagine for one moment that South Korea would<br />
be sending troops unless it was with the approval, and I should<br />
imagine at the request of, South Viet Nam. There is nothing<br />
mysterious or unlikely about South Viet Nam which is so sorely<br />
pressed it has over 300,00 of its own troops in the field<br />
asking for help where help can be giv. n. These matters are handled<br />
between governments on the basis of formality finally so that you<br />
don't have people imposed on one government against the will of<br />
that government. There was a clear understanding for some time<br />
that South Viet Nam would welcome whatever help could be given.<br />
Now, the South Koreans have every cause to be sensitive to pressures<br />
from Chinese Communism. They were within an ace of being overrun<br />
themselves. It was only by the most strenuous American resistance / 4 </p>
<p>4<br />
MR. HOLT ( Contd2-Biñ b-them and very substantialAmer-ican support-4That<br />
South Korea was held from a takeover by Communist China. I think<br />
that this is one of the influences affecting the decision of the<br />
Government of South Korea. It may well be that such decision<br />
imposed economic stresses on the Government of that country or<br />
the financing of the operation of their own troops imposed<br />
stresses on it. They might well have turned to the United States<br />
and said, " Will you help us economically if we are going to accept<br />
these burdens?" But I don't think I read too much significance<br />
into the fact that, on the face of it, we met a request, and on the<br />
face of it they supplied the troops apparently without a request.<br />
I am sure there would have been a continuing request which, in<br />
effect, is what we already have.<br />
Q. Mr. Holt what has to ha pen in South Viet Nam or in the<br />
vicinity of South iet Nam before the United Nations steps in?<br />
MR. HOLT I would of course, be very glad to see the United Nations<br />
step in, if it did so in a purposeful and effective way. It did<br />
so in the case of South Korea, but perhaps the issues are not so<br />
clear-cut in the minds of some members of the United Nations at<br />
this time. I think we must all recognise the political significance<br />
of the development of an Afro-Asian Bloc in which Chinese<br />
Commnist leadership played a very large part, and undoubtedly<br />
there are many members of the United Nations in that bloc who<br />
would not give support to any nation which seemed to be directed<br />
against Communist China. And I think this is the principal<br />
inhibiting factor. One other is, I think, the preoccupation of<br />
the countries of Western Europe with the problems of Europe.<br />
I had a European diplomat put it to me quite bluntly. He said<br />
" You won't get the Western European countries at this time thinking<br />
of South East Asia. They are all too much concerned with trying<br />
to hang on te a species of unity in Europe."<br />
Q. ( Stewart Cockburn) Even those, Sir, who are members of SEATO?<br />
Because Britain and France would have similar obligations to those<br />
of Australia under the provisions of the SEATO treaty.<br />
MR. HOLT The United Kingdom, of course, has been conducting its<br />
own recent Defence Review, ancepting obligations in relation to<br />
the Indonesian confrontation of Malaysia which have required a<br />
very lare build-up of British Forces in the area far larger than<br />
they would intend t maintain subsequently in that area so I<br />
think they feel they are making their valuable cortribution.<br />
The Americans are doing a big jrb in South Viet Nam.<br />
Q. The reason why I ask the guestion is that you are today<br />
reported as saying that the United States and other SEATO nations<br />
would probably consider it a serious disregard of our obligations<br />
if we were not actively participating in South Viet Nam. I am<br />
wondering how the fact that Britain and France are not actually<br />
participating as strongly as we are is explained?<br />
MR. HOLT Well, I repeat that the Americans know that the United<br />
Kingdom in addition et the obligations it has in NATO has assumed<br />
very substantial obligations in the Malaysian area and, of course,<br />
the United Kingdom doesn't possess these days the economic<br />
strength, particularly in relation to external capacity that it<br />
had in an earlier point of time. I don't think that the Americans<br />
would feel that Britain wasn't playing a considerable and<br />
appropriate part where it is. But looking at the Australian<br />
participation until we had made our recently announced decision,<br />
the numbers of Australians outside this country were not so very<br />
large and the contribution in that particular area was a<br />
comparatively small one. A very good battalion, but just one<br />
battalion. Se a </p>
<p>Q. ( Brian Taylor, Channel 7) Mr. Prime Minister, it appears that<br />
some people feel very strongly about the lack of information on<br />
the Viet Nam issue, particularly in regard to our increased<br />
commitments. If in yodr mind the situation does exist, has<br />
anything been done to rectify it?<br />
MR. HOLT Yes. It's not that there has been either lack of<br />
action or lack of will to et the story over more widely, and<br />
we have looked to the Parliament in recent days as one of the<br />
mmst effective mediums for getting the Government's policy aid<br />
intentions across but even there it is hard to cover the story<br />
in the detail that you wish to do so in the time and the<br />
opportunities available. I spent 20 minutes last night and<br />
really didn't touch more than the fringe of the matter. I would<br />
have liked to have explained the attempts being made to secure<br />
volunteers the fact that in none of the last three years did we<br />
have less than 9,000 volunteers coming forward in each of those<br />
three years, and in each of those three years we did not find more<br />
than 2,500 who measured up to the standards which the Army<br />
required. Now, when it was decided that we had to increase our<br />
force from say, 22,500 to 33,000 by 1967 to meet increasing<br />
dangers and problems which were seen in the area, our military<br />
advisers made it quite clear to us that you just couldn't get<br />
those numbers by the normal voluntary process. It was not a<br />
case of pay and conditions. Our re-engagement rate this is<br />
not well-khown our re-engagement rate in the Army is at about<br />
the highest level it has ever attained. Our re-engagement rate<br />
is 70 per cent., and these are men who have done their full term<br />
of service, not National Servicemen, but career Army men, and<br />
peGple don t re-engage at that rate if pay and conditions aren't<br />
atfractive to them. The rate has been as low as 40 per cent.<br />
Seventy per cent. is a high rate. So it wasn't that. In a<br />
fully employed society, you do find it difficult to attract young<br />
men to a Regular Army career. The National Service scheme was<br />
adopted as the fairest method. It only touches a fractional part<br />
of that age group. Only one in ten of the age group is called<br />
up and the pro ortion of those called up who wilI ever see service<br />
outside of Ausralia will be a very small one. So it is a<br />
relatively small proportion of that total age group.<br />
Q. Getting back to my final question on Viet Nam, when<br />
we were up there last year, we found that morale was very high.<br />
The soldiers felt a certain disinterest from Australia, and they<br />
were also ratler concerned about the anti-Viet Nam demonstrations.<br />
Has that in any way prompted your forthcoming visit to Viet Nam<br />
and other ports of call?<br />
MR. HOLT Well it was frankly an influence in my decision to<br />
go there. It so happens that the particular battalion which is<br />
coming to the end of its tour of duty would be leaving that area<br />
at no distant point of time, and I felt it appropriate that this<br />
battalion which had brought such credit to Australia and distinetion<br />
to itself should be thanked for its services if I could make the<br />
visit in that time, as well, of course, familiarising me in my<br />
present position as to conditions not only there but in several<br />
other posts where our troops are. But I agree that morale has<br />
been splendid and it is unfortunate that there should have been<br />
doubts created in the minds of these men serving so ably there<br />
that they didn't have wholeheartedly behind them the Parliament<br />
and indeed the Australian people as a whole. But I am sure that<br />
those who are serving do have-the gratitude and appreciation of<br />
the Australian people and * ust as their morale is high, I am glad<br />
to say that the morale of ? hose who have been called up that alse<br />
is high. They are turning Put splendidly, and those that are<br />
later to serve in reaudlar army units in any theatre of combat,<br />
I am sure will acquit themselves as well as the regular army men<br />
themselves. s / 6 </p>
<p>6<br />
Q. ( Frank Kennedy of the " Advertiser") We gather that you are<br />
interested in the Festival, Sir. Financial difficulties are<br />
holding up the building of a much-needed Festival Hall. Would you<br />
care ti tell us Sir what would be the attitude of your Government<br />
to any request from the South Australian Government in this matter?<br />
MR. HOLT Well, it would certainly, of course, be carefully<br />
studied. Our interest has been shown in the general sphere of<br />
cultural developments by the Elizabethan Theatre Trust contribution<br />
and by the regular contribution we make to the Adelaide Festival.<br />
We don't make it to all city festivals I might remind you. We<br />
don't make a contribution, for example, t9 M" omba. We don't<br />
believe it has attained quite the same cultural level as your own<br />
and yet I think there was a request for assistance for the Waratah<br />
Festival which also didn't attract Federal suppnrt. But I make<br />
the point that we have not been lacking in sympathy. Whether this<br />
is a matter which should more appropriately be financed by the<br />
people of this State from their own resources, or whether it is<br />
one which will justify some Commonwealth participation is a question<br />
which I would like to look at with the necessary documentation in<br />
front of me and some consideration of what we have found it fair<br />
and proper to do in similar circumstances in other States.<br />
Q. ( Len James of Radio 5AD) Mr. Prime Minister I would like to<br />
make a point of reference concerning the United States radio<br />
communication centre being built in Western Australia. I<br />
understand that the American partner or one of the American subcontractors<br />
has gone through the hoop and left quite a number of<br />
private Australian concerns small ones and large ones with<br />
debts owing to them of some few dollars to tens of thousands.<br />
Does the Federal Government compensate these people or is the<br />
Federal Government conversing with the United States Government<br />
over these things?<br />
MR. HOLT This matter has been looked at, I know, by Ministers<br />
who have activities relarant to the episode to which you refer or<br />
tj the events to which you refer. My colleague the Minister for<br />
Defence has commented on it. He is very much better informed on<br />
it than I am, but I understood his general view to be that when one<br />
took into account the circumstances cf the notification of people<br />
concerned in these matters that they have embarked on what might<br />
be fairly re! arded as commercial risk and they could hardly expect<br />
the general body of taxpayers to carry the consequences of their<br />
own lack of provision or care in the matter. That is putting it<br />
as I understand it from what I have heard and read but how far<br />
this matter is still before us is something I couldn't just answer<br />
off the cuff.<br />
Q. South Australia has been asking for financial assistance<br />
for beef roads in the State's North. Is there any plan by the<br />
Commonwealth Government to supply financial assistance to cover<br />
freight costs for restocking the North?<br />
MR. HOLT You mean in relation to the drought? They are two<br />
separate matters really. On the first one I would regard this<br />
myself as not being finally dealt with. There has been a request<br />
in earlier but the higher priority in what was not an unlimited<br />
provision of funds for beef road purposes has gone to roads further<br />
to the north, running across the top of Australia in Western<br />
Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland. But the Premier<br />
does not regard it as a closed matter. I doubt whether the<br />
Leader of the Opposition would see it as a closed matter. For<br />
my part, I still regard it as under active consideration. I am<br />
sure we will be hearing something more about it, seein there is<br />
a Loan Council meeting in June if not before then. It may be that<br />
we will find it more appropriate to deal with it then than at this / 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
MR. HOLT ( Contd.) point of time. On the second point, I have<br />
received a request. I did not actually see it but that might have<br />
been because I was preoccupied with other matters until last<br />
night. I do regard it as a matter which needs to be looked<br />
at quite urgently and I hope to get reply tc the Premier early<br />
next week. That s on the arought and freight assistance.<br />
Q. During your arrival at the Adelaide airport you must<br />
have found it uncomfortably crbwded because I don't think it<br />
is possible for a plane to come in and not have that effect.<br />
Do you think that you could think very seriously in the future of<br />
giving us added facilities at our Adelaide airport.<br />
MR. HOLT Well, again I think I would like notice of that one<br />
because I am not sufficiently well informed. I must say that<br />
when one looks at the Canberra facilities I think they rank<br />
about the bottom of any city which lays claim to that sert of<br />
title. I used to feel badly about it until having travelled<br />
overseas and being compelled to carry my bag through long<br />
interminable passages in these great glittering airports of<br />
other countries, I felt a little more kindly disposed to our<br />
more accessible terminals here. But all I know is that my<br />
colleague the Minister for Civil Aviation puts up a very costly<br />
programme of civil aviation works and I am sure that Adelaide<br />
would be justly dealt with by him out of those funds, but I<br />
can't say from my own knowledge much about it.<br />
Q. ( Ron Boath, Southern Cross newspaper) Does the Federal<br />
Government plan any extension for aid to independent schools?<br />
MR. HOLT You mean additional to the provision that has been<br />
made? The origin of this matter I think, is well known. In<br />
Canberra we tock action to assist the schools there which were<br />
coping with a quite abnormal situation, and from that beginning<br />
we have extended our assistance in a manner which you were<br />
well aware of at the time of the last general election. But<br />
I am not aware of any proposal currently before us for any<br />
extension. I will be surprised if we didn t receive requests<br />
for further extensions, but it is customary to deal with these<br />
at Budget time, sometimes even at election times.<br />
Q. ( Jeff Medwell) Do you believe that the new Indonesian<br />
anti-communist regime will result in a lessening of its<br />
confrontation policy in Malaysia?<br />
MR. HOLT Now, are we on the record or are we off it?<br />
Q. I think so, Sir.<br />
MR. HOLT Well, I prefer not to say too much about that matter<br />
because noreof us can be sure at the moment what attitude will<br />
emerge from this regime but I amqiite certain that it would<br />
not e very helpful to that regime for it to be felt inside<br />
Indonesia that this regime was going to abandon the confrontation<br />
policy.<br />
Q. ( Stewart Cockburn): Following up that question, Sir, is the<br />
Minister for External Affairs likely to visit Indonesia and<br />
take the opportunity to meet the new regime there and satisfy<br />
himself of the probable policies of the new Government? 0 / e </p>
<p>8<br />
MR. HOLT What I have just said on the other matter has a<br />
bearing n your question, too. There is virtue in a little<br />
patience, I think, in this field. But as I indicated in the<br />
House yesterday, we have maintained even through the difficult<br />
confrontation period, a basis of friendship in our general<br />
relations with Indonesia. de wish to live in cordiality, as<br />
I said yesterday with them. certainly think that it is<br />
unfortunate in their owm interests that a country with their<br />
tremendous natural resources hasn't succeeded in building up a<br />
considerable trade with not merely Australia but other<br />
cimopunrotrveiemes nto f itnh et haatr ead, i raencdt ioinf, thiet wnoeuwl dr egbei mew elecfofmeec. t s sBoumte our<br />
interest in Indonesia is not primarily a commercial interest,<br />
and it is the interest that one neighbour has for the other,<br />
particularly when the other has a rather restless turbulent<br />
population of 100 million people.<br />
Q. ( Barry Tornquist of the " News") How do you enjoy life as<br />
Prime Minister?<br />
MR. HOLT: Well, I am enjoying it. I enjoyed life as<br />
Treasurer. I enjoy it in most capacities, as I think my<br />
friend Nancy would know. But I find it a very stimulating<br />
occupation. I think my anly criticism of it is that it<br />
doesn't leave me very much time to behave as a human being. </p>
