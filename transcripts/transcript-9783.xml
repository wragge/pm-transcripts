INEI KING POINTS THE HON P J KEATING MP AUSTRALIANRMAN<br />
ASSOCIATION, ' PARTNERSHIP 2000' TRADE AND<br />
rESTMENT CONFERENCE, THURSDAY 5 OCTOBER 1995<br />
It is a great pleasure to join you for this conference and to welcome this<br />
senior German business group to Australia and particularly. to welcome the<br />
German Posts and Telecommunications Minister Dr Boetsch as its leader.<br />
S I promised'Chancellor Kohl when we met in March that I would come<br />
personally to this conference as a means of underlining the importance I<br />
attach to building stronger tics between Germany and Australia business<br />
and investment ties, of course, but not only those. Earlier this week I was in<br />
Sbuth Australia, which has a long historical link with Germany and German<br />
culture. I was there in part for the re-opening of the magnificent Palm<br />
House at the Botanic Garden, designed by Gustav Runge and manufactured<br />
S in Bremen listening to the Stuttgart Chamber Philharmonic and reflecting<br />
on all the things Australia has drawn from Germany. I am glad the cultural<br />
flow is not all one way. The Sydney Symphony Orchestra has just completed<br />
a very successful tour of Germany. My wife Annita had the opportunity to<br />
be with them, including at a concert given to a very large and enthusiastic<br />
audience at Christian Georgi's Bremer WoUlkammerei.<br />

i~ In Germany earlier this year I hadtwo particular messages I wanted to get<br />
across and I want to repeat them today,<br />
S First, is my conviction that Australian business people need to do more in<br />
Europe, and that if we are to. maximise the opportunities available to us there,<br />
we have to look beyond the English Channel this is not to downplay our<br />
economic links with Britain, but to recognise that there is much more to<br />
Europe than is covered by the route map of the London Underground: and,<br />
above all, that means Germany, which accounts for almost one quarter of<br />
European GDP, is the world's third largest economy and its second largest<br />
xporter and importer.<br />
, There is no doubt that our trade and investment relationship with Germany<br />
falls short of its potential. Germany is our seventh largest trading partner,<br />
with two-way trade around $ 6 billion, but only our 15th largest export<br />
madka. andoor exports have been falling so there is clearly much more for<br />
Aintahin innss to do on that front and I hope thi conlr e helps<br />
PRIME MINISTER </p>
<p>2<br />
The investment relationship is in better shape. Germany is our 9th larpst<br />
source of foreign investment, and more than 200 subsidiaries of German<br />
companies operate in Australia. They represent some of our most respected<br />
companies. In the other direction, Australian companies like Boral, Pioneer,<br />
Brambles, TNT, ANIand AMCOR are active in Germany but here again<br />
you can't help feeling that there is more of mutual benefit to squeeze from the<br />
relationship than we have yet managed.<br />
I hope our German visitors will have the opportunity to see some of the gicat<br />
economic, and social strengths of this country a highly skilled Workforce,<br />
with a strong emphasis on training, lessons we have drawn directly from<br />
Germany's experience a deep pure research base an economy which puts<br />
a. premium on growth, and which has now delivered growth for 16<br />
consecutive quarters, and which is becoming more international ( exports<br />
havec nearly doubled as a share of GDP since the early 1980s) and more<br />
competitive ( international competitiveness increased by 36 between 1983<br />
4nd 1995)<br />
9. 9 The other major point I want to get'across is that there is no contradiction or<br />
tension between the Australian Government's determination to integrate<br />
Australia more deeply into the Asia Pacific and our desire to strengthen our<br />
tics with countries like Germany -: in fact, the reverse is true: Australia's<br />
engagement with Asia makes us much-more, not less, relevant to Europe a<br />
prosperous Australian economy which is integrated into the region around us,<br />
using all the resources of our multicultural society, has much more to offer to<br />
Germany and other European countries, as a direct trade and investment<br />
partner, as an investment base into Asia, and in cooperative activities in third<br />
markets we have already seen successful German Australian investment<br />
" partnershipsi n Asia like the Leighton-AEG venture to construct the Hong<br />
on~ n~~ ai.-<br />
" t is very good, to have Dr Boetsc, hleading this mission because<br />
telecommunications and information technology offer huge potential for this<br />
sort of co-operation telecommunications equipment is already one of the<br />
fastest growing components of our bilateral trade and in the wider Asia<br />
. Ptcific region, expenditure on-telecommunications services and equipment is<br />
expected to reach nearly $ 300 billion by' 2010.<br />
. m The reason for the timing of my visit to Germany earlier this year was to<br />
attend CeBIT, in which Australia had been invited to participate as a partner<br />
country. This. was an honour for us, but it was a reflection of what has been<br />
happening in Australia in this area our long history of technological<br />
S. excellence in telecommunications broad band networks expanding across<br />
the country world's heaviest per capita users of the Internet and second<br />
highest per capita users of personal computers.<br />
K<br />
I. I a S'S </p>
<p>3<br />
So this area, again, offers great opportunities for both Of us hope Australian<br />
if and telecommunications companies will -use the success of CeBIT this<br />
year as a base to build on at, next year% exhibition.<br />
Congratulations to the Australian-Germani Association especially -Mr<br />
Tretbowan and Dr Rohkamm, President of the German counterpart<br />
organisation, on their work to set up this conferece I wish you every<br />
success with it. </p>
