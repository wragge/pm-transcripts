They arc retained in the now lo jisltion.<br />
Additionally it is nocossary to ] aoa it clear * chit the<br />
Board may roject a candidnto who bacauso if cL: racter,<br />
including police record, etc., or for ' othier josd re:' soui is<br />
not considered to be suitable for ndnissijn to the Public<br />
Service. The Woard, in ti1o past, hias boon ; Torting on the<br />
assumption thiat it hias the ordinary rilits of an amployer to<br />
decide whiethAor a candidate for : vpp.) int1Lent mow; ts the<br />
standard of cheractor and into ' rity w; hich is clearly<br />
assential. But thiarc is soma doubt nbout this and thiewefore<br />
there is included in Clause 11 if the Bill Section 34~( c) of<br />
the now A. ct, a privision to anable the Woard to be satisfied<br />
that a candidate for ippaintiuent is n fit and proper person to<br />
be an officer of thecimnw; t. Service.<br />
Th2-G: v -= nment has adopted the .3ywr Comittoe<br />
re c-z-iie-, ndation that the heaving Crtificate standvr? stould<br />
be the firm minimum roq'oirorlcnt for entry to the Third<br />
Division if the Public Sarvica. This is a most inportant<br />
roco-Trendati~ n. Entry to the Third Division in this context<br />
includos Leaving Certificate entry, appointment of sxservicemen<br />
whao uere provl ously oligible for app:. int~ oont at<br />
about Intarmediate Cetificate ! o. val, and also transfers from--<br />
the Fourth to thc Third Division, which is Sons by internal<br />
exanima tion. it wu'uld be difficult to bring dmlo,., islation<br />
owing to the need to take 2c count if tHe variation in<br />
educational standards as oKt-reen ths States, Hence tho<br />
Government fools that it wrould be preferable fir the Public<br />
Service Board to give effect t this reciomriation by<br />
administrative action. The lasisl~ ti rn thox-fore loaves it<br />
to the Woard to ' i. terino the standards of ontry, but it is<br />
the clear intention that anf ' cxamination at the love! and<br />
standard of the Now Si; uth qales Leaving Crtificate will be<br />
the firD!:~ nPu7 standard fo) r entry to the Third Division of<br />
the Service, with equivalent examinations in other States<br />
for example, the Senior Vublic in quoonslanG.<br />
This t-iinir. un standard will apply both on first<br />
appointment to the Third Division and on transfor from the<br />
Fo. urth to the Third Division, alth ) u: h the latter " ay need to<br />
be put into affact woe a period.<br />

The Wor C'miit a as Palo recommendations which<br />
are designed to facilitcto; recruitment ' of univoysity<br />
Iraduztos Moh have had w~ rk experience outside the ? ublic<br />

and oxpcrionco to : ioo spcial loods both in<br />

Tho Govriient supports these objectives and provision is<br />

Entry at university , raduate level will be freely<br />

It is prpsesd to : o tain the-pir ovisions of the<br />
Principal Act which per-i-it the icard to r. ake app-intme-Onts<br />
free. outside the Co: 1jE: nweolt[ Service, subject to certain<br />
sfeguards and to the istablished selection proceduro; s<br />
: 1owefvr, the now Section 38, rhich re-enacts the eld Section<br />
47, will be lii-ited in the future to the appoint--Int of<br />
persons of exceptinal bility and experience.<br />
A now -30ction 37 will be used fr-m'st of the<br />
appo) intmeionts o) f persons with professio) nal and spcialist<br />
qualificatins. Under bothl these Sections the rights of<br />
officers , ill be Drotocted.<br />
Criteria for] 2ro-.-Ltion:<br />
The 3ayor Commnittee rc-co1.: : e-nded that seniority as a<br />
criterion f-r promoT.-,. tion should be droDpped entirely froji, the<br />
Public Service ct and [, egulatic. ons,<br />
I wo) uld like) t m-ake it plain that we are on corir'. on<br />
rcund with the Comittee that seniority should nut be the<br />
solo, or even tho principal, basis for prom'iotiojn in<br />
ad, inistrative and senior clerical pests within the-<br />
Commi. onwecalth Public So*-vico. The Public Service A: ct<br />
proscribes that the criterion for roYjtion in the Second and<br />
Third Divisions of the Service is kfficiency It is only in<br />
a case of equality of me* rit that snio) rity is app. iod.<br />
In -xami, n in-this suggeost-ion, the Governme. ont was<br />
ir; prossdl withi the fact that the 3oyor C-1ittee s<br />
recOIujendations i-; ul ci extend net only to th-e Second an,-d Third<br />
Divisions of the Servic, but lso to the Fourth Division,<br />
which com; prises appro) ximately 66,000 o) fficers, and wurhich<br />
covers a groat variety of i. ployi~ nt including, skilled,<br />
sem-. i-skilled and unskilled . oerati-ons, typing staff, eerlaZ<br />
ffice assistnts, m-. inor clerical workrs, nd so on. The<br />
application of a pure efficiency test thughout the Fourth<br />
Divi-kn would present very i ald pori-ILyp6 JArslporablo,<br />
difficulties. The Gove: n.Ã± eL-,. nt is not convinced thaL thoi ; re) is<br />
a need to depart from the existing, pro., visions and pr-ceduros.<br />
In the G-, vci-.,: nt's view tlceoroj ust be a continuing<br />
quest fo&gt; r oerffaitceire ncy and the m! ost efficient officers<br />
should-be prferred fir promiot ion. The 3ill providos, in<br />
Clause 13, for an extensin nd a mre flexible application<br />
of the principle thlat in considering o) fficers fo) r prormlotion<br />

decisions. These re the em,, ployme: nt of Korried women and the<br />
iicl standards for ; ntry ) f ) Iysic-11ly haicapped prs ns. </p>
<p>The Public Service _ ct at present requires women<br />
members of the permanent Service to retire on marri. ge The<br />
Boyer Committee has recommended the repeal of this provision<br />
and an interdepartmental comm Uee is examining the<br />
implications of the proposal,, The Government will consider<br />
the problem carefully as soon as this Sork is completed.<br />
As to the proposed relaxation of medical standards<br />
for the . ppointment of physically handicapped persons, it<br />
should be remembered that the Government and the Public Servicc<br />
Board are mindful of their resp! onsf. bilities in the employment<br />
of the physically handicapped nd 0a eat deal is being done<br />
to provide employment in the Cnnion'Death Service for such<br />
people including those who are no longer physically fit to<br />
carry out their previous dutie's,<br />
fhile the problemis of thr -nh-) rficl 1 hrandicapped<br />
merit and do receive the Govurnment'S sympathetic consid ration<br />
there are difficult prob ems of definition as well as the need<br />
to maintain , n overall standard of medical fitness in a<br />
career Service. The Public Scrvice 3o_ rd has established a<br />
separate committee, including imedical authorities, to examine<br />
this question and the conclusions of this group will be<br />
considored by the Government<br />
ppointment of Permanent Heads:<br />
Å he Committoo has recomrinnded that Section 54 of the<br />
Public Sorvice ct be ca. mended so that the Public Service i3oard<br />
would be required to make a recomrnondaton to the Governor-<br />
General on all appointments as Permanent Head of a Department,<br />
and so that if the Governor-General appoints a person other<br />
than the person recommonded by thle 3oerd, the roasons for the<br />
rejection of the Board's recommndation should be reported to<br />
the Parliamnent. It has been mPy consistent practi. ce as Prime<br />
iinistor, as I understand i was the pri ctice of my<br />
predecessor, iir. Chifloy, Lc consult with the Chairman of the<br />
Public Service Board rhen appointments to positions of<br />
Permanent Hoad are required. This I regard as a most desirable<br />
practice, and one which I would therefore hope will be<br />
continued by all future Governments. The Government has not,<br />
however, thought it desirable to mnd the present section of<br />
the Act in the way recommnded by the Boyer Committoo.<br />
nRo-shapjitnhn e Second Division:<br />
The Second Division of the Soevice includes officors<br />
who are required to .: eorcise oxocutive : nd professional<br />
functions in the more important positions. The iBoyor<br />
Committo&amp; rocommends that the definition of this Division<br />
should be amonded to road " administrative or executive functiors<br />
and officers in training to exLrcise such functions". The<br />
object of the recommrondation is to improve the efficiency of<br />
the service by a clearer definition of the " administrative<br />
career", which. the Committoo belioves can be achieved with the<br />
least dislocation by a : odification of the Second Division.<br />
3asically, the Soya:: Comittco sccks a distinction<br />
betwoen those positions which have an i-porant policy advising<br />
element and those whic-have not; and therefore positions of<br />
a purely managerial or professional character, containing no<br />
policy advising clamoeat; s, would renmain in the Third Division.<br />
The Second Division vould include al' positions with an<br />
important policy-advising elor: nttogethur with intermodiate<br />
positions that night Ãµ orm part of an administrative career,<br />
and below theom a trairing grad. with positions suitablo for<br />
administrative torainiag.<br />
C </p>
<p>6.<br />
The 3oyor Committoee was concerned that snior<br />
officers in the Service . are too immersed in routine work and<br />
do not got " time for thinking" and in making its recommondation<br />
it had the very laudable objective of attracting and making<br />
the best use of officers with creative ability, and of<br />
encouraging self-improv) eront.<br />
The Government supports the objective of the Boyer<br />
Cormittoe. It fooeels, however, that the methods by which the<br />
Boyor Committoo sought to 3chieve this objective, namely the<br />
creation of an administrative civil service along the lines of<br />
the United Kingdom, would not be suitable in the present<br />
circumstances of the australian civil service. Th3 Government<br />
feeools that the future requirements in staffing the Second<br />
Division of the Service can be achieved by more flexible<br />
recruitment provisions and the continuance of advanced<br />
training programmes, assistance to officers taking university<br />
courses, use of external training facilities such : s the<br />
iustralian . dministrztive Stff Collogo, use of the A'ustralian<br />
universities and overseas institutions for advanced specialist<br />
study, and other r. methods. This is the present approach by the<br />
Public Service Board and it will be intensified from time to<br />
time as the demands of the public Service increase.<br />
It will be clear to honourable members that the<br />
availability of an adequate number of people, trained and<br />
expert in functions of policy advising and policy adieinistration,<br />
is so important that recruitnunt methods, including<br />
the composition of the Second and Third Divisions of the<br />
Service should be kept constantly under revie. i and the Public<br />
eorvice Board has beeon asked to ensure that this is done.<br />
Preference to Ex-servicomon:<br />
Since the First orld Tar, ox-servicron have<br />
enjoyed the following concessions:-<br />
Proforonco in appointnment over other candidates<br />
Eligibility for appointment up to ag 51 yoars.<br />
Lower medical standards where the mdical condition<br />
results from war service<br />
Reduced oducational standards in particular, the<br />
acceptance of a qualification of Intermediate<br />
oxamination standard for appointnont to the Third<br />
Division.<br />
In the view of the Boyer Con. iittec, the efficiency<br />
of the Service will be imiproved if rmininmur aducational<br />
standards for appointment are fixed and appliod evenly at the<br />
various levels of recruitr. ent. The legislation provides<br />
therefore that ex-scrvicunin will continue to receive<br />
preference in appointment as against other candidates Aiho are<br />
not ex-servicwen only whor-c thor. is equality in qualificatiors<br />
They will retain ] i gibility for appointmeont up to<br />
age 51 and receive tlhe sime concessions as to medical<br />
standards as exist at present. Howver, they will be<br />
required in other respects to qualify for appointreient at the<br />
same standard c. nd und,' r u<br />
candidatos. Clause 35 of the Bill makos an exception in<br />
favour of ex-serviceeaon who have attained the minimum.<br />
qualifications for appointnent which have pruviously appli. ed<br />
and who a-. re applicants for ii. mppeoOindtniaen-t oly before the<br />
date on which the new provisions of Division 4 of Part Three<br />
come into opertiln. nich wwxi-l-l s. rcrivmiacienm ne ligible<br />
for appointwyni by virtue of their existing qualifications.<br />
Opportunity Las bien taken to include other </p>
<p>7.<br />
amendments whichhave boon found to be necessary for the<br />
effective administration of the Public Service. One such<br />
amendment gives the Board authority to determine conditions of<br />
service for the increasingly complex section of the Public<br />
Service on duty overseas, where conditions vary from post to<br />
post. I conclude my remarks by saying that in Australia we<br />
are fortunate to have a Public Service of great integrity,<br />
which is efficient and dedicated to its task of facilitating<br />
good government. It is certainly no reflection on the<br />
Service that the objective of the Bill before the House is to<br />
provide machinery for attracting more good recruits to the<br />
Service. I pointed out at the beginning of my speech that the<br />
establishment of proper standards of recruitment to the<br />
Service is essential to the development of a Public Service<br />
of the highest quality and integrity and is a first essential<br />
of good government. I conclud6 on this note and I conim ond<br />
the Bill to the House.<br />
