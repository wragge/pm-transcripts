PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED ON PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS 7 . LAURIE WILSON<br />
Question: Prime Minister, things got pretty heated today in Parliament. Was that<br />
really necessary, do you think?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No, I. don't think it is necessary,. and I really do think it is<br />
appalling Debate ought to be on the basis of argument, one way or<br />
another, and it ought to be responded to on that basis. I don't<br />
think I have ever seen or heard such a personal attack in the time<br />
I have been in Parliament, but, I take that to be a mark of people<br />
who. are totally devoid of arguments, and totally devoid of policies.<br />
Question: But don't you think you were being somewhat provocative-effectively,<br />
what you were doing was accusing the Labor Party per se, as being<br />
sympathetic to the Russian cause, in particular to the situation<br />
in Afghanistan.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Let's take what I said, quite exactly, because what I said, I think,<br />
is accurate that there is a thread in the Australian Labor Party<br />
which seeks to find excuses, or if not that, reasons why we should<br />
do nothing. Now, reasons why we should do nothing over the boycott<br />
of the Olympics Games, for example. Mr Hayden started by saying<br />
yes, he could be in favour of an effective boycott, yes, he would<br />
be if there is strong international support. Well, fair enough.<br />
But then if you believe, as he does, that an effective boycott would<br />
get the message through to the Soviet Union about the abhorrence that<br />
we all feel, more clearly and more strongly than anything else.<br />
Why does he now take a view which leads him to argue very strongly<br />
against any boycott. -The logic of his own earlier position should<br />
be that he would help us to argue for an ef fective boycott. It is no<br />
good saying, " If there is an effective boycott, I'll join it",<br />
after 40 other countries have joined it!' If you believe it you have<br />
got to argue for it.. So that is one very clear instance where a<br />
change in view by Mr Hayden now seeks to undermine the position<br />
that the Government has taken and therefore undermine our mark of<br />
disapproval of the Soviet Union. You could go on into other areas<br />
in what has been said about trade and the importance of the matter,<br />
which they also seek to diminish.<br />
Question: But, from the outset, Mr Hayden has always made the point that they<br />
were not in favour, that they did not support what happened in<br />
Afghanistan. Prime Minister:<br />
That is not in dispute, but if you don't support something, and if<br />
you believe it is serious-and if on all available advice to us,<br />
' it is serious-then you need'to do something about it.<br />
It is not good enough on the one hand to say, " We are opposed to the / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
Prime Minister: ( cant.)<br />
Rtussians moving into Afghanistan", then to seek to frustrate every<br />
single thing that the Government might do or seek to do to make sure<br />
t~ hat we along with others, exhibit a collective determination so that<br />
the Solriet Union will know it can't do that again, that there mustn't<br />
be -any nore Afghanistans.<br />
Now Mr Hayden has to make up his own mind where he wants to stand.<br />
He condemns -all right and I accept that. Wle all accept that.<br />
That is not in dispute, but what I do say is condemnation of a military<br />
invasion, involving units of the best armed army in the world<br />
going into a non-aligned country, going into a country that could<br />
offer a threat to no-one. No way could Afghanistan ever be a threat<br />
to the Soviet Union. Now, it is not good enough just to condemn<br />
what we say. that condemnation has to be brought through in as<br />
realistic a way as can be to the Soviet Union. Again, I put it all<br />
in the context of a kind of experience that the world has been<br />
through on earlier occasions. In 1936, everyone tried to make<br />
excuses, reasons for doing nothing nobody approved Hitler moving<br />
into the Rhineland, or I don't think they did. Nobody really<br />
approved them marching into Austria or approved them marching into<br />
Czechoslovakia, or approved Italy going into Ethopia, but what they<br />
sought on every hand to do was to argue that we mustn't do anything,<br />
that the free world, France and Britain, must sit back and let Italy<br />
and Germany do what they want. Against that background, the last<br />
World War started. Now, I've said on other occasions that I think<br />
what has~ happened now is equivalent to 1936 Germany marching into<br />
the Rhineland an d therefore the purpose-aof the United States<br />
and of others who support it, is to try and establish the circumstanceE<br />
where those other subsequent steps which occurred in the latter part<br />
of the ' 30s do not occur in the earlier part of the<br />
Question: Time may eventually show that the stance the Labor Party was wrong,<br />
but is it not provocatiAve to paint the sort of Inicture that gives the<br />
sort of feeling that you did to Parliament today suggesting there<br />
was a pro-Soviet feeling in the Opposition.<br />
Prime minister:<br />
There is just one point that I would like to make to you if I<br />
could. In 1938, Neville Chamberlain said this. " How horrible,<br />
how fantastic and incredible it is that we should be digging<br />
trenches and trying on gas masks here because of quarrel between<br />
people of whom we know nothing". He was speaking of Czechoslovakia,<br />
and that was after other events after the Rhineland, after Austria'-<br />
but still not enough to spur France and Britain into really believing<br />
that a stand was going to have to be made. Then we have Paul Keating<br />
saying, " Vraway from our area of interest, Australia<br />
is not threatened by Afhganistan. It is extremely dnlikely that the<br />
Soviet Union will attack Pakistan or Iran. Afterall, who-would want<br />
Pakistan, for that matter, who-would want Afghanistan?"<br />
Now that is exhibiting a lack of concern, a lack of interest in,<br />
people whose life is just as valuable as yours or mine. If the invasio:<br />
was closer to us, would they take a different attitude. I am not<br />
saying that the Labor Party is suppor * ting obviously that would be<br />
absurd and a terrible charge to make supporting the Soviet Union.<br />
But what I do say is that is if they seek to condemn the Soviet Union<br />
as they have, then in the circumstances that prevail,. that is not </p>
<p>-3<br />
]? rime Minister: ( cant.)<br />
enough, because the whole lesson of history is that once an imperial<br />
power starts out on an aggressive path, unless it is stopped by<br />
determination, it continues. And it is because nations did not<br />
recognise that in the 1930s that a World War in which tens of<br />
millions of people died occurred. It could have so easily been<br />
stopped on early occasions, and the stand that the President of<br />
of the United States is making, the joint communique that was<br />
issued by the French arnd the Germans just shortly before I arrived<br />
in Bonn a week or so ago that as I understand is taking the steps,<br />
making the statements, making the determination clear so the<br />
tragic errors of the kind that occurred between 1936 and 1939 will<br />
not be made between 1980 and some years hence. That'is.. what it is<br />
all about and I just do not understand why the Australian<br />
Parliament can't have a concerted view on this. Afterall, in<br />
the motion that was passed, that committed and Mr Hayden did not<br />
dissent from . it, he got up just towards the end of it and said we<br />
don't think it is quite as serious as the Government thinks, and<br />
therefore, e want a certain section deleted. But we did not accept<br />
that. He did not dissent from another part which said countries<br />
should act separately or in concert to take what action they could<br />
to make sure that the abhorrence of many of us, nations from around<br />
the world, is brought home to the Soviet Union But if you support<br />
that kind of statement as an expression of the Parliament's view,<br />
why then take steps to frustrate every single action that this<br />
Government has taken that would help make that necessary step. </p>
