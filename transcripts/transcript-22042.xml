    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce Australian support for initiatives to combat avian and pandemic influenza and to further liberalise trade and investment.</p>
<p>Australia has played a leading role in developing a coordinated regional response to avian and pandemic influenza.  In recognition of the threat, APEC leaders have made an unequivocal commitment to transparency and regional cooperation to prepare for a possible influenza pandemic.</p>
<p>Australia will provide $100 million over four years for initiatives to combat the threat of pandemics and other emerging infectious diseases within the region.</p>
<p>  Of this package, $90 million will be spent on bilateral assistance to enhance preparedness in regional economies and to support the work of multilateral institutions, such as the World Health Organisation.</p>
<p>  A further $10 million will be used for specific APEC activities on avian influenza.  In particular, Australia will provide $4 million funding and considerable logistical support to coordinate a simulation exercise in 2006 to test our region's preparedness and response mechanisms for a human-to-human outbreak; and to support the development of a register of experts who have specialist skills in human and animal health and disaster response from across the APEC region.  Mr Downer announced the remaining $6 million as support for APEC capacity building earlier this week at the APEC Ministerial Meeting.</p>
<p>In the event of an outbreak, these experts could be called together to respond rapidly, at the request of the affected economy and in support of multilateral agencies such as the World Health Organisation.</p>
<p>This significant package of assistance is in addition to the $41 million Australia has already committed since 2003 to combat avian influenza and other infectious diseases, including $15.5 million for Indonesia, $3 million for Vietnam and $8 million for Pacific states.</p>
<p>Australia also welcomed APEC's call for all WTO members to demonstrate political leadership and make concerted efforts, particularly on agriculture, to deliver an ambitious conclusion to the WTO Doha Round in 2006.</p>
<p>I was also pleased APEC leaders agreed to refocus efforts on concerns of the business community by tackling behind-the-border barriers to business activity, such as excess regulation and compliance costs.  Ongoing work to address business concerns will be a high priority for Australia in our host year in 2007.</p>
<p>Australia has also played a leading role in developing the Regional Movement Alert List which tracks lost and stolen passports.  Australia and the United States undertook a successful pilot of the system this year and encouraged other APEC economies to consider joining the initiative in 2006.  </p>
