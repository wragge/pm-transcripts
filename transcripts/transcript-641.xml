ANNUAL GNEACONVENTION OF rT* IIÃ± N,, S<br />
OF jE JJI. BERJAL A<br />
AT SYDNEY--' Otc 13: 11M1.9R6 2<br />
Sir, Parliamentary colleagues and Ladies anid Gentlemeni<br />
I have learned at least th-Yroe things since I arriTed<br />
hero tonight, and for an old fellov like ma to lea-rln anything<br />
is such a novelty that-to learn tharee tG11ngs is quite exciting,,<br />
( Laughiter), The first thing is that I hlave some resemblance<br />
t~ o a gentleman whom I don't know the President of Puerto<br />
R-Iro4 Now if I had known ' that you wer: ie going in for these<br />
analugies, I would ' nave hired from. a theatrical outfi-uter a<br />
very straggling dark beard and would have-presented myself to<br />
you as the President of Cuba. ( Laughter) ( Applause)<br />
The second thning T have learned I warn. my<br />
col]. oague, Senator Spooner is one thiat I will in future<br />
employ inr thie Cabinet room,) I aTA in thae habit of letting<br />
every Ministea.' who wants to say something., say s.-mething<br />
sometimes briefly and sometimes at considerable length. But<br />
i have learned tonight thiat the right drill is to hear a little<br />
argument not too rnuca arnd th; say, 17Those whlo agree with<br />
me, 3ay ' Aye'" and if a loud noise comes out, I say, de-clare<br />
it carried6( Laughter) You have no idea how mnuch time thiis<br />
will save me in future, ' in Canberra. 6 ( Laughater)<br />
Tlie th) ird thing I have . laarned ia that it Is not a<br />
bad idea when people have spa echios to mraike with! I which you may<br />
not agree, to make them stand -in a corridor with so many pillars<br />
in, it that you can't see tbhem at all., ( Laught'er) I could sec<br />
Bill Arthur and hoar him well, I aeheard him before toda-,<br />
But two or three speakers here, standing in the middle will go<br />
don,, n in my meomory as diser~ bo-dicd voices0 ( Laughiter) I~ think<br />
perhaps,~ Bill, we inight do something about thiat in the Cabinet<br />
room anid have a broad. pillai!, put between you and me and between<br />
Bill Mci~ a'ncn and me ( Lsrnghter and then uhat will-bc th. a result, 7<br />
, Je don't undertake to sa-y0<br />
Bat, Sir. I am very gl~ ad to have: com--e in h. ere just<br />
at the end of a d.-SCus: L* Lr. about thle United States of<br />
America boc. iuso thLis is onie mat tat I was going to say somethling<br />
to you about, I don' t th-ink we are so badly k-nown in<br />
America. I don'-t think so,, I can :, omembe~ r years ago before<br />
he wa r, one could go tUg t U ne Stte of Amyzerica and<br />
find the vaguest possible ideas as to wheore Austral. ia was0<br />
Indeed, oncza I went into a shop in San Francisco and the feJllow<br />
identifying my accent as something weird and wondercftil, Saidi<br />
to mn, " Where do you come from?" I saidg, " I come from Australia,"<br />
and he said, " Where's thiat?" " Well, I said, " don't you kn) ow?"<br />
He said, " IT ought to know0 I have an idea it's out on the<br />
East1 Coast.' ( Laugter) But i must say that after the Second<br />
Wqar, I nave not found anything of that kind, For aL ra nme<br />
of young Americans we have become muchi better knownm than we were.<br />
Ard on the Government level, I amn ba-. und to say that I thiil., and<br />
I say it ww th great p1Loa' sulco that cur stocks are high withn the<br />
Administration of thae Unditod'Statcs0Indeed in that supnosced<br />
s-ink, of iniquity, Ne-, w-York, wich happens to be the centre of a<br />
great deal of private financiJ'al en-terprise in the United. States,<br />
our stocks are so h-igh t[ hat cuar credit rating to use that<br />
abominable expression is hi. glier than u: erhaps any other country<br />
in the world) 0 a0a 0/ 2 </p>
<p>But I wanted to refer to the United States of America<br />
because quite recently there have been arguments going on as<br />
you have all noticed and, indeed, I have seen them continued<br />
on the Agenda Pape-r about Australian defence, I am not going<br />
to enter into a long disquisition about Australian defence.<br />
My distinguished colleague, the Minister for Defence recently<br />
made, with our full approval., a considered statement on tiis<br />
matter which, in most quarters I think, has been pretty well<br />
received, But I think that as Liberals and that's what we<br />
are here tonight we really ought to clarify our minds by<br />
going back to the basic differences between ourselves and our<br />
opponents those basic matters which determine on wthat side<br />
we are, You can have all sorts of arguments of detail and I<br />
don't resist them and I don't resent them. They are all very<br />
healthy, But if we get so taken up with arguments about<br />
particulars that we forget that we have basic differences a. Id<br />
that these are the things that create the whole Parliamentary<br />
controversy in Australia, then we will all into a most grievous<br />
error. I wonder if we all remember that the Labor Party,<br />
the Australian Labor Party, not so long ago committed itself<br />
to the proposition, and it regards this as its pride and joy,<br />
that we should seek to establish a nuclear-free zone in the<br />
Southern Hemisphere, that no nuclear weapons should either be<br />
established in the Southern Hemisphere, or fired from the<br />
Southern Hemisphere, or stored in the Southern Hemisphere, or<br />
in any way used from the Southern Hemisphere, This has been<br />
their categorical statement,<br />
This. afternoon when I got back I blush to tell you<br />
from looking at a very, very good innings by Norman O'Neill,<br />
I read the Communist Review and it, of course, seized the<br />
Labor doctrine with the warmest possible approval and claims<br />
it as a triumph for a long-sustained Communist propaganda,<br />
Now just think about it. This is one of those catchpenny ideas.,<br />
calculated to appeal to us if we don't think. Wouldn't it<br />
be wonderful to have a Southern Hemisphere which was immune from<br />
all the possible trials and struggles of the Northern Hemisphere,<br />
Wouldn't it be a wonderful thingo This is what they say, in<br />
effect if in Australia we could live quietly and comfortably<br />
while Great Britain and the United States and Western Europe<br />
and the Soviet Union tore each other to pieces. Even stated<br />
in that way, you know, it doesn't appeal very much, does it?<br />
Look at it a little further.<br />
We have, and. it's thanks to your present Government<br />
that we have it an ANZUS pact with the United States the<br />
United States Australia, New Zealand under which we all come<br />
to each other s aid in our mutual defence. If somebody attacks<br />
us, if somebody attacks Australia, then we know that the United<br />
States of America will come to our aid. Not a bad thing for<br />
us, don't you think? Not a bad thing for us to have, metaphorically,<br />
alongside of us the greatest power in the modern worldo<br />
Do we want to dispose of it? If you had secret ballot, would<br />
you vote to repeal the ANZUS pact? Would you vote to say that<br />
Australia should have no alliance with the United States?<br />
If that's the way you feel then you can support the Labor<br />
Party's recent policy with complete conviction. Because that's<br />
what they are saying to the United States and T know that<br />
the United States understands this because I've been there<br />
twice this year and I have discussed this very problem with<br />
them, Suppose Australia is attacked say by Communist China,<br />
directly or through devious routes, attacked some day by a<br />
country which today has seven hundred million people and which<br />
is reaching out into South East Asian countries Laos o 00 aP<br />
C </p>
<p>moderately successfully North Viet Nam, successfully South<br />
Viet Narm placed in a state of imminent peril so it goes<br />
down the map, towards Australia suppose Australia is<br />
attacked with nuclear weapons and who is there here tonight<br />
who can say that won't happen some day and suppose the United<br />
States of America said to us, " Very well. Now we are going<br />
to come ino We are going to take a hand in this, You are<br />
friends. You are our allies. We accept responsibility for<br />
you," And we say to them, " Well, that's all right but you<br />
can't put a nuclear weapon on Manus Island in our defence,<br />
because it's south of the Fu. ator; and you can't bring in any<br />
ballistic missile into Australian territory and fire it deeply<br />
into the strongholds of your enemy because we are South of<br />
the Equator, In other words," United States of America, you<br />
can defend us, thank you very much, with conventional weapons<br />
but in the event of a global nuclear contest, you keep out,"<br />
Now, what nonsense it iSo Does anybody suppose that any one<br />
of us wants to see a war of this disastrous kind; but how<br />
suicidal, recognising that such a war is always possible, for<br />
us to say to the United States of America and to any other<br />
power Great Britain " You keep out of the Southern Hemisphere,<br />
You attend to your business North of the Equator, We won't<br />
have you here."' Now, ladies and gentlemen, if such a grim event<br />
happened nobody in Australia could be found to warn the<br />
United States off the course any more than anybody could be<br />
found in the last war to warn the United States off the<br />
course and say, " You are not to come in here. You are not<br />
to come into New Guineao You are not to fight in our defence<br />
in our own area," Yet the tragedy is that our opponents have<br />
made this great single contribution tthought, They have<br />
said, " A nuclear-free zone south of the Equator, and we don't<br />
want any ally who is not prepared. to respect it." Well I've<br />
been Prime Minister a long time as you know and I have found<br />
a fair number of extraordinarily difficult problems to consider.<br />
I find no difficulty in this one, I will never be heard to<br />
say to the United States, " You keep out" if we are in danger,<br />
Nor would you, But our opponents, who are now masquerading<br />
for the first time I think; I am not sure as advocates<br />
of improved defence for Australia, nullify the whole of their<br />
argument by striking at its very basis, by striking what they<br />
. intended to be or what they ought to understand to be a<br />
deadly blow at the ANZUS alliance which is increasingly the<br />
sheet anchor of Australian security,<br />
Well, . thapte rihaps enables me to go on a little<br />
from that point, because what I have been saying to you about<br />
that merely exhibits what I'll call an isolationism of mind.<br />
Now, we came into existence as a party because we were not<br />
isolationists in mind. I don't mean merely in terms of<br />
defence, I don't mean merely in terms of international<br />
relationso I mean in every sense of the word. The soul of<br />
Liberalism is that we are not divided into little isolated<br />
units. We don't say, " Well, we are manufacturers and therefore<br />
we couldn't care less about anybody elseo" We don't say<br />
" We are primary producers and we couldn't care less about<br />
anybody else," We don't say, " We are employers" or " We're<br />
this or we're that and we couldn't care less about other<br />
people," There are plenty of pressure groups in the country.<br />
There are plenty of pressure groups in the world. The whole<br />
of the remarkable events of the last ten days brought to a<br />
point by the courage and skill of the President of the United<br />
States ( Applause) the whole of those events has arisen<br />
because of the existence in the world of pressure groups, the<br />
O. a0 0. 0/ 4 </p>
<p>grca't Communist pressure group not only in1 the Soviet Union<br />
but in all, the satellite countries of Europe -a pressure<br />
group reaching its way out into Asia9 into Africa, constantly<br />
maintaining tension, constantly making people Live with the<br />
fear in th~ e back of thieir minds of disasters to come this<br />
is the greatest pressure group0 But wo have some ourselves.<br />
It is in a sense the age of the pressure group. It is in a<br />
sense a period of time, politicllyaditrainlyi<br />
which people seek to promote differences, seek to promote a<br />
clash of interests, so that in the waters so stirred up they<br />
may fish to their own advantage.<br />
We are Liberals, we are not a sectional party.<br />
We represent no pressure group. It is our historic mission in<br />
Australia to see that the interests of the community as a whole<br />
at all times prevail over the interests of any individual jr<br />
any group. This is our great mission in Australian politics.<br />
And I really came tonight so that I might remind you of it and<br />
beg of you never to lose sight of it. Are we the employers'<br />
party? Are we the employees' party? Are we the party of the<br />
rich or the party of somebody else? Our opponents will<br />
frequently try to pretend that we are, but the fact is that<br />
we have frequently reached our most unpopular moments by<br />
running contrary to what were the superficial interests of<br />
people whom we were supposed to represent in Parliament.<br />
( Applause) I remember this and remember i~ t with considerable<br />
satisfaction ( Applause) and we've done that and we'll continue<br />
to do that because we believe that the whole is greater than<br />
the part, we believe that Australia has interests as Australia<br />
and that the people of Australia, men, women and children,<br />
have interests superior to those of any particular group or<br />
section. ( Applause) And therefore I say to you, " Away with<br />
all this pressure group idea." Personally, I ea sick to death<br />
of it and I am happy to say it no longer retains the fain~ test<br />
impact on my reasoning mind. The Liberal Party of Australia<br />
is a unique experiment in the history of ! nstralian politics.<br />
Just let me remind you of it because this is not<br />
only our future task but it's part of the pride that we ought<br />
to have in our own history. I have been in Parliament, one<br />
way and another, man and boy, for a long, long tire, and ever<br />
since I was a boy at school, I have been hearing politics<br />
talked in the house. Therefore I night claim in a rough and<br />
ready fashion to know something about politics in Australia.<br />
But look back on it. d'hon did we ever have a completely<br />
concerted body until this party was established? I was<br />
Leader of tGhe Opposition from 1943 on and I very well remember<br />
sitting down and casting up how many organization-there were<br />
that were theoret'ically on our side in politics in Australia,<br />
and there were fourteen. Fourteen. Well, you remember when<br />
Woodrow Wilson produced his fourteen points, old Clemenceau<br />
said, " Le bon Dieu n'avait que dit," 1 Ten was enough he<br />
thought, for the Lord0But we had fourteen like Woodrow<br />
Wilson0 And with an effort, with a lot of understanding men<br />
and women, we created a party of one out of a dispersed number<br />
of groups of fourteen0 I dontt think this ever happened<br />
before. There have been parties, there have been compromises,<br />
There have been changes across the floor of the House. I<br />
don't think in the history of Federation until then, we had<br />
over had one party which was united not by a series of<br />
particular doctrines but by a consuming faith, a faith which<br />
is superior to doctrine or to dogma. We had people who a year<br />
before were arguing with each other because " You're a bit too<br />
far to the Right you're a bit too far to the Left" -some of<br />
you will remember this; and then we realised, all of a sudden,<br />
a o a </p>
<p>that there's room for many mansions even in our heaven, tha. t<br />
there is room for many views in a party which gets together and<br />
which has one ultimate faith, Let us argue on the sidelines<br />
about what we think of this, or this, or this. I dont grudge<br />
all the argument that you will have on the various resolutions<br />
that are on the Notice Paper. I~. 1 read others when we come to<br />
our Federal Council Meeting. And I'll say, " Good, Let's fight<br />
it out. Let's thrash these things out, but don't let us believe<br />
that the details are more important than the whole," Don't lot<br />
us believe for one moment that we ought to allow our magnificent<br />
unity in our task to be dispersed by partisan disputes, Now<br />
this is tremendously important in Australia, Tremendously,<br />
We've been in office a long time, I know even<br />
my best friends when they meet me in the street will say to<br />
me, ' By jove, old man, now how long is it that you've been in<br />
office?" Well I shrug my shoulders and admit to the truth<br />
and they say, 1Oh, yes. It's a long time," And I wonder what<br />
they are thinking about in their minds, ( Laughter) Now,<br />
I've no great ambitions on these matters Any man who is not<br />
content to have been the Prime Minister of his country for a<br />
quarter of its Federal history is greedy and I hope nobody<br />
will think I am greedy. ( Laugher) So don't think I am<br />
displaying any personal interest on this matter ( Applause) but<br />
I tell you that much more important than who is Prime Minister,<br />
much more important than who is a Minister, is the importance<br />
of this party as a party not growing old in its ideas, not<br />
losing sight of its historic mission,<br />
Men may grow old; wome. n, in my observation, never<br />
do, ( Laughter) ( Applause) Men may grow oldo We all get<br />
older, We get tired, , Jo perhaps worry a little more about<br />
things than we did once. Well, that's in the course of nature,<br />
But the Liberal Party as a party is yourg. Have that in your<br />
mind. There may be people in it who have grown white-haired in<br />
the service of the party but the party is young. Compared with<br />
the great historic parties of the United States, of Great<br />
Britain, this is a boy, this party, and if it is to retain its<br />
youth, if it is to grow at all., sturdily, into maturity, then<br />
it must do it by remembering that its great mission is to serve<br />
all the people of Australia, to keep up our friendships with<br />
great nations around the world, to preserve our standing, our<br />
credit, our repute, and to allow sectional arguments to be<br />
dealt with, but not to cause divisions at the heart of the<br />
party. ( Applause) Now, Sir, that's one great mission we have,<br />
There's another one that I would like to say a word or two<br />
about because I don't want to speak too long, We are living<br />
in a Federal community. We are living in a nation which was<br />
created as such only sixty years ago, but it was created as<br />
a Federal community with sovereignty which, in the long run,<br />
attaches to the people, divided between a Commonwealth, a<br />
great central administration, and the administrations and<br />
governments and parliaments of the States. The essence of<br />
federalism is that there is a division of sovereignty not<br />
that somebody is sovereign and that somebody isn't, A division<br />
of sovereignty this is the complete essence of our democracy<br />
and of federalism, Federalism in Australia for which we stand<br />
whih is one of the keynotes in our policy, will not be destroyed<br />
by overt actso Nobody is going to come along and put up a<br />
referendum to abolish the States, Well he may, if he is feeling<br />
gay and enterprising, but he won't succeed. The people of<br />
Australia, once you put the question to then " Do you want to<br />
destroy the States?" will never say '" Yes", 30 o. 0 / 6 </p>
<p>But things can be changed by subtlety more easily<br />
than they can by direct attack, and one of the subtle things<br />
that is going on today, practised perhaps by some people in<br />
this room inadvertently, is to put more and more and more<br />
responsibility on the Commonwealth and still pretend the<br />
Commonwealth powers haven't increased, Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
if this bad habit of taking everything to the Commonwealth<br />
something crops up; well we're short of money, we want to<br />
do this or want to do that " Let's go to Canberra" and you<br />
know this happens every day I get only a percentage of them<br />
on my desk, but it happens every day. What do you suppose is<br />
going to happen if the Commonwealth is ultimately given all<br />
financial responsibility? Then it will have a pretty powerful<br />
case some day to have all political authority because it is<br />
a pretty good thing to have responsibility and authority married<br />
together. Now I say to you beware of this. The States have<br />
great powers. We have great powers. Admittedly in the<br />
financial world by reason of a number of events, we have<br />
predominant financial powers in the Commonwealth, but it is<br />
still true that there are things in the hands of the States,<br />
masses of administrative responsibilities which, in my<br />
considered opinion, after a lot of experience, they are much<br />
more competent to attend to than we would be at Canberra.<br />
Therefore it's one of our tasks it is the other<br />
task that I wanted to mention to you to preserve the Federal<br />
structure, to preserve a system of Government under which<br />
the national Government the national Parliament have<br />
responsibility for great national affairs and the State<br />
Parliaments, the State governments have responsibility within<br />
their own borders for very great local affairs. It would be<br />
a dreadful thing I think if this came to an end, because, you<br />
know, to talk of freedom, individual freedom, may be thought<br />
occasionally to be rather old-fashioned, but it is the great<br />
thing that matters, individual freedom and if you get all<br />
power concentrated into one set of hans then freedom begins<br />
to disappear. It is in the division of power between governments<br />
, hat freedom flourishes. The moment you get some other<br />
state of affairs there is an enormous temptation to subordinate<br />
the freedom of the individual. I will take a single example<br />
from overseas. In the United Kingdom, all power is at Westminster<br />
and therefore you have the possible danger that I have referred<br />
to. But the British inv. nted self-government but for Great<br />
Britain, nobody would have heard of self-government. It is<br />
not only the mother of Parliaments, it is the only mother of<br />
Parliaments in the world and because they understand these<br />
things and because there is a passion in the British heart for<br />
freedom, no tyrant for hundreds of years has been able to<br />
prevail in Great Britain. ( Applause) But across the Channel,<br />
in France, a country of which we all speak with profound respect,<br />
we have had a different history, Somebody was under the<br />
impression in fact I said something about it at the London<br />
Conference that because the French had had a Revolution, in<br />
the latter part of the eighteenth century, it must be taken<br />
that they understood democracy perfectly. This, of course, is<br />
a complete non sequitur, because the plain truth is they don't<br />
understand democracy very well. For years and years, right<br />
through this current century, their system of Parliament has<br />
been so dispersed, the Frenchman himself so individualist in<br />
his views that any average government lasted six weeks, sometimes<br />
six months changes of administration, changes of administration,<br />
five years, 22 governments or something of that kind and in the<br />
result, what we call parliamentary democracy became ineffective<br />
So. ./ 7 </p>
<p>I71<br />
and th. e country was increasingly run, if there was to be<br />
continuity, by what they are pleased to call the bureau or<br />
what we are pleased to call the civil. service.<br />
Bureaucratic control is the inevitable result of<br />
grave uncertainty of government because somebody has to carry<br />
on, somebody must do the job. In the last two or three<br />
years, of course, we have had the remarkable episode of<br />
President De Gaulle who has, let us face up to it almost<br />
dictatorial powers, but who because of his strength, his<br />
flaming patriotism, has restored the pride of the French, as<br />
I ventured to tell him the last time I spoke with him in<br />
Pari. s But after him, what do we know?<br />
Now, the one thing I am illustrating to you is<br />
that you must have a passion in the mind for preserving<br />
individual freedom and for restraining the powers of government<br />
then, and particularly so in the case of Australia, You do<br />
well to say, " We have a system of division of authorityo We<br />
have a great country that is going to be greater and greater<br />
as time goes on and we must be careful not to allow ourselves<br />
by folly or inadvertence to lose a Federal system which has in<br />
reality served us so well." ( Applause)<br />
Sir, there is just one other matter that I would<br />
like to say before I conclude and that is that the task of<br />
government in Australia was at one time thought to be<br />
distributive. " We have so much wealth, lot us divide it upo<br />
Let us reduce the inequalities between the rich and the poor.<br />
Lot us develop our social services, so that there will be<br />
a proper protection for people who have, so to speak, fallen<br />
by the wayside." All this is great stuff and your present<br />
Government has had a hand in it9 not to be surpassed in the<br />
history of the Commonwealth, but we are rapidly reaching a<br />
point of time when the main business of government is not to<br />
distribute but to create, to help to create ( Applause) to<br />
help to have more and more production, because if the mind<br />
is concentrated blindly on sharing out what you have, then<br />
before you can say, " Knife", you won't be having any more<br />
next year or the year afterwards. The creation of resources in<br />
Australiao their development, the creation of markets for<br />
Australia, their development, the creation of ingenuity in<br />
research in technology in Australia and, what's even more<br />
important, speedy application to the problems, the practical<br />
problems of production these are the great challenges of<br />
the next ten years, I have only to mention them to you?<br />
this great creative task, for you to realise that in spite of<br />
some commentators I am not sitting down in ai armchair at home<br />
with my back turned to the future, and contemplating the<br />
glories of the past, not at all.<br />
We haven't done all that badly in the past, but we<br />
have a great job, and that is to do twice as well in the<br />
future. It is a creative task, a task which will be based<br />
upon our undertstanding of government and its function and<br />
its division, It will be based primarily upon our realisation<br />
that the time has gone by for little sectional conflicts<br />
between farmer and manufacturer, between employer and employee.<br />
The time has come in a pretty difficult world for ten million<br />
of the best people living in the world to go on and demonstrate<br />
that they can command by their own efforts a magnificent<br />
future, </p>
