PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
DELIVERED BY THE MINISTER FOR HUMAN SERVICES AND HEALTH,<br />
THE HON CARMEN LAWRENCE, MP<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S EMPLOYER OF THE YEAR AWARDS, CANBERRA,<br />
18 OCTOBER 1995<br />
I am very pleased to be here today to present the Prime Minister's Employer<br />
of the Year Awards and to recognise employers who have given job<br />
opportunities to Australians with a disability.<br />
The Awards are in their sixth year and in 1995 attracted almost 400<br />
nominations. I must say that past presentation ceremonies number amongst the most<br />
uplifting functions I have attended.<br />
The Awards always tell a good story and, I think, a very Australian story.<br />
In Australia we move forward as a group. In Australia, we care about each<br />
other we help each other out and we stick together. Australians have, I<br />
believe, a fundamental and very deeply-held belief in fairness.<br />
There is a consensus in this country and it's not found in all countries, or<br />
even most countries a consensus that everyone should contribute to and<br />
share in the common wealth.<br />
That's one of the best things about living in Australia. And it's one of the best<br />
reasons for loving Australia.<br />
These awards are a practical expression of the Australian consensus. They<br />
are a good example of government, business and unions all pitching in and<br />
working together in the common interest.<br />
There are many things that a government can do to create an inclusive<br />
society and to maintain a strong social net. </p>
<p>Governments can provide health care and social security and education and<br />
community services to all. Not all governments do this but the best do.<br />
And there is much that governments can do for people with a disability.<br />
For the past decade, this Government has assisted people with disabilities<br />
through the Disability Services Program and in light of the Baume Report,<br />
we will redouble our efforts to increase opportunities, especially in<br />
employment, education and training.<br />
In 1991 the Government introduced the Disability Reform Package to coordinate<br />
Commonwealth services and enable people with disabilities to<br />
participate more fully in the life of the community. The Disabilities<br />
Discrimination Act of 1993 declared that discrimination on the grounds of<br />
disability is unlawful.<br />
These are valuable things and the Government will keep doing them, and<br />
building on them.<br />
But what governments cannot easily provide to people with disabilities<br />
unlike businesses are jobs.<br />
A job is the most important element of the Australian inheritance.<br />
Ilt is the best guarantee of an interesting and prosperous life.<br />
It's the best builder of confidence and self-esteem, and the best antidote for<br />
depression and self-doubt.<br />
As a way of bringing people in from the margins of society, nothing else<br />
comes close.<br />
Businesses should employ people with disabilities because they share<br />
along with the rest of us a responsibility to society.<br />
They should do it because it will provide their employees with new skills and<br />
a better future.<br />
But they should also do it because hiring people with disabilities is good<br />
business practice. With proper training and support and in the right job, a<br />
person with a disability can do as well as any worker. And the experience of<br />
these Awards tells us they bring an extra measure of enthusiasm and<br />
commitment to the workplace.<br />
Of course, many businesses have already seen the light. People with<br />
disabilities are working with great flair and success in shops and offices and<br />
schools; in councils, timber companies and computer companies; in<br />
universities and banks and hotels and airlines. </p>
<p>And all of them are very much a part of the national enterprise.<br />
Let me offer my congratulations to everyone involved with the Employer of<br />
the Year Awards the organisers, the sponsors and the very hard-working<br />
selection panels.<br />
Thank you especially to the ACTU, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and<br />
Industry and Business Review Weekly.<br />
Congratulations to those employers in both the private and public sectors<br />
who have given people with disabilities a chance, and who have been<br />
nominated this year.<br />
Most importantly, congratulations to those people with a disability who take<br />
their place in Australia's work force, whose courage is equal to their<br />
employers' vision.<br />
Australia is a stronger nation for these Awards. And because of the<br />
generosity and intelligence of the employers we recognise today, Australia is<br />
a better country in which to live.<br />
Thank you. </p>
