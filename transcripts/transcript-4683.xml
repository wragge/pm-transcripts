FOR PRESS 14 APRIL 1978<br />
AMERICAN NATIONAL CLUB DINNER ADDRESS<br />
Those of you here tonight who are avid readers of the financial<br />
pages of the press will be aware that there is at the moment<br />
quite a flurry of international activity.<br />
On Tuesday, President Carter unveiled his plans to attack<br />
inflation and promote growth in exports. On the same day,<br />
Mr. Healey, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, brought<br />
down a budget described as Britain's contribution to boosting<br />
world economic recovery. President Carter is soon to have<br />
discussions with Mr. Fukuda and other world leaders. At the<br />
end of May, I and the leaders of a representative cross-section<br />
of other nations will attend a special meeting in Jamaica, and<br />
the seven countries, which attended the summit meeting in London<br />
last year, will have a fourth summit meeting in Bonn in July.<br />
What has prompted this sudden escalation in international<br />
consultation at the highest political level? I imagine you<br />
can guess the answer; the world economy and why it is failing<br />
to perform as well as we would all like. Everywhere countries<br />
are facing, to differing degrees, the same problems: inflation,<br />
which in Australia and some other countries has come down<br />
markedly, but is still too high; sharply fluctuating prices,<br />
particularly for commodities; sluggish rates of growth; and<br />
unemployment, especially amongst the young.<br />
I need hardly remind this audience that all these difficulties<br />
have been compounded by quite dramatic fluctuations in the<br />
U. S. dollar and other currencies. In the past 13 months, for<br />
example, the Swiss Franc has appreciated against the Canadian<br />
Dollar almost 50%. Over the same period, the U. S. Dollar has<br />
depreciated against the yen by over<br />
The causes of these problems, to the extent that they are known,<br />
are many and complex but they are clearly a world-wide phenomenon.<br />
The major world economies do seem to be staging a tentative<br />
recovery but it has not been enough so far to reduce the numbers<br />
of those looking for work.<br />
It has been estimated that total output needs to grow by about<br />
per year if unemployment is to start to decline across the<br />
world. Growth in 1977 was lower than this, and will probably<br />
fall short of this figure again in 1978. / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
Growth in international trade in 1977 was also sluggish and<br />
the prospect is that the same will occur this year. It is<br />
in this area that both the mighty American economy, and our<br />
small but highly developed Australian economy, have of late<br />
been sharing some uncomfortable experiences.<br />
On the one side, we have both felt acute social problems<br />
notably high unemployment in sensitive sectors. A sharp rise<br />
in imports from the industrialising countries has been a<br />
contributor to this. We have both been obliged to take the<br />
inevitable palliative action to protect employment while at<br />
the same time acknowledging that the carefully regulated and<br />
coordinated reduction of barriers to international trade is<br />
the best long term guarantee of prosperity, of progress<br />
and incidentally of peace.<br />
On the other side, both our countries have felt the lash of<br />
protectionism applied against our own exports On this score,<br />
Australia's experience has been more painful, more dramatic<br />
than Americals. After all, what has happened to our exports<br />
of agricultural products to the European community in recent<br />
years is quite extraordinary.<br />
Through no fault of our own indeed while * in most areas we<br />
have been boosting our capacity to supply quality food cheaply<br />
and reliably we have seen our sales of beef, cheese, wheat<br />
and fruit to the community plummet. Its purchases of our sugar<br />
have virtually ceased and, while in 1966 we were selling over<br />
60,000 tonnes of butter to Europe, last year we were permitted<br />
to sell the princely amount of one solitary tonne. Yet we<br />
permit some 4,000 tonnes of heavily subsidized European cheese<br />
to enter this country annually. In all, our exports of<br />
foodstuffs to the European community over the past four years,<br />
have been reduced by over<br />
We recognize that the common agricultural policy is an integral<br />
part of the social and political fabric of the European<br />
community and no one is seeking to have this dismantled. What<br />
we do seek, and the United States share this objective, is to<br />
have the more extreme aspects of the C. A. P. modified to have<br />
alterations made at the margin to provide relief to<br />
efficient producers.<br />
All Australia desires is a reasonable degree of access to<br />
European markets, and more restraint on the part of the Community<br />
in its practice of exporting artificially generated agricultural<br />
surpluses to other markets which have previously been supplied<br />
by Australia.<br />
Although Australia's principal concern with E. E. C. trade<br />
relates to agricultural products, there are problems in other<br />
sectors as evidenced by the Community's action to restrict<br />
imports of steel. / 3 </p>
<p>Last June, the President of the E. E. C. Mr Jenkins, and I<br />
agreed that bilateral discussions would be held to find meaningful<br />
solutions to these problems. We put forward specific<br />
proposals in October, and talks were scheduled for mid-May<br />
to hear the Commission's response. This week we were told<br />
that the Commission was not ready to have such talks, that<br />
they must be postponed until June even though the Commission<br />
had had our propositions for eight months.<br />
I recognise it is now impossible to hold the discussions on<br />
the due date, and that the postponement is an inevitable fact.<br />
But I find it incomprehensible that after eight months, the<br />
Commission has directed so little attention to the matter that<br />
they have not yet done their homework.<br />
Now some elements in the Commission are apparently suggesting<br />
that there be no bilateral talks at all, that they be encompassed<br />
in the general multilateral trade negotiations that have been<br />
dragging on for some time.<br />
Such a course is totally unacceptable to.-Australia. I would<br />
regard it as a flagrant abrogation of the agreement reached<br />
between myself and Mr Jenkins less than a year ago.<br />
What faith can we ha ve in the Community when they show such<br />
a blatantly self-intL-erested attitude as this? Whey they show<br />
so l-ittle interest and concern in important bilateral issues?<br />
Let me say that concern at the European attitude is not confined<br />
to Australia and the United States. It is one which has come<br />
to be widely shared, especially amongst developing nations.<br />
I well recall that I was one of the very few members of the<br />
Australian Parliament who strongly supported Britain's entry<br />
to the E. E. C. when this was first mooted in 1961.<br />
The Treaty of Rome seemed to offer the real prospect of European<br />
unity and cohesion, an opportunity for Europe to take a constructive<br />
role in world affairs. It would be a tragedy if these original<br />
high hopes were not fulfilled and the European community continues<br />
to be primarily a narrow, self-interested trading group, seeking<br />
to make the rest of the world dance to their tune.<br />
Letme say that attitude will not survive. It cannot survive.<br />
The world is coming to demand a responsible international<br />
attitude from all nations not least from the great and powerful<br />
E. E. C.<br />
In the coming months, Europe will have to make a fundamental<br />
decision. Are they going to use current depressed economic<br />
conditions as an excuse for refusing to modify their trade<br />
barriers or even increasing them? Or are they going to<br />
decide to move towards freer trading conditions? It augurs<br />
poorly for the success of the multilateral trade negotiations<br />
due soon to recommence, when in the one international commodity<br />
agreement finalised in the past year the sugar agreement<br />
the E. E. C. resolutely refuses to be a member. / 4 </p>
<p>What confidence can this inspire in the developing world?<br />
Australia has already made its move. Since our 1973 average<br />
tariff rate has been reduced by some 30%, and our use of nontariff<br />
barriers is very much less than in the major trading<br />
blocs. Regrettably, our tariff reductions were made unilaterally on<br />
our part, without deriving any commensurate reductions in<br />
trade barriers inhibiting our own exports. As a result, we<br />
now have little room to manoeuvre in tariff reductions,<br />
especially when we are faced by the non-tariff barriers which<br />
apply to much of our exports a practice which regrettably<br />
is applied against us both in Europe and in North America.<br />
The developing countries have also been facing more than<br />
their share of problems, for they too rely heavily on exports<br />
of agricultural goods and other commodities. What they seek<br />
is a narrowing of the gaps between themselves and the developed<br />
countries in fundamental human needs in nutrition, literacy,<br />
life expectancy, education and other pub lic facilities.<br />
So we have two pressing international economic problems<br />
which require urgent action and reassessment: the slow rate<br />
of economic growth and the unemployment to which this gives<br />
rise; and the need to accommodate the developing countries<br />
as a growing political and economic force in the world.<br />
Both these problems must be tackled now they can be bypassed<br />
no longer and it may well be that there are some areas where<br />
actions on both sets of problems can be combined. That is to<br />
say, there are things which all countries can do jointly that<br />
will at one and the same time re-structure trading relations<br />
between the developed and developing worlds and assist us to<br />
boost world growth.<br />
Any lasting solution to current world economic problems must<br />
involve the developing countries. The leaders of the major<br />
western economies have to re-assess their trading relations<br />
with the developing countries acknowledging those countries'<br />
need for wider access to markets if they are to attain greater<br />
self-reliance and adopting policies which assist the<br />
achievement of that end.<br />
Such a reappraisal is required on grounds of justice and<br />
equity for we must do more to reduce world poverty and want.<br />
but such a policy would also be in the interests of the<br />
developed world for in the creation of bigger markets in the<br />
developing countries lies the potential for revitalisation<br />
of world trade.<br />
World markets must be allowed to grow at a faster rate for if<br />
this fails to occur, there can only be increasing bitterness<br />
and despondency as countries fight over the break-up of<br />
existing markets. </p>
<p>If we can succeed in boosting world growth and world trade in<br />
a non-inflationary manner, economic recovery around the world<br />
will be achieved very much faster. Our factories, farms, mines<br />
and other enterprises can then operate at full capacity again<br />
and that means the creation of more jobs throughout the<br />
developed world.<br />
Various formal discussions and negotiations held recently on<br />
international trade problems have not progressed far and unless<br />
there is a major reassessment by the developed nations,<br />
forthcoming meetings will fare little better.<br />
Many world leaders, including President Carter, are conscious of<br />
the significance of these coming discussions and negotiations.<br />
That is why the next 3 months will see government leaders across<br />
the world meeting informally to make sure that all avenues are<br />
explored in finding practical and equitable solutions.<br />
We Australians are conscious of our responsibility to take<br />
an active role in this process. My talks in Tokyo next<br />
week with President Fukuda are in direct response to the<br />
concerns felt by the Japanese Prime Minister and myself<br />
on these issues.<br />
Progress in defining and implementing solutions will be<br />
neither quick nor painless. But I am hopeful that, with<br />
a common sense of urgency and commitment, solutions can be<br />
found to the mutual benefit of all trading nations.<br />
Mr. President, this is one field in which the United States<br />
and Australia can and must cooperate. It is vital for us<br />
both that the right solutions be agreed upon without further<br />
delay. </p>
