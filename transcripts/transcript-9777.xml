PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
Today's front-page report in The Sydney Morning Herald deliberately distorts the<br />
process of consultation undertaken by the Federal Government to develop a National*<br />
Forest Reserve System.<br />
Yet again, the Herald's environment writer has either faied to understand the process,<br />
or deliberately misrepresented it in an effort to derail the constructive process now<br />
underway. Statements claiming that some areas proposed for interim protection were either not<br />
forest or had previously been logged, are mischievous and misleading.<br />
The criteria for identifying which areas should be set aside were developed by a panel<br />
of eminent scientists and endorsed by the International Union for the Conservation of<br />
Nature. It is important that the criteria be properly understood by the relevant interest groups,<br />
and by those reporting on this issue.<br />
The main criteria relate to protecting old growth, wilderness and biodiversity values of<br />
forests.. Under the old growth criteria, 60 100 per cent of all remaining old growth forests<br />
would be protected, with the appropriate level of protection for each fqrest type<br />
dependent on its comparative rarity. This means that for some forest types, 100 per<br />
cent of old growth would be protected, with a minimum protection level of 60 per cent<br />
for forest types with extensive old growth stands remaining.<br />
The wilderness criterion, however, does not relate just to forests. Wilderness is not<br />
related to vegetation type. " Wil1derness" embraces measures of remoteness,<br />
naturalness and lack of disturbance, regardless of the composition of the vegetation.<br />
Accordingly, the approach taken by the Commonwealth is to identify high quality<br />
wilderness, regardless of vegetation type, consistent with well-established<br />
methodology and then to give it interim protection. Any forest areas within those<br />
wilderness areas are therefore also given interim protection. This approach has<br />
resulted in an estimated 99 per cent of all remaining wilderness in Tasmania being<br />
given interim protection. The Commonwealth criterion aims to protect 90 per cent or<br />
more wherever practicable. </p>
<p>2<br />
Under the biodiversity criterion, the Commonwealth is committed to protecting 15 per<br />
cent of the pre-1750 distribution of each forest community. Meeting this benchmark<br />
will inevitably lead to the protection of significant areas of previously logged forest,<br />
simply because it would be impossible to meet this criterion for many forest types if<br />
only unlogged areas were considered. This would result in a significant reduction in<br />
the total area of forest set aside for the reserve system.<br />
While it may have been possible to establish a comprehensive, adequate and<br />
representative reserve system without including previously logged areas one hundred<br />
years ago, this is unfortunately no longer possible.<br />
The Government is making the most serious attempt ever to balance the many<br />
competing interests involved in the forests issue, and it will not be deflected from an<br />
objective application of its policy<br />
We have always said, however, that the reason for having a public review period was<br />
to allow issues to be raised so that we can be sure that the final decisions are correct.<br />
We are as keen as the various interest groups for the material presented as drafts by<br />
Commonwealth and State officials to be fully tested and we will ensure that any doubts<br />
about the veracity of the methodology used by the States to apply the Commonwealth<br />
criteria are resolved before final decisions are made.<br />
This is a matter of immense importance to all Australians. The Government wants to<br />
strike a balance which will best serve the interests of the whole community. This<br />
includes establishing a world class forest reserve system. It is important that the<br />
process leading to the establishment of this system be reported conscientiously.<br />
