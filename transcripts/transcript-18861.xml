    <content><![CDATA[<p>Canberra</p>
<p>I want to begin by saying to the men and women of Australia's farming communities: because of your hard work and that of your forebears, Australia is an agricultural powerhouse.</p>
<p>Our agricultural industries export over $30 billion worth of food a year.</p>
<p>They provide enough food to feed our own population three times over.</p>
<p>And our food supply chain employs around 1.6 million Australians, or 15 per cent of the nation's workforce.</p>
<p>All this in a continent that poses huge challenges of climate, logistics and workforce availability.</p>
<p>Our success didn't happen by accident.</p>
<p>Australian farmers have never been better educated or better connected.</p>
<p>We have better science.</p>
<p>We have better tools and equipment.</p>
<p>And in the Asian Century, we have bigger markets than we've ever had before.</p>
<p>Australian farmers are no strangers to Asia.</p>
<p>Your parents and grandparents led the way in the 1950s on our breakthrough deal with Japan that paved the way into the region.</p>
<p>So Asia is not new  -  but the scale of this opportunity is.</p>
<p>The Asian middle class is around 500 million strong today but will grow to 3.2 billion within two decades.</p>
<p>By 2025, half of the world's economic growth will come from this region.</p>
<p>Growth equals demand.</p>
<p>Demand for minerals. Demand for manufactures. Demand for services.</p>
<p>And, of course, demand for food.</p>
<p>Agrifood demand is set to double between 2007 and 2050.</p>
<p>Not just in China but in India, the ASEAN region and South Asia as well.</p>
<p>So unlike the past two centuries when our markets were far away, this time we are in the box seat.</p>
<p>A farmer in the US Midwest is twice the distance from Beijing than a farmer in Kununurra.</p>
<p>So Australia has an Asia advantage.</p>
<p>By seizing that advantage, we'll see agriculture's share of the Australian economy rise through to 2025, reversing the fall we've seen in the past decade.</p>
<p>Of course, even if we doubled our production levels, we couldn't put food on every Asian table.</p>
<p>But we can target the region with clean, sustainable produce, renowned for its quality and consistency.</p>
<p>Australia's opportunity is to provide high quality product to a growing middle class in areas where we have experience and advantage, especially beef, wheat, dairy products, sheep meat and sugar.</p>
<p>But more than that.</p>
<p>I want us to sell our ideas and innovative capacity as well.</p>
<p>Australia should be a supplier of choice for agricultural solutions like technologies to increase yields, reduce water use and lessen environmental degradation; soil management systems; and improving feed sustainability for marine aquaculture.</p>
<p>We've got so much to offer to the region and the world.</p>
<p>Succeeding in the Asian Century will demand a lot of us too.</p>
<p>The strategies that have worked for the domestic market won't always work in Asia.</p>
<p>Success will require a whole-of-Australia effort, with farm businesses, communities and governments being partners in a profound transformation of how we think and operate.</p>
<p>It will mean becoming more Asia-capable, like having more business people on company boards with direct expertise in the region.</p>
<p>Businesses must continue to increase adaptability and resilience to changes in the environment and economy, including drought and climate change.</p>
<p>They must become fully part of the region, adjusting their strategies, linking with regional value chains and developing long-term relationships.</p>
<p>And some businesses will need to look at their size and structure, finding new ways to grow and scale-up.</p>
<p>Finally, engaging with our north will demand new and deeper Asia-relevant job capabilities include adaptability, flexibility, resilience, creative thinking, and the confidence and readiness to operate in Asia.</p>
<p>We also face significant agricultural skill shortages spanning the entire value chain, especially in agribusiness and agricultural science.</p>
<p>Addressing these factors will require sustained effort.</p>
<p>We cannot build stronger relationships or learn new skills overnight, or even over five years, especially given the diversity of the countries in our region.</p>
<p>But we can begin now.</p>
<p>At the heart of Asia-readiness is productivity.</p>
<p>So since 2007, we've been focused on building the long-term productivity and sustainability of our nation's agriculture, fishing and forestry industries.</p>
<p>Australia's producers know the value of investment in rural research and development.</p>
<p>That's why we've provided $1.1 billion to rural research and development corporationsover our five budgets so far.</p>
<p>Our rural R&amp;D policy included a commitment to continuing matching funding and outlined improvements that will drive productivity, investment and adoption of innovative practices.</p>
<p>We've also invested more than $1.6 billion in biosecurity, to minimise threats and keep Australia's primary industries strong.</p>
<p>Released draft legislation to replace the century-old Quarantine Act.</p>
<p>And announced a state-of-the-art post entry quarantine facility in Victoria.</p>
<p>But we don't just need to refine what we sell but how we sell it.</p>
<p>In an increasingly interconnected world market, a premium is being placed on joined-up supply chains and partnerships.</p>
<p>So stronger entrepreneurial and management skills will be necessary to be successful in an increasingly interconnected global food industry.</p>
<p>Investments in water and transport infrastructure help farmers better integrate into supply chains.</p>
<p>Governments have an important role to play in getting the settings right and enabling the sector to do what it does best.</p>
<p>Through APEC we are working in the region to improve cross-border supply chain performance by 10 per cent by 2015.</p>
<p>This includes identifying and fixing choke points that limit fast, cost-efficient movement of goods.</p>
<p>In the Asian Century, our production and exports will expand, but our soil and water resources remain finite.</p>
<p>Farmers more than anyone know how fragile our natural assets are and how preserving them must be a priority.</p>
<p>As Prime Minister, I recognise you as frontline caretakers of our greatest assets  -  our soils, our water, and our biodiversity. </p>
<p>Soil is the very basis of our survival.</p>
<p>Clean air and water; food and fibre; and our unique biodiversity all rely on protecting our soil.</p>
<p>This valuable asset is threatened by climate change, land degradation and competing land uses.</p>
<p>So I seek a deeper partnership in trying to increase our soil health, our water quality, our biodiversity and vegetative cover.</p>
<p>Throughinnovation, researchand improving on-farm practices,we can reduce our impact and increase our output.</p>
<p>Late last year we established a Working Group on Water, Soil and Food in recognition that the condition of our soils must be a national priority.</p>
<p>Akey step in this direction is the appointment of a person with the authority and trust of the community to raise awareness of the importance of soil -  an Advocate for Soil Health.</p>
<p>I'm pleased to announce that this important role will be filled by an eminent Australian, the former Governor-General, Michael Jeffrey.</p>
<p>As Governor-General, Michael Jeffrey had a passion for regional development and the future of our rural industries, a commitment he has continued since leaving office.</p>
<p>This role will also involve the development of soil research priorities to complement existing efforts to develop a national soil research, development and extension strategy.</p>
<p>Government departments, CSIRO and our rural RDCs must continue to take an integrated approach to ensure resources are used sustainably and we target investment to the right areas.</p>
<p>We also need to engage better with our soil scientists to take advantage of new ideas and provide the information that farmers need to look after theirsoil.</p>
<p>The Government recently announced the new $700 million ‘sustainable agriculture' stream in the next phase of the Caring for our Country program.</p>
<p>Helping farmers to improve the health of their soil will be a major component of this.</p>
<p>Healthy soil underpins biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services.</p>
<p>The Government recognises the importance of biodiversity conservation, now and for future generations.</p>
<p>We also know that in this dry land, we know the next drought is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>So we're working with industry as well as State and Territory governments to reform drought management in Australia.</p>
<p>In these relatively good times, it's a unique opportunity to move from crisis management to preparedness.</p>
<p>The work is ongoing but we look forward to delivering a new and improved system to help producers deal with the impacts of climate variability.</p>
<p>Most important of all our land use challenges, we need to resolve the Murray Darling Basin Plan.</p>
<p>It's hard to believe we've gone 111 years as a Federation without such a plan.</p>
<p>2012 will be the year when we get the job done.</p>
<p>None of this will be easy.</p>
<p>As you all know so well, nothing in agriculture ever is.</p>
<p>In a way, growing and selling goods to Asia is the simpler part.</p>
<p>Putting in place the policy and regulatory settings here at home is where we need to dig deeper.</p>
<p>There's no single ‘big bang' but rather our method is to weave together complementary strategies to ensure that all the resources of government are focused on the task.</p>
<p>Like removing the heavy hand of centralisation and getting our wheat marketing right.</p>
<p>We believe that those who own the wheat should decide how they want to sell the wheat.</p>
<p>Taking the politics out of foreign ownership.</p>
<p>Foreign investment is not a new thing.</p>
<p>It has helped build Australian agriculture over the last two hundred years and it is important for the future as we seek to boost food production and food security.</p>
<p>Foreign direct investment in agriculture, forestry and fishing accounts for just 0.1 per cent of total foreign investment.</p>
<p>And 89 per cent of our agricultural land is entirely Australian owned, with a further 6 per cent majority-owned by Australians, roughly similar levels to what they were 30 years ago.</p>
<p>But we also understand the need for more information to foster an informed public debate.</p>
<p>That's why I am announcing that the Government will be introducing a foreign ownership register for agricultural land.</p>
<p>The register will provide the community with a more comprehensive picture of the specific size and locations of foreign agricultural landholdings over and above what is currently available.</p>
<p>We will shortly be releasing a paper to begin discussions with stakeholders, including many people in this room, plus the States and Territories, about the design and content of the register.</p>
<p>We're continuing the hard grind of negotiating the Free Trade Agreements that are so vital to market access.</p>
<p>The Government is working overtime to support Australia's industries in getting their products to the world.</p>
<p>That's why I spoke with Prime Minister Noda at the United Nations last month because I want to see the Japan FTA done.</p>
<p>Just as I want to see the China and Korea FTAs done, and the Trans Pacific Partnership as well.</p>
<p>We're completing Australia's first ever National Food Plan to look at our food system from paddock to plate.</p>
<p>This plan will help ensure we have a sustainable, globally competitive, resilient food supply that supports access to nutritious and affordable food and that our agricultural sector makes the most of the opportunities, like the growth of Asia.</p>
<p>And bringing it all together, we're very close now to delivering the Asian Century White Paper.</p>
<p>Charting our path as an export-driven economy with a smart, innovative, Asia-literate population.</p>
<p>We can't accomplish this work without the advice and input of the NFF and its fellow peak bodies.</p>
<p>The NFF's contribution to the Asian Century White Paper has been thoughtful and substantive.</p>
<p>I'm also proud of our work on the Coal Seam Gas National Partnership, which went from an idea Jock and Matt presented in my office to a signed-off COAG policy in record time.</p>
<p>But for every success and occasional controversy that gets a front page in the papers, a lot goes unsung as well.</p>
<p>Like the North Queensland irrigated agriculture strategy, where we're working with the State government, industry and CSIRO.</p>
<p>Or the Northern Australian Beef logistics initiative, again working with industry, State and Territory governments and other stakeholders to get a good result.</p>
<p>This policy work won't always win headlines.</p>
<p>But the farmers and communities involved know its value.</p>
<p>Work that will be earning export dollars for Australia long after we have all left the stage.</p>
<p>That's really what this work is all about  -  the future.</p>
<p>Like when Trade Minister John McEwen renewed our relationship with Japan 60 years ago.</p>
<p>He didn't know precisely what the opportunities would be.</p>
<p>He couldn't guess that within a few years we'd be extracting iron ore from the Pilbara, or farming fish in Tasmania.</p>
<p>But he helped ensure we'd be ready for whatever chances presented themselves along the way.</p>
<p>We don't quite know what Australia will be like in 2050.</p>
<p>But we do know we'll have to be living within the natural limits of our soil and water resources.</p>
<p>Drawing our energy from sustainable supplies.</p>
<p>Linking ourselves to high-speed broadband.</p>
<p>Better understanding Asian cultures and manners.</p>
<p>And putting ourselves back in the top five countries educationally.</p>
<p>All of these things are within our grasp right now.</p>
<p>Yes they are complex in execution, but they are not hard to understand in principle or design.</p>
<p>Most importantly, let's remember this:</p>
<p>Australia is up for the challenge of the Asian Century.</p>
<p>We are no longer the small, isolated nation of our grandparents' fears and imaginings.</p>
<p>We are the world's 12th biggest economy on the doorstep of a historic economic transformation.</p>
<p>But for all of the opportunities, the journey doesn't get any easier from here.</p>
<p>The low hanging fruit has been picked, so we have to reach higher up the tree.</p>
<p>We have to be smarter and stay smarter to not only hold our own in the international market place but grow our share of the opportunities.</p>
<p>That's why it's time to get the right settings in place now.</p>
<p>We can't afford to be arguing about stuff like the Murray-Darling in ten years' time.</p>
<p>The Asian Century, like the Industrial Revolution, is a rare moment in history.</p>
<p>You don't too many chances like this in the life of a nation.</p>
<p>We've got one  -  and we won't let it slip away.</p>
