That I am here as AustraliaÂ´s first female Prime Minister  -  alongside so many other female heads of government and several of the worldÂ´s most influential women leaders -  is only because of the extraordinary courage and tenacity of generations of women before us and because of the vision and commitment of the United Nations.</p>
<p>The Call to Action we heed today requires the full force of our focus and ongoing resolve.</p>
<p>Women and girls continue to bear the brunt of global challenges and inequalities.</p>
<p>Too many continue to be voiceless.</p>
<p>Too many continue to face unacceptable obstacles to education, employment and leadership opportunities.</p>
<p>The suffering of millions of women diminishes us all and obligates us.</p>
<p>How can we achieve sustainable development if we do not rectify these inequalities?</p>
<p>I commend the work of UN Women, under the valuable leadership of its Executive Director, Michelle Bachelet.</p>
<p>I support the Call to Action not only because the inherent dignity of women and gender equality is a right, but also because it makes profound economic sense.</p>
<p>By some estimates, two-thirds of the worldÂ´s illiterate people are women. ThatÂ´s about 500 million women worldwide who cannot read or write.</p>
<p>According to UNESCO, more than 30 million girls worldwide are not even getting basic primary-level education.</p>
<p>ThatÂ´s more uneducated girls than there are people in my entire country.</p>
<p>Failure to support womenÂ´s education and employment equals billions of dollars in economic losses.</p>
<p>The Asia and Pacific region alone is losing up to 47 billion US dollars annually as a result of womenÂ´s limited access to employment opportunities, as well as up to 30 billion US dollars annually as a result of gender gaps in education.</p>
<p>These statistics are graphic testament to the urgent need to elevate gender equality, they underscore the urgency of this Summit and they point to a serious economic blind-spot in boosting global prosperity.</p>
<p>If we are to achieve sustainable development, we must invest in womenÂ´s education and training.</p>
<p>We must include women in the workforce.</p>
<p>And we must increase the proportion of women in high-level decision making roles.</p>
<p>Of the 193 members of the United Nations, only about 10 per cent have elected a female president or prime minister.</p>
<p>Women hold less than 20 per cent of the worldÂ´s parliamentary seats, in the Pacific only about 2 per cent.</p>
<p>As Michelle Bachelet herself has said: âDemocracy grows stronger with the full and equal participation of women.â</p>
<p>As one of the worldÂ´s top 20 economies, Australia has a responsibility to contribute to womenÂ´s equality globally.</p>
<p>ThatÂ´s why nearly half of AustraliaÂ´s aid expenditure in 2009-10 was in support of activities promoting gender equality and the empowerment of women.</p>
<p>Australia has a chance to show real global leadership.</p>
<p>I am delighted that from January next year Australia will actively further UN WomenÂ´s work as a member of its Executive Board.</p>
<p>In September last year, I was proud to appoint Penny Williams as AustraliaÂ´s first Global Ambassador for Women and Girls, to advocate internationally for the empowerment of women, particularly in the Asia Pacific region.</p>
<p>IÂ´m pleased sheÂ´s here with us today.</p>
<p>Penny and I are personally committed to improving conditions for women, both in Australia and internationally.</p>
<p>We must forge greater country-to-country links on gender programs and learn from one another.</p>
<p>If the determination and commitment of the remarkable women here today can be amplified globally, we can make our Call to Action a pledge that will benefit generations of women to come. </p>
