FOR PRESS 10. FEBRUARY 1977<br />
EMBARGO: 1 P. i. : li<br />
ADDRESS AT RETURN DINNER GIVEN BY PRIME MINISTER, PORT MORESBY<br />
It is indeed an honour for me to be the first Australian<br />
Prime Minister to visit Papua New Guinea since your indeoendence<br />
celebrations seventeen months ago.<br />
Although I have visited Papua New Guinea on three previous occasions,<br />
this extended visit has enabled me not only to have substantive<br />
and valuable discussions with you, Mr Prime Minister, your<br />
colleagues, and the Leader of the Opposition, but has also allowied<br />
my wife and me to see more of your exciting and beautiful country.<br />
The links between Papua New Guinea and Australia are many and<br />
varied, and since independence a range of complex agreements and<br />
arrangements have been negotiated amicably and successfully.<br />
These do not depend solely on the actions of Government to<br />
sustain them. They are above all personal links based on a<br />
close understanding of each other over many years. They reach<br />
into every corner of our two socieites.<br />
We have a relationship which is soundly based and which looks<br />
confidently towards the future.<br />
The strength of our relationship allows us to discuss issues in<br />
a straight-forward way and to find mutually satisfactory<br />
solutions. The continuation of this plain and open approach, which to date<br />
has marked all our discussions and negotiations, is essent: il<br />
if our relationship is to be further strengthened.<br />
It is in this spirit that negotiations on Torres Strait wiftl<br />
continue during the coming months.<br />
It is our desire and I know it is your desire, Mr Prime Ministcr,<br />
that a mutually satisfactory settlement be concluded.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, since coming to office, my Government has<br />
given high priority to laying a solid basis for this new era of<br />
our relationship. / 2 </p>
<p>We have reaffirmed the importance of a close relationshi. p<br />
betweer Australia and Papua New.. Guinea.<br />
We have reaffirmed the pledge of successive Australian Governments<br />
to give the highest priority to assistance to Papua New Guinea.<br />
Indeed, we have improved on it. The aid agreement which<br />
you and I announced during your visit to Australia last March,<br />
was a long term Australian commitment for a guaranteed minimum<br />
level of aid eachyear for five years.<br />
As you have told us, this agreement has made a substantial<br />
contribution to Papua New Guinea's ability to make its cwn<br />
decisions, to define its own policies and order its own priorities<br />
as an independent nation.<br />
Both Papua New Guinea and Australia live in a world where there<br />
are many tensions, divisions and problems. Both our nations<br />
seek to contribute to the resolution of these issues.<br />
Among the most important of them is the relationship between<br />
developed and developing nations and the economic gap between<br />
rich and poor countries. Mr Prime Minister, we have discussed<br />
these matters in the last few days. We agreed, that the need to<br />
bridge the gap between the developed and developing nations<br />
is pressing. Phrases such as the north/ south dialogue,<br />
the new international economic order have been coined<br />
to capture the imagination of men and build a greater commitment<br />
to come to grips with the problem, precisely because such<br />
phrases can win people's loyalties and commitments. The words<br />
must he yiven a meani which c: in be trn sllteO . into rel i ty.<br />
Otherwise, the idealism which they enlist will be dissipated.<br />
Unrealistic expectations will be created which, in the longer run,<br />
will produce a disenchantment and frustration.<br />
There is a need for change in policies between nations, sometimes<br />
for significant change. To the extent that the call for a new<br />
international economic order is a call for practical and viable<br />
change in economic policies affecting the international<br />
economic system, it should have the support of all nations.<br />
But if the call. is for a total change of our international system,<br />
the result will be misdirected energies, and unrealistic<br />
expectations we will not be coming to grips with the real problems.<br />
Australia believes that making improvements within the<br />
essential framework of the existing international economic system<br />
holds out the greatest hope for the economic progress of all nations.<br />
Present international economic problems are not caused by the<br />
system itself, but by some of the policies nations pursue<br />
within the system it is these that should be changed, not the<br />
system.<br />
One of the major problems facing developing nations is that of<br />
getting secure access to markets of the developed world.<br />
You have had particular problems in gaining access for your<br />
timber products. We also have had difficulties in gaining access<br />
for some of our products. Importing countries need to understand ./ 3 </p>
<p>3.<br />
that there must be continuity of trade both ways. Wve<br />
have been pressingc this view bilaterally and multilaterally<br />
We will be pressing it at CHOGM.<br />
Australia has long supported the idea of commodity agreements<br />
to provide exporters with fair prices and reliable markets<br />
and importers with secure supplies.<br />
Another serious problem is the growing debt burden of the<br />
developing nations. For years Australia has stated that aid<br />
to developing countries should be provided in ways which avoid<br />
adding to their debt burden. Our aid to Papua New Guinea<br />
is grant form, and untied. Governments that purport to<br />
give aid but do so in the form of tied loans are in reality<br />
providing an indirect subsidy to their own industries.<br />
If all the developed countries had followed the lead provided by<br />
the Australia/ Papua New Guinea relationship the enormous third<br />
world debt burden would not have emerged. If our lead were<br />
followed now, the magnitu; e of the debt problem would be<br />
substantially diminished.<br />
Australia and Papua New Guinea are imembers of the Commonwealth<br />
and Mr Somare and I will soon be attending the Commonwealth Heads<br />
of Government Meeting in London. The Commonwealth of Nations<br />
is important, and this Meeting will seek to come to grips with the<br />
major issues of the world today. For too long some people have<br />
regarded the Commonwealth as an appendage from a past era. They<br />
have neglected the fact that it is a multi-racial association<br />
which can contribute significantly to international affairs.<br />
The Commonwealth is a unique institution in which a diversity<br />
of nations of different social, cultural and economic backgrounds<br />
can meet together in an open, constructive and sympathetic climate.<br />
Unlikec the United Nations the Commonwealth is smaller and<br />
more intimate. The superpowers are not members and the rivalries<br />
they engender are more distant. Nowhere else, not even in the<br />
United Nations, do some 30 Heads of Government take time<br />
from their normal pressing duties to spend a week or so together<br />
discussing the problems facing the world.<br />
The (: ovwioic; iith is a microcosm of the international community.<br />
It should be used to make a real contribution to resolving the<br />
problems we face.<br />
Australia regards the matters to be raised in London as so<br />
important that we are establishing a task force composed of all<br />
relevant departments to examine the issues and to advise<br />
on how we may most effectively approach them. Moreover,<br />
Australia has deliberately begun a process of consultations<br />
with Commonwealth leaders in our region.<br />
We have spoken with Mr Lee Kuan Yew and now with You,<br />
Mr Prime Minister. / 4 </p>
<p>I have invited the Priim. e flijstcrs of Fiji, New Zealand,<br />
Tonga -ind We. 1sterni Samoa to visit Australia For an exchange of<br />
views prior to the Conimonaeaith I-eads of Government Meeting.<br />
Mr Peacock will be discussing these matters with Malaysian leaders<br />
when he visits Malaysia in April.<br />
We i~ n Australia want the benefit of all your views before<br />
we finalise our own. One of the major issues discussed at<br />
CHOGM will be the developments in Africa. The political<br />
difficulties in this area derive from the continuing attempt<br />
of one race to subordinate another. We have repeatedly said<br />
that the-only way to resolve the Rhodesian problem is by a<br />
significant and early move to majority rule. We regret<br />
that Mr Smith has rejected the British proposals. So far<br />
as Sothl Africa is concerned,, Australia has stated its views on<br />
the policy of apartheid many times. It is a system which<br />
cannot and will not work.<br />
IBcqlAustralia and Papua New Guinea are strongly opposed to<br />
apartheid, and any other form of racism. Our two nations<br />
have many interests in comrmon.<br />
In the Pacific region we both support the idea of increased<br />
regional cooperation-and we are both members of the South Pacific<br />
Forum. -We share a common desire that the aspirations o: E island<br />
nations, in political and economic areas, can be achieved.<br />
Much hat; been dlone already but I am confident that there is scope<br />
for further initiatives towards cooperation between the peoples<br />
of the region.<br />
In South East Asia, both our governments attach rior ty to<br />
our relations with the ASEAN countries. We both support the basic<br />
objective of those countries, in excluding great power rivalry<br />
from the region.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, although my stay in your country has not been<br />
long, it has enabled me to see at first hand some of the many<br />
changes which are now taking place here. Your desire for the new<br />
to be balanced by a respect for the past, for tradition and<br />
cultural heritage, has been particularly impressive.<br />
It is this delicate but vital balance between innovation arid<br />
traditional values which will provide an important sense of<br />
continuity and stability.<br />
I would like to pay a tribute to the great progress Papua New<br />
Guineai has made in the early days of your independence. Above<br />
all, you are developing your sense of nationhood and pride in<br />
your achievements as a people.<br />
Papua New Guinea has made a reality of its independence and its<br />
future is in the hands of its own people. In a world where<br />
conflict and tensions remaiLn the order of the day, our relationship<br />
is proof that two nations of vastly different social and economic<br />
backgf rounds can live as close to each other as we do without<br />
stultifying one another's separate identity and aspirations. </p>
<p>Mr Prime Minister, thank you for having invited me to<br />
visit Papua New Guinea. I have found our discussions both<br />
stimulating and valuable. The hospitality my wife and I and<br />
all those with me have received has been quite overwhelming.<br />
On their behalf, and on my own behalf, Mr Prime Minister.<br />
I thank you and your colleagues, and the many other people who<br />
have been involved in making this visit so interesting and enjoyable. </p>
