PRIME MINISTER 0C<br />
FOR MEDIA28 July 1983.<br />
I am very pleased that the Street Royal Commission has<br />
completely cleared the NSW Premier, Mr. Neville Wran, of any<br />
impropriety.<br />
At no stage did I believe that the innuendo levelled against<br />
him had any substance whatsoever.<br />
My respect for Neville, Wran has been increased by the manner<br />
in which he sought to have these charges fully tested by a<br />
judicial inquiry.<br />
I now look forward to Neville Wran very quickly returning to<br />
public life.<br />
He will again be able to make an important and valuable'<br />
contribution to tackling the great problems which face this<br />
nation. </p>
