    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...........................</p>
<p>  Well, thank you very much, John; to Richard Alston, my other Parliamentary</p>
<p>   colleagues, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>  This is quite an exciting and, I think, historic night for us here in Parliament</p>
<p>   and also for the interaction between political Australia, if I can put it</p>
<p>   that way, and media Australia. I think, and this doesn't carry any connotations</p>
<p>   of any changes in media policy let me say immediately, but I think this</p>
<p>   country has been incredibly well served by free-to-air television. I think</p>
<p>   the quality of free-to-air television in Australia is better than in any</p>
<p>   other country I've seen and I think what we are witnessing tonight is another</p>
<p>   very interesting stage in the very praiseworthy and meritorious history</p>
<p>   of free-to-air television in Australia.</p>
<p>  I think the aim of providing to the 19 million Australians who consume free-to-air</p>
<p>   television the best technology in the latest available form in a way that's</p>
<p>   accessible to them is a very, very important obligation which is not only</p>
<p>   the responsibility of those who hold the free-to-air licenses but also the</p>
<p>   responsibility of the Government to provide it an intelligible, regulatory</p>
<p>   framework.</p>
<p>  Media policy has always been something in this country that's attracted</p>
<p>   intense debate. And when Richard said I should come along tonight he said</p>
<p>   it's just a very quiet gathering of modest, understated, retiring Australians</p>
<p>   who are coming to this gathering and you'll enjoy it.</p>
<p>  But, finally, can I say that devouring new technology whether it be high</p>
<p>   definition television, whether it be all of the other elements of information</p>
<p>   technology in Australia, devouring new technology has always been a particular</p>
<p>   Australian passion. We have a great desire to master, to understand, to</p>
<p>   enjoy new technology and I think that Australians will take to high definition</p>
<p>   television. Those of us who love our sport, whatever that sport may be,</p>
<p>   will find in high definition television and all that goes with it, an opportunity</p>
<p>   to enjoy the pleasures of our particular sporting passions like we've never</p>
<p>   enjoyed them before. And the opportunities and the new world that it opens</p>
<p>   up and everything else associated with it will be a very, very important</p>
<p>   part of the ongoing entertainment story of this country.</p>
<p>  I want to congratulate Richard Alston as my Minister for the really first</p>
<p>   class job that he's done in this area over the last three-and-a-quarter</p>
<p>   years. I think he's a great Minister for Communications. I know some of</p>
<p>   you here don't always agree with him 100 per cent of the time but I'm sure</p>
<p>   you agree with him most of the time. And that's what he tells me anyway</p>
<p>   and, you know, who am I to disbelieve such a shy, retiring colleague.</p>
<p>  So, ladies and gentlemen, can I again say to the proprietors of free-to-air</p>
<p>   television, thank you for the contribution that you've made to Australian</p>
<p>   society over the last 43 years since that historic moment in 1956. And I</p>
<p>   think that high definition television and all that is associated with it</p>
<p>   is going to be a really exciting chapter in the entertainment story of Australia</p>
<p>   and I can't wait to participate and I think most Australians will feel the</p>
<p>   same way. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>  [Ends]</p>
