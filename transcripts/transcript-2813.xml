SPEECH 3Y THE PRIME MINISTER, TI-HON. E. G. :. TITLAM, O. C.,<br />
TO A DINER GIVEN BY TEV L LAiD DEVELOPME'lNT COiHFEUNC<br />
OF VICTORIA, MELBOU2i-E, 13 FEBRUARY 1973<br />
The decisive issue at the last election was the future<br />
of our cities. It was the response of those who must live in<br />
those cities particularly the growing areas of Melbourne and<br />
Sydney which decided the outcome. The national swing to my<br />
party was about In outer Sydney and Melbourne it was never<br />
less than 5% and as high as 11%. Cities and city life became<br />
one of the great issues in a national election campaign because<br />
the Australian Labor Party believed that the national Government<br />
must increasingly share with State and local Government<br />
responsibility for rebuilding our existing cities and building<br />
new ones. That was the central theme of my campaign.<br />
You will forgive me if I quote myself, but I do so only<br />
to re-affirm my central conviction of the mlevance of the cities<br />
to practically every other national issue which Australia must<br />
face. I said in the Policy Speech:<br />
" Increasingly, a citizen's real standard of living,<br />
the health of himself and his family, his children's<br />
opportunities for education and self-improvement,<br />
his access to employment opportunities, his ability<br />
to enjoy the Nation's resources for recreation and<br />
culture, his ability to participate in the discussions<br />
and activities of the community are determined not by<br />
the hours he works, but by where he lives. This is<br />
why Labor believes that the National Government must<br />
involve itself directly in cities. Practically every<br />
major national problem relates to cities."<br />
Believing this, we have moved promptly to implement our<br />
undertakings. A Department of Urban and Regional Development has<br />
already been created. It will be a major policy department of the<br />
Government. It is to have a creative, initiating and coordinating<br />
role in policy as well as an administrative responsibility for the<br />
application of that policy.<br />
The department will have a responsibility for creating<br />
a National Urban strategy a statement of a national attitude<br />
to urban and regional growth, a statement of priorities in the<br />
urban field and a guideline statement for Government and private<br />
action. This strategy will be concerned with the future of all<br />
urban areas, old as well as new.<br />
I am reminded of the definition of an urban planner as<br />
a person who rearranges the deck chairs on ' The Titanic'. Despite<br />
the tone of fatalism that is often reflected in debate on urban<br />
affairs, I am convinced that we can that we must succeed.<br />
! e are all in the same boat whatever its name. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
ee should not be discouraged by the failures of the past.<br />
" here is a new factor which should not be underestimated: the full<br />
resources and expertise of the Australian Government are now committed<br />
to the task. While the Labor administration is mindful of the important<br />
contribution the various State Governments can mlake towards determining<br />
national iolicies on the cities and regions, we reject the implicit<br />
. ownradin of the role of the iational Government. The shibboleth<br />
of States rights must no lone or be used as an excuse to deny the rights<br />
of the majori of itrlians. Certainly, we know that only with<br />
ta:; c co-ou'eration will we be able to solve the problems of the cities.<br />
WTe recognise, however, that the iational Government must<br />
involve itself in the problems of all urban areas, the old as Iwell as<br />
the ne, the existing cities as much as the new ones which we believe<br />
must be built before the end of this century.<br />
If I night again refer to the Policy Speech my colleague,<br />
hr. Deazley, refers to it as the Hew Testament to distinguish it from<br />
the Old Testament embodied in the Party platform I said:<br />
" A Labor Government will have two over-riding objectives<br />
to give Australian mfailios access to land and housing<br />
at fair prices and to Preserve and enhance the quality<br />
of the national estate of which land is the very foundation."<br />
There should be no doubt about our c. termination to halt the<br />
rise in land prices. There is scarcely an undertahirng we gave to which<br />
we are so firmly committed. Te are convinced that if any serious<br />
effort is to be made to et land prices down, then Governments must<br />
participate in the buying, development and leasing or selling of<br />
residential land. It is a practice long accepted in most comnparable<br />
countries. Yet because it has not been the Australian eractice I<br />
presume because it was regarded as socialism the price of land in<br />
every State capital has more than trebled in the last decade. Tha<br />
Comonwealth Banking Corporation has conducted periodic surveys of<br />
land prices. Thcy show that in ieolbourne between 1968 and 1971 the<br />
average price for a block of land which the Banh classified as modest,<br />
increased by In Canberra, alone the local authority which happens to be<br />
the 1ational Government owined, develoed and leased the residential<br />
land. In Canberra clone were prices held stable. Two years ago the<br />
rules were changed and the result was Canberra exerienced last year<br />
the most expensive land boom in Australia. So, at no gain to the<br />
community, hundreds of Australians obli ed to live in Canberra for<br />
their living, are being needlessly &gt; urdened by high land prices.<br />
Conversely, hundreds of thousands of Australians can be saved millions<br />
if only the Commoronwealth will make grants to the States to enable<br />
then to acquire, sub-divide, develop and sell or lease at cost<br />
substantial tracts of housing land. , Te prooose to do it. </p>
