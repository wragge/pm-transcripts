FOR MEDIA 31 DECEMBER 1986<br />
The Acting Prime Minister, Mr Bowen, today sent the<br />
following message to Mrs Antill-Rose, daughter of the<br />
late Dr John Antill:<br />
" On behalf of the Government and people of Australia<br />
I extend to you and your family sincere condolences<br />
on the death of your father Dr John Antill, CMG, OBE.<br />
Dr Antill was a great Australian whose contribution<br />
to Australia's musical life as a composer, conductor<br />
and as music editor for the ABC, will always be<br />
remembered. His compositions, including the ballet<br />
Corroboree, created a place for Australian music in<br />
the international arena and helped to raise<br />
Australians' consciousness of their land and its<br />
heritage. Dr Antill will be sadly missed." </p>
