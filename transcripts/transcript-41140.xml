    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia strongly condemns North Korea’s latest ballistic missile test.</p>
<p>The missile flew over Japanese territory,  posing an unacceptable threat to peace and stability in our region.</p>
<p>This morning’s test firing represents a serious escalation by Pyongyang. It is a provocative and threatening act by a dangerous regime.</p>
<p>North Korea’s nuclear weapons program is in violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions and continues in defiance of repeated demands by the international community for the regime to halt these actions and focus the country’s resources on the welfare of its impoverished people.</p>
<p>Australia calls on all countries to fully implement existing UN Security Council resolutions to place pressure on Pyongyang to change its behaviour.</p>
<p>We also call on major economic partners of North Korea, including China and Russia, to use their bilateral economic leverage over Pyongyang to persuade the regime to abandon its illegal missile and nuclear weapons programs.</p>
<p>In addition to implementing all UN Security Council resolutions, Australia continues to implement a strong autonomous sanctions regime against individuals and entities supporting North Korea.</p>
<p>We will continue to work with our partners, including the United States, Japan, the Republic of Korea and China, to impose costs on the regime in order to end its threatening and destabilising behaviour. </p>
