JOHN BELL<br />
I regret the passing of John Bell, the Melbourne businessman who contributed so much<br />
to young unemployed and homeless people.<br />
As the managing director of the Esprit clothing company, John Bell provided<br />
inspirational community leadership in his approach to training and developing young<br />
people. I recall with gratitude his contribution to the Government's national youth summit last<br />
year. John Bell will be remembered as a man of generous spirit with an exemplary<br />
sense of social responsibility.<br />
