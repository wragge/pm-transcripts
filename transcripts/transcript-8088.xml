PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF SEPARATE INTERVIEWS WITH CHANNEL NINE AND ABC<br />
TV, HARRY WOODS' ELECTORATE OFFICE, GRAFTON<br />
16 AUGUST 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: There is a growing amount of concern from<br />
overseas countries this morning that Australia and the US<br />
should stay out of the Gulf crisis. What's your reaction to<br />
that? PM: It is also the case that there is a growing support for<br />
the decision of those countries to go in. As I said the<br />
other day, and I repeat it to your viewers, there is a<br />
paradox about this decision for me. It was the most serious<br />
one I have had to take as Prime Minister but it was also, in<br />
the end, a very easy one because the principles are clear.<br />
We hope that there is no conflict, no armed conflict. But<br />
if there is one lesson the world should learn from this<br />
century it is this, from that disastrous decade of the<br />
thirties. We had the unmeasurable tragedy of the Second<br />
World War for two reasons. One was the tyranny of the Axis<br />
powers and the evil of them. There was also the second<br />
condition and that was the appeasers. And without the<br />
second the first couldn't have produced the tragedy of the<br />
Second World War. The lesson of that is burnt into my mind.<br />
And if we believe therefore in the principle of the rights<br />
of independent nations to be free and to be free from naked<br />
aggression from their neighbours and it is no good just<br />
saying that we believe that we have to be prepared even at<br />
some risk to back up our beliefs with action.<br />
JOURNALIST: How then do you view the criticism from Gough<br />
Whitlam saying that perhaps your decision has been a little<br />
bit too rash?<br />
PM: Well Gough seems to be entering a phase now of<br />
gratuitous advice to Government. He has been telling us<br />
recently how to run the economy which led one of his<br />
previous staffers to ring us up and saying having Mr Whitlam<br />
giving advice on how to run the economy is like having Nero<br />
giving advice about firefighting. Now it was a fair<br />
comment, one of which he would have been proud himself I<br />
think. Now Gough is entitled to his views but he showed as<br />
Prime Minister that he wasn't, let me say, incapable of<br />
error at times. I respect Gough Whitlam. but on this issue I<br />
think he is wrong. The important thing is this, that we<br />
have made a decision now which involves a limited role for<br />
our ships. It involves four functions as it has been spelt </p>
<p>out identification, contact, interrogation and warning to<br />
any ships and not at this stage the question of<br />
interdiction. Now we have got some 18 or 19 days before the<br />
ships are actually in the zone. There will be a lot of<br />
discussion and consultation between now and then and<br />
hopefully before then the matter will be resolved. That's<br />
my greatest hope that Saddam Hussein will see the stupidity<br />
of his decision and that the best interests of the Iraqi<br />
people are served by withdrawing. That's the best outcome.<br />
But if he hasn't done that then we've made it clear as a<br />
Cabinet that if there are changed circumstances between now<br />
and then which would require some enhanced role for the most<br />
effective presence of our forces then we would consider that<br />
as a Cabinet and make the decision if necessary. The role<br />
that we have decided on is one which the United States<br />
understands and regards as the valuable contribution I<br />
believe it is.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister as you know a couple of<br />
political commentators have criticised the haste with which<br />
you committed the ships to the Gulf. What's your immediate<br />
reaction to that?<br />
PM: Well it wasn't hasty. I mean there is a perception in<br />
some quarters that I got a ring from George Bush on the<br />
Friday morning and made my decision on the basis of that<br />
call. Of course this is a totally erroneous perception.<br />
This matter had been raised much earlier in the week in<br />
Washington. There had been serious discussion there then<br />
discussion by me with Ministers and others and it was a very<br />
considered decision. There was no ill haste in it. I've<br />
said that it was a paradox in the sense it is the most<br />
serious decision that I have had to take as Prime Minister<br />
but, in the end, it was a relatively easy decision because<br />
the principles were clear.<br />
JOURNALIST: It has been said that part of the criticism has<br />
come about because the ground rules even for confrontation<br />
weren't even laid down before the ships were committed.<br />
PM: Well this again is an ill-thought through analysis and<br />
objection. Let me say why I have that view and I am not<br />
objecting to criticism but at least when it's made people<br />
should understand the inadequacy of their analysis. We have<br />
a situation where it takes from the time the ships left<br />
Sydney about 22 days to get to the Gulf region. We made it<br />
clear in our discussions with the Americans that there were<br />
matters of detail and important matters of detail that had<br />
to be decided and they understand that. We've got plenty of<br />
time to do that. The Navy understands that and are involved<br />
deeply in the discussions obviously. And by the time our<br />
vessels arrive there their role and their relationship with<br />
others will be established crystal clearly. What we've made<br />
clear at this time out of discussions with the Americans<br />
that the role initially will be seen as what we have<br />
identified as four things that's identification, this is<br />
in regard to shipping in the region, identification,<br />
contact, interrogation and warning and not at this stage </p>
<p>interdiction. But the Cabinet made it clear that if in the<br />
processes of consultation that are going on now before the<br />
ships get there, if it becomes clear that some enlarged role<br />
would be appropriate then the Cabinet would consider that.<br />
JOURNALIST: So our men won't be boarding ships?<br />
PM: Well at this stage no. And that is understood by the<br />
United States and is regarded, the role that I am talking<br />
about is regarded by the United States as a very useful<br />
role. When I refer to the United States it is not well you<br />
tell us what to do and that will be OK but the facts are<br />
that they are the major naval force and will be the major<br />
naval force in the area and obviously it's sensible you talk<br />
with them. And they regard that role as important. But I<br />
repeat, if it's appropriate for more to be done then Cabinet<br />
will consider that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Cabinet ratified the decision though one<br />
commentator who I am sure you have read has criticised the<br />
fact that Cabinet didn't make the decision.<br />
PM: Well let me make it clear that I consulted the members<br />
of the Security Committee, that is all, Neal Blewett was<br />
overseas so I couldn't contact him, but all the Ministers<br />
that I contacted were members of the Security Committee.<br />
That Security Committee doesn't usurp Cabinet but what I am<br />
saying is that that Security Committee has to take a range<br />
of decisions that are very very significant for this<br />
country. I had no doubt what the sense of Cabinet was<br />
because you will recall that earlier we had had discussion<br />
about sanctions. I had no doubt at all what the sense of<br />
Cabinet was and the fact that I had no doubt about the sense<br />
of Cabinet was reflected that when we did go to Cabinet this<br />
week there was endorsement of what I did.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is your preferred option for our men to be<br />
under UN control?<br />
PM: Yes we have made it clear and indeed let it be<br />
understood the United States has said they would prefer a<br />
situation where there was the blue cover of the United<br />
Nations. But let me make this important point that my<br />
reading of the situation and perhaps more importantly than<br />
that the advice of our relevant departments is that we have<br />
legal sanction, legal cover for what we are doing through<br />
the combination of the provisions of Section 51 of the UN<br />
Charter together with the letter that I had from the Emir of<br />
Kuwait. JOURNALIST: Do we push on regardless of getting that UN<br />
protection? PM: Well we do two things. What we'll be doing is to be<br />
part of a series of processes which will try and get a UN<br />
decision because from every point of view it would be<br />
desirable if you could have that as well. But yes we will<br />
go on because there is legal sanction for what we are doing. </p>
<p>I mean history shows you that you don't hang around and<br />
condone aggression by inaction. Kuwait today, Saudi Arabia<br />
tomorrow. Who next? And if the thirties tell us anything<br />
they tell us the disastrous nature of that concept.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does it annoy you that Gough Whitlam has become<br />
involved again as he has done over the last couple of months<br />
in other issues?<br />
PM: Doesn't annoy me. It seems reasonably difficult for<br />
ex-prime ministers to retire gracefully. The pre-eminent<br />
exponent of that, of course, was Robert Menzies. Once he<br />
went out he left it to others. But Gough, as I have just<br />
said recently, seems to be entering a phase of gratuitous<br />
advice on a range of subjects. No I don't object to that.<br />
I simply, I got a little bit of amusement out of one of his<br />
former staffers ringing in when he was giving us the<br />
economic advice the other day and that former member of his<br />
staff said to have Gough Whitlam giving a government advice<br />
on how to run the economy is like asking Nero for advice on<br />
firefighting techniques.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the economy the Coalition yesterday adopted<br />
consumption tax as policy. What's your reaction to that?<br />
PM: Well the reaction is in two parts. I was fascinated by<br />
the reports of their meeting and the deep divisions within<br />
the conservative parties on this issue, the reported remark<br />
of Wilson Tuckey that this was an act of collective<br />
political suicide. So there is great and deep division<br />
within the conservative parties as well there might be.<br />
which leads me to the second point. There was an argument<br />
earlier in the 80s when we looked at it but we have so<br />
transformed and widened the tax base noiv that the very<br />
obvious disadvantages far outweigh any perceived advantages.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is Mr Tuckey right, is it political suicide?<br />
Can a political party in Australia win an election promising<br />
a new tax?<br />
PM: You need to make this point in regard to that question,<br />
no election is ever decided in my judgement on one issue.<br />
This one issue won't be the single issue that the electors<br />
of the next election will have in their mind as to who<br />
should govern them next. But I do say this that by the time<br />
we go into the next election I have no doubt at all that on<br />
this issue it will be a political minus for the Opposition.<br />
JOURNALIST: Overnight or yesterday BP and Caltex told the<br />
inquiry into petrol pricing that they were going to seek<br />
compensation as a result of the petrol freeze. Will you<br />
consider that?<br />
PM: We have the processes and tribunals where they can go<br />
and put their arguments on this.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you consider compensation though? </p>
<p>PM: No what I'm saying is that there is a tribunal that<br />
they go to and make their arguments. It is for those<br />
tribunals to make their decisions about whether they have<br />
established an argument and what pricing level should come<br />
out of that and I will allow those processes to take their<br />
course.<br />
JOURNALIST: Finally there was a report today that<br />
Mrs Kirner might come to you seeking extra funding for<br />
Victoria to help her out of the position that Victoria is<br />
now in since she has just taken over the premiership. Can<br />
you see yourself giving Victoria any more money over and<br />
above the Commonwealth grants?<br />
PM: Mrs Kirner came to see me yesterday and I had quite a<br />
long meeting with Mrs Kirner, and Mr White and Mr Roper, two<br />
of her important economic ministers, they didn't ask for<br />
additional assistance. They discussed certain issues with<br />
us and as is appropriately within our power and areas of<br />
responsibilities to do things which may be helpful, we will.<br />
But that does not involve the giving of additional<br />
assistance.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you elaborate on what those issues are?<br />
PM: I could but it's not appropriate that I do.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think she is going to be able to pull<br />
Victoria out of it?<br />
PM: I think she can. It would be stupid for me to say yes<br />
she is right they are going to achieve all they want to do<br />
and win the next election. But I think they can.<br />
