FOR PRESS 6 NOVENBER 1978<br />
MEETING WITH SIR CHARLES COURT AND MR BJELKE-PETERSEN<br />
The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, and the Premier<br />
of Western Australia, Sir Charles Court, and the Premier of<br />
Queensland, Mr Joh ] jelke-Petersen, today had useful and<br />
productive discussions on mineral export policy. They all<br />
agreed that a resolution of differences between the Commonwealth<br />
and the States was important to maximise investment and trade<br />
opportunities to achieve the maximum advantage for Australia.<br />
Mr Joh Bjelke-Petersen and Sir Charles Court expressed their<br />
disagreement with the Commonwealth's 24 October 1978 announcement<br />
about export price guidelines and procedure.<br />
The meeting acknowledged the Constitutional position of the<br />
Commonwealth Government in respect of export licensing but<br />
Queensland and Western Australia expressed fears of unnecessary<br />
intervention by the Commonwealth.<br />
The Commonwealth expressed the view that in certain marketing<br />
situations the negotiating arm of some Australian companies needed<br />
strengthening and that was the purpose of export controls.<br />
It was agreed that closer cooperation between the Commonwealth and<br />
States is needed in the interests of achieving the maximuim benefit<br />
from resources development consistent with the National Interest.<br />
With this in view as suggested by the Commonwealth, there will<br />
be discussions at Commonwealth/ State Minister and officer levels<br />
to review the guidelines announced on 24 October 1978 and the<br />
method of application to ensure encouragement of trade and investment.<br />
As also indicated by the Commonwealth companies will be closely<br />
involved in discussions.<br />
The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister repeated that the<br />
guidelines were forwarded to the States and the industry as a<br />
draft for discussion.<br />
In the meantime, it was agreed that the States and companies would<br />
be consulted where necessary about the parameters for current<br />
negotiations so that they can prbceed quickly under the present<br />
guidelines pending completion of the review. The Commonwealth was<br />
anxious to avoid a vacuum in negotiations in the immediate future<br />
as it was obvious agreement could not be reached at a single meeting. </p>
