lijUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 6 MARCH 1986<br />
At the invitation of Prime Minister Nakasone, I shall make a<br />
working visit to Japan on 15-18 may. This follows my official<br />
visit to Japan in early 1984 and Prime Minister Nakasone's visit<br />
to Australia in January 1985.<br />
my visit to Japan will provide an opportunity to exchange<br />
perspectives on regional and international developments and to<br />
develop further our dialogue on the Australia-Japan relationship.<br />
Japan is important to us not only because it is our major trading<br />
partner. It plays an important role in wider international<br />
trading and financial relations and has an increasingly<br />
significant voice on international political issues. Australia<br />
and Japan share a fundamental interest in the stability and<br />
prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
my visit will provide a timely opportunity to hear, first hand,<br />
the outcome of the Tokyo Economic Summit on 4-6 May.<br />
I expect that my discussions with Mr Nakasone and his ministers<br />
will assist a further strengthening of our dynamic economic<br />
relationship with Japan.<br />
In our bilateral dealings Australia is concerned to ensure that<br />
our trade with Japan proceeds on a commercial basis, with each<br />
country recognising the other's capacity in those areas where it<br />
is a competitive and reliable supplier. During my discussions in<br />
Tokyo I shall stress the Australian Government's commitment to<br />
develop a more efficient and dynamic industrial base one able<br />
to take full advantage of Japan's market Opening Measures.<br />
my discussions in Tokyo will also provide an opportunity to<br />
review the joint efforts of Japan and Australia to promote a<br />
successful launching of the forthcoming multilateral trade<br />
negotiations. The consultative process established through the<br />
Regional Trade initiative provides an important basis on which<br />
countries in the region, including Australia and Japan, can<br />
further develop shared perceptions and positions in the lead up<br />
to a new round.<br />
I shall be paying an official visit to China following my visit<br />
to Japan. </p>
