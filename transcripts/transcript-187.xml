P. M. No. 19/ 196o<br />
UNI VE SITY SALARIES<br />
Statement by Acting Prime Minister. Mr. J. MoEwen<br />
The Acting-Prime Minister, Mr. McEwen, said today that<br />
thle Australian Universities Commission, having regard to movements<br />
in professorial salaries during the past two years, has<br />
proposed that the Commfonwealth Government should accept an increase<br />
in the basic professorial salary on which Commonwealth<br />
assistance is made available under the States Grants ( Universities)<br />
Act. Some States, he said, had sought a lead from the<br />
Commission on the question of University salaries. The Commission<br />
had advised the Commonwealth that it would be appropriate to<br />
assist the States in respect of salary rises up to f-4 000 a year<br />
for basic professorial salaries as from 1st July, 1966. The<br />
Commission has also recommended that the salaries of sub-professorial<br />
staff should be suitably adjusted.<br />
Mr. McEwen said that the Commonwealth accepted these<br />
recommendations. He emphasised that the actual level of salary<br />
increases in each State iras not a matter for the Commission or<br />
the Commonwealth Government to determine. The Commonwealth,<br />
however, is prepared to meet its share of any increase in University<br />
salaries up to the level indicated. Whether the actual<br />
professorial salaries paid in State Universities were higher or<br />
lower was a matter for the State Governments and their Universities.<br />
Mr. McEwen pointed out that there had been general acceptance<br />
of the Murray Committee report ( on which the present<br />
level of assistance is based) which includes the concept that<br />
University salaries throughout Australia should be more or less<br />
in line. The Gommonwealth has assumed heavy financial commitments<br />
under the States Grants ( Universities) Act, arid it also has<br />
its own direct responsibility for the Australian National U~ niversity<br />
and the Canberra University College. Because salaries form<br />
such a large element in University ' costs, the Commonwealth must<br />
necessarily concern itself with movements in University salaries.<br />
During the past eight months the Commission I1Rs visited<br />
all Universities and has considered their needs for the 1961/ 63<br />
triennium. Since approximately 601o of the recurrent expenditure<br />
at Universities is devoted to salaries, the Commission recommended<br />
the appointment of an expert committee to advise it on the<br />
appropriate levels for academic salaries throughout Australian<br />
Universities for the 1961/ 63 triennium and on other relevant<br />
matters. The Acting Prime Minister said that the Government had<br />
accepted this recommendation.<br />
Mr. McEwen said that the committee would be under the<br />
Chairmanship of Sir Leslie Martin, the Chairman of the Australian<br />
Universities Commission, and :* iould comprise the following members:<br />
Dr. 11,0. Coombs, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr.<br />
L. B. Hamilton, First Assistant Secretary, Department of the<br />
Treasury, Canberra, Professor Sir George P ton, Chairman of the<br />
Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee, Mr. G. F. Seaman, Under<br />
Treasurer, South Australia and Mr. L. J. Jeickhardt, Technical<br />
Director Imperial. Chemical industries of Australia and New<br />
Zealand Limited. The Acting Prime Minister added that the<br />
committee would have power to co-opt where special information<br />
was required and that interested bodies would be invited to prepare<br />
submissions for the consideration of the committee.<br />
