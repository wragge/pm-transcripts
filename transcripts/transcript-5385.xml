ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The Government's determination to continue with responsible<br />
economic management is unwavering. We can never mratch the<br />
economic promises of our opponents and their promises of<br />
enlarged and more powerful 9overnment. To do so would run<br />
counter to our own notion of government responsibility.<br />
A central plank in discharging that responsibility is to continue<br />
our fight against inflation. The importance of this fight was<br />
emphasised this week with the release of international inflation<br />
figures. The latest statistics from the OECD that is from the<br />
advanced Western democracies-show that Australia is continuing<br />
to improve its competitive position in relation to other major<br />
industrialised nations.<br />
During 1979 and 1980 inflation rates around the world have risen<br />
boosted in part by steep increases in oil prices and by prices<br />
of other commodities. We have been subject to the same pressures<br />
yet the rate of inflation in Australia has increased by only<br />
half as much as inflation in other major industrialised countries.<br />
Official figures make this point very clear.<br />
Since the end of 1978 the inflation rate for all OECD countries<br />
has risen by 5 per cent while in Australia it has risen by less<br />
than 3 per cent. In the United States it has risen by approaching<br />
6 per cdenit; in Japan by nearly 5 per cent; in Germany by about<br />
3 per cent and in the United Kingdom by a massive 13.4 per cent.<br />
The inflation rate has more than doubled in Japan, Germany and<br />
the United Kingdom.<br />
Yet in Australia our inflation rate is more than 3 percentage<br />
points lower than the OECD average and the margin in our favour<br />
has been increasing since the middle of 1978. Nevertheless we<br />
cannot afford to be complacent. These raw statistics reflect<br />
our improved trade performance, and our economic strength and<br />
prospects. Exports are up, confidence is higher, and employment<br />
in Australia has increased. The prospect is for further gains,<br />
by continuing with sound and responsible economic policies.<br />
This picture of economic strength and vitality stands in contrast<br />
to those bleak years of 1974 and 1975, when the then government<br />
with total disregard for the effects of its policies decided to<br />
spend its way into the hearts of the electorate. </p>
<p>Inflation went -through the roof -in 1975, our inflation<br />
hit 17 per cent and was nearly 4percentage points higher<br />
than the OECD average during the ycear nf 1975.<br />
It has taken four years of hard work-by my Government and the<br />
people of Australia together to rebuild the economic strength<br />
of this nation; the economic strengbCh that Labor so . wijlfully<br />
destroyed. Australia's achievem~ nts have been won by persistence.<br />
By accepting that, hard decisions were necessary. This is not<br />
the time to throw our gains away.<br />
Against this background, the current national wage case is of<br />
vital importance. The Full Bench of-the Arbitration Commission<br />
is now considering its decision. All Australians would expect<br />
a decision which would allow us to reap the benefits of enhanced<br />
international competitiveness. A large wage increase would add<br />
intolerable pressure to the costs of production, thereby raising<br />
prices, weakening the momentum of our trade overseas, and<br />
depressing output and employment-within Australia.<br />
In this context, the 35 hour week being advocated by some trade<br />
unions is patently irresponsible. Shortening the working week<br />
by five hours without a corresponding cut in wages would raise<br />
labour costs by at least 12 per cent more if overtime increased<br />
as a result. It has been estimated that the full additional<br />
cost of labour from a 35 hour week would be in the region of<br />
21 per cent. No-one could responsibly advocate this sort of<br />
increase in hourly wage rates at this time. our survival in the<br />
harsh world of international trade depends on sanity prevailing<br />
at home. We must reject moves to shorten hours of work.<br />
During the coming week while the National Wage case is being<br />
considered the States and the Commonwealth will meet at the<br />
Premiers' Conference in Canberra. Just as this is not the time<br />
to meet high wage demands., it is also not the time for extravagant<br />
Government spending by the Commonwealth or by the States. We have<br />
to maintain vigilance over all levels of Government spending.<br />
I am meeting with the Premiers' to discuss a wide range of matters<br />
including financial arrangements for next year. In past years<br />
the Federal Government has been generous to the Statesirrespective<br />
of what may be said at the time by individual<br />
Premiers. The Government's new Federalism policy reversed the<br />
trend of the 11hitlam Government by giving the States more freedom<br />
to decide how they would spend their money.<br />
General tax sharing payments to the States through the<br />
Government's tax sharing arrangements have grown from just under<br />
per cent to 57 per cent of total payments to the States since<br />
1975-76. There has been a corresponding decline in theproportion<br />
of total payments tied to particular programmes.<br />
Therefore the States have had more freedom to use federal monies<br />
in the way that they prefer. </p>
<p>On top of that, we have guaranteed to Local Governments throughout<br />
Australia 2 per cent of income tax collections. This move<br />
has been warmnly welcomed by the local administrators, who were<br />
for too long the poor cousins in the Australian system of<br />
Government. We have also introduced a new programme which allows the State<br />
authorities to borrow from overseas to financo major infrastructure<br />
developments and more than $ 2 billion worth of borrowings<br />
have already been approved. These funds help provide the imoetusfor<br />
a great programme of national development which will provide<br />
investment and employment opportunities and rewards for<br />
Australians in the decade ahead.<br />
However, with the new freedom enjoyed by the States come new<br />
disciplines. For example, the tax sharing arrangements make<br />
sure that the States as well as the Commonwealth, are constrained<br />
in their rate of growth of expenditure by tax indexation.<br />
The fight against inflation should not be a matter for the<br />
Federal Government alone. All levels of government have a part<br />
to play in exercising restraint. There are always individual<br />
progranumes and projects which, if looked at by themselves<br />
seem to have a case for additional funds.<br />
But as'the Federal Government we have an over-riding responsibility<br />
to look at the total picture. We must never forget that the<br />
unchecked expansion of government Commonwealth and State<br />
would threaten the success of our continuing fight against inflation.<br />
And therefore in the long run would threaten the well-being of<br />
every business and every individual in Australia.<br />
Australia enters the 80s with lower inflation; significant<br />
successes in cost containment; and an economic system with more<br />
appropriate rewards for risk taking and enterprise. It is<br />
understandable that investors are now loohing to Australia with<br />
justifiable confidence and, as Australians, we are entitled to<br />
view the short and the longer term prospects with optimism.<br />
Our success in recent years in the face of significant economic<br />
difficulties has made this possible. We know there will<br />
be difficulties in the future.<br />
We must commit ourselves as a nation, as one community, to<br />
overcome whatever the difficulties may be; to make sure that<br />
Australia takes advantage of the enormous opportunities open<br />
to us. 000---</p>
