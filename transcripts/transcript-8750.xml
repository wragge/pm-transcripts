PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING M. P,<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS TO THE FECCA CONGRESS, CANBERRA<br />
THURSDAY, 3 DECEMBER 1992<br />
Ladies anid gentlemen<br />
I am very pleased to have the opportunity to address this<br />
third Congress of the Federation of Ethnic Communities<br />
Councils of Australia.<br />
Over the years, FECCA has made a substantial contribution<br />
to the process of~ nation-buildinfg, to Strengthening the<br />
social fabric, and to defining an Aus~ trali -an identity.<br />
which more accurately reflects today's national<br />
aspirations and realities.<br />
I congratulate you for it and urge you to keep up the<br />
good work.<br />
You have played a leading role in one of the<br />
unquestionable success stories of this country's history.<br />
Multicultural Australia is one of the great social<br />
engineering achievements. In a world once more torn by<br />
ethnic hatred and bloodshed, what has been done here<br />
stands increasingly as a benchmark of democratic common<br />
sense. it is something all Australians should be proud of and<br />
I say " all" advisedly.<br />
I say it because while governments have played a leading<br />
part in this success, and FECCA has played a notable part<br />
with various ethnic groups, and while the ethnic<br />
-communities are themselves deserving of enormous credit,<br />
ina the last resort success depended on Australian<br />
democratic values and_ principles of tolerance.<br />
The policies of multiculturalism encouraged those ideals<br />
of course. Groups like your own have encouraged<br />
tolerance. But, as I said to a recent immigration conference, the<br />
triumph of multiculturalism, is a triumphi of Australian<br />
democracy. </p>

It is built arnd could only be built on a sturdy sense<br />
of-social justice.<br />
Australia was inclined to narrowness arnd xenophobia,<br />
there is rno doubt. All nations in their own way are.<br />
Not a11 nations, however, overcome these feelings.<br />
In not all nations are the democratic values stronger<br />
than the undemocratic ones, the values of-tolerance, the<br />
idea of fai -rness stroriger than the feelings of fear and<br />
resentment towards those who are different.<br />
In Australia to an unsurpassed extent they manifestly<br />
are. And must remain.<br />
in the 1990s I would like to see Australians counting the<br />
democracy they have built here high among their many<br />
reasons for pride.<br />
And the success of multiculturalism high among their<br />
democracy'se achievements.<br />
Multiculturalism should never be seen as a denial of<br />
Australia's heritage, but as an affirmatioi of our<br />
democratic values -and traditions.<br />
The notions of access and equity are not new ones they<br />
were current at the birth of the Federation. They were<br />
there in the 1890s. They have been with us ever since.<br />
Properly understood, multicultural~ ism is an extension of<br />
democracy of pluralism.<br />
The proper end of multicultural policies is cultural<br />
plurallsm The integrity of different cultures within an<br />
Australian democratic framework.<br />
I say these things because I think it will be good for us<br />
in this last decade of the century, the decade leading to<br />
the centenary of federation, to re-awaken awareness of<br />
Australian social democracy.<br />
Awareness of our social democratic values and<br />
achievements. I think sometimes we could do more to raise our<br />
democratic consciousness.<br />
I think it would at once help reinforce democratic<br />
institutions and traditions, and make the way easier for<br />
necessary change.<br />
Multiculturalism is among the institutions a greater<br />
level of democratic consciousness would support. </p>

Multiculturalismi as I have described it the opposite<br />
and the antidote to ethnocentrism and cultural<br />
fragmentat ion.<br />
It is a source of cultural strength arnd, as we are now<br />
discovering, a potential source of economic strength.<br />
In this regard I was pleased to attend the ' Productive<br />
Diversity conference, and to announce there some steps we<br />
are taking to exploit our linguistic and cultural<br />
diversity in the interests of a stronger, internationally<br />
oriented economy.<br />
As you probably know I also told the conference that we<br />
have taken steps to assist job seekers whose lack of<br />
formal English is impeding their employment prospects.<br />
In another innovation we have established the Bilingual<br />
Consultants Network to meet the need for<br />
governments to identify the views of individuals and<br />
groups within the community when planning their policies<br />
and services.<br />
The network is designed to act as a channel for the views<br />
of those Australians who, through language, cultural or<br />
geographic barriers have not to date been adequately<br />
considered. The Australia-wide BCN comprising 600 people and fifty<br />
languages, and extending to all States and the Northern<br />
Territory, is now available to government and community<br />
organisations. It can, for example, let agencies and companies gather<br />
knowledge among client groups of their policies and<br />
programs. it is an invaluable, cost effective tool for those who<br />
require soundly-based information on the needs and views<br />
of all Australians.<br />
By such means as these the Government can do much to<br />
create an envitroinent in which all Australians have a<br />
chance to play a part in society.<br />
When I say all Australians let me specifically<br />
acknowledge immigrant women, of all ages and backgrounds,<br />
who have contributed so much to this country and whose<br />
needs, I recognise, have not always been met as they<br />
should. Ladies and Gentleman,<br />
Ethnic radio is a major element in the Government<br />
strategy for enabling those from non-English speaking<br />
backgrounds, particularly older residents and newly<br />
arrived migrants, to participate in the life of<br />
Australia. TEL </p>

Ethnic radio programming is an important vehicle for<br />
accommodating the information and communication needs of<br />
people from non-English speaking backgrounds.<br />
Unfortunately, there is at present insufficient air time<br />
available on the SBS's two radio stations to satisfy the<br />
programming demands of all ethnic communities in Sydney<br />
and Melbourne.<br />
-SoS currently provides programming in approximately 64<br />
different languages between 6am and midnight, but the<br />
demand on available air time means some languages are<br />
limited to half an hour per fortnight.<br />
And there is no SBS radio service outside Sydney and<br />
Melbourne. To provide migrant communities with a fairer share of<br />
broadcasting services, I am pleased to announce that the<br />
Government is establishing a.-s econd -SBS radio network in<br />
Melbourne and Sydney, and extending the service to Perth,<br />
Adelaide, Brisbane, Darwin, Canberra and Hobart.<br />
For the first time, Australia will have a _ nati-onl ethnic<br />
broadcasting network.<br />
A second SBS radio network will begin broadcasting to<br />
Melbourne in December 1993 and to Sydney in July 1994.<br />
The first services to Adelaide, Perth, Brisbane and<br />
Darwin will commence In late 1993 with services to<br />
Canberra and Hobart to follow.<br />
The new network will ensure that the many people in<br />
Sydney and Melbourne who are of non-English speaking<br />
background get a better deal.<br />
its programs will be directed to meeting the needs of<br />
ethnic communities in Sydney and Melbourne which cannot<br />
now be accommodated on Radio 2EA and 3EA.<br />
The new service will complement the excellent EA radio<br />
services in each city, and also those of the volunteerbased<br />
public -radiQ. stations that offer multi-lingual<br />
programs. Community broadcasters have nothing to fear from the<br />
decision to extend SBS radio services. The Government<br />
will continue to support the public broadcasting sector.<br />
The new network will help meet the needs of ethnic<br />
communities for programs in their own languages,<br />
including communities affected by the recent<br />
re-scheduling of services on Radio 2EA and 3EA. </p>
<p>TEL: 3. Dec. 92 9: 43 No. 017 P. 07/ 09<br />
The programs will mostly originate from SBS's new studios<br />
at Artarmon in Sydney and be networked to other capital<br />
cities. The SBS will be carrying out consultations with ethnic<br />
communities and stakeholder groups before taking final<br />
decisions on program content, format and scheduling.<br />
I know you will forgive me for pointing out the sharp<br />
contrast between the Government's policy on ethnic<br />
broadcasting and the Federal Opposition's stated<br />
intention to cut $ 6 million from the SBS.<br />
Such a reduction must put in jeopardy plans for<br />
expansion, as well as existing programming, services and<br />
staffing. Six million dollars is more than the SBS spends on<br />
program acquisition. It is more then their Australian<br />
production budget. It is more than the total operational<br />
costs of 2EA.<br />
SBS is a remarkable and in my view remarkably effective<br />
and valuable institution of Australian democracy.<br />
You may be absolutely sure that the Government will<br />
continue to support it, and where possible expand its<br />
services. Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
Australian citizenship with its attendant rights and<br />
obligations is part of the glue which binds this nation<br />
and its citizens.<br />
The Government is keen to encourage all Australian<br />
residents to become Australian citizens and does not<br />
consider it should be restricted to a privileged few.<br />
The recent decision of the High Court on the eligibility<br />
of several candidates in the Wills bi-election has<br />
implications which are a matter of concern for all<br />
Australians. In particular, the decision which found that two<br />
individuals were ineligible to stand because they had<br />
failed to take " reasonable steps" to renounce their<br />
foreign citizenship may raise doubts about the value of<br />
Australian citizenship.<br />
I recognise that immigrants from certain countries face<br />
almost insurmountable barriers to renounce their former<br />
citizenship, even when assuming Australian citizenship.<br />
Technically, therefore, thiy can be constitutionally<br />
precluded from entering the Commonwealth Parliament for<br />
reasons quite beyond their own control. </p>
<p>TL: 3. Dec. 92 9: 43 No. 017 P. 08/ 0'-<br />
6<br />
The High Court decision effectively debars naturalised<br />
inunigrants Austrfalian citizens from certain countries<br />
from standing for Parliament, unless they have taken<br />
" reasonable steps" to divest themselves of their original<br />
citizenship. Only a constitutional -_ referendum-can ensure that this<br />
does not happen agai-n.<br />
I recognise that the High Court decisions on this and<br />
other eligibility requirements for members of Parliament<br />
raise a number of complex issues, including the -role of.<br />
dual citizenship in our society.<br />
I would welcome your views on these matters and will take<br />
these into account in the Government's consideration of<br />
the subject.<br />
Practical considerations preclude a referendum at the<br />
next election. However I intend to pursue the issues<br />
with the opposition in the next Parliament, with a view<br />
to changing the current constitutional requirements for<br />
eligibility for Parliament.<br />
And in my view Australian citizenship should be<br />
sufficient qualification.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Let me conclude as I began by saying that<br />
multicultural ism is an extension of Australian social<br />
democracy. A dramatic extension.<br />
it has radically changed the way Australians live and the<br />
way we think about ourselves and the rest of the world.<br />
But it is built on a traditional democratic foundation.<br />
we need to expand economic and social opportunity, of<br />
course that is the basis of social democracy. It is<br />
one of the principles underlying multicultural policy.<br />
But we also need to develop a greater awareness and<br />
appreciation of our democratic institutions and values<br />
among the immigrant population and among Australians of<br />
long standing.<br />
It is my passionate belief that in this decade we need to<br />
build a multicultural Australia which is richly<br />
pluralist, richly democratic -and richly and<br />
unmistakeably Australian.<br />
Finally I must say a word or two about your retiring<br />
Chairperson, Carl Harbaum.<br />
I know of the hard work he has put into the Federation<br />
over many years, of the dignity and the deep love of<br />
Australia which he has brought to the job.<br />
