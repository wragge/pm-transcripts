CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
RAOUL WALLENBERG TREE NAMING CEREMONY<br />
CANBERRA 9 MARCH 1989<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
In a century that has seen too much proof of mankind's<br />
capacity for hatred, oppression, depravity and inhumanity,<br />
the heroism of Ralph Wallenberg is an inspiring beacon.<br />
Wallenberg single handedly protected the lives of tens of<br />
thousands of Hungarian Jews from the Nazis in World War II.<br />
Those efforts truly place him in the select company of men<br />
and women who have made an indelible mark on human history<br />
through a selfless devotion to the safety and well being of<br />
their fellow human beings.<br />
Raoul Wallenberg is one of the great heroes of the<br />
Holocaust. In the face of the almost unimaginable reality<br />
of the Final Solution, and the seemingly insuperable power<br />
and ambition of the Third Reich, Raoul Wallenberg proved<br />
that persecution can and must be opposed, whatever the<br />
appalling odds.<br />
But the achievement of Raoul Wallenberg can be viewed not<br />
only as the achievement of a man involved, directly and with<br />
great valour, in the rescue of a great many persecuted<br />
people. The significance of his achievement today lies also<br />
in his importance as a living symbol of the broad horizons<br />
of human-vision and compassion in defiance of danger and<br />
intolerance.<br />
Thus we owe him a debt not only for the lives he has saved,<br />
but also for the inspiration he has provided and the<br />
direction he has furnished to guide future human endeavours.<br />
In the words of one person who was saved by him, " Raoul<br />
Wallenberg symbolises the ideal that one person can make a<br />
difference." I am moved and encouraged every time I hear anew the story<br />
of Raoul Wallenberg. He came to Budapest on a mission of<br />
mercy, prepared to follow any means, however unorthodox, to<br />
rescue the Jews and other potential victims of the Nazis.<br />
He pursued this task with a tireless zeal and a courage that<br />
reflected total disregard for his own safety. </p>
<p>When Budapest was liberated early in January 1945 there were<br />
approximately 120,000 Jews still living in the city the<br />
largest surviving Jewish population in all of occupied<br />
Europe. It is estimated that about five-sixths of this<br />
population owed their lives directly to the intervention of<br />
Raoul Wallenberg.<br />
Among us here today I believe there are individuals and<br />
families whose personal histories link them directly to the<br />
actions taken by Raoul Wallenberg in war torn Hungary. To<br />
you I offer my very warmest regards.<br />
And to everyone here today I confirm the commitment of my<br />
Government to seeing a satisfactory resolution to the<br />
mystery which continues to shroud the facts of Raoul<br />
Wallenberg's fate.<br />
Not only was he denied the hero's return home to his native<br />
Sweden he so rightly deserved. He was arrested and plunged<br />
into oblivion, assigned to a fate that still has not been<br />
revealed.<br />
The Swedish Government continues to pursue the Wallenberg<br />
case with the Soviet authorities. Australia has offered its<br />
full support to the Swedish Government in its attempt to<br />
elicit a satisfactory account from the Soviet authorities.<br />
As I noted in the most recent newsletter of the Free<br />
Wallenberg Committee, international concern with the<br />
progress of the case continues to be strong from a wide<br />
cross-section of individuals and organisations.<br />
Our concerns about Wallenberg including the paucity of<br />
conclusive information on his fate were raised in the<br />
context of my visit to the Soviet Union in late 1987.<br />
Soviet officials responded without elaboration, as they have<br />
on many previous occasions, that Mr Wallenberg died many<br />
years ago. Last September, it was stated simply that<br />
Wallenberg was cremated on July 17, 1947.<br />
The struggle for truth and justice in the Raoul Wallenberg<br />
case is not new. For many years Wallenberg lobby groups in<br />
the West have been working in conjunction with Jewish<br />
organisations such as the Simon Wiesenthal Centre for<br />
Holocaust Studies in an attempt to establish the facts of<br />
Raoul Wallenberg's fate.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
There are grounds these days for viewing the current world<br />
outlook with some optimism. Within the Soviet Union itself<br />
we have seen, with President Gorbachev's programs of<br />
perestroika and glasnost, a long overdue and still<br />
incomplete, but nevertheless very encouraging, movement away<br />
from the repression and inflexibility that for too long has<br />
characterised the Soviet system. </p>
<p>3.<br />
It is encouraging to note that significant improvements in<br />
human rights, including the fundamental right to profess and<br />
practise religious faiths, are in train. We acknowledge<br />
what is being done to improve the lot of Soviet Jews and<br />
Christians. we look to further progress.<br />
Our objective is to help individuals suffering from abuse,<br />
be this on the basis of colour or creed. I believe that<br />
Australian involvement in human rights issues does have this<br />
effect. Indeed, it is not too much to say that a transformation is<br />
occurring in. the position of Soviet Jews. This is to the<br />
enormous credit of Governments and private citizens around<br />
the world who have raised their voices on this issue over<br />
many years, as well as to the spirit of change which has<br />
developed under Mr Gorbachev.<br />
Successive Australian Governments, Australian public<br />
opinion, and the Australian-Jewish community, have played a<br />
notable role in this. The recent opening of the Solomon<br />
Mykhoels Cultural Centre in Moscow, in which the Executive<br />
Council of Australian Jewry, and its President,<br />
Mr ISi Leibler, played a very prominent role, is a striking<br />
example of the new spirit.<br />
My friends,<br />
There are many great challenges that still lie before us.<br />
To some, these challenges may seem insuperably complex.<br />
But we must not be daunted.<br />
That most certainly was not the response of Raoul<br />
Wallenberg. By placing his faith in the belief that ideals<br />
could be realised and seemingly insurmountable obstacles<br />
overcome, Raoul Wallenberg went forward to perform one of<br />
the most significant rescue operations of our century.<br />
It is immensely encouraging to know that admiration for<br />
Wallenberg's endeavour is shared by young Australians who<br />
were not even born when he made his sacrifice.<br />
It is my hope that this tree that we name today, as it grows<br />
in perhaps the most significant plot of land that our nation<br />
can provide here in the vicinity of Parliament House<br />
will remind future visitors and legislators of the immensity<br />
of Wallenberg's achievement.<br />
Raoul Wallenberg will live on in memory as long as new<br />
generations continue to be moved and inspired by his life<br />
and his action.<br />
