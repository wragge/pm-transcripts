TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH IAN M'cMINN 3AK 11 DECEMBER 1986<br />
MCMINN: Prime Minister, welcome to the program and at the end of<br />
the parliamentary year with the Senate finishing last night I am<br />
wondering whether Christmas has arrived early for the Government.<br />
obviously I am referring today's extraordinary trade figures. How<br />
do you see them?<br />
PM: Well, we have said consistently Ian, that we don't get<br />
overly carried away by any one month's figures but having said<br />
that we, of course, welcome this remarkably low figure of<br />
$ 685 million which is significantly below I think what the market<br />
was expecting. I think it does confirm what the Treasurer Paul<br />
Keating and I have been saying that the basic strategy of the<br />
Government as contained in the Budget and our wages policy is<br />
having its impact. There is just simply no question now that the<br />
J-Curve that is the expectation that the depreciation would<br />
have its impact in lowering the volume of imports and gradually<br />
creating a better environment for exports is working and that is<br />
good for Australia. We will not simply as a result of one month's<br />
figures relax our firm policy position because what we are<br />
committed to is creating the environment within which we can be<br />
as certain as possible that the longer term requirements for<br />
Australia's best interests are satisfied.<br />
MCMINN: It seems an extraordinary drop though Prime Minister,<br />
from $ 1.5 billion to $ 685 million. I am wondering if that could<br />
have anything to do with the new computer service that is<br />
this month's figures?<br />
PM: It can't in any sense explain all of the massive drop. The<br />
Opposition I understand is saying that you can't rely on one<br />
month's figures. I must say I have a very healthy belly laugh<br />
when I hear them say that because when the one month's figures<br />
were very high they latched onto them and said that that is proof<br />
that the Government's policies are not right. They wanted to say<br />
we do attach weight to one month's figures. They seem to want now<br />
to say, oh well, this is an aberration, you can't take any notice<br />
at all.<br />
MCMINN: I was just iondering is there any particular area that<br />
you can pin point why there should be such a drop in our current<br />
accounts? PM: ' Well, you have got to say, I think what the Treasurer and I<br />
have been saying that it is inevitable that with the depreciation </p>
<p>that has taken place that there would be an impact upon import<br />
volumes. Now there clearly has been and that is working its way<br />
through and whether there is some particular element this month<br />
which has played some part in this very dramatic reduction you<br />
can't be sure. But what you can be sure of is that taking this<br />
figure into account with the underlying trend of what has been<br />
* happening you can be certain that import volumes are falling and<br />
that export volumes are rising over the period. And that is<br />
precisely what Australia needs.<br />
MCMINN: Would you see the trend continuing in the next figures<br />
to come out?<br />
PM: Both Paul and I have been saying that we had to expect<br />
reasonably tough figures as we went into 1987. It may be that now<br />
the trend is accelerating a little bit faster than we thought. If<br />
that is so that is welcome but it is a reflection of the fact<br />
that the both the Treasurer and I are cautious about these<br />
things. We have said that there should be cautious optimism about<br />
the Australian economy for 1987. And all I can say is that these<br />
figures certainly justify the expression of cautious optimism by<br />
the Treasurer and myself.<br />
MCMINN: On another set of figures Mr Hawke, the unemployment<br />
figures, they fell slightly as well. Is that due to the same<br />
policy setting or is<br />
PM: What we have seen there is a drop in the unemployment rate<br />
down to 8.3% but that is a reflection obviously in part of the<br />
decline in the participation rate. But we have said that in<br />
regard to the general employment and unemployment figure that we<br />
couldn't expect significant continuing growth in employment and<br />
significant reductions in the unemployment rate given the fact<br />
that we have got to contain the level of economic activity in<br />
this country so that we don't suck in imports at a more than<br />
sustainable level. But again I think we have to take some<br />
cautious optimism from these employment figures.<br />
MCMINN: Well, both sets of figures obviously come at a very good<br />
time given that the parliamentary year is at an end. At the start<br />
of next year you are going to the middle East. I was wondering if<br />
I could ask you how you would see that trip?<br />
PM: Well, the trip has two components if I can put it that way.<br />
I have been invited to give the keynote address at this very<br />
prestigious meeting in Davos in Switzerland which is attended by<br />
leading political figures from many nations as well as<br />
outstanding business leaders from around the world. And I am<br />
going to take the opportunity there of making a major speech in<br />
regard to the international trading situation including the<br />
position affecting agriculture which is of fundamental importance<br />
to Australia. And I am taking the opportunity while going there<br />
to deliver that impotitant address to make a brief visit to the<br />
Middle East. I will be going to Israel and Jordan and Egypt and<br />
let me just make these points about that visit Ian. Firstly, I<br />
don't want any overstatement of Australia's capacity to play any<br />
sort of mediating role in the Middle East. I am not going there<br />
in that sense but we are in the fortunate position where we are </p>
<p>regarded favourably by Israel and by the moderate Arab states, by<br />
Egypt and Jordan and so I am sure that the leadership of these<br />
three states will talk fully and frankly with me about how they<br />
see the current and future situation in the Middle East. I hope<br />
that in that context I can become better informed about the<br />
possibilities in that region. And if in any way they believe<br />
there can be some in put in Australia, but only if they so<br />
believe, then of course Australia is prepared to make whatever<br />
input to such processes that they would seek of us.<br />
MCMINN: Of course Israel, Prime Minister, has been something<br />
very close to your heart over a number of years and I am just<br />
wondering whether or not there is some danger in the trip so far<br />
as that you are closely aligned to the motivations of the<br />
Israelis and there might be an expectation that you might if you<br />
like not maintain a balance, that you might go their way rather<br />
than the way of moderate Arabs?<br />
PM: Oh well, in part the answer to that is that I have a long<br />
standing invitation from both Jordan and Egypt to visit their<br />
countries and I am accepting their invitation as well as the<br />
invitation of the Israelis. While it is true that I have had some<br />
fairly long standing association with Israel I have also for a<br />
very long period had good relations with Egypt and Jordan. I have<br />
been to Jordan twice. I visited Egypt when I visited there the<br />
late President Sadat was in power but I did have the<br />
opportunity then of meeting as he was Vice-President Mubarak. I<br />
established good personal relations with him and he is now the<br />
leader of Egypt. And I recognise the very real problems that the<br />
people of Egypt and of Jordan and the policy of my Government<br />
recognises also the interests and the rights of the Palestinian<br />
people as well as our total commitment to the right of Israel to<br />
exist behind secure and recognised boundaries. So we go there<br />
with a position of integrity which is accepted and recognised by<br />
all the countries that I will be visiting.<br />
MCMINN: You don't see a danger of an expectation that Bob Hawke<br />
might solve the problem?<br />
PM: Well, that is why I made the first comment that I did. I<br />
want to emphasise as strongly as I possibly can. I don't go there<br />
with some assumption about playing the role of the great<br />
international mediator. I am simply saying that we are a country<br />
and I think I am a person who is respected by Israel and by Egypt<br />
and by Jordan. It is for that reason that-I think as I say they<br />
will talk fully and frankly with me and I simply say that if it<br />
is the view of the countries themselves that Australia even in<br />
some small way can play a part in what will be a very complicated<br />
process of achieving a peaceable resolution of the Middle East<br />
conflict then of course Australia stands ready to help. But I<br />
don't in any sense overstate either the capacity or the role of<br />
Australia. MCMINN: OK, moving along to domestic politics. Prime Minister,<br />
the Senate last night knocked back the Australia Card as everyone<br />
expected them to. A double barrel question first of all this<br />
obviously would give you a trigger for a double dissolution if<br />
you wished. The second point, Senator George Georges saying that I </p>
<p>he is prepared to quit the ALP. I was wondering if I could get<br />
comments on that?<br />
PM: Well, in regard to the first. It is of course a tragedy that<br />
the opposing political parties that is the Liberal Party, the<br />
National Party and the Democrats have rejected a piece of<br />
legislation which the overwhelming majority of Australians<br />
recognise as being necessary if as a community we are going most<br />
comprehensively to fight the war on the one hand against tax<br />
avoidance and on the other against social security fraud. And<br />
so those opposing parties have clearly put themselves in the camp<br />
of those who don't want to fight the fight as hard we can against<br />
tax avoidance or to fight the fight as hard as we can against<br />
social security fraud. They have made a gross error of political<br />
judgement. They have acted manifestly against the interests of<br />
the ordinary people of this country and we will continue to<br />
fight. Let me say, however, I make it clear that I am going to<br />
ensure that this Parliament runs it full term. They will pay, in<br />
my judgement, a heavy political price for their refusal to<br />
identify themselves with the great wish of the Australian people<br />
to fight tax avoidance, to fight social security fraud. Now, your<br />
other question was about Senator George Georges. I think that the<br />
Australian Labor Party will reasonably, comfortably survive<br />
whatever George Georges may perceive as the trauma of his<br />
defection. MCMINN: So you don't see Senator Georges, an ALP Senator, his<br />
quitting of the ALP over this issue as an embarrassment to the<br />
Labor Party?<br />
PM: No.<br />
MCMINN: No way?<br />
PM: I think my answer was pretty unequivocal.<br />
MCMINN: Another thing a personal message if you like. As I<br />
understand it there is a lady listening to the program right now.<br />
She is 112 years of age. Her name is Carolyn Mockridge or people<br />
call her Carrie the oldest living Australian. And I understand<br />
you have a message for her.<br />
PM: I have indeed. Carrie, first of all, my very, very sincere<br />
and great congratulations to you on achieving your 112th<br />
birthday. This is just truly remarkable and as I understand it<br />
that makes you the oldest Australian according to our Federal<br />
Government records. I congratulate you not just on your longevity<br />
but I would like to say how thrilled I am to be told that you<br />
retain a very vivid interest in current affairs, that you listen<br />
to parliamentary broadcasts. I think it is absolutely fantastic<br />
that you are able to do this and that you like to do it. I am<br />
told that your father Carrie, came to Australia with the British<br />
Army, that he was at the Eureka Stockade as a soldier at the age<br />
of 19. When I think Carrie, of the fact that you are a 112, that<br />
means you were in fact 55 years of age when I was born back in<br />
1929. You span a truly remarkable period of Australian history<br />
and I suppose one of the things that you -must just wonder about<br />
as you look around you today is the absolutely immeasurable </p>
<p>IL nature of the change that has taken place in the world and in<br />
Australia since your early days. It is an unrecognisably<br />
different country and different world. But I guess the basic<br />
considerations, the basic values remain unchanged and I just hope<br />
that you will see in the sort of things that are happening today<br />
moves that are going to make for a better Australia. You<br />
obviously Carrie, would also have a great pride in your family<br />
and particularly some names that come to mind. I understand that<br />
your great nephew was Russell Mockridge the famous cyclist and<br />
also John Mockridge, an architect who amongst other things has<br />
designed several buildings here in Canberra. So I hope Carrie<br />
that as you look back over those 112 years you will have very,<br />
very many fond and happy memories and I certainly hope that you<br />
continue to enjoy the capacity to involve yourself in what is<br />
happening in Australia today and I wish you all the best for the<br />
future. MCMINN: Thank you Prime Minister.<br />
ENDS I </p>
