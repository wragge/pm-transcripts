PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, JOHN CURTIN HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
7 SEPTEMBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: What sort of resolution are you hoping today<br />
will go to conference?<br />
PM: One that will enable the discussions I think to go<br />
on before the time of the conference.<br />
JOURNALIST: You're not worried last night's decision<br />
will be seen as a non-decision, open you up to attacks<br />
from the Opposition?<br />
PM: I'm quite prepared to deal with the Opposition on<br />
this issue. As I said last night at the end of my press<br />
conference when we've finished our consideration of this<br />
matter we'll have a clear position that will involve very<br />
effective competition in the telecommunications industry<br />
but with a fully publicly-owned telecommunications<br />
facility operating internationally and nationally. That<br />
will be in the starkest of contrasts with the position of<br />
the Tories who will throw, if they had their way, the<br />
whole of the telecommunications industry into the private<br />
sector and sacrifice the public good. That's the debate<br />
that I'm looking forward to having and it's a debate<br />
we'll win.<br />
