PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, RICHMOND RAAF BASE, SYDNEY<br />
DECEMBER 1989<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke airlines are pressing ahead with<br />
their damages claim?<br />
PM: Well whether they're going to the point of collection I<br />
don't know. I hope they're not. Obviously the formal<br />
proceedings have to go to a conclusion. But I've expressed<br />
my view very clearly that I hope they don't move to a<br />
collection of damages.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Peacock says a coalition government would<br />
see a massive downturn in interest rates. How do you feel<br />
about that?<br />
PM: Well, you know, to coin a phrase of Mr Peacock in<br />
regard to the Opposition you just have to say ' who's to<br />
know'. I mean just last week we had Senator Stone, Dr<br />
Hewson and Mr Howard saying that interest rates would remain<br />
high, and through the next three years. But now the Leader<br />
of the Opposition, who is not regarded by Mr Stone, Dr<br />
Hewson or Mr Howard as having any economic competence as<br />
compared with themselves, contradicts them and says they<br />
will come down massively. Now of course, as I've had reason<br />
to say, when you're talking about economics Mr Peacock knows<br />
nothing. The important thing to say about interest rates is<br />
what I've said and what my Treasurer has said. And that is<br />
that we will keep the settings of policy firm for as long as<br />
is required. We do have the situation now where there are<br />
signs, as both the Treasurer and I have been saying, that<br />
that policy is working. The conditions are being created<br />
for a reduction in interest rates. But we have no more to<br />
say about that. And for Mr Peacock to be coming out and<br />
speaking in direct and blatant contradiction of those people<br />
within the Opposition who really do know more about these<br />
things than he does, is a sign of the increasing desperation<br />
of Mr Peacock.<br />
JOURNALIST: wind down their operations. Does that mean<br />
the pilots' dispute is over in your </p>
<p>PM: well we have made the position quite clear and indeed<br />
the people are reflecting their understanding of it. The<br />
domestic airline industry is being restored towards its<br />
normal operating capacity. They'll be able to handle the<br />
Christmas traffic and we will see Australia's domestic<br />
airlines operating normally in the early part of 1990.<br />
JOURNALIST: What about the cost to the taxpayer<br />
PM: The cost to the taxpayer is something that will be<br />
finally determined when the accounts are put in and when<br />
they are dealt with by government officials. All I can say<br />
is this, that it will be a significantly lesser amount than<br />
those figures that were recklessly thrown around by the Mr<br />
Jull to whom I referred. And of course the other point to<br />
make is that the cost to Australia would've been infinitely<br />
higher, immeasurably higher if I had been prepared to do<br />
what the Opposition had wanted me to do and that is to lay<br />
down and let the pilots have their way. That would've been<br />
economically disastrous. It was totally unacceptable to me.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Keating doesn't seem to be as definite as<br />
you are about the signs of interest rates coming down. He<br />
doesn't seem to be as definite as you about interest rates<br />
coming down next year. He seems<br />
PM: You look at the comments of Mr Keating yesterday and<br />
mine. They were totally<br />
JOURNALIST: So you see that as a strong endorsement of your<br />
comments? PM: well if you actually look at what he said he had no<br />
reason to disagree with the remarks I'd made.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will there be a cost in the Defence Force<br />
budget itself in terms of wear and tear and greaterusage of<br />
the aircraft over this dispute?<br />
PM: Well if there's anything that has to be taken into<br />
account in the Budget sense it will be. I mean we've made<br />
it quite clear that what was being done in this last four<br />
months was to provide a service from the Royal Australian<br />
Air Force and to a lesser extent from the Royal Australian<br />
Navy to provide an essential service to Australia. And if<br />
there is supplementation required then of course that will<br />
be done.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: G'day, how are you. There's no need to kneel.<br />
JOURNALIST: There is, the cameras are there.<br />
PM: Arise. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: After yesterday's retail sales figures the<br />
Chamber of Commerce said that you should be looking at<br />
bringing interest rates down at the end of January,<br />
beginning of February and if you don't it might be too hard<br />
for too long. Is that something that you are looking at?<br />
PM: As I've said before, the fine art of economic<br />
management now is to make the decision in regard to monetary<br />
policy, that is interest rates, which means firstly that you<br />
haven't taken them off too early and therefore allow a<br />
resurgence of demand which would mean unacceptably high<br />
levels of imports. And on the other hand not leaving it too<br />
late so that you go into an unacceptably prolonged and deep<br />
downturn. JOURNALIST: Recession.<br />
PM: I believe that we will be able to make that fine art of<br />
judgement. We will.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you afraid the markets will jump the gun<br />
and lower interest rates too early?<br />
PM: I think that the markets will respond to their<br />
assessment of government policy.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the pilots say they still want their<br />
seniority. Isn't that going to still be a stumbling block<br />
to getting them back in the air?<br />
PM: Well of course the airlines need very few pilots now as<br />
the figures have been released. This matter will be before<br />
the Commission on Monday and the position there is quite<br />
clear. If the Federation wants to have any part now in the<br />
final resolution of the difficulties in the airline industry<br />
then they have to meet three conditions. And not special<br />
conditions upon them, the same conditions that apply to any<br />
other union. And that's a matter for decision for them. It<br />
will either you'll have a complete restoration of the<br />
airline industry without the involvement of the Federation<br />
or they may have some part in the tail end of it. It's up<br />
to them.<br />
ends </p>
