The community around Parramatta will soon have access to a healthier, more sustainable commute along the northern foreshore of the Parramatta River.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard today announced that a separate cycling and walking link will be built between the University of Western Sydney, housing developments in the area and key employment precincts of the Parramatta city centre.</p>
<p>This will link areas of the northern Parramatta River foreshore to each other, and will ensure residents have access to a safe, healthy and sustainable way to get to work or university.</p>
<p>This joint project - the Parramatta River City Renewal project  -  is the first successful project to be announced under the Government's Liveable Cities program.</p>
<p>Projects like the Parramatta River City Renewal Project are vital for the future sustainability of Australia's large cities.</p>
<p>Beyond just building better infrastructure to support communities, the Liveable Cities Program will provide lessons in achieving good outcomes that can be shared across capital and larger regional cities.</p>
<p>By improving the capacity of our cities to undertake strategic planning, we are working to improve the quality of life in our major cities, where the majority of our population lives.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government has committed up to $3.75 million, Parramatta City Council has committed $4.4 million and the NSW Government has committed $7.9 million to the Parramatta River City Renewal project.</p>
<p>The project is expected to be completed by mid 2015.</p>
<p>The other successful applicants under the Liveable Cities Program will be announced in the very near future. </p>
