BRITISH GIFT TO CANBERRA<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Halt<br />
The British Government's gift to Canberra to mark the<br />
capital's Golden jubilee will be a carilon on Aspen Island in Lake Burley<br />
Griffin. An announcement to this effect is also being made in the House of<br />
Commons by the Prime Minister of Britain.<br />
In 1963, the then Prime Minister of Britain advised the<br />
Australian Government that the British Government would make a gift to<br />
mark the Golden jubilee of Canberra, being celebrated that year. It was<br />
intended that the gift make a significant contribution to the development of<br />
Canberra and reflect Britain's and Australia's common parliamentary<br />
heritage. It was suggested at the time that the gift might take the form of a<br />
set or ornamental fountains or a bell tower.<br />
Subsequently the Australian Government proposed that<br />
the gift take the form of a structure housing a carillon to be erected on<br />
Aspen Island. In consultation with the Royal British Institute of<br />
Ardhitects and the Royal Australian institute of Architects, it has been agreed<br />
that there should be a limited competition for the design: three Australian<br />
architects and three British architects will be invited to take part. The<br />
assessors for the competition will be Lord Holford, Mr. Bedford ( the Chief<br />
Architect of the British Ministry of Public Building and Works), and Mr.<br />
Overall ( Chairman of the National Capital Planning Committee). The winning<br />
design will be put before the British and Australian Governments for<br />
consideration before being adopted.<br />
The British Government estimates the cost of the gift.<br />
including the competititon, as being about OEStg. 2CC, 000.<br />
The carillon will be a notable addition and asset to the<br />
National Capital. The Australian Government warmly welcomes the British<br />
Govenmen's generous and symbolic gift.<br />
