TRANSCRIPT OF INTI" ERVIEW WITHiDAN WEBB, DAY BY kY, CHANNEL 7,<br />
7 APRIL 1987<br />
E &amp; O0E -PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: today in McEwan, tomorrow in Isaacs. These<br />
are two of Labor's most marginal seats. Now in these areas,<br />
as in many other areas across the state, people are still<br />
trying to come to terms with Australia's economic crisis.<br />
They don't understand it. They know it's getting harder to<br />
live. Housing interest rates are still high, things cost<br />
more, living standards are falling. There's talk of selling<br />
off airport terminals and embassies to reduce the national<br />
debt. And yet iliuust evory day we rpad of some new<br />
multi-million dollar take-over. The share market is booming.<br />
The rich seem to be getting richer, but there's little cheer<br />
for the averago Lamily. I'm dolightRd the Prime Minister has<br />
agreed to talk to us about whdt's happoning to Ax-tralia and<br />
the likely prospects for the future. Prime Minister, thanks<br />
for coming in.<br />
PM: Pleasure to be here Dan.<br />
JOURNALIST: What has caused this latest economic downturn?<br />
PM: It is very simple. Basically, Dan, Australia, as you'd<br />
appreciate, historically has sold very much of what it grows,<br />
diga oit nf the ground, overseas. Our wheat, our wool, our<br />
dairy products, our iron ore, our coal, LILhos sorto of<br />
products. The standaid of living Australia has been able to<br />
enjoy In tMV p5bL depanda upon * he prices that the people<br />
overseas will pay us for those things that we grow and dig up<br />
out of the ground and send over there. In the last couple of<br />
years there has been a very drastic decline in the prices<br />
that they have been prepared to pay us for those things. It<br />
llasi'L Inrolod y A-rision on the part of Australian<br />
workers or Australian fa~ zers or Aust raiian Ml1IWs Lu iorhl<br />
less hard. It's simply that the world is paying us less.<br />
Lot me Uiva you an idea of what that's meant. It's meant the<br />
best part of 9 billion has been Wiped our national<br />
income. That s nine thousand million dollars los that<br />
Australia had. IL I can put that in terms of Australian<br />
families, it means per family on average of the whole of<br />
Australia, we've lost something like $ 2,000 per family. And<br />
so the Government, responsibly, has had to take account of </p>
<p>2.<br />
that. We've had to have policies which reduce the am~ ount of<br />
activity in Australia, which reduce the demand in Australia<br />
for imports because we can no longer afford to pay for those<br />
imporLs by our export earnings. There ' s a gap, a very, very<br />
big gap and we just simply cannot go on borrowing from<br />
overseas. The world in not going to say to Australia will<br />
you keep on having the same standards by just not earning the<br />
money but borrowing it from us. So we've had to go about ~ he<br />
task of reducing demand and you mentioned interest rates,<br />
we've had to have a tight mnentary policy with hiqher<br />
interest rates as pacL ulf the policy for roduoing the lovL<br />
of demand. No Prime Minister in his right mind wants to d'~<br />
that. You wouldn't live with a higher interest rate for a<br />
day longer than you had to. But that's what's been necessa~ y<br />
to adjust ourselves to the fact that the world is not paying'<br />
us as much as they used to.<br />
JOURNALIST: You mentioned that we've had to reduce activity<br />
in Australia. is that development activity?<br />
PM: It's just the level of actual activity which is reflected<br />
in the demand for goods from overseas. We've had to bring<br />
about a situation where we buy less from overseas because<br />
we're not earning as much to buy from overseas. And the only<br />
way, if you've got that gap between that -amount -that you earn<br />
and that level that your buying from overseas, that gap, you<br />
have to borrow. And you just can't keep on borrowing. So<br />
we'v e had to roduoo the level rif Petivity so that we're not<br />
demanding from overseas as many goods and services.<br />
JOURNALIST: Now this economic statement that we can expect<br />
next month. Is-that going to hit people's hip pockets? Or<br />
is it just curtailing of government spending in Australia?<br />
PM: A curtailing of Government expenditure means an impact<br />
upon people. For instance, last year when we were being hit<br />
by this phenomenum that I refer to, for instance, we had to<br />
ask the pensioners of Australia to forego for six weeks the<br />
increase in pensions that they were expecting to get. So<br />
that's a government decipion about what you do in regard to<br />
paying pensions. And that of course hit them in the hip<br />
pocket. An'A T jimst want to take this opportunity, as I have<br />
around Australia, of just saying how magnificent the<br />
pensioners in Australia were. I've now talked to tens of<br />
thousands of them, I've had letters from them and they say Mr<br />
Hawke, we understand that if Lhe. country is poorer, we have<br />
to play a part in that and I must say that the magnif icent<br />
response of our elderly citizenn has been a marked contrast </p>
<p>to some of the greediness of some other sections of the<br />
community. JOURNALIST: You're referring to the unions?<br />
PM: No, I'm not referring to the unions. Let's make it<br />
quite clear that the unions generally have been magnificent.<br />
It's the first time in Auttralian history, Dan, where we've<br />
had economic growth as we've had in the period 83-84-85, very<br />
substantial growth and a reduction in-real wages. It's the<br />
first tim 4it'q ever happened because the unions have played<br />
their part. There have been one or two dishonourable<br />
exceptions, but overwhelmingly because of the co-operation of<br />
the trAde UniOns Hluy've lu~ tiod thoir deman'* fnor the<br />
first time in history a reduction in real wages when there's<br />
been economic growth and that has been very much responsible<br />
fuL the fact that wo've had rt-' nrd Amployment growth. If we<br />
hadn't had that restraint by the unions, we wouldn't have<br />
been able to create the 3/ 4 million new jobs that we have in<br />
Australia. That ic a record amplnyment growth in the whole<br />
of the post-war period.<br />
JOURNALIST: on to reducing the deficit. Now if<br />
governments, and that is.. your Government, and-all State<br />
Governments, as I understand will have to reduce their<br />
borrowings. If they all have to reduce their borrowings, how<br />
can privaLa people-borrow thoe -onormnt" I sums of money<br />
overseas to perpetrate the take-overs that are going on.<br />
PM: What you've got. to. understand is that where you do have_.<br />
a -deficit on your current-account-that-I -was talk-ing-ebout<br />
before, then there has to be borrowing overseas to finance<br />
that. And some of the borrowing that goes on in the private<br />
sector brings money in to balance that deficit in the current<br />
account Rnt you go now to another area of change in the<br />
structure of Australian industry. There should be no<br />
assumption, whether it's in the television indusLLy, I might<br />
say, or in the manufacturing industry or in the service<br />
industry there should be no assumption that the present<br />
uwnership is naoroeanct. Nnna at all. The community has got<br />
no vested interest in saying that there is a perfect<br />
concrete-set, sort of ownership of the resources in<br />
Australia. The very essence of change and responding to<br />
challenge is that existing ownership can change. That you<br />
can got nvw munaoment, new ownership and that's what happens<br />
all the time in television. In the media industry ot which<br />
you've been part.<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes, I want to come backtto that in a moment.<br />
PM: Just let me not go away from that because the Herald and<br />
Weekly TAmoa rnvrip. thpv were the masters of take-overs.<br />
They bought up little papers here, liLL1 paperA tneru. Mwy,<br />
they said it was much better that you have the dynamism of<br />
change, that a little show that is operating there can't<br />
opwLdLe as well an It Llia gyer-p Inrnld and Wookky Times<br />
conglomerate were to take it over. That was the very essence<br />
of the Ierald and Weekly Times. It was good for the Herald<br />
and Weekly Times when they were Lliw ones who wore taking nvar<br />
.1 </p>
<p>something here, there, everywhere. It was marvellous. It<br />
was the very essence of the free enterprise, capitalist<br />
system. But when it happened to them suddenly this dynamic<br />
frnA enterprise system, which means that everyone is opened<br />
tn purchased, to be grabbed for change of ownerghip.<br />
Suddenly, it was different. Why! Had the principle changed?<br />
No, instead of being the taker-over, they were taken over.<br />
JOURNALIST: Had you envisaged for a moment what has happened<br />
to the modia Inductry?<br />
PM: I said when we started these dibuubslons a couplo ot<br />
years ago in the Cabinet and it started really on the basis<br />
of regional television because when I came to government I<br />
was convinced that we had to end the situation where<br />
non-metroplitan viewers in this country didn't have the same<br />
choice as their city cousins. In the city we had the choice<br />
of a whole range of stations, but out there in<br />
non-metropolitan Australia they had this monopoly situation<br />
where owe monopoly owner just provided tho one and I said<br />
we have got to change that. We have got to change the system<br />
so that, in fact, we can get the position for the whole of<br />
Australia that everyone, wherever they are, will have that<br />
same element of choice. And I said that what we have got to<br />
do to do that is to get a change, we have got to get rid of<br />
the two station limitation rule which stopped, which was a<br />
And I said-then, in those discussions, and my<br />
colleagues, particularly the ones most immediately concerned,<br />
will remember it, I said once you unleash the forces of<br />
competition. you will just be amazed how quickly it will move.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you just explain, before we have to end<br />
this<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Fairfax are in breach of the law by buying<br />
Channel 7 the existing law. They appear to be in breach of<br />
the foreshadowed law with their ownership of<br />
PM: But you see the way that the law is operated and the<br />
Broadcasting ' rrihinAl is operated, there has always been this<br />
period of qrzuu where there hao boon a traren'tinn, that the<br />
effect of that transaction would, for the time, put them in<br />
breach of the law. That has been understood. But what has<br />
got to happen, clearly, in that the legislation which we<br />
bring in has got to be passed by the Parliament. I have<br />
heaid œ iuises from 3omo of the Liberm1a, some of the National<br />
Party and of course always from some of the Democrats that<br />
thoy will frustrnta That they won't allow the law to be<br />
passed. I think that is very unwise to assume that that Will<br />
happen. It would certainly be extremely unwise for those<br />
poliieh^ 1 pnrtiou to stop thi' law because it is that law<br />
which is going to mean the extension of competition<br />
throughout the whole of Australia. And I believe that all<br />
your viewers, particularly those in non-metropolitan<br />
Australid, are going to oay ' we want onmpAtttion'. And they<br />
are certainly going to say, I think, that they want that part<br />
of the law which is going to stop cross-media monopolisation </p>
<p>because it was a part of the law that we are going to be<br />
bringing in in the various regions. You are not going to be<br />
able to have the situation where one person can dominate the<br />
television, the radio and the print media. And that is<br />
something that ought to have been brought into this country a<br />
long time ago.<br />
JOURNALIST: But as you zead Lthu piupuad lw, FdiLZdA will<br />
have to' 1l off some of its ownership of Channel 7?<br />
PM: You' eemn to be saying that with great hope. Do you want<br />
to get ri of this mob? Not very good employers?<br />
JOURNALIST\ No, but I want to know what moral right they<br />
have to be moving people around and threatening their jobs<br />
when they are in breach of the law?<br />
PM: As I say, the way that the Broadcasting Tribunal has<br />
operated, Dan, is that there has been this period of grace<br />
where an actual transaction takes place in regard to the<br />
previous law. There has been a period of time within which<br />
the purchasers and vendors have had the opportunity of<br />
bringing themselves within the law. That same period of<br />
grace has beenopaxating-and.. nnw, . of., course, the-whole-of . the<br />
industry is waiting to see what the Parliament will do in<br />
respect of our legislation. When that is passed then<br />
everyone will have to be-within that legal. situation. And<br />
within that position which would give a 75% spread, as you<br />
know, of reach then, obviously, John Fairfax would be within<br />
he-law.. -I . can. understand.-your-views about John Poirfax,<br />
Dan. I don't think that you unwise to be sceptical about<br />
JOURNALIST: I have no particular-brief for-him . or . ior the<br />
Herald for that matter but there are a lot of people in the<br />
television industry and in the radio industry, as you know,<br />
as a result of the change of media ownership who are worried<br />
about their jobs and the future?<br />
PM: But you know Dan, ithe Luleviiu1n iidubLiy, thu media<br />
industry is no different. Do you know there are a hell of a<br />
lot of people out there, your viewers who work in the motor<br />
vehicle industry, they work in the textile, clothing and<br />
footwear industry they work in a whole range of industry<br />
and every day of their life, Dan, they have been subject to<br />
the dynamism of the change, of people taking over other<br />
enterprises. That has been happening to them for yoaro and<br />
years and years. What is happening to you people in the<br />
ina. lustr. y iv h-hhh} n ip g t^ yniiT-vicwnrn for a<br />
very, very long time. There is no reason why you should be<br />
in a different position.<br />
JOURNALIST! NO, but one of the diUZIaui we dahked you in here<br />
was to see if you could give an assurance to all those people<br />
out there that Australia will be a better place to live Inl<br />
1990.<br />
PM: Obviously it will be because this restructuring of<br />
industry is absolutely fundamental. Let me remind you. In<br />
the election campaign ' 82-' 83, at that stage BHP was </p>
<p>k6.<br />
considering Clos1ng down the SLeel iztlusLy. I said ' no, we<br />
won't have an Australia without a steel industry'. And I<br />
said we will bLiUy ini a plan for the rotructuring of the<br />
industry which will involve the co-operation of the unions<br />
and BHP and the State Governments. And now, instead of<br />
having a steal industry which is going to disappear we have<br />
got one of the most competitive steel industries in the<br />
world. We are restru turing the motor vehicle production<br />
industry. We are restructuring the textile, clothing and<br />
footwear industry; the'! heavy engineering industry; the<br />
shipbuilding industry;/ the chemical industry. And we have<br />
got to do all of that for the reacons that I gAid t-tho<br />
beginning of thio program Australia can no longer ho a<br />
country which depends, \ for its standard of living, on our<br />
wheat, our wool and our dairy products, our iron ore and our<br />
coal. The farms will remain important. The mines will<br />
remain important but we have got to restructure our industry<br />
so that we are more competitive in manufacturing industry,<br />
more competitive in service industry. So that Australian<br />
lidusLLips vdi provide more of the thingo that previously we<br />
are buying from overseas. And so that we can compete in<br />
manufacturing industries and service industries overseas<br />
new markets. That is what has got to happen. And none of us<br />
yuvuILiinWLb, oppositions, trade uniono, omployors oan gay<br />
we are going to shelter in the past and say we had that<br />
Lhiue LbwfuLu dand that is sacred. If wo havo got any<br />
commitment at all to our children then we have got to say<br />
that nothing is sacrosanct in terms of previous structures in<br />
industry. We have got to make the industry more competitive<br />
so that we can sell things that we haven't sold before. So<br />
that we can provide goods in Australia that we haven't<br />
provided before. Until we do that we will not have a secure,<br />
auetainable baciv for imprnving living standards.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, thank you very much indeed.<br />
PM: My pleasure, Dan, to be with you.<br />
