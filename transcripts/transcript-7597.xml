TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, ROYAL CANBERRA GOLF COURSE<br />
14 MAY 1989<br />
E OE-PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what does the Tasmanian result<br />
mean for your policies in terms of the environment?<br />
PM: Well it means that clearly the judgement has been made<br />
that as far as the two major parties are concerned the Labor<br />
Party has the best policy on the environment. You see we<br />
held our vote. The great swing to the Independents in<br />
Tasmania has come from the Liberals. This is not surprising<br />
because their record on the environment is disastrous. They<br />
have just talked states's rights, states' rights and let any<br />
development go ahead whereas we have an unsurpassed record<br />
on the environment. So that's the clear message down there.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does it mean to some extent the next election<br />
will be won and lost on that kind of vote?<br />
PM: No the Australian electorate is not a single issue<br />
electorate. It is quite clear however that in the way the<br />
political scene is developing in Australia, Independents are<br />
being listened to somewhat more than they were before.<br />
No-one can dispute that and thankfully it is the case, and I<br />
say thankfully from my point of view, that environmental<br />
issues are becoming more significant in the minds of the<br />
electorate. I say thankfully because it is important that<br />
the sorts of things that we've been talking about should be<br />
becoming more widely accepted. The questions not only of<br />
specific geographical environmental issues like the pulp<br />
mill for instance in which we acted so decisively but<br />
increasingly importantly the global issues of the Greenhouse<br />
Effect and the depletion of the ozone layer are issues for<br />
which we have a great responsibility and in which we've<br />
already begun to act very decisively and in which we'll be<br />
doing more.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are people getting disillusioned with the major<br />
parties though?<br />
PM: I suppose there's some element, not so much of<br />
disillusionment but that they are thinking in some respects<br />
more about particular issues and where people stand up and<br />
say this is an issue which we regard as important they are<br />
able to attract some votes. But I'm not worried about this<br />
because it is my Party which on these major issues has taken<br />
the lead. If you look at this Government since 1983 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM ( cont): starting with the saving of the Franklin Dam,<br />
it's only the major parties that can make the decisions<br />
which affect the environment and if you look at us from the<br />
Franklin Dam onwards, Kakadu, Barrier Reef, the rainforest<br />
in Daintree, the rainforest in Tasmania the protection of<br />
the forest there, on all these issues of the environment it<br />
is the Hawke Labor Government which has acted and acted more<br />
decisively than any other government in the history of this<br />
country. JOURNALIST: You're very relaxed about the result then, it<br />
doesn't really provide any particular concern for you?<br />
PM: Any politician who is ever relaxed in any political<br />
situation is silly. You should never be relaxed. I<br />
think the hallmark of this Government is that we have to a<br />
very large extent set the agenda. I repeat, the 1983<br />
election to some considerable extent was fought on the issue<br />
of saving the Franklin. Now who was it that said we'll save<br />
it? It was me, my Party and then my Government which did<br />
it. On every important issue we have been there. I<br />
acknowledge without reservation the significance of the<br />
people like Bob Brown and so on who have had this single<br />
issue as their overriding concern but the important thing is<br />
that action, action to do things which are important in the<br />
environment is only possible by a government formed by the<br />
major party. And overwhelmingly it has been my Labor<br />
Government which has set the pace in that respect.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is a Labor/ Independent Government viable and<br />
should Gray concede to make way for that sort of government?<br />
PM: I'm not telling Mr Gray, and more particularly I'm not<br />
purporting to tell the Governor of Tasmania how they should<br />
act there, that's a matter for them. Because the most<br />
interesting thing on the political agenda which has emerged<br />
today is in a sense not so much Tasmania but we now have the<br />
clear position where the federal president of the Liberal<br />
Party is setting the agenda for the new parliamentary<br />
leader, Mr Peacock. He's put the consumption tax right back<br />
on the table but in a quite deceptive way. He's saying well<br />
we wouldn't do it in our first term because that might be a<br />
bit electorally lead in the saddlebag. But he's saying<br />
that's what our agenda is. Now to have the consumption tax<br />
put back on the agenda is interesting, interesting in two<br />
ways. One that it means that the powers behind the throne,<br />
and of course Mr Elliott is that, without Mr Elliott Mr<br />
Peacock wouldn't be the leader of the Liberal Party now.<br />
But he's making it quite clear from day one virtually that<br />
he's going to set the agenda. Now, it would be a disastrous<br />
agenda, it would mean a massive increase in the consumer<br />
price index at a time now when we're starting to get </p>
<p>PM ( cont): inflation under control. It would impose a very<br />
very significant burden on ordinary working people and<br />
pensioners, those on benefits, because when we were talking<br />
about it before it was in a circumstance where we were able<br />
to work out a total compensation arrangement for workers and<br />
pensioner beneficiaries.<br />
JOURNALIST: So Prime Minister, you're ruling out the<br />
possibility of a consumption tax for the forseeable<br />
future?<br />
PM: I am ruling out a consumption tax. The clear political<br />
agenda, the clear political division has been settled by Mr<br />
Elliott, the man who enabled Mr Peacock to become leader of<br />
the Liberal Party has said now right at the beginning of it,<br />
' Mr Peacock, you got there because I let you get there, and<br />
I'm telling you now that the consumption tax is on the<br />
agenda, but I'll be a little bit deceptive about it Mr<br />
Peacock, I'll allow you the chance of deceiving the<br />
electorate. We won't put in the first term but I'm telling<br />
you Andrew I, Mr Elliott, who let you get there, I'm telling<br />
you it's squarely on the agenda'. I'm happy about that<br />
because as far as the Hawke Labor Government is concerned a<br />
consumption tax is not on the agenda and will not be on the<br />
agenda. JOURNALIST: Are you pleased with Labor's performance in<br />
the Merthyr by-election?<br />
PM: A very interesting outcome there. The conservative<br />
parties have had a massive loss in their combined vote from<br />
about while we have had an increase in our vote, a very<br />
significant increase in our vote. It means, as I've said<br />
for some time now the end of the Ahern National Party<br />
government and it indicates a very good chance I think in a<br />
general election in the state up there of Wayne Goss forming<br />
0 a Goss Labor Government.<br />
ends </p>
