This is i-eally a very remarklrable day bac. Duse it<br />
represents the culmination of a v. ary remiarkable piece of emok<br />
And I am very glad to know, f~ ton my c&amp; Llaettthrar<br />

the various groups wh-o were responsiblo for thnis ach: levoment,<br />
, le live i~ n such tuirbulent and hurried imes that we<br />
occasionally forget tftat history is still being made even thoug~ h<br />
It is made q 31Jittle more hastil; y thian it used to be mpade0 I<br />
daresay that -if somebodyv were l~ iving today who could say, '" 4e11<br />
my grandfathier had a hand in thie -laying of thie first trans-<br />
At*-laPntac cable" tbis w,. ould be a mnatter of great family pride,<br />
great family satk; isfaction. I hope thcat vo will have enough<br />
imagination in future for those who have contributed to this<br />
enterprise to be able to haand down to tiaeir grandchildren this<br />
wcndcrf'ul constructive t-radition.<br />

And T thiink parliaps I ml . ght br. aJllowocI to depart for one moment<br />
from the theme to tell you that i ha13d a letter from him the<br />
other day. Those oi you whio L,. cw -Sir dilliam Olivor know that he<br />
couldniit be anytair-g ( else but an Englishman: tall. straight,<br />
almost thie Znglisix-man of fCiction, And he -urote_ in Ia lettor to me<br />
that he had arrived in England, and when hae hailed a taxi the<br />
tax-drivter said -to him ' Yhitorc do you coma from?" withL that<br />
charming famili-ar view th-a t ' t. axi.-drivers take in London. He said<br />
'" From A. ustralia". To Vhnicth t aXi-driver said I! Ah. T knew you<br />
