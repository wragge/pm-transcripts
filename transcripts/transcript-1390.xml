ROYAL COMMONWEALTH SOCIETY LUNCHEON<br />
LONDON 8th September 1 966.<br />
Speech by the Erime. Ministeir Mr Harold Holt<br />
Your Grace, Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
Our Chairman and I have attended a number of Commonwealth<br />
gatherings, usually uncomfortable, but by no means as agreeable as this<br />
meeting we have in company with you today, and I speak a little feelingly<br />
because I think I've spent one of the more uncomfortable of my mornings<br />
in the service of the Commonwealth this morning at the Prime Minister's<br />
Conference; One of our delegates has been going for a couple of hours and<br />
is still in play. I don't mean to keep you anything as long as that, and indeed<br />
I felt that thiere were about three matters that I could hope to cover and then<br />
at question time perhaps we will supplement and broaden out a bit what I've<br />
been sayin-y or touch on other matters which could be of interest to you.<br />
The three things I thought I would canvamwith you today would be<br />
first the contrast which exists and I speak now not as an old Prime Minister<br />
but as an old campaigner whose first ministry was in 1939 and attended the<br />
first of the Post-War Prime Ministerial Conferences when the New Commonwealth<br />
was emerging. And there is a contrast, of course, to be painted between the<br />
conditions under which Prime Minister Conferences were held then and how they are<br />
held at this time. The second thing was to say something quite briefly about Rkodesia.<br />
which quite clearly is the dominating issue of the Conference briefly, because<br />
we are still in discussion on it and I've not yet made any comment myself in the<br />
Conference. although I would have hoped to do so this afternoon. but for the<br />
rather lengthy contribution which seems to have absorbed most of the working<br />
time so far today. The third aspect which I hope to have time to touch on arises from<br />
some of the things I've been reading. more particularly over recent months<br />
following a couple of visits I made to Washington.<br />
I'd always re~ arded myself as a fairly staunch supporter of the<br />
Commonwealth of Nations and, in particular. of the British -Australian coqnection.<br />
but I see myself described by some as having sold out to the United States or<br />
having thrown in my lot with America. Well, of course. there are some very good<br />
reasons why Australia should be close to the United States, which you will<br />
appreciate, but I would hope to find time to tell you something of the continuing<br />
link which exists between this country and Australia, not merely links of sentimentalthough<br />
these are powerful but material links of trade, mutual problems of<br />
security in the area, and other matters of that sort.<br />
Now, firstly, contrasts between the Commonwealth Conference as<br />
I first knew it. when one could gather all the delegates into No. 10 Downing Street.<br />
It was, of course, in those days a white Commonwealth Conference; there were<br />
no difficult racial problems to concern ourselves with. The delegations fitted<br />
comfortably into No. 10, the discussions were cosy and intimnate, from men of<br />
like -minded views on the problems of the world. It was all very agreeable and<br />
it helped to knit us together very closely indeed, and there is today. of course,<br />
a quite remarkable contrast as a result of the evolution that has gone on since<br />
the second world war. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
The new Commonwealth was given its first expression in the<br />
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference of 1948 when we had<br />
India Pakistan and Ceylon added to the former white and aaropean racial team.<br />
but since that time of course, there has been the proliferation of other<br />
membership and also certain changes inside the composition of the old<br />
Commonwealth with the result that as we sit round the table at the present<br />
time there are the four old Commonwealth countries of European racial<br />
derivation rhe United Kingdom Canada, Australia and New Zealandand<br />
with the full teamn there would be 19 others from Asia and from Africa<br />
and other parts of the world. There are 22 Delegations represented at this<br />
Conference, quite a good muster considering the subject matters to be discussed,<br />
but one of the questions which we shall all be asking ourselves increasingly as<br />
time goes on is a sort of mental debit and balance sheet so far as the Commonwealth<br />
is concerned. I know that there are many people that have their doubts about the<br />
continuing value of the Commonwealth, some of them outside this country and<br />
some of them inside it, and I don't think we have been assisted in forming an<br />
objective judgment by those who arrive on these shores threatening to withdraw<br />
unless their terms are acceded to. This, not unnaturally, provokes a reaction<br />
amongst many people inside this country that the United Kingdom might be more<br />
comfortably placed without such ungenerous or unfriendly or critical associates<br />
inside the Commonwealth. Now I think bath of these developments are to be<br />
regretted. They are both, in a sense, understandable and it calls on our<br />
patience, our wisdom, our tolerance to see them in their true perspective.<br />
But if there are to be these uncomfortable problems in an uncomfortable world.<br />
perhaps we are better off and I incline to that view myself subject to what<br />
emer-yes in the course of the next few days we are, I believe, better off having<br />
these exchanges, however searching and even acrimonious around our own table,<br />
able to round off the sharp edges of discus nion with the personal and intimate<br />
contacts we have outside the conference room itself. That surely is to be<br />
preferred to the alternative of long-distance exchanges; either at the United<br />
Nations or some other international forum.<br />
I'm quite certain that the Commonwealth has been a force for good<br />
in the years which have preceded our present situation. It has and I speak as<br />
a veteran parliamentarian who has attended many Commonwealth Conferences in<br />
the Parliamentary field, and quite a number of conferences of Prime Ministers<br />
it has undoubtedly contributed to a better understanding of each other and our<br />
problems. it has established personal contacts which have bred respect for the<br />
other man's point of view, and has developed a better and more realistic<br />
appreciation of his national position and so all these things are advantages.<br />
But on the other hand must be weighed the cost to the United Kingdom in terms<br />
of international confidence. If it is to be a punch-bag for visiting delegations.<br />
some questioning the good faith of the Government of the day, some asserting that<br />
there are racial prejudices which are complicating the solution to these difficult<br />
questions then it may well be that Great Britain pays a price in international<br />
respect and confidence which is far outweighing the advantages which the<br />
Commonwealth currently brings to it.<br />
These are matters of judgment which can be resolved. I think more<br />
fittingly by a United Kingdom Government weighing up the ' Pros and Cons' than<br />
by those of us who can take a rather more objective view of what lines of criticism<br />
are being developed against this country. But I've heard a great deal in recent days<br />
which I believe is neither fair to this country and is not practical in the political<br />
measurement that we bring to policies directed at particular problems.<br />
Now, just to give an illustration surely the best and most effective<br />
answer to any charge that the United Kingdom has allowed racial prejudice<br />
to distort its view of these questions is the nature of the gathering in which we<br />
participate at this present time. As I said, it's not so long ago it was an<br />
entirely white and European community of representatives European as to<br />
race, at any rate and outlook. But by the de~ iberate choice of those who were. 1.3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
at that time the members of the Commonwealth and, in particular, in response to<br />
British leadership, we have seen emerge the Commonwealth of Nations multiracial,<br />
representative of all the national groupings at least all types of<br />
national groupings, differing creeds, all the differences which we are conscious<br />
of, those of us who have an enthusiasm for the Commonwealth or have attempted<br />
to contribute to its continuance and successful operation. These are the cliches<br />
of Commonwealth, in a sense.<br />
We know that embraced in our membership is about a quarter of the<br />
world's population covering about a fift'i of the world's total area, and it would be<br />
a remarkable and welcome achievement if over the period of years we could<br />
demonstrate to the rest of the world tiiat this multi-racial association succeeds,<br />
that it has brought people closer together, it has helped to solve difficult<br />
international problems and it has promoted economic progress. national<br />
security and a general situation of peace. Now these are the great objectives of<br />
our Commonwealth community and it would be, I believe, a tremendous sacrifice<br />
of aspiration if. because of irritation or our own frustrations or, indeed, the<br />
irritations and frustrations of other members of the Commonwealth we were to<br />
find withdrawals or damage being done to the structure of such magnitude that the<br />
Commonwealth ' lid not possess a continuing existence and a hopeful future. And<br />
so over the critical days which lie ahead of this particular conference I hope that<br />
these thoughts will be uppermost in the minds of the Delegates. and that they<br />
shall apply the test of what is fair, what is practical, to the suggestions and<br />
solutions which come to us around the table.<br />
Now the second matter that I wanted to mention was a passing<br />
reference to the question of Rhodesia and~ here. perhaps, is the illustration of<br />
my comment that much of what I have heard has been neither fair nor practical.<br />
When the United Kingdom's own good faith is brought into question in this matter,<br />
those who make these charges I believe ignore the relationship which has existed<br />
over the years between the United Kingdom and Rhodesia.<br />
When it is urged that force be employed then, in my view. that is<br />
an impractical course. I would very much question whether a Parliament in<br />
the United Kingdom would give support to a Government which directed force<br />
against the people Rhodesia when the possibility of other solutions had certainly<br />
not been fully exhausted.<br />
We in my own country have seen this as a special problem between<br />
the United Kingdom and its former colony, but we have, for our part subscribed<br />
to the programme of sanctions which was agreed upon and our current<br />
arrangem ents apply to about 96 percent of our former imports from Rhodesia.<br />
But there is, I believe, in this issue a test of the good se nse, a judgment of what<br />
is practical and what is fair in relation to the United Kingdom itself, and when it<br />
is known. as is the case of course, that the United Kingdom which could have<br />
resolved this matter of itself and through its own policies has brought the<br />
Commonwealth as a whole into conference with it, that again is I believe, a<br />
substantial answer to any charge of bad faith or failure to deal with it in a<br />
Commonwealth spirit.<br />
I can't go over the ground of the Rhodesian issue in any detail because<br />
the discussion is still before the Conference. I haven't spoken 012 it there, and<br />
although our practices are changing, I think not necessarily for the better in<br />
relation to public disclosures, I at least would like to say rather more to my<br />
colleagues before I say a great deal on this in public. But perhaps it's<br />
reflective of the changing situation, that I make that comment about the changing<br />
procedures. In earlier times it was an intimate, confidential discussion with<br />
Prime Ministers reporting back to their cabinets and the world hearing very<br />
little about what went on beyond the rather sterle language of the communique. </p>
<p>4-r<br />
Well, all this has changed, I repeat not necessarily for the better, the<br />
highest common denominator of agreement that we seemed to be able to work<br />
out on this business was that Delegations aould roake known their own views to<br />
the press, but were enjoined not to discuss the views expressed by others, and<br />
as somebody said when this suggestion was made, " That's a counsel of perfection".<br />
Well, we've now reached a point where, I gather, on one earlier occasion<br />
I don't know whether it's repeated on this one. countries have engaged the services<br />
of professional Public Relations Consultants. Obw heads of Delegations give<br />
a direct interview to the Press following the contribution that they have made<br />
inside and all this marks a contrast between what had gone before and the current<br />
situation. But are we to condemn the whole system on account of what may seem to<br />
some of us to be imperfection in its practice? Perhaps in the current state of the<br />
world and with the sensitivity on these issues of race. of colonial evolution that<br />
kind of public use made of what is regarded clearly by some as a political forum<br />
or a means of national propaganda, this is part of the refriction on the machine in<br />
modern times. But out of it all, although I confess that I came away from this<br />
morning's discussion a little more pessimistic than when I went in about the future<br />
of the Commonwealth. I've still retained in my own heart an optimism that when we<br />
come to the end of the Conference talks we'll have felt that it has been of value to<br />
have these frank exchanges together to carry away with us a mre realistic awareness<br />
of how developments in particular countries are affecting the Governments of that<br />
country or of zeighbouring countries and in this way at least assist towards a<br />
more effective solution of the perplexing international problems which are vexing us<br />
all in these difficult times.<br />
Now let me turn from that because I'm not -unmindful of my undertaking<br />
to answer some questions. Toput the question to myself I was just writing some<br />
notes for this this morning. I did it in shorthand terms by Baying " How British<br />
is Australia? I wouldn't have thought I had to ask myself that question but when I<br />
read these Press commentaries that Australia is going through a metamorphosis of<br />
ideas and attitudes and policies which is tending to weaken our link with this<br />
country well this is I won't use the word ' nonsense' because there have been<br />
changes of a quite important and material kind which I shall refer to but it<br />
misreads the Australian situation altogether to imagine that there is not a strong<br />
continuing link of affection and mutual interest between this country and our own.<br />
it's not the same relationship which exists with our powerful friend the United<br />
States. Th Srelation ship with the United States is a relationship of friendship, of<br />
comradeship of mutual interest in that area of the world. The relationship with<br />
this country is for most of us a relationship of family of kinship and there are<br />
these different attitudes ' idach obtain as between friend and friend and between<br />
members of a family and one is very conscious of it as we come here or as you<br />
come out, as I hope you do. to see us.<br />
But let's face quite realistically together some of the changes which<br />
have been occurring. I refer first of all to immigration. It may interest you to<br />
know that since the second world war a total of 2, 400. O J people in round figures<br />
have come to Australia as long,-term or permanent arrivals. They haven't all<br />
stayed there of course, but most of them have. by far the overwhelming proportion<br />
of them have stayed there, and included in this total -and this is sometimes overlooked<br />
is the fact that more than 5UJ percent of these arrivals have been British,<br />
and so. Fithough in some ways you'll discover some changes in community living<br />
in Australia we get better food and drink than we used to get ' Thanks to the<br />
arrival of Italians and Greeks and Dutch and Germans and other nationalities<br />
you can get almost any type of meal including Chinese and Japanese cooking as you<br />
want it. Australia has at least on that account become a very much more delightful<br />
place to live in but more than half, I repeat. of the immigration has been still<br />
from the British Isles. A </p>
<p>Now this t-irmportant when I go on to the next detail, and that is<br />
that of the people living in Australia today one in five has either been a post-war<br />
migrant or the child of a post-war migrant, and when you get down to the younger<br />
age groups say up to 30 or 35 or thereabouts the proportion becomes<br />
significantly larger one in 4 of the young people in Australia would have been<br />
either a migrant or the child of a migrant. Some people knowing these figures<br />
have assumed from it a weakening of the British composition of the community<br />
well. I give you the other figure again to offset that for you've provided us with<br />
something more than half of the total and the tendency. of course. has been for<br />
these other nationalities I've mentioned to make their useful and helpful<br />
contribution at the cultural level, at the community level, in productive terms,<br />
adding skilld and their own enterprise to the national effort, but the country is<br />
still overwhelmingly a British community.<br />
Now I don't say that its attitude tends to become more British in the<br />
sense of emulating what goes on in the British Isles. If we're going axywhere we're<br />
not going American, we're going Australian, and there is. I think a stronger sense<br />
of nationalism a feeling of growing pride in Australia its achievements, its<br />
potentialities, even its hazards as our own people see a larger place for themselves<br />
in relation to the affairs of Asia, and this is certainly worth bearing in your mind if<br />
you are to inderstand what is happening out there.<br />
Now there's been a great deal of talk in this country, I know. about<br />
what again has been described in shorthand terms as a defence policy east of<br />
Suez, or a British effort east of Suez, and I've been myself irritating enough to<br />
try to demonstrate to people in Governmental and other high places that this must<br />
not be either overlooked, forgotten or ignored in relation to the future of this<br />
country. Heaven knows, we all appreciate the burdens which the United Kingdom<br />
has carried for the rest of the world, and I'm not seeking to add to those. We shall<br />
be carrying ourselves a greater share of responsibility as we grow in strength as<br />
we shall in the years ahead, and again our great ally in the Pacific, the United<br />
States. in recent significant pronouncements from President Johnson has made it<br />
clear that the United States sees for itself a continuing role in relation to economic<br />
progress in Asia and the security of the free countries of Asia. You get a<br />
reflection of this in a recently-formed association of countries, what we call the<br />
Aspac Group, the Asian and South-East Asian group of countries, which have come<br />
together for reasons of mutual interest. They include Japan. Thailand Korea,<br />
Vietnam Malaysia, the Phillipines. Australia New Zealand, now which is the<br />
9th? anyway there are 9 of us there in that area of the world. It's not a strong<br />
defensive combination or intended as such but recognising that we have joint<br />
interests in the successful development of t rade, of exchanges between our two<br />
countries, no dominance by azy particular major power, but a recognition of<br />
common interests making association desirable.<br />
This is a quite remarkable contrast of course, with the situation of<br />
a few years ago when Japan was the country that we had been fighting. Today our<br />
trade with Japan is second only to that of the United Kingdom. By next year it<br />
wl. certainly be our first customer n current trends. Just to give you one<br />
illustration of the way in which our trade will be building in future years, we<br />
currently have iron ore contracts negotiated with the Japanese to a value of<br />
over one thousand million pounds sterling and these have yet to get fully under way<br />
and we believe this to be only the beginning of a growing trade in this commodity so<br />
basic and vital to the steel industry of Japan.<br />
Our trade with that country, I think I can give you a figure or two on it,<br />
has grown from about six million pounds in 1951 our imports in 1949-50 were<br />
000, 000 sterling and our exports S19, 000, 000. iaasyear Itport<br />
hld grahaft m 000, 000 to œ L 2, 000. 000 and exports from the<br />
œ 19, 000, 000 to œ 188. 000, 000. Our trade through buth-East Asia and<br />
Asia generally well, trade east of Suez has built up from 16 percent of our total<br />
trade in 1951/ 52 to 33 percent in 1965/ 66 and the likelihood of that increasing is<br />
established by trends in the trade curves with the various countries of the area.<br />
/ 6 </p>
<p>* 1 </p>
<p>-6<br />
So, vYien you put allithese-things together I think you get somne explanation of<br />
Aust~ alian attitudes which have seemed at this distance to reflect even a<br />
change of orientation a change of sympathy and if not of allegiance at least of<br />
association, but when you see the basis for these things, the security contribution<br />
which the United States makes to us through our treaties under Anzus The<br />
Australian and New Zealand Treaty with the United States and the Treaty<br />
arr'angements made with this country and with the United States under the South<br />
East Asia Treaty Organisation. these things quite clearly -have their impact on<br />
Australian attitudes. This growth of trade on a quite dramatic scale with countries with<br />
whom trade was almost non existent 10 or 15 years ago, this ap. in is effecting<br />
the concentration of our outlook which was in my early days in public life almost<br />
entirely directed towards the British Isles and Europe generally. These days at<br />
least a large part of our attention is given to the possibilities developing for us to<br />
our north, and of course out of trade and security arrangements there is a<br />
growth of personal contact.<br />
It was not entirely for the significance that has been attributed to it,<br />
that my own first visit as Prime Minister outside my country was to a group of<br />
countries in South-East Asia rather than to the more traditional sources of<br />
Au stralian contact and association. I say it wasn't with quite that significance.<br />
because my role and intention was to see our own troops where they were stationed<br />
in that area of the world.. But in a result it developed into a quite sizeable<br />
diplomatic exercise and I was interested to see subsequently that the countries of<br />
Asta themselves were reading into this an Australian interest, a lively interest in<br />
our future with them which they were welcoming. Well the need for it is clear<br />
and I think that Australia can, by the growth of our own economy and our contacts<br />
with these countries, make our own international contribution to the objectives<br />
of Which the United Kingdom ad the United States have in relation to the world<br />
ge~ ierally. We are helping, we believe in this way to preserve freedom for<br />
thcose peoples of Asia who feel threatened by communist aggression. We are<br />
striengthening the economies of the free areas by the increasing trade, increasing<br />
aid and eventually we would hope through these massive programmes which the<br />
United States has in contsmplation.<br />
Now please see all these things in their perspective. but this doesn't<br />
detract in any substantial way from the feeling that Australian people have, that<br />
our destinies in the future as in the past will be closely linked together and that<br />
the problems which you face both in relation to your internal adjustment and the<br />
problems in relation to the rest of the world will always be of acute interest<br />
to us and of sympathetic concern to the people of my country.<br />
Now Mr Chairman I haven't left all that time for questions I<br />
apologise for going, not as long as my colleague from an unnamed Commonwealth<br />
country, but longer than I had intended. Thank you very much.<br />
Que stion How important S~ ir, to Australia is the continued presence of British<br />
troops on the ground in Malaya?<br />
Answer Well we think there is an importance which goes beyond the security<br />
consideration measured purely in military terms. The rather curious arrangement<br />
which has built up over the years whereby a Commonwealth force has been<br />
stationed in Malaysia and a large naval base has been operated out of Singapore,<br />
these establishments have wi~ th the troops located at them been a stabilising and<br />
moderating factor we believe in the affairs of the area, and I know that this view<br />
is shared by the Government of Malaysia and certainly the Government of Singapore<br />
and when we had our talks earlier in the year with Mr Healey we made this fact<br />
sufficiently powerfully known to him to have some impact we believe on British<br />
thinking and we welcomed the decision which was then made. We don't ask for<br />
large forces to be there, but we think that you people in the United Kingdom underrate<br />
your own influence and the character and strength which Britain still possesses<br />
around large areas of the world. 17 </p>
<p>-7<br />
Question I wonder-' whether the Prime Minister would be good enough to tell<br />
us whether the future plans of Australia contemplate the early arrival of Asian<br />
immigrants, particularly the country with which they now have trade worth<br />
000, 000, 000 and the trade it is said is likely to increase.<br />
Answer I am asked as to whether we contemplate an influx of Asian immigrants.<br />
I do not. We do have in Australia at the present time a considerable influx of<br />
Asian students to our schools and universities amounting to about 12, 000 or about<br />
percent of our total university population and the figure is tending to grow. This<br />
is one of the useful ways in which we are proving helpful to the people of Asia<br />
and indeed if we were to say to those students that they were to remain on in<br />
Australia when their courses were completed, I think the friendly relations<br />
currently existing between Australia and the Governments of the area would<br />
quickly be affected for the worse. They want the students back with them to help<br />
them with their own problems. But I don't think It's generally realised that<br />
attitudes in Australia are rather more liberal and sensitive on these questions<br />
than is usually conceded to them.<br />
I said, half jocularly when a question somewhat along these lines<br />
was put to me as I was leaving Australia " Well. you know a country which has<br />
just elected a Chiniaman to be Mayor of Darwn and a Japanese to be Shire<br />
President of one of our Victorian Shires and has invited an American Negrq<br />
Dean Dixon to run the Sydney Symphony Orchestra can't be too racist in its<br />
general attitudes" and I don't know of any complaints of discrimination inside<br />
Austa~ tlia, A.@ j. complaint of discrimination on racial grounds.<br />
But the question of immigration on the large scale it is not as if<br />
there hasn't been some history of these matters in the past. There were times<br />
in Australian history in the past when the migrants came in as a result of<br />
encouragement and it was because of the social and racial disturbances which then<br />
followed that restraints had to be applied. There would be no answer to the<br />
population problems of Asia to be found in our own country on a basis of Asian<br />
migration and indeed if one talks to the political leaders of these countries I<br />
think they recognise the value for them of a strong-growing homogeneous Australia<br />
rather than one divided by a plethora of minority elements contributing to<br />
national weakness. But in the administration of the policy, we do have room for humanity<br />
and good sense. An Asian who marries an Australian takes up citizenship by<br />
that fact alone. The children are of course Australian children and there is room<br />
inside the policy for admission on a permanent basis of Asians who have some<br />
special contribution to make to our national advancement.<br />
Question Sir, can you see a future growing up in Australia as a buffer say<br />
between Asia and the rest of the Western World?<br />
Answer Well, I should hope we wouldn't have to regard ourselves as a buffer,<br />
because I would trust that the relations between Asia and the rest of the Western<br />
World will be cordial and co-operative. Certainly that will be so of the kind of<br />
Asian countries with which we are associated in the Aspac Group.<br />
Australia is not a large country in terms of population although we<br />
are large in area and I believe large in potential. But we don't claim the<br />
capacities of a major power to the extent that a national capacity for friendliness<br />
and a well-developed spirit of mateship can contribute in our discussions in Asia<br />
to better relations in Asia and other parts of the world well that will be freely<br />
forthcoming. Question Is it true there is growing opposition in Australia Sir to your<br />
Rhodesian Policy? </p>
<p>-8<br />
Answer I amceRtinjy-not. consctous of it if there is. I don't think Australians<br />
have followed with anything like the same detail developments in Rhodesia as they<br />
have, for example in Vietnam which is an issue of very much more direct concern'<br />
to us and to our security as it is seen from there at any rate. But there has been<br />
in Australia as a carry -over of a comradeship in arms of two world wars and<br />
the admiration for the early settlement under difficult conditions in that part of<br />
the world of British settlers in particular a friendliness and a sympathy which<br />
does affect the public attitude to this particular question. That has not~ however,<br />
prevented either the Government, the Parliament and the people from supporting<br />
the policies we have pursued of maintaining sanctions against the present<br />
Administration. Question What will be the future of the Commonwealth if all the African<br />
countries walk out of the Commonwealth?<br />
Answer Well? Hope that's a question we don't have to answer.<br />
I would certainly have hoped that there is sufficient responsibility<br />
and tolerance and recognition of the quite serious and damaging effect it would<br />
have around the world for us to avoid any action of that kind. However it is<br />
a question which events will answer before all of us are very much older.<br />
