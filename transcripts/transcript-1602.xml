FOR PRESS: F. M. No. 58/ 1967<br />
MIDDLE EAST HOSTILITIES<br />
Statement by the Acting Prime Minister, Mr. John McEwen<br />
The outbreak of fighting in the Middle East is a tragic development.<br />
All Australians are dismayed at the suffering and destruction that is being<br />
brought to the people of the countries which are now in conflict. In addition<br />
any large scale fighting in that region which upsets the precarious balance<br />
there holds dangers of involving outside powers and endangering peace elsewhere.<br />
The failure of the Security Council to act before hostilities began<br />
is to be deplored. The Australian Government still hopes that the United Nations<br />
can discharge its responsibilities and take decisions for which the Australian<br />
and other governments can offer their full support. The Australian Permanent<br />
Representative to the United Nations has been instructed to give all support to<br />
this end. On 25th May, the Minister for External Affairs, Mr. Hasluck,<br />
said: " I hope that all the Great Powers, whatever their differences on some<br />
aspects of the present situation, will nevertheless work together to prevent<br />
hostilities. Now that hostilities have broken out, this appeal to the Great<br />
Powers is no less valid. In fact, the urgency is even greater.<br />
Australia has a great concern that peace should be maintained in<br />
the Middle East. Where our own good offices can be of use, we are ready to<br />
be helpful. Australia looks to the Security Council to act to prevent a widening<br />
of hostilities and to bring about an end to the present fighting.<br />
