TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />
INTERVIEW WITH PAUL LYNEHAM, 7: 30 REPORT, 4 JUNE 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
PL: Prime Minister, thanks for slowing down long enough<br />
to speak with one of the faded and jaded players.<br />
PM: Well that's a pleasure. If that's how you want to<br />
describe yourself.<br />
PL: Well that's how you described the established media<br />
outlets yesterday.<br />
PM: Well I think they are. As I said a bit of fade on<br />
all of them.<br />
PK: So you can't wait for those American quiz shows with<br />
all the custard pies and the plastic compares?<br />
PM: I don't think you'll see those.<br />
PL: You won't see them on Pay TV?<br />
PM: No, I think what you'll see on Pay TV is blockbuster<br />
movies, the movies you see as first releases at the<br />
movie theatre, you'll be able to turn it on and<br />
watch it at home. That's what you'll see in the<br />
main.<br />
PL: But apart from that though, do you think there's a<br />
whole lot of terrific TV programs out there that the<br />
established networks are, for some perverse reason,<br />
not showing people? Is all that product waiting to<br />
burst on the screen?<br />
PM: Are you making a case against Pay TV?<br />
PL: I'm just wondering if we need this sort of<br />
investment in this time in our nation's history. I<br />
mean, what about a bit of productive export<br />
production?<br />
PM: I think information technolo y is going to be one of<br />
the important industries in Australia. And we have </p>
<p>the satellite, we have the technology available, and<br />
it's a matter of choice I think for Australians, I<br />
think if they want to lay out what is the equivalent<br />
of the price of a VCR they can beam into their home<br />
four channels of movies, sport, news etc.<br />
PL: Done by somebody who's not been in the industry<br />
before?<br />
PM: Well done by somebody who's been in the<br />
entertainment industry, not necessarily the<br />
television industry.<br />
PL: And someone who is going to bid up a lot of money to<br />
get these first four channels of f the satellite then<br />
twelve months from that, while they're still trying<br />
to get us to buy the dishes and sign up, everyone<br />
else gets in on the act and it's open slather.<br />
PM: No, but the others have got one channel only, one<br />
channel not four.<br />
PL: Yes, but one of the others could be Kerry Packer, or<br />
anyone.<br />
PM: Kerry, even though I know he would regard himself as<br />
a radiating force, I don't believe he could beam<br />
four channels for himself when there's only one<br />
available. So he's got one channel even if he were<br />
to succeed. Whereas the first player is in the box<br />
seat. They get four channels.<br />
PL: It's only in a year.<br />
PM: More than that. Four channels on an existing<br />
technology as a new group removed from television,<br />
removed from newspapers, removed from<br />
telecommunications. As a new group, new players,<br />
diversity, which I think is what the public is<br />
looking for, they can go for their lives in signing<br />
households up to Pay TV. On transponders five and<br />
six, the single ones, that's where you're likely to<br />
see fibre optics, what's called interactive services<br />
where you can talk back to your bank or order your<br />
shopping and where you'll have block buster movies<br />
as well, news. But it's on one channel at this<br />
stage so they can't do it on one channel.<br />
PL: But you've got all this rival competing technology<br />
coming. I mean we going to have aerial and black<br />
boxes everywhere you look aren't we?<br />
PM: No, because I think the one black box we'll have<br />
will be common to them all. That is, that part of<br />
the legislative framework is that the black box you<br />
have in the house will be able to deal with any of<br />
the technology so you won't have to re-invest in it. </p>
<p>PL: It's going to be a hell of a black box.<br />
PM: No, you know how minaturised things are these days,<br />
this is as clever as anything. So it means that<br />
Telecom, which has made a very large decision to<br />
wire up the Australian suburbs years ago with fibre<br />
optics as very few telecommunication carriers around<br />
the world have done, it could then profit from that<br />
decision and Australians could profit from their<br />
foresight in having interactive services which the<br />
satellite can't provide. So we get the best of all<br />
worlds early, satellite provided, quality Pay<br />
TV, blockbusters etc, and also the fibre optic<br />
option or a hybrid between the satellite and the<br />
cable.<br />
PL: And only 10 per cent of it by value Australian<br />
product.<br />
PM: That's right and I think that that will still take a<br />
fair bit of doing.<br />
PL: Now I know you have got this speedy, eat my dust<br />
style running this week, but..<br />
PM: Well we've had it running for eight years really.<br />
PL: Yes, but its been metal on the floor since Sunday<br />
though hasn't it? Slightly speedier since Sunday?<br />
PM: What did you say? Metal on the floor?<br />
PL: Yes.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
PL: But doesn't it all look like policy making on the<br />
run though? I mean this Pay TV thing was turned<br />
around in a couple of hours wasn't it?<br />
PM: I think the policy dexterity of the Government, the<br />
fact that you've got and you have in this<br />
Government, at least a good third to half that<br />
Caucus as technologically well informed about<br />
telecommunications, frankly as anyone in the<br />
bureaucracy, and people can sit down and discuss<br />
variants and options, in what is after all a limited<br />
discussion, and work their way through to the best<br />
option. I think we are able to do that and we did<br />
it with expedition.<br />
PL: Expedition is an understatement. I mean you say to<br />
Chris Schacht I dare you to take on this option and<br />
he says right-o, I mean its almost like a poker game<br />
isn't it. </p>
<p>PM: This is a subject which has been around for donkey's<br />
years and if we were to allow the plodding rate<br />
we'ye had through the bureaucratic<br />
PL: But suddendly you're talking about giving networks<br />
per cent of the action. Yesterday they get none.<br />
PM: No, yesterday they get 100.<br />
PL: Oh well the tail end of the game.<br />
PM: That's right. No, you've got to understand. You<br />
see your not up to what it means either. Do you<br />
understand? I mean this policy is moving awfully<br />
quickly.<br />
PL: Has it moved again since yesterday has it?<br />
PM: The thing is we went from 45 per cent, we went<br />
upwards to infinity to 100, but not on the first<br />
four channels. On the first four..<br />
PL: You went down to zero?<br />
PM: We went down to zero and that way we do get a new<br />
player. I mean this is a very strong case for a new<br />
player in the media so we are not dealing with the<br />
Newslimiteds, or the Consolidated Press or any of<br />
the other established players, or TCN 9 or 7 or any<br />
of these other people. Alt's basically a group that<br />
will be new to the media, as we've seen new people<br />
to radio come, as we've seen new people to regional<br />
television. It will make Australia more diverse in<br />
media and that's got to be good.<br />
PL: And there's all that talent out there is there that<br />
we've not spied before, that's just eluded us up<br />
until now, all that programming talent, that<br />
networking expertise.<br />
PM: We have been able to run a picture theatre business<br />
for fifty years in this country.<br />
PL: Yes, but that's nearly gone broke recently.<br />
PM: I don't know why some of them and the providers of<br />
television and movie products can't run a Pay TV<br />
station. It's basically a video shop tubed into<br />
your house.<br />
PL: We'll find out won't we? For the moment at least<br />
you appear to have left the Marshall Islands affair<br />
behind in your slip stream, but what if the<br />
Democrats decide after all to join the Coalition in<br />
demanding a Senate inquiry?<br />
PM: I think that would be an abuse of the powers of the<br />
Senate. </p>
<p>PL: Why, they've got every right to do that?<br />
PM: No, I thinkc this is a matter where obviously Sentor<br />
Richardson. he person first involved in this, had<br />
made an unguarded connection with someone who was<br />
prepared to fight ruthlessly to prey upon his good<br />
instincts and goodwill. But there was never any<br />
notion of anything improper being there and for this<br />
to be dragged out for political reasons is not to be<br />
applauded.<br />
PL: But all those former associates of Mr Symons, the<br />
public servants, all giving evidence, I mean it<br />
could look a bit messy after a while.<br />
PM: But what former associates and which public<br />
servants. I mean who are Mr Symons contacts.<br />
Millions of Australians deal with the Commonwealth<br />
Government, why should they be the subject of<br />
inquiries other than the entirely appropriate ones<br />
which are done in the normal course of bureaucratic<br />
investigations.<br />
PL: Whatever you think though they can do it, can they<br />
not?<br />
PM: You see the Opposition, this can only happen with<br />
the support of the Liberal Party.<br />
PL: And they're red hot for it aren't they?<br />
PM: And in these two weeks when we've been recasting the<br />
airline system of Australia, remodelling the airline<br />
systei and establishing for the first time pay<br />
television, and at the same time working on a<br />
rejuvenation of TAFE, technical and further<br />
education, Dr Hewson is there publishing pamphlets<br />
frightening older people about the prospects of them<br />
being burgled, but they won't be if they introduce a<br />
consumption tax.<br />
PL: Which might be good politics, elderly people are<br />
afraid of crime.<br />
PM: We've got to have a proper moral basis to our<br />
politics and if it gets down to it, this is the<br />
Liberal Party<br />
PL: You're saying he is immoral?<br />
PM: I think that style of argument of immoral, yes I do<br />
and when the Government is so obviously on the<br />
tangible issues in public life and while the Cabinet<br />
is sitting at night doing these things, they're<br />
sitting at night working out ad campaigns they've<br />
taken from the worst elements of American<br />
electioneering. </p>
<p>PL: Well let's talk about another real issue, the Mabo<br />
jdgpision in the High Court yesterday. You said<br />
you'd welcome it, why?<br />
PM: Because I think the whole notion of dispossession is<br />
put down by it.<br />
PL: Galarrwuy Yunupingu says the Government must either<br />
move quickly to negotiate a treaty now and implement<br />
comprehensive national land rights or face a barrage<br />
of litigation as a resul t o s decision.<br />
PM: I don't think that's right. I don't think it's wise<br />
for Aboriginal leaders to take that position.<br />
PL: There's a lot of crown land out there they could lay<br />
claim to.<br />
PM: Many have not, but the Court itself stressed that<br />
there wouldn't be a threat to private property as a<br />
result of the decision. It's just we're recognising<br />
the fact that even though the Aboriginals have not<br />
had our traditional association and ownership with<br />
the land, or have not worked the land as Europeans<br />
have worked the land, that did not entitle us to<br />
take the view they were dispossessed of the land.<br />
This is what this decision means.<br />
PL: Training in general and TAFE in particular, what's<br />
the latest stage of the game? I mean the ministers<br />
are meeting tomorrow aren't they the State and<br />
Federal Education Ministers?<br />
PM: The latest stage of the game is I would like very<br />
much for the States to accept the Commonwealth offer<br />
for the Commonwealth to take over TAFE in total.<br />
PL: Why do you think..<br />
PM: Just understand it, funding and administration.<br />
PL: Why though? Why do you have to take it over to make<br />
it work?<br />
PM: Because it has not been developed as a national<br />
system, it is not adequately providing certainly not<br />
enough places for kids as they leave school, but<br />
more than that it is not adequately reflecting the<br />
training profile of the labour market as it should.<br />
PL: But what if the Premiers so no again?<br />
PM: Well let's see what they say.<br />
PL: But you've suggested if I read you right earlier<br />
today, that some of them might start missing out on<br />
some money? </p>
<p>PM: No, we're saying that if in the event that they<br />
don't accept that offer, if we look at a joint<br />
funding model, the Commonwealth will provide growth<br />
to it providing we get commitments from the States.<br />
Obviously we will not be providing our funds, or<br />
certainly growth in our funds, to States which don't<br />
give the commitments.<br />
PL: So the ones that don't join in could miss out to<br />
some extent?<br />
PM: Again, we may maintain our recurrent funding but the<br />
growth factors, why should we support a system which<br />
is not growing as it should.<br />
PL: What do you think of the idea of a youth wage. Many<br />
people say that that's a good idea, do you agree?<br />
PM: We are now looking at the Carmichael-Rep~ t.. and<br />
entry level training wages, and I think the whole<br />
notion of getting young people into work, into<br />
companies and at the same time have a training focus<br />
to it is important and there is a great possibility<br />
there of doing something good. It is therefore<br />
doubly important that the TAFE system provides that<br />
training place and on that basis I think the<br />
Carmichael recommendations can succeed and the, if<br />
you like, the trials we will now fund the models<br />
we're looking at within that, those pilot programmes<br />
will be I think important precursors to the<br />
development of such a system.<br />
PL: And you have talked of helping comnpanies that are<br />
offering a fair bit of work based training to<br />
youngsters, haven't you?<br />
PM: Yes, a number of companies have expressed to me an<br />
interest in taking up many thousands of young people<br />
and we are seeing how that might be accommodated.<br />
And I am going to hold a meeting with a number of<br />
the significant companies.<br />
PL: Many thousands?<br />
PM: Many thousands, yes.<br />
PL: What ten thousand?<br />
PM: Well maybe not in any individual company, but<br />
certainly multiple thousands in individual<br />
companies. And certainly, probably many more then<br />
ten.<br />
PL: But if their giving these kids a genuine go and<br />
teaching them things on a trainee basis, you might,<br />
the Government might help them? Is that how it<br />
might work? </p>
<p>PM: That's right, that's right. But again that is to be<br />
looked at and negotiated under the pilot programs.<br />
PL: The APPM dispute, Prime Minister, if the ACTU<br />
targets other operations of North Broken Hill Peko<br />
this dispute could go national very quickly.<br />
PM: Well I have said in the House and I will take the<br />
opportunity of saying here, this is the sort of<br />
industrial mayhem John Hewson would give us if he<br />
was Prime Minister. This is exactly the approach<br />
that the Coalition are following say to the<br />
company don't deal with the union, only deal with<br />
the individual employees.<br />
PL: But how can we stop it? How and when is it going to<br />
end?<br />
PM: Well it can only end when the company comes to its<br />
senses. In this one you have got the Tasmanian<br />
Liberal Government, the Commonwealth Labor<br />
Government, the Industrial Relations Commission, the<br />
Commnonwealth Minister for Industrial Relations, the<br />
Tasmanian Premier, all saying to the company don't<br />
sack people, take them back as per the agreement.<br />
PL: But they started sacking them today and your<br />
Industrial Relations Minister says the IRC doesn't<br />
have the power to force the companies hand.<br />
Meanwhile it threatens to go national, we have got a<br />
current account to worry about, I am sure you worry<br />
about it more then most people.<br />
PM: Well I think, and can we say the current account is<br />
now down to a very low level as we noticed two days<br />
ago<br />
PL: We don't want to start importing too much more paper<br />
though do we?<br />
PM: in the national accounts, no we don't. This is<br />
a matter of great disruption for the people of<br />
Burnie and I could only enjoin the company to take<br />
the advice of the Commonwealth, the Commission, and<br />
indeed, the Liberal Premier of Tasmania Mr Groom, in<br />
saying take the people back on and re-start the<br />
business in terms of the agreement made last week.<br />
PL: Bob Hawke would have stepped in about now wouldn't<br />
he?<br />
PM: Well maybe he might have, but the fact is this is<br />
exactly the kind of industrial relations policy that<br />
Dr Hewson has been enjoining us to adopt, a la New<br />
Zealand. See APPM said they will not deal with the<br />
union, they will only deal with the individual<br />
workers. Well, Australians should contemplate what </p>
<p>prospects they would have as individuals in dealing<br />
with a business or a company. Not as a group as a<br />
union, or as a collective group, but as an<br />
individual. And of course that is what the dispute<br />
is about, this is the policy Dr Hewson and Mr Howard<br />
are championing.<br />
PL: Why does the Reserve Bank want to get rid of<br />
Caroline Chisolm from the $ 5 note? What have they<br />
got against her?<br />
PM: We are dancing around the topics.<br />
PL: Around the world for sixpence.<br />
PM: I don't know. I think that Caroline Chisolm was<br />
probably the most significant women, in certainly<br />
our early history, and her effigy was on the five<br />
dollar note.<br />
PL: They want to put the Queen there do they not?<br />
PM: The Board has decided it should have an effigy of<br />
the Queen. Now I wrote to the Board when I was<br />
Treasurer to say that I disagreed with this and that<br />
I thought that Caroline Chisolm's effigy should be<br />
maintained, or retained. But the Board in its<br />
wisdom have decided otherwise, and in this respect<br />
the Board has a clear power given to it by the<br />
Parliament under the Reserve Bank Act.<br />
PL: So what the Prime Minister thinks is irrelevant, is<br />
it?<br />
PM: I think in this subject it may not be irrelevant,<br />
but the prerogative is that of the Board's.<br />
PL: So she could go, Caroline Chisolm could go?<br />
PM: I think that is a possibility but the Board, in its<br />
wisdom, may at the eleventh hour choose otherwise.<br />
PL: But the Queen is still going to be on the coins is<br />
she? No problem about that?<br />
PM: No, none whatsoever.<br />
PL: You were asked today in Parliament, when will we see<br />
your submission on changing the flag?<br />
PM: Well we have had so much on at the moment, airlines,<br />
there the ones you see, and there's all the other<br />
things that go through Cabinet, we have had such a<br />
program, and particularly with the Parliament<br />
sitting for the last two weeks. I will get round to<br />
bringing a submission about it.<br />
PL: A few weeks, or months or what? </p>
<p>PM: I think probably a few weeks, maybe a month, where<br />
we can sensibly think about the flag and its future.<br />
That would be within the context of not changing the<br />
flag, whatever the Cabinet decides, and however it<br />
may approach a change in the design of the flag.<br />
Not actually changing the flag in its official<br />
designation without a plebiscite of some kind. Not<br />
a referendum because a referendum has States<br />
majority questions, what have you. But a<br />
plebiscite, a vote.<br />
PL: So something a bit better then what an opinion poll<br />
might say?<br />
PM: Well, I think that on this it is important that the<br />
public believe they have a right to say what they<br />
think about the flag. But I certainly take the view<br />
that we can't go on flying the flag, our flag, with<br />
the flag of another country in the corner.<br />
PL: Would you be unhappy with linking this plebiscite to<br />
the next federal election?<br />
PM: Well it depends what I take to Cabinet, and we we'll<br />
see.<br />
PL: My last topic Prime Minister. What we discovered<br />
yesterday was that you, Dr Hewson and Peter Reith<br />
have all reported late on the affairs of your<br />
private companies. Not a very shining example by<br />
the nation's leaders to the corporate sector,<br />
surely?<br />
PM: Well I wasn't upbraiding Dr Hewson.<br />
PL: No, but nevertheless you were all in the wrong as it<br />
turned out.<br />
PM: But the interesting thing is while I have been<br />
beavering away on these various policies in the last<br />
two weeks, Dr Hewson, the fellow who said he would<br />
bring some decent politics to Australia, is down at<br />
the companies office digging out my company return<br />
to find out whether the information return was<br />
lodged on time, and had the gall to go on about it<br />
and have Mr Peacock ask me about it, having failed<br />
himself for three consecutive years to lodge his<br />
return on time, and Mr Reith the same for two<br />
consecutive years.<br />
PL: And both have conceded their embarrassment, and<br />
there is lots of egg dripping of f face. But<br />
nevertheless, you were all in the wrong and are you<br />
happy to cop it sweet and pay a penalty if that's<br />
what happens? </p>
<p>PM: There is a late lodgement fee and a penalty, and<br />
that has already been paid in my case. And<br />
obviously they will get theirs in on time now too.<br />
PL: You know if you keep on making investments though,<br />
like half a million dollars in a piggery, you are<br />
going to have to stop taunting John Hewson about<br />
being wealthy though, aren't you?<br />
PM: On that's not the value of one of his Ferraris. I<br />
mean, he has got more in toys, in his garage, in one<br />
toy, than I have invested in a simple primary<br />
industry.<br />
PL: It's a lot of money though half a million.<br />
PM: Do you think it is today, in terms of investments?<br />
PL: Well I tell you what, if you would like to leave it<br />
somewhere in a paper bag I'll pick it up.<br />
PM: The thing is Dr Hewson has a vast collection of<br />
assets, which if you turn up the pecuniary interests<br />
of the Liberal front bench you will find a plethera<br />
of companies and trusts, reflecting of course the<br />
wealth which these people have traditionally had.<br />
PL: The truth is you are all pretty wealthy these days<br />
aren't you?<br />
PM: I don't think that is true. I think you will find<br />
most members of the Government have one house and<br />
probably a mortgage. That's certainly my position,<br />
one house and a mortgage, and an interest in a farm.<br />
PL: What do you know about pigs? What is so good about<br />
pigs?<br />
PM: I never found how anyone was so interested when Mr<br />
Anthony had a similar interest, no one ever<br />
questioned him about his interest in a piggery.<br />
PL: There seems to be a political link here. I mean,<br />
Rodger Douglas in New Zealand went into pigs.<br />
PM: Yes they are very much the vogue. I have got to say<br />
that.<br />
PL: What's so good about them?<br />
PM: I don't know, I don't know. But Howard asked me<br />
yesterday about it, I said I wouldn't take you there<br />
because I would then have to find you again, and<br />
that would be a problem.<br />
PL: Thanks for your time and I hope we haven't<br />
interrupted for too long this feverish pitch or<br />
policy change. </p>
