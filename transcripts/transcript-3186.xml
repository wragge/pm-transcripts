FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Press Statement No. 202<br />
11 March 1974<br />
FLOODS<br />
I am profoundly concerned at the renewed flooding<br />
in Queensland and New South Wales and the plight of many<br />
families. I extend the Government's sympathy to all those<br />
affected by the floods.<br />
I have sought immediate and up-to-date reports<br />
on the flood situation. The Leader of the Country Party,<br />
Mr. Anthony, has drawn my attention to the situation in<br />
Lismore and Murwillumbah It is tragic that further flooding<br />
should occur so soon after the recent devastation in Queensland<br />
and Northern New South Wales. I have agreed with the Minister<br />
for Defence that the defence forces will again provide all<br />
possible immediate assistance during the present emergency.<br />
No effort will be spared to ensure the safety of<br />
life and the supply of necessary food and shelter. I assure all<br />
victims of the latest flooding that the same assistance and<br />
guarantees of long-term aid for flood relief and restoration<br />
that we have pledged to the earlier flood victims will be<br />
extended to the victims of the latest flooding.<br />
This will be provided, where necessary, through<br />
co-operation with the State authorities.<br />
CANBERRA. A. C. T. </p>
