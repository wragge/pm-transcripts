PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 520<br />
June 1975<br />
EMBARGO: 6 p. m.<br />
JOINT PRESS STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE<br />
PREMIER OF TASMANIA<br />
The Prime Minister' ( Mr Whitlan) and the Premier of<br />
Tasmania ( Mr Neilson) announced their general agreement<br />
with the recommendations of the Joint Expert Advisory<br />
Committee on the second Derwent River crossing at Hobart.<br />
They also announced that an immediate start would<br />
be made on detailed investigation and design for a second<br />
bridge and road approaches at Dowsings Point. The bridge,<br />
to be of concrete box construction, would be designed to be<br />
compatible with the attractive natural environment in<br />
the vicinity of Dowsing Point. It would carry four<br />
traffic lanes and, with approaches, is estimated to cost<br />
$ 21 million. Detailed investigation and design of the second<br />
bridge would be carried out under the auspices of a new<br />
Joint Committee to be constituted by the two Goverments.<br />
When firm information becomes available as a result of these<br />
studies, an environmental impact statement will be prepared.<br />
The statement will incorporate details of the studies<br />
already undertaken on alternative locations and give due<br />
regard to the location and design of the proposed bridge,<br />
the changes to the metropolitan road systems and consequential<br />
effects of land use on both banks of the Derwent.<br />
Mr Whitlam, and Mr Neilson said that the-. two Governments<br />
would have discussions on the timing for construction of the<br />
new bridge, procedures for the further studies and their<br />
assessment and the financial arrangements involved.<br />
It was expected that investigations and design and<br />
preparation of contract documents would take about 18 months.<br />
The timing of actual construction would need to be keyed to<br />
completion of reconstruction of the Tasman Bridge. / 2 </p>
<p>Mr Whitlam gave an undertaking that the Bridge and<br />
associated roadwords would be funded by the Australian<br />
Government up to the cost applicable to a bridge of<br />
metres vertical clearance.<br />
Mr Neilson said that he and Mr Whitlam had discussed<br />
the question of land use involved in areas made more<br />
accessible by the second crossing. He had given the<br />
Prime Minister an undertaking that appropriate<br />
measures would be exercised by the State Government to<br />
control land sub-division and development pending the<br />
completion and adoption of the planning study currently<br />
being undertaken by the Southern Metropolitan Master<br />
Planning Authority. This could probably be achieved<br />
within existing powers, but, if necessary, special<br />
legislation would be introduced.<br />
The Prime Minister and the Premier said that<br />
construction of the second bridge should aid the future<br />
economic and integrated development of the Hobart<br />
metropolitan area and, therefore, it was essential to<br />
warn the public that appropriate control measures, operative<br />
as from today, would be taken to achieve this end. Land<br />
speculators should beware.<br />
The Prime Minister and the Premier said that the<br />
future role of the Tasman Bridge after its restoration to<br />
trafficable conditions was discussed by the Advisory<br />
Committee. It has reported that it was feasible to<br />
widen the bridge to accommodate five ( instead of four)<br />
traffic lanes, and that this work could be completed while<br />
the restoration work was being carried out. The estimated<br />
cost was put at about $ 3 million, and the Prime Minister<br />
had agreed that the Australian Government would meet this<br />
cost. Accordingly, they would ask the Joint Tasman<br />
Bridge Restoration Committee to make arrangements for the<br />
carrying out of this work concurrently with its major task<br />
of bridging the gap. This, they said, would greatly enhance<br />
the carrying capacity of the bridge, particularly during<br />
peak hour. Mr Neilson said that he would be meeting<br />
representatives of affected metropolitan councils in<br />
Hobart within a few days to discuss the report and the<br />
implications for the environment and people of Hobart<br />
arising from the Joint Committee's recommendations.<br />
The Prime Minister and the Premier paid tribute<br />
to the work of the Joint Committee. They said that its task<br />
had been formidable, but, through close co-operation its<br />
members had produced a clear, concise report in a short time.<br />
