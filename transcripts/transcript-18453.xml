Prime Minister Julia Gillard will join leaders and representatives from 52 other countries and four international organisations to participate in the Nuclear Security Summit hosted by the President of the Republic of Korea, Lee Myung-Bak, on 26 and 27 March.</p>
<p>The Seoul Summit will continue international efforts  to address the potential threat of nuclear terrorism, one of the gravest challenges to international security.</p>
<p>This Summit follows the 2010 Summit in Washington, which was the largest gathering of world leaders in the US since the 1945 founding of the United Nations.</p>
<p>The Washington Summit initiated international action in support of President Obama's goal to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials worldwide within four years.</p>
<p>The Seoul Summit will continue the momentum of international cooperation on this important objective and take stock of progress made since 2010.</p>
<p>Australia also has a strong record of achievement on nuclear security, non-proliferation and disarmament, including supporting the introduction of international legally-binding obligations to secure nuclear material and facilities.</p>
<p>In 2008, Australia partnered with Japan to establish and support the independent International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament and then again, in 2010, to establish the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative.</p>
<p>In keeping with the Government's proud record, the Prime Minister will take to the Seoul Summit an assurance that Australia will continue to support the strongest possible measures against the threat of nuclear terrorism.</p>
