    <content><![CDATA[<p>The General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, HE Nong Duc Manh, will visit Australia from 6 to 9 September, accompanied by a high-level delegation. </p>
<p>This visit by Vietnam's senior leader will be an opportunity to discuss how this important relationship can be taken forward.</p>
<p>Vietnam is a highly valued partner for Australia in the Asia-Pacific region. We enjoy a strong bilateral relationship and cooperate closely on the regional and international challenges we face, including counter-narcotics and combating people smuggling and trafficking in persons.</p>
<p>Australia and Vietnam work closely in regional forums, including the East Asia Summit and APEC, and have a shared interest in building a stable and prosperous region.</p>
<p>Vietnam is one of Australia's most dynamic trading partners in South East Asia, with bilateral trade growing an average of 20 per cent per year over the last five years to reach $8 billion in 2008. Australian investment in Vietnam was worth more than $500 million in 2008.</p>
