THE PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
TUESDAY, 12 DECEMBER 1972<br />
PRIME MINISTER Ladies and gentlemen : the first announcement<br />
I wish to make to you is concerning the Interim Australian Schools<br />
Commission about which you will remember I spoke in the government's<br />
policy speech. I will hand out the terms of reference of the Interim<br />
Committee for the Australian Schools Commission, the terms of the<br />
letter sent to each of the persons who have been asked t~ o serve on<br />
the Interim Committee and the list of those persons. All I-need to<br />
say before you ask any questions is that the Chai~ rman<br />
Karmel, whose service in general administrative jrlitki's and<br />
particularly educational matters in South Aust 4ia, Papua New Guinea<br />
and the Commonwealth as a whole is well-known. 0--<br />
On diplomatic relations with China; there has been a further<br />
meeting between the Chinese and the Australian ambassadors in Paris,<br />
this time at the Australian Embassy early this morning Canberra time.<br />
Good progress is being made. I have also received a cordial message<br />
from Prime Minister Chou En-lai.<br />
Our Ambassador to Indonesia has returned to Indonesia. He has<br />
been received by President Suharto. He has given the President the<br />
news about the $ 24-million gift of rice to alleviate the severe<br />
shortage in Indonesia caused by drought. There is a press statement<br />
which will be given to you on that.<br />
At yesterday's Executive Council meeting, there were some<br />
renewals of appointments to what were the Boards? in the<br />
repatriation. field and-the valuation field the No. 1 War Pensions<br />
Entitlement Appeal Tribunal and the Valuation Boards.<br />
The Honorable John Ignatious Armstrong has been appointed our<br />
High Commissioner to Britain as from next Friday for a term ending<br />
at the end of 1974. You will remember he was a Senator for very<br />
many years, he was'Minister for Supply, he was Chairman of the Sydney<br />
County Council, he was Lord Mayor of Sydney. I have let Mr Heath<br />
know that Mr Armstrong's appointment is to symbolise the high<br />
importance that the Australian Labor Party places on links with<br />
Britain, and my own personal desire that those links should be close<br />
ones. Well, those are the thinps I thoug; ht I woiil. d announce first.<br />
IRANK CHAMBERLAIN : Prime Minister, that's ex-Senator Armstrong?<br />
PRIME MINISTER .: Yes.<br />
TONY HILL : Can you give us the terms of the message from Chou En-lai?<br />
PRIME MINISTER : No. I think the terms of messages will be released<br />
when, as we expect shortly will happen, relations are established,<br />
but there is no agreement to release any texts at this stage.<br />
MATTHEWS, MELBOURNE HERALD : Have you any intention of recalling the<br />
Parliament early to give the pensioners an immediate $ 1.50 rise for<br />
a Christmas bonus?<br />
PRIME MINISTER : No, When the ministry is sworn in we will decide<br />
when the Parliament will meet. It is unlikely to be before February. </p>
<p>One of the early pieces of legislation will be to increase th.-<br />
basic pensions by 31.50 per week. I know there has been some<br />
speculation on a Christmas bonus. In fact9 no such proposal<br />
ever made in the policy speech and during the campaign I was v: rr<br />
asl.. cd about it, and I made no commitments on it.<br />
KEVIN POIWER, 2UE: Does your Government propose to re-negotiate<br />
the Fill agreement, Sir. That's the first question, the secc:. d<br />
one do you propose to restore the News and Information Bursau<br />
to full departmental status or will it be incorporated in some<br />
other department such as Media or will it remain with Interior?<br />
MIR. BARNARD: The first one, Kevin, if I may answer it, on the Fl1l<br />
it has not been possible for me, at this stage, to be able to examine<br />
the documents that I would want to look at in relation to the Fll1<br />
purchase. What I did, of course, say during the course of the<br />
ca. mpaign was that it appeared, in view of the large amount of money<br />
that Australia has already paid out for the F111, that we will have<br />
to accept it. But it would not be possible for me, before the full<br />
minisi. ry has been sworn in, to devote my attention to this particular<br />
quest ion.<br />
PRIME MINTSTER: On the I have made no commitment. There<br />
is no current proposal to make the Australian News And Information<br />
Bureau a full department. The Department of which it will form a<br />
part, or the Minister to whom it will be responsible, 4. s being<br />
considered at this time by Mr. Barnard, Senators Murphy and'Willesee<br />
and me in consultation with the departmental heads in preparation<br />
for a recommendation to Caucus next week.<br />
jitjY( PN STOYLES, FINANCIAL REVIEW: In view of what Mr. Crean has been<br />
saying about taxation policy, have you yet made any decision for the<br />
Treasury to publish a " comprehensive review" on taxation levels which<br />
ou promised in your policy speech?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We have been asking Treasury about this. There<br />
have been several papers prepared for the former Government on<br />
taxcatior review. We are working with them on two matters. Firstly,<br />
which are the ones to which Mr. McMahon was referring in answers to<br />
questions in Parliament, and, I think, in answers to members of the<br />
press. Secondly, if these were Cabinet papers then we clearly have<br />
to check with our predecessors whether they mind them being released.<br />
JOH1N LOMBARD, MELBOURNE SUN: Last July you promised rehabilitation<br />
assistance for those who suffered in the name of conscience under the<br />
National Service Act. What form will the rehabilitation assistance<br />
take will it be financial compensation and is compensation being<br />
considered for draft resisters who went underground?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Nothing is being considered at the monent. I can<br />
assure you that Mr. Barnard and I have not considered this matterÃ¸<br />
You mention some statement by me. I do not remember a statement of<br />
this character. At the last Federal Conference of the-Australian<br />
Labor Party in June last ye: r, there was a resolution that this<br />
matter should be considered. I do not remember saying anything about<br />
it. We have not given consideration to it, I did not mention it in<br />
the policy speech. I was not asked about it and I made no statements<br />
about it later in the campaign. This is a matter clearly for the<br />
ministry when it is formed. </p>
<p>MR. BARNARD: Mr. Prime Minister, can I supplement the question<br />
by saying that once again I have not had the opportunity to fully<br />
consider this matter but I have made etnquiries0 I will be having<br />
. discussions later this; afternoon with officers of the department.<br />
LONDON DAILY TELEGRdAPH: Have you any more surprise announcements<br />
for people in Britain?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I wouldn't believe that any Britons taking an<br />
intelligent interest in Australian politics would have had any<br />
surprises to this stage.<br />
BEGG, Have you given any consideration, as yet, to the<br />
redistribution of boundaries?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. Here obviously is a matter which will be<br />
left to the full ministry. I would expect that there will be<br />
legislation amending the Commonwealth Electoral Act as there was<br />
introduced as a Private Members Bill by Mr. Daly in the last<br />
parliament, and a distribution is due but the census upon which a<br />
distribution would be based was held 18 months ago. Western<br />
Australia should have one more seat in this Parliament if a<br />
distribution had been held. There would be a much more equal<br />
representation of thc. people if a distribution had been held, as<br />
it could and should have been, before this recent election.<br />
DAVID SOLOMON, CANBERRA TIMES: Do you expect that there will be any<br />
necessity for another meeting between the Australian and the Chinese<br />
amibassadors in Paris before the matter is finalised?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
FRANK CHAMBERLAIN: Will you be taking any Christmas holidays?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I hope so.<br />
FRANK CHAMBERLAIN: Will you use those holidays to go for a trip to<br />
the Torres Strait Islands with Mr. Bjelke-Petersen?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am very much looking forward to Christmas so I<br />
can have a holiday. I noticed Mr. Bjel~ ke-Petersen's kind off'er.<br />
I had already received some offers. I will be writing to Mr. Bjelke-<br />
Petersen about the Torres. Strait Islands question. which was raised<br />
by the United Nations Visiting Mission to New Guinea in the middle<br />
of last year. I think I am right in saying that this matter had not<br />
been raised by the former Government with the Queensland Government.<br />
I am taking steps to raise it.<br />
ROBERT HAUPT. FINANCIAL REVIEW: It is Dr. Cairns' publicly expressed<br />
view that a final decision has been reached as to the future shape<br />
of' the Trade Department. I understand from your office-that this<br />
is not so. Can you finally tell us whether a decision has been made<br />
over the future status and shape of the department? Can you tell us<br />
under what title Dr. Cairns will be sworn in when he is sworn in? </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No decisions have been made at this stage.<br />
As I said in answer to an earlier question, these are matters<br />
being discussed by Mr. Barnard, Senators Murphy and Willesee and<br />
me in consultation with the heads of departments for a recommendation<br />
to Caucus. Caucus will make the decisions as to what departments<br />
there will be, and then after Caucus has made that decision it will<br />
be my responsibility, if I am re-elected as Leader of the Party,<br />
to allocate the portfolios.<br />
KEVIN POWER: Will you make a recommendation to Caucus on that<br />
partiLcular point?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Among others. There will be recommendations on<br />
the whole departmental structure.<br />
BENNELL, 7 NETWORK: How long do you think it will be before the new<br />
health scheme comes into operation as proposed by the Labor Governement,<br />
and what do you think should be done with the vast reserves that the<br />
health schemes have at the moment?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There are two big items of the health scheme.<br />
One is the question of insurance; how long it takes to implement<br />
the Government's program on this matter will depend on the co-operation<br />
of the medical profession. There is, in addition, a very large part<br />
of the Government's health program relating to hospitals, the<br />
modernisation and regionalisation of hospitals through Commonwealth<br />
grants to the States on the basis of recommendations of a Hospitals<br />
Commission. I would hope that that Hospitals Commission would be in<br />
operation before the end of 1973. There are other features in the<br />
Government's health program such as dental health for school children<br />
which can scarcely get under way in the life of this Parliament because<br />
one just has to train more dental therapists or nurses than Australia<br />
has the hope of getting in less than three years. You asked me about<br />
the reserves of the hospital and medical benefits funds. I think these<br />
reserves amount to somewhere about $ 140 million. This is a sum which<br />
obviously would be appropriate to provide hospital and nursing home<br />
facilities in those parts of Australia where they are very badly<br />
needed. I would hope that arrangements can be made for the-se sums which<br />
have been collected by contributors over the la. st twenty years to<br />
be spend for such proper public health purposes as hospitals and<br />
nursing homes. It will require, naturally, negotiations with the<br />
bodies concerned because they are generally incorporated under State<br />
laws and the registration by the Commonwealth which has enabled them<br />
to flourish and multiply exceedingly didn't provide for the<br />
dissolution of these bodies.<br />
HAWKINS, BRISBANE TELEGRAPH: Is there a possibility, as you have<br />
seen Mr. Tonkin and Mr. Dunstan in the last few days, of asking Mr.<br />
Bjelke-Petersen to come to Canberra before Christmas to talk to you<br />
about this problem rather than you arranging a trip up there?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Mr. Dur~ tan and Mr. Tonkin asked to see me.<br />
If Mr. Bjelke-Petersen asks to see me I am very happy to see him<br />
on this or any other * matter.<br />
BAILEY, ADELAIDE ADV RTISER: Has a date been discussed for a Premiers<br />
Conference? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: No. This is clearly a matter which will have to be<br />
decided by the full ministry. There have been suggestions that, as<br />
usual, there will be a Premiers Conference in February, but this is<br />
not a matter upon which Mr. Barnard and I would make arrangements<br />
alone. D'ARCY, In view of the speculation, could you state at<br />
this stage whether Dr. Stephen FitzGerald is to be Australia's first<br />
ambassador to China, and secondly, have you had any official<br />
communiques about Francis James?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: My answer on an ambassador to China must be the<br />
same as it was a week ago. It is just not possible or proper for<br />
any country to announce who its representative will be in another<br />
country until that other country has been informed and has approved.<br />
This must be the case still more, of course, with a country with<br />
which we don't yet have full diplomatic relations, with which, at<br />
this stage, we are only having discussions. So, I must reiterate<br />
that it would be quite improper to confirm or deny any speculation<br />
on who might be our~ first ambassador to China.<br />
In view of the very many references which are being made to this<br />
question, perhaps I should say that many of you have seen Dr. FitzGerald<br />
in China when you accompanied me and Dr. Patterson and Mr. Burns and<br />
Mr. Young there. 1 think most of you are here. There is Mr. Barnes,<br />
Mr. Oakes, Mr. Walsh, Mr. Stubbs, Mr. Randall, Mr. Barnett and Mr. Koch.<br />
Nearly all of you are in this room. You went to China with us.<br />
You saw Dr. FitzGerald in those isolated circumstances and you would<br />
have noticed his dexterity, his diligence, his decorum. Perhaps<br />
I might add this Dr'. FitzGerald has turned down the opportunity of<br />
taking a prestigious professorial post, a foundation professor, at<br />
Griffith University so that he might be eligible for appointments<br />
by the Commonwealth Government. The Commonwealth Government regards<br />
it as appropriate that there should be academnics or business people<br />
serving the nation in various positions of advice or representation<br />
for periods of 2 or 3 years and we would regard it as appropriate<br />
that public servants, for instance, should be seconded to academic<br />
and commercial positions for similar periods. I don't believe that the<br />
constant speculation about Dr. FitzGerald is fair to him. He can't<br />
say anything on this matter and, I reiterate, I can't either.<br />
D'ARCY, Prime Minister, Francis James, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am sorry. I have sent no message about Mr. Francis<br />
James since taking office.<br />
D'ARCY, Have you heard anything of him, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have heard nothing about him since taking office.<br />
LAUR&amp; IE OAKES, MELB. SUN: Will you send a message, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: When full relations are established then the<br />
Australian Government will be in the normal, proper position to<br />
safeguard the interests of its citizens in China, including Francis<br />
James, </p>
<p>6-<br />
WARREN DUNCAN, Prime Minister, there has been yet another<br />
prediction~ today as to what the level of inemployment will be in the<br />
coming year. How do you see employment over the next 12 months in<br />
Australia? Secondly, when will the monthly figures be released,<br />
and in view of Mr. Cameron's comments about these figures, are you<br />
going to check to make sure they are accurate?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I will ask the Minister for Labour and National<br />
Service to answer this question.<br />
MR. BARNARD: I have asked for information concerning the latest<br />
unemployment figures and I have no knowledge of them myself at this<br />
time but I expect to have some information on them tomorrow. They<br />
would normally be available for publication, that is if one follows<br />
the procedure of the previous administration, they would be available<br />
for publication on Monday next. Whether I at this stage ought to make<br />
any comment, that is after I have received the information, or wait<br />
for the new Minister for Labour and National Service to make the<br />
comment is a matter that I will determine with the Prime Minister.<br />
Matters concerning the levels of unemployment and what we intend to do<br />
about unemployment, of course, I think ought to be more properly<br />
answered by the Prime Minister at this stage.<br />
BOB BAUDINO. NEWS LIMITED: Mr. Barnard, if I might, in his capacity<br />
as Minister for Defence Massive savings have been made by the<br />
abolition of national service, and now of the withdrawal of' our<br />
forces from Vietnam. Could you tell me if those savings will be<br />
diverted elsewhere or do they remain in the defence vote?<br />
MR. BARNARD: I have not discussed this aspect with the Prime Minister.<br />
It is not one of the matters that we thought desirable or necessary<br />
to consider immfediately. Naturally I will have to determine what will<br />
be done, but myoff-the-cuff decision. at this stage would be that<br />
whatever saving is made in this respect would be expended by the<br />
defence forces.<br />
DAVID BARNETTA. A. P.:....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: An old China handa.<br />
DAVID BARNETT: A question to Mr. Barnard. Have you begun to consider<br />
yet the future of the D. D. L. program announced by the last administration?<br />
Have you begun to think yet about what sort of tank the Army should<br />
have, and have you begun to consider also the level of 40,000 men set<br />
by the former Defence Minister as desirable for the Army'?<br />
MR. BARNARD: You have asked three questions. First of all, concerning<br />
the D. D. L. program as you know, action was initiated by the previous<br />
administration, that is, for a * design study to be authorised. I have<br />
made no alteration to that program. It is still proceeding although<br />
this does not, and I want to emnphasise this, it does not necessarily<br />
mean that the present governme~ it or the new government, the next<br />
Whitlam ministry, when it is sworn in, would continue with the program<br />
without looking very closely at it. Now naturally I have not had the<br />
opportunity to fully consider it. The second question, I think, that<br />
you asked was in relation to the tanks. The tanks that we have in<br />
Australia today, the Centurion tanks, are 22 years old. Half of them,<br />
I understand, have been used in Vietnam. Naturally there would be a<br />
need to look very closely and quickly at this question. Yes, I have </p>
<p>-7-<br />
discussed it but no firm decision has been made at this stage.<br />
The final one was on..<br />
DAVID BARNETT: The level of troops, is 40,000 a desirable number<br />
for the Army?<br />
MR. BARNARD: I have, as you know, following the announcement which<br />
I made last week to discontinue the call-up and the discharge of<br />
national servicemen,-and perhaps I can answer your question by<br />
pointing out that what I said at the time apprently appears to have<br />
been borne out by the facts that I have available to me at this time<br />
that about at least 40 per cent of the national servicemen have<br />
elected to remain and continue their service. The precise figures<br />
or the details will not be available to me until the middle of next<br />
week. It could be even higher. Indeed, the report I think I read<br />
in the Melbourne " Age" this morning may be rather closer to the<br />
actual figure, that is about 60 per cent. So far as the level of the<br />
Army is concerned, once the decision. had been made in relation to<br />
national service, the future level of the Army itself is a matter that<br />
I have set down for discussion with the people concerned from the Army<br />
Department early next week.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Gentlemen, you are asking quite a number of questions<br />
about defence. Mr. Barnard and I spent this morning at the passing out<br />
parade and graduation ceremony at Duntroon. You might be interested<br />
in the remark that was made there, that it is the first time that the<br />
whole Commonwealth4 Ministry has attended such a ceremony and it is the<br />
first ministry which is entirely composed of returned servicemen.<br />
TED BARKER, " WEST AUSTRALIAN": Prime Minister, could you tell us<br />
ihat plans you have for the terrirotial sea legislation? Do you<br />
intend to press ahead with it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
BARKER: Anything else?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. The Labor Partyls policy is, as you know, to<br />
assert the national government's jurisdiction over the territorial<br />
sea beyond low water mark and I expect that, in opening this Parliament,<br />
the Governor-General will use the same words as he used in opening<br />
the last Parliament.<br />
MUNGO McCALLUM: Sir, do you think you can get that through in time<br />
for the Law of the Sea Conference?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
LAURIE OAKES, " MELBOURNE SUN": Prime Minislar, you told us a week<br />
ago that the interim two-man government was set up to deal with<br />
urgent matters. I am wondering, since we already had an acting<br />
High Commissioner in London, what was urgent about appointing a<br />
permanent High Commissioner? Secondly, while I am aware of Dr.<br />
FitzGerald's qualifications for a diplomatic nost, I am not aware<br />
of Mr. Armstrong ' s qualifications. Could you explain that to me,<br />
what experience he has had? And, thirdly, do you anticipate any<br />
criticism based or. allegations of jobs for the boys and if it should<br />
occur, how would you answer it? </p>
<p>-8-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have been urged by the Foreign AffE: irs Department<br />
to make this appointment promptly because there has already been an<br />
embarrassing hiatus in the post. You will remember that the former<br />
High Commissioner, Sir Alexander Downer, had had his term of office<br />
extended sevvral times and finally he would not accept another<br />
extension., and the whole staffing of the office, such as the<br />
appointment of a Deputy High Commissioner and-so on, awaits the filling<br />
of the main post. The post has always been one of what is called a<br />
political nature, and this has the advantage, it has been said over<br />
the years, that the person holding the post has the ear of the<br />
government of Australia. There are some matters, as you know, where<br />
the new government of Australia has found that it had to vote in a<br />
different way to Britain in the United Nations. There are a ntumber<br />
of issues whiich have arisen in Britain concerning the position of<br />
Australian citizens visiting, settling or working in Britain. Clearly<br />
it is an embarrassment to have this post, the first diplomatic post<br />
that Australia ever set up, vacant any longer. As I said earlier,<br />
Mr. Armstrong is a public figure of long ' service and great distinction<br />
in several fields and his appointment will be understood by the British<br />
Government as one showing that the Australian Labor Party regards the<br />
post as important and that I regard the post as important.<br />
BROWN, COURIER MAIL: Sir, could you clear up the Torres Strait<br />
issue, please? Do you plan to confer with Mr. Bjelke-Petersen eitherhere<br />
or in Brisbane in the near future, and do you plan to take up<br />
his invitation to go to the Torres Strait Islands?<br />
Could I ask a second question on a slightly different subject?<br />
Why is the Schools Commission interim at this stage? Interim is<br />
until when?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Torres Strait Islands first I only know of<br />
Mr. Bjelke-Petersen's invitation. from reading the newspapers.<br />
I don't think I have received a letter from him conveying such<br />
an invitation. I am writing a letter to him. I would not think<br />
that a meeting between us is necessary at this stage to discuss<br />
the question. The discussions which may take place will be made<br />
easier if there are appropriate arrangements between officials in<br />
advance. But I would rather wait till I have written the letter to<br />
Mr. Bjelke-Petersen before saying anything-more on this matter. I<br />
did say something last week about it, I am not sure that I mentioned<br />
last week, as I did today, that the United Nations Visiting Mission<br />
to New Guinea had raised this matter at least 18 months ago.<br />
Furthermore, there has been the successful conclusion of an agreement<br />
between Australia and Indonesia concerning the sea boundary between<br />
them. One would expect that similar negotiations would now take<br />
place with Portugal as regards Timor and then also there are to be<br />
negotiations which will concern Papua New Guinea herself concerning<br />
the land and sea border with Indonesia. In these circumstances it<br />
is desirable to have a consistent border, a contemporary border<br />
between Papua, which is still an Australian colony but which will<br />
soon be part of an independent nation, and Australia. This is much<br />
more amicably settled while the Australian government has jurisdiction<br />
on each side of Torres Strait than it will be if we wait until Papua<br />
New Guinea gets independence and the matter has to ) e determined, say,<br />
by the International Court of Justice. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
BROWN: The plan on that is for officials to discuss it first?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, as I say, I iuant to write a letter before<br />
I say any more about this. You also asked about the Schools<br />
Commission. The reason for having an. interim committee is, as I said<br />
in the policy speech and as I had said I think in Parliament but<br />
ce rtainly I had said at public meetings well before the election<br />
campaign opened, we wanted to follow the procedure that Sir Robert<br />
Menzies had followed in regard to the Commonwealth's peace-time<br />
commitment for universities. Just as Sir Keith Murray and some<br />
other prominent educationists were asked to make a report on<br />
universities and that report was adopted in the next Common-ealth<br />
Budget and was then followed by legislation establishing the<br />
Australian Universities Commission, so, as I said in the policy<br />
speech and in these earlier public meetings, we would write to<br />
educationists in this field to make a report in good time for our<br />
next Budget and then we would set up a standing commission by statute.<br />
I did say I would write before Christmas, and I might also add t1Xit<br />
Mr. Beazley has spent a great deal of time with the people concerned<br />
and the Department of Education. and Science and some of the A. U. C.<br />
in the terms of reference and the personnel. We discussed these<br />
first last Wednesday or Thursday.<br />
DAVID SOLOMON: Have they all accepted?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
ALAN RAMSEY, " THE AUSTRALIAN": Prime Minister, it appears you are<br />
going to have another national strike on your hands. The tanker<br />
drivers are going nut. Can you tell me whether you have had discussions<br />
with Mr. Cameron about this?<br />
PRIM MINISTER: No.<br />
RAMSEY: Any suggestion. that the government might intervene in this<br />
strike, and what is your comment on suggestions that industrial<br />
activity has been delayed, in support of pay claims, has been delayed<br />
until after the elections so it would not hurt your party's prospects<br />
at the elections?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have no comment to make on the last. I have not<br />
been in touch with Mr. Cameron on this. I have no doubt that he has<br />
the matter well in hand.<br />
STEWART HARRIS, ". LONDON TIMES": Sir, I know you don't normally give<br />
away what goes on in-negotiations, but I think perhaps a lot of people<br />
would like to know whethqr the matter' of-Francis James was raised with<br />
the Chinese in Paris by Mr. Renouf.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
PETER BARRON. " SYDNEY SUN": Mr. Whitlai, on the question of the<br />
health funds' reserves, Mr. Hayden was quoted in the press this<br />
morning as saying these reserves could be used to provide free<br />
health insurance for contributors to the funds or perhaps to pay the<br />
benefits to the contributors. Can we take it from your answer<br />
earlier this afternoon that you have dismissed that idea? Do you<br />
believe, as Mr. Hayden is quoted as saying this morning, that those<br />
reserve# belong to the contributors?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Of course they do. </p>
<p>I r </p>
<p>BARRON: And is it correct that if the funds decide not to co-operate,<br />
the Common' 4ealth can do very little about the reserves that they have<br />

PRIME MINISTER: Of course these funds belong to the contributors<br />
in every moral sense. A great number of these funds have lasted<br />
for a long time. They are benevolent associations, co-obps, in the<br />
very best sense. These are the closed funds and I have no doubt that<br />
those bodies will do the right thin~ g by their members. As you know,<br />
however, the funds which have grown most rapidly in the last 20 years<br />
since the Commonwealth decided to register the funds anc. to make them<br />
the vehicle for any help in paying doctors' and hospital. bills, these<br />
funds are run by very small bodies. Ths most notorious of them is run<br />
by a council composed of doctors and laymen nominated by those doctors,<br />
and the annual meeting is never notified and the contributors have no<br />
right to attend it. And there are other similar demtocratic examples.<br />
I think it is right, but Mr. Hayden really is much more au fait with<br />
these than I have been in the last Parliament, that the reserves have<br />
been run down a bit in the case of the medical funds, I think it was,<br />
as a result of the Nimmo Committee's recommendations. It was said<br />
that reserves should not be held for more than about three months.<br />
I think the reserves were larger a year ago than they are now,<br />
It would be possible to run down the reserves in that way. If it<br />
were found th.-these autocracies running the l. arge open funds were<br />
not to devote these resEerves to proper public purposes such as I have<br />
suggested, then the government wou'ld rely on the co-operation of the<br />
States to see that the contributors' funds were properly safeguarded<br />
and properly directed.<br />
Ladies and gentlement, perhaps there are a couple of things I might<br />
have mentioned. We expect quite quickly to ratify the Treaty on the<br />
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Treaty on the Prohibition<br />
of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and other Weapons of Mass<br />
Destruction on the Seabed and the Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil<br />
Thereof. Those two nuclear treaties have been signed by Australia.<br />
We will be ratifying them quite soon. At yesterday's Executive<br />
Council meeting we took the proper procedures to enable us to sign,<br />
as Britain and New Zealand signed, I think four years ago, the<br />
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and<br />
the International Covenent on Civil and. Political Rights. These<br />
have been outstanding for a long time. There will also be steps to<br />
ratify fairly soon, before Parliament meets we hope,. three I. L. O.<br />
conventions No, 87 Freedom of Association and Protection of the<br />
Right to Organtise; No, 98 Right to Organise and Collective<br />
Bargaining; No. 100 Equal Pay; and No, 111 the Elimination<br />
of all Forms of Discrimination in Employment. We are taking<br />
legislative means to enable us to ratify the International Convention<br />
on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. It would<br />
be our hope to ratify all these human rights conventions by the<br />
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which falls<br />
on 10 December next, year, and upon which I made a statement two days<br />
agoo Might I conclude by mentioning that at the press conference<br />
I had on Sunday week I referred to the fact that it was not only the<br />
anniversary of Eureka bu the first Sunday in Advent. I have been<br />
helped by the officer of the Prime Minister's Department who covers </p>
<p>-11-<br />
the question of horours and decorations and also by a letter<br />
from the priest who performed the marriage ceremony for my son that<br />
on the first Sunday in Advent the epistle of the day, and you might<br />
be interested in the reference, Epistle to the Romans, Chapter 13,<br />
verses 11 and folluw, ( This is the Jerusalem Bible, translation)<br />
read: " The time has come. Our salvation is near. Besides you<br />
know the time has come. You must wake up now. Our<br />
salvation is even nearer than it was when we were converted.<br />
The night is almost over. It will be daylight soon." </p>
