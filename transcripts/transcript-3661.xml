VICTORIAN AL. P. CONFERENCE<br />
NATIONAL SCIENCE CENTRE, PARKSVILLE,<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR WHITLAM,<br />
SUNDAY, 23 MARCH, 1975.<br />
THE CONTINUING LEADERSHIP CRISIS IN THE LIBERAL<br />
PARTY IS NOW IN ITS NINTH YEAR/ THERE IS NO REASON TO<br />
BELIEVE THAT. LAST FRIDAY'S DECISION HAS REALLY SETTLED<br />
ANYTHINGx THE WAR OF THE LIBERAL SUCCESSION HAS BECOME<br />
WAR BY ATTRITIONX THERE MAY BE, AFTER THE MELODRAMA OF<br />
THE LAST FORTNIGHT, A PERIOD OF TEMPORARY TRUCE, BUT IT<br />
WILL BE ONLY THE PEACE OF EXHAUSTIONX FOR THE FACT<br />
REMAINS THAT IN ALL THOSE NINE YEARS OF STRUGGLE AND<br />
BLOOD-LETTING, IN ALL THOSE SEVEN CONTESTS INVOLVING<br />
CHALLENGES TO THE LEADERSHIP, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A REAL<br />
DEBATE ABOUT ISSUES, ABOUT THE DIRECTION THE LIBERAL<br />
PARTY SHOULD TAKE OR ABOUT THE DIRECTION IT WANTS<br />
AUSTRALIA TO TAKEX<br />
THE MOST DEPRESSING ASPECT OF THE CRISIS IN THE<br />
LIBERAL PARTY HAS BEEN, AND REMAINS, THE FUNDAMENTAL<br />
TRIVIALITY OF THE TERMS IN WHICH THE DEBATE HAS BEEN<br />
CONDUCTEDX NONE OF THE PROTAGONISTS S: EM TO BE AWARE<br />
THAT A CHANGE IN PARTY LEADERSHIP HAS DEEP IMPLICATIONS<br />
FOR THE DIRECTION THAT PARTY WILL TAKEX AND THIS IS HOW<br />
IT HAS BEEN FOR NEARLY A DECADEX </p>
<p>-2-<br />
THE DESTRUCTION OF SO MANY LIBERAL LEADERS GOES<br />
DEEPER THAN THE MERE CONFLICT OF PERSONALITIES AND<br />
PERSONAL AMBITIONS, PRETTY SAVAGE AS THAT HAS BEEN; IT<br />
HAS BEEN A DIRECT RESULT OF THE SHEER NEGATIVISM OF THE<br />
LIBERAL PARTY&gt; THE<br />
EXCRUCIATING BARRENESS OF THE LIBERAL APPROACH HAS BEEN<br />
PAINFULLY EXPOSED IN THE PAST TWO YEARS)<br />
WHEN THE APPARATUS OF GOVERNMENT WAS TAKEN AWAY AFTER<br />
23 YEARS, THE LIBERALS HAD PRECIOUS LITTLE TO SAY OR TO<br />
DO) YOU REMEMBER THAT WHEN THEY FORCED ON THE. MAY<br />
ELECTIONS THEY TOOK A WEEK OFF TO DEVISE POLICIES FOR<br />
THE ELECTION) WE'VE HEARD NOTHING OF THEM SINCEX ALL<br />
WE HAD WAS A PRE-OCCUPATION WITH TACTICS ELECTORAL<br />
TACTICS, PARLIAMENTARY TACTICS AND ABOVE ALL, ULTIMATELY<br />
FATAL TO BILL SNEDDEN, PARTY TACTICSy AND IN THIS SENSE<br />
BILL SNEDDEN HAS BEEN A VICTIM-OF LIBERAL PARTY NEGATIVENESSA<br />
THE ABSORPTION WITH TACTICS, THE DELIBERATE DAMAGING<br />
CREATION OF ELECTION HYSTERIA, INEVITABLY MEANT A PRE-OCCUPATION<br />
WITH PERSONALITIES RATHER THAN POLICIES, PERSONAL<br />
CONFRONTATION RATHER THAN DEVELOPMENT OF RELEVANT POLICIESx<br />
YOU HEAR A GREAT DEAL OF TALK ABOUT PARLIAMENTARY<br />
PERFORMANCESX OF COURSE, THAT IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF<br />
POLITICS IN A PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEMx IT IS A TEST, A VALID<br />
TEST OF LEADERSHIP BUT IT IS ONLY ONE OF MANYX BUT IN<br />
THEIR SELF-CREATED OBSESSION WITH ELECTIONS, THE LIBERALS<br />
TOOK A SINGLE POOR PERFORMANCE IN PARLIAMENT AS A CATASTROPHE) </p>
<p>-3-<br />
BECAUSE THERE IS NO ESSENTIAL UNDERPINNING OF A<br />
POLICY, OF A PHILOSOPHY, OF ANYTHING THAT COULD BE<br />
DESCRIBED AS A WELL MOTIVATED, PURPOSEFUL PARTY,<br />
PERSONALITIES HAVE BECOME EVERYTHING TO THE LIBERALSX<br />
THE THREAT OF USING THE SENATE TO FORCE OUT THE<br />
ELECTED GOVERNMENT TO FALSIFY DEMOCRACY ONCE AGAIN<br />
WAS AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE US LOSE OUR NERVE; ALL THAT HAS<br />
HAPPENED IS THAT THE LIBERALS HAVE LOST THEIR HEADx<br />
I NOTE THAT MR FRASER HAS STATED THE CORRECT DEMOCRATIC<br />
PRINCIPLE THAT A GOVERNMENT SUSTAINED BY A COMFORTABLE<br />
AND ASSURED MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, THE<br />
PEOPLE'S HOUSE, SHOULD RUN THE FULL TERM FOR WHICH IT<br />
WAS ELECTEDX TRUE, HE QUALIFIES THIS SOMEWHAT BY CURIOUS<br />
REFERENCES TO CATCHING ME WITH MY PANTS DOWNX I'M SURE I<br />
DON'T KNOW WHAT HE MEANSX<br />
THE PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO INSIST THAT MR FRASER<br />
STICKS TO HIS ORIGINAL UNDERTAKING HIS FIRST PROMISE. AS<br />
LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION THAT THE DECISION THE PEOPLE<br />
MADE LAST MAY WILL BE ADHERED TOx AFTER ALL, IT IS MY<br />
PREROGATIVE AS PRIME MINISTER TO ADVISE THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL<br />
WHEN, AND ON WHAT GROUNDS, AN ELECTION WILL BE CALLEDx<br />
4 </p>
<p>IF I WERE ABSORBED IN THE BATTLE OF PARLIAMENTARY AND<br />
ELECTORAL TACTICS I COULD CALL ONE NOW,( I HAVE EVERY<br />
GROUNDJ FOR ITx I ALREADY HAVE THE GROUNDS FOR A DOUBLE<br />
DISSOLUTION I COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE. PRESENT<br />
DISARRAY OF THE LIBERAL PARTY&amp; I COULD BE AS-FULLY<br />
JUSTIFIED IN THAT COURSE AS SIR ROBERT MENZIES WAS IN 1955,<br />
BARELY A YEAR AFTER THE 1954 ELECTIONSA I FORBEARA THE<br />
SMASHING ADVANTAGE WE WOULD HAVE COULD NOT JUSTIFY THE<br />
DAMAGE YET ANOTHER INTERRUPTION A SUSPENSIOR OF THE PROPER<br />
BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT FOR THREE OR FOUR MONTHS WOULD DOA<br />
WHAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN IS WHETHER MR FRASER WAS REALLY<br />
STATING A PRINCIPLE OR AN EXPEDIENTA. FOR IN HIS SITUATION<br />
IT IS CERTAINLY NO SACRIFICE ON HIS PART TO ABJURE AN EARLY<br />
ELECTIONx, THE REAL TEST OF HIS CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES<br />
IS YET TO COMEX<br />
AND OF COURSE ALL HIS REAL TESTS ARE YET TO COME,<br />
FOR A MAN WHO HAS BEEN IN PARLIAMENT 20 YEARS, MR FRASER<br />
IS CURIOUSLY UNKNOWN. A THERE IS NOBODY SO PROMINENT IN<br />
PUBLIC LIFE WHOSE STANCE ON THE WIDER RANGE OF ISSUES IS<br />
SUCH AN ENIGMAL ONLY JOHN GORTON CLAIMS TO KNOW WHAT HE<br />
REALLY STANDS FOR$ e </p>
<p>BUT HIS CRUCIAL TESTS IN THI IMMEDIATE FUTURE ARE<br />
THESE:-HIS ATTITUDE TO SENATE OBSTRUCTION<br />
HIS RELATIONS WITH THE COUNTRY PARTY<br />
( REDISTRIBUTION)<br />
HIS ATTITUDE TO THE IRRESPONSIBILITY<br />
AND SOCIAL SABOTAGE OF THE ANTI-LABOR<br />
STATES. ( VIC, CHALLENGE MEDIBANK)<br />
THESE THREE MATTERS ARE CLOSELY CONNECTEDK AFTER<br />
ALL, ONE OF THE FUSES WHICH SET OFF LAST WEEK'S EXPLOSION<br />
WAS MR ANTHONY'S THREAT TO BLOCK MEDIBANK IN THE SENATE
AND THE REFUSAL OF THE ANTI-LABOR STATES TO CO-OPERATE IN<br />
MAKING MEDIBANK WORK RAISES A GREAT NATIONAL ISSUE WHICH,<br />
HAD WE BEEN FORCED INTO IT, WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY<br />
PREPARED TO FIGHT ON FOR THE FOURTH TIMEX<br />
MR FRASER HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT MEDIBANK IS THE LAW<br />
OF THE LAND AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE RIGHT TO BE ABLE<br />
TO APPLY THE LAW AND COMPLY WITH ITA BUT HIS GESTURE IS<br />
MEANINGLESS UNLESS HE IS PREPARED TO USE HIS INFLUENCE ON<br />
HIS COLLEAGUES IN THE NON-LABOR STATES TO GET THEM TO STOP<br />
SHILLY-SHALLYING AND TO STOP PLAYING AR) UND WITH THE HEALTH<br />
AND WELL-BEING OF THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLEX a </p>
<p>THE VICTORIAN PREMIER AND THE VICTORIAN MINISTER<br />
FOR HEALTH, MR SCANLAN, NOW PLEAD FOR MORE TIMES<br />
WHAT ARE THE FACTS?<br />
THERE WERE INITIAL MEETINGS BETWEEN BILL HAYDEN AND<br />
THE VICTORIAN HEALTH MINISTER ON MEDIBANK IN OCTOBER AND<br />
NOVEMBER 1973. y,<br />
I WROTE TO MR HlAMER ON 15 AUGUST, 1974 SETTING OUT<br />
OUR PROPOSALS)( SAID:<br />
" NOW THAT THE HEALTH INSURANCE ACT HAS BEEN PASSED<br />
BY THE AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT, I AM NOW IN A POSITION* TO<br />
PUT TO YOUR GOVERNMENT A FIRM PROPOSAL FOR AN AGREEMENT<br />
WITH my GOVERNMENT CONCERNING THE PROVISION OF HOSPITAL<br />
SERVICES AND THE FINANCING OF PUBLIC HOSPITAL OPERATING COSTSA<br />
THE OBJECTIVES OF THE AGREEMENTS WILL BE TO'<br />
ENSURE THAT EVERY PERSON HAS ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE HOSPITAL<br />
CARE, INCLUDING MEDICAL TREATMENT, PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE<br />
IN STANDARD BEDS OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS IN A WAY THAT WILL NOT<br />
PLACE ANY IMPEDIMENT IN THE WAY OF PERSONS BEING ABLE TO<br />
SEEK PRIVATE TREATMENT-IN PUBLIC HOSPITALS, IF. THEY SO WISHX<br />
_ F_ </p>
<p>-7-<br />
" to Tills END, TI1E TI:. a1; () 17 [ HiE AGREIMEIIf S WILL VISUALISE<br />
TIlE REMOVAL, WHERE APPLICABLE, OF MEANS TESTS WHICH<br />
DECIDE ELIGIBILITY FOR ADMISSION TO STANDARD BED PUBLIC<br />
HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION AND TREATMENT; ABOLITION OF STANDARD<br />
WARD FEES; THE PROVISION OF FREE MEDICAL SERVICES TO<br />
HOSPITAL PATIENTS; THE METHOD OF PAYMENT OF DOCTORS<br />
PROVIDING MEDICAL SERVICES TO HOSPITAL PATIENTS AND THE<br />
SETTING OF SPECIFIED FEES TO BE CHARGED FOR CERTAIN CATEGORIES<br />
OF INPATIENTSI " FOR ITS PART, THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WILL UNDERTAKE<br />
TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO BOTH INDIVIDUAL HOSPITALS AND STATE PUBLIC<br />
HOSPITAL AUTHORITIES WHICH WOULD AMOUNT TO 50% OF THE NET<br />
OPERATING COSTS OF THE PUBLIC HOSPITALS IN THE STATES"<br />
I RECEIVED AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT4 ON 5 SEPTEMBER BILL<br />
HAYDEN WROTE TO MR SCANLAN SETTING OUT THE MATTERS TO BE<br />
SORTED OUT AT THE OFFICIAL LEVELf,<br />
ON 2 DECEMBER I WROTE AGAIN TO MR HAMER SEEKING AN<br />
EARLY DECLARATION OF THE VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT'S ATTITUDE,( </p>
<p>-8-<br />
ON 12 DECEMBER MY DEPARTMENT RECEIVED AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT<br />
FROM THE SECRETARY OF THE PREMIER'S DEPARTMENT(<br />
AND ON FRIDAY ( 21 MARCH 1975) I AT LAST RECEIVED A<br />
REPLY FROM MR HAMER SAYING,'" MR SCANLAN IS SEEKING EARLY<br />
DISCUSSIONS WITH MR HAYDEN TO CLARIFY THE OUTSTANDING ISSUES.",<br />
THAT'S HOW HAMER MAKES THINGS HAPPEN&amp; 9/, </p>
<p>-9-<br />
WE ARE ALSO ENTITLED TO KNOW MR FRASER'S ATTITUDE<br />
TO THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF THE VICTORIAN CHALLENGE IN<br />
THE HIGH COURT TO THE VALIDITY OF THE AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE<br />
PLANX THERE ARE 57 PROGRAMS IMPERILED BY THIS CHALLENGE<br />
SOME OF THEM INITIATED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF WHICH MR FRASER<br />
WAS A MEMBERK THE POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS CHALLENGE<br />
IS THAT IT IS ONE OF THE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE VERY RAPID<br />
SHIFT TO THE RIGHT, THE SHIFT TOWARDS REACTION WHICH IS<br />
TAKING PLACE IN THE LIBERAL PARTY, NOT LEAST HERE IN VICTORIAK<br />
MR FRASER'S STANCE ON THIS MATTER NOT JUST THE CHALLENGE<br />
BUT ON ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR WEAKENING THE NATION'S WELFARE<br />
SYSTEM WILL BE A CRITICAL TEST ABOUT WHERE HE REALLY<br />
WANTS TO TAKE HIS PARTYK </p>
<p>JUST AS CRUCIAL FOR TIE FUTURE ( O THE LIBERAL PARTY<br />
WILL BE MR FRASER'S ATTITUDE TO OUR FIGHT FOR EOUAL<br />
ELECTORATES THAT TIIE VOTE OF EACH AUSTRALIAN WILL HAVE<br />
EQUAL WORTH WHEREVER HE OR SHE LIVES.<br />
ONE OF THE REAL SIGNIFICANT RESULTS OF LAST FRIDAY'S<br />
DECISION WAS TO REDUCE TO ALMOST NOTHING THE REPRESENTATION<br />
OF METROPOLITAN ELECTORATES AT THE LEADERSHIP LEVEL OF THE<br />
COALITION IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. OF THE FOUR<br />
ONLY MR LYNCH NOW REPRESENTS SUCH AN AREA. So I DON'T SEE<br />
MUCH REASON TO MODIFY THE STATEMENT THAT METROPOLITAN<br />
REPRESENTATION THE EFFECTIVE VOICE OF AREAS TYPICAL OF<br />
WHERE MOST AUSTRALIANS LIVE HAS BEEN REDUCED TO ALMOST<br />
NOTHING. 11/ </p>
<p>-11.-<br />
MR SNEDDEN LEIT OFFICE ON FRIDAY AND HE DID IT<br />
WITH ADMIRABLE GRACE SAYING THAT THE LIBERAL PARTY " HAD<br />
ENTERED A NEW ERA", t THERE IS CERTAINLY A FAIR AMOUNT OF<br />
AMBIGUITY IN THAT MR GORTON OBVIOUSLY AGREES THAT IT IS<br />
A NEW ERA FOR THE LIBERAL PARTY AND IT IS ONE'IN WHICH HE<br />
DOES NOT WANT TO TAKE PART, WHATEVER IT MEANS FOR WHAT IS<br />
LEFT OF THE LIBERAL PARTY, IT DOES MEAN FOR THE LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENT AND THE LABOR PARTY AT ALL LEVELS, A GOOD<br />
OPPORTUNITY TO GET ON WITH THE JOB FOR WHICH WE HAVE BEEN<br />
TWICE ELECTED, TO GET ON WITH THE BUSINESS OF IMPLEMENTING<br />
THE PROGRAM WHICH THE PEOPLE HAVE TWICE ENDORSED AND TO<br />
CONTINUE THE JOB OF DEVELOPING FURTHER POLICIES TO ENSURE<br />
YET ANOTHER TRIUMPH FOR OUR CAUSE AT THE NEXT ELECTIONSV </p>
