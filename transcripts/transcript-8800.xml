STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DR HEWSON'S TAX PHILOSOPHY<br />
The essential point which emerges from the taxation<br />
material aired in Christ ne Wallace's biography Is Dr<br />
Hewson's philosophy towards taxation.<br />
Taxation is the issue which Dr Hewson has made the<br />
centrepiore of his policy tor Government.<br />
Dr Hewson's QW would make tax unavoidable for the<br />
unemployed and the low paid who have to spend 100 per<br />
cent of their income by taxing their expenditure.<br />
Apparently he believes that the expenditure of the low<br />
paid should be fully taxed, but the income of the highly<br />
paid should be open to tax minimisatlon.<br />
Apparently in Dr Heweon's case it is okay to pass oft as<br />
a business expense the normal costs of domestic housing.<br />
If Dr Hewson confirms the suggestion In the Wallace book<br />
that he pretended a domestic and personal expense was a<br />
business expense, for the purposes of tax minimisation,<br />
legitimate question8 arise about his approach to taxation<br />
end social equity.<br />
His message to Australia is that In tax matters " you' 11<br />
pay as I tell you through a GST", but with income tax<br />
" you'll pay only as needs be, upon advice from a tax<br />
accountant." The message seems to be that if you can afford elaborate<br />
tax advice you can minimise tax, but if you are a wage<br />
and salary earner you'll pay on Virtually everything you<br />
consume and every service you use.<br />
