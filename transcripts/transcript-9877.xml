Now, this election coming up is going to be about what sort of country we are,<br />
what we have become and where we want to be, And you know what the<br />
Government has been doing now for ten years opening Australia up, we<br />
have been seeking to looking for these things, opportunities and equity at<br />
home and enterprise abroad. And we're now going out to the world as we<br />
have perhaps never done before, but not only are we going out there, we're<br />
actually putting into place the structures that will receive us. When I came<br />
back from Osaka a couple of weeks ago, Australia was a part of by the<br />
adoption of that Action Plan the largest free-trade agreement in the world,<br />
and will be an integrated part of the largest whole of any economic<br />
organisation in the world. We are now an integrated member, and we will be<br />
when we get our action plans adopted next year, of a body which is<br />
responsible for the production of 63% of the world's GDP and half the world's<br />
population. So, it's larger than any other body the European Union, or<br />
NAFTA or any other economic grouping. And we're not just sitting on the<br />
outside looking at it, we are an integral part of it. And that's been done by a<br />
Labor Government that had the vision and the wit, and the belief that not only<br />
were we good enough to be in it and to participate in to, but we were open,<br />
stripped down, competitive and ready to be in it, and we have then put the<br />
organisation together so Australia has that sort of place in the world.<br />
Now, these sorts of changes and going out there as a community proud of<br />
what its done, proud of itself, clear about who it is, strong about its culture<br />
it's why I believe that in the end, we can't approach the community around us,<br />
or be an integral part of it as we would like to be, by saying here we are a<br />
unique country, proudly Australian, but by the way, our head of state is the<br />
Monarch of Great Britain. It might have worked for us in the past, it won't<br />
work for us any more. It's why the change to an Australian republic is not </p>
<p>TEL 2<br />
simply an important thing for our identity and our culture, an affirmation of<br />
what it is to be an Australian, but rather as well that it's going to be part of<br />
better economic integration of Australia in the Asia Pacific, as a consequence<br />
of this. And I don't * have any time for John Howard's view he says " oh, I'm a<br />
traditionalist, I believe in the Monarchy". What he is saying is no Australian<br />
is good enough or smart enough to be our head of state. That's what it really<br />
means down in a nutshell, what it really means is that he believes someone<br />
with a hereditary title can be and should be head of Australia, our head of<br />
state, can best perform the responsibilities of head of state, rather than any<br />
one of us. Any one of us, And that's a terrible indictment I think on a country<br />
such as this.<br />
An indictment of a view that I believe he has on a country with such promise,<br />
and such vitality, and such individuality as Australia has. So, it's going to be<br />
about these things about who has faith in Australians, and who believes in<br />
us as a society. Who will back Australians in. Who knows they can do all<br />
the smart things that any other country can do, and has the confidence to let<br />
them go and do it, and build the structures within which they can do it. These<br />
are the things that I think Australia needs now, and not a trip down the time<br />
tunnel of s ome derivative society that believes that as he said in his foreign<br />
policy speech we have let the US Alliance go. As if the United States<br />
Government wants another mendicant state turning up saying oh, will you<br />
please protect us? What they want are allies that can stand on their feet and<br />
make structures that actually help them, as well as ourselves, in the<br />
management of world issues, world trade issues etc. And that's the sort of<br />
ally I believe Bill Clinton wants not someone with their hand out looking for<br />
some gifts strategic client status some gifting from the United States. And<br />
that's why, again, it gets back to whether you have faith in yourselves,<br />
ourselves, to relate to the old societies around us, to find our place in the<br />
world, to feel comfortable here, and to become part of the community of<br />
nations here. Or whether we say, look, we want security from Asia, rather<br />
than security in Asia, because that's John Howard's message he wants<br />
security from Asia, not security in Asia. The Government is after security in<br />
Asia, he wants security from Asia. And when he said in his speech that<br />
defence capabilities and defence collaboration and all of these things, good<br />
though they may be, present at once an opportunity, but on the other hand,<br />
an issue of conflict. That is, whether it will actually help us protect ourselves.<br />
In other words, our friends in Asia might be our enemies in Asia, and we<br />
should be wary of them, and that's why we need to keep our bet covered by<br />
this sort of unreconstructed, if you like, alliance with the United States.<br />
Now, that's not the way we will prosper. We will prosper in this country with<br />
security in Asia, not from Asia, because 18 million of us occupying this huge<br />
continent, but holding it in fear of the neighbourhood around us is, I think, for<br />
us untenable. But that's essentially his view. Now, he's doing a statement on<br />
Wednesday about what he calls identity and these things. But all of it will be<br />
covering his tracks, about what he really thinks. He says " I'll give you a<br />
republic, too but at that referendum, I will actually be voting for the<br />
Monarchy". Now, to get a republic referendum through, you have got to get a<br />
majority of electors in a majority of States, and if the Government isn't going<br />

flat out for it absolutely flat out for it there is no chance of it succeeding.<br />
Imagine what chance you would win with the Prime Minister running around<br />
saying " well, we have got a republic referendum on, but actually, I'm in favour<br />
of the Monarchy". Now, this is his proposal. You see, because basically, his<br />
whole world started at Whitehall, and finishes at Pennsylvania Avenue.<br />
That's his view of the world, and the fact that we are here is just a sort of<br />
inconvenience you know, likes the country, but doesn't like the location.<br />
Likes the house, but doesn't like the neighbourhood. And I just can't see how<br />
there is any profit in Australians supporting that sort of view. And the other<br />
things, I think, are going to be important too. And that is, the things that<br />
underpin our society, like a decent social safety net, or Medicare, or a fair<br />
industrial relations system, or superannuation. He's saying now after saying<br />
for years Medicare, we are going to rip it up, we're going to go back to before<br />
Medibank, bulk billing is a rort, and we are going to make deep cuts in<br />
Government expenditure, and talking about a structural surplus in their first<br />
year, which implies cuts of $ 9-10 billion, he's now saying ' oh, no I don't<br />
believe any of that any more". He now says he is in favour of Medicare, of a<br />
decent social safety net, fair industrial relations. Well, as I have said to other<br />
audiences don't believe him. He doesn't mean it. What he means, is what<br />
he said for so long. And when he goes around the country saying " people<br />
know what I stand for I have been around for a long time in public life, they<br />
know what my values are, they know what I stand for Yes they know what<br />
he stands for ripping Medicare up, pulling the social wage apart, running on<br />
a contract basis with no protection no Award protection's in the industrial<br />
arena. These are the things which he believes in, and also cutting back<br />
Government spending in important services.<br />
ends. </p>
