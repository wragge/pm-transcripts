Young Australians will be given help to achieve their education, community and sporting goals, through the creation of new scholarships in honour of Jim Stynes.</p>
<p>Jim Stynes was a man who inspired AFL fans across the nation. But off the football field, Jim was also a man who fought for a better life for thousands of Australian kids.</p>
<p>Today we honour that legacy, with the creation of the Jim Stynes Achievement Scholarships.</p>
<p>In partnership with the AFL, these scholarships will help young Australians to realise their potential.</p>
<p>Jim courageously held up his number 37 guernsey at the start of his battle with cancer.  Today, we're holding up 37 scholarships a year for young kids who come from indigenous or multicultural backgrounds, or suffer from disadvantage and need a leg up in life.</p>
<p>These scholarships will build on the remarkable work that is done at Reach, by helping each recipient achieve their education, community or sporting goals.</p>
<p>We want to see kids reach for their dreams.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government will provide $3 million to establish the Jim Stynes Achievement Scholarships. As a partner in the program, the AFL will provide an annual contribution of $150,000 a year for the next five years. The scholarships will be administered by Reach and the AFL in partnership with the Government.</p>
<p>Through these scholarships, Jim will continue to inspire some of our most disadvantaged children to gain confidence and find their place in the world.   </p>
