PROGRAMME FOR ROYAL VISIT<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Queen has been pleased to approve a detailed<br />
programme for the Royal Visit to Australia later this year.<br />
The Visit, Her Majesty's third to this country, will begin<br />
in Sydney on Monday 30 March and end in Sydney on Sunday 3 May. The<br />
Duke of Edinburgh and The Princess Anne will be accompanying The Queen<br />
throughout the Visit, while The Prince of Wales will be here for the first<br />
days. Celebrations marking the Cook Bicentenary will be<br />
highlights of the tour, which will take the Royal Visitors-~ to New South<br />
Wales, Tasmania, Victoria, Queensland and the A. C. T. In Sydney,<br />
The Queen will attend the re-enactment of the landing of Captain Cook<br />
and, at Her Majesty's request, the programme generally features those<br />
aspects of the Australian way of life that have historic links with the days<br />
of the first settlement, such as agriculture, mining and transportation.<br />
As well, the importance of education and hospitals in the development of<br />
the country will be recognised.<br />
In agriculture, for example, the Royal Family will visit an<br />
apple orchard in Tasmania to see crops being picked and prepared for<br />
overseas markets, inspect a wool store in Victoria, and attend the National<br />
Sheep Dog Trial Championships in Canberra.<br />
In Queensland, the tour will include a visit to the Mt. isa<br />
mines, while in Townsville Her Majesty will give Royal Assent to the<br />
Bill granting autonomy to the University of North Queensland.<br />
The Queen will lead the nation in the observance of Anzac<br />
Day at a ceremony at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, and will<br />
give a talk to the nation over television and radio on Sunday 26 April.<br />
Her Majesty will undertake a final official engagement<br />
only an hour before departure for London. This will be the opening of<br />
the new International Terminal at Sydney Airport. </p>
<p>4 -2-<br />
In planning the tour, organisers have kept in mind the<br />
wishes of The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh to meet as many people<br />
as possible from different sections of the community. Informality will<br />
be the essence of the visit.<br />
On some occasions, The Prince of Wales and The Princess<br />
Anne will have their own programmes. These engagements have been<br />
designed to enable Their Royal Highnesses to meet young people and to<br />
find out for themselves something of the community and recreational and<br />
other interests of Australians of their own age.<br />
I am confident that I speak for all Australians when I say<br />
we are delighted that The Queen and members of her family will be<br />
visiting us and helping us to celebrate our 200th anniversary. They are<br />
assured of a warm welcome.<br />
CANBERRA 18 January 1970<br />

The Premiers of the States being visited are making<br />
simultaneous release of their respective programmes.<br />
A comprehensive programme of the visit to Australia is<br />
being made available to news media in the capital cities<br />
being visited. </p>
