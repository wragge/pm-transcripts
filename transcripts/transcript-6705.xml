PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED) UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
OPENING OF NEW RADIOLOGY DEPARTMENT AND REFURBISHED WARD<br />
AT REPATrRIATION GENFRXM, HOSPITAL HEIDELBERG, VICTORIA<br />
29 AUGUST 1985<br />
Senator Gietzelt, ( representative of the Victorian<br />
Government), representatives of ex-service<br />
organisations, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
It gives me considerable pleasure to be here today on<br />
the occasion of the official opening of two much needed<br />
improvements to the range of facilities available at the<br />
Repatriation General Hospital, Heidelberg.<br />
This occasion is a special " double" for it is the second<br />
time this month that I have been able to perform such a<br />
function at a Repatriation General Hospital. At the<br />
beginning of this month, I opened the new surgical<br />
operating suites at Daw Park, South Australia. Today it<br />
is the new radiological Department and the refurbished<br />
Ward 8 here at Heidelberg.<br />
it is no coincidence that these two events have occurred<br />
so close together in time. Since it came to office in<br />
March 1983, the Australian Laibor Government has given a<br />
very high priority to refurbishment and construction<br />
work throughout the Repatriation General Hospital<br />
network in Australia.<br />
Since 1982/ 83 spending on Repatriation hospitals has<br />
increased by almost $ 76 million ( or 35 per cent). The<br />
recent Budget increased spending on these hospitals by<br />
$ 19.8 million including a 78.6 per cent increase in<br />
spending on specialised equipment such as the digital<br />
subtraction unit.<br />
Also approved for Heidelberg in the Budget brought down<br />
last week were: </p>
<p>$ 3.5 million for a new outpatients department;<br />
$ 2.0 million for a psychogeriatric unit;<br />
$ 7.1 million for a new building to replace six<br />
original pavililon wards;<br />
more than $ 500,000 for other works.<br />
This burst of activity in the Repatriation General<br />
Hospital system was occasioned by the need to do<br />
something, and do it urgently, to overcome the years of<br />
neglect which had left staffing levels inadequate,<br />
morale low, and a poor standard of equiipment and<br />
facilities.<br />
Among early action taken by the Minister for Veterans<br />
Affairs was his commissioning of a review of the<br />
Repatriation Hospital system by a committee led by<br />
Doctor Ian Brand. That committee's report has now been<br />
received and its wide-ranging recommendations warrant,<br />
and will receive, careful consideration by the Minister<br />
and the Government.<br />
They will be addressed against the background of the<br />
commitment I gave in the national policy speech before<br />
last year's election " to continue upgrading repatriation<br />
hospitals to meet the needs of an ageing veterans<br />
community." That was a firm, unequivocal pledge and one<br />
which, as the 1985 Budget clearly shows, we are intent<br />
on implementing.<br />
One of the key issues to be addresscd, of course, is the<br />
Brand Review's comments on the inevitability of the<br />
integration of the Repatriation General Hospital system<br />
with the State health systems to ensure that the very<br />
best care is available to what is an ageing Veteran<br />
community. Clearly what is needed is careful planning<br />
for this eventuality. What must be uppermost in our<br />
minds, especially with an ageing veteran population, is<br />
that every effort be made to provide services, including<br />
hospital services, closer to home.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, that said, I can assure you that<br />
there will continue to be Repatriation Hospitals<br />
operating as an important and visible element in the<br />
overall treatment system for Veterans and war widows for<br />
many years to come.<br />
I know that many of you have a keen interest in the </p>
<p>3<br />
Veterans' Entitlements Bill which will be presented to<br />
the Parliament next month. There has been a great deal<br />
of work on the Bill since it was first tabled for<br />
discussion. Comments and suggestions from the exservice<br />
community have been considered and where<br />
appropriate incorporated in redirafting.<br />
There can be no suggestion that there has not been<br />
consultation or co-operation. In the history of the<br />
Repatriation system ~ there has never been such<br />
consultatiopi on legislative changes. In this regard, I<br />
should particularly like to pay tribute to the<br />
constructive, very helpful role played by the RSL's<br />
National President Sir William Keys.<br />
Ladies and. gentlemen, on this important day in the<br />
history of this Repatriation General Hospital, I could<br />
not conclude without expressing my thanks to all<br />
concerned at Heidelberg for their work in providing care<br />
to our Veteran community; particularly the visiting<br />
Medical officers, the Visiting Medical Specialists and<br />
the staff doctors, nurses, allied health<br />
professionals, ward staff, orderlies and domestic<br />
services staff and clinical teams.<br />
You are responsible for running a major hospital which<br />
handles 15,000 inpatients and about 180,000 outpatients<br />
a year. While your prime responsibility is Victoria' s<br />
Veteran community, you also have a much wider community<br />
role, witnessed by the wide-ranging nature of the<br />
gathering here today.<br />
The work you do is important and is appreciated not only<br />
by your patients, but also by the community at large. I<br />
should expect that the facilities I shall now proceed to<br />
open will make your task easier and more satisfying.<br />
They certainly add a further dimension to the services<br />
provided by this important hospital. </p>
