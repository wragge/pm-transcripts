FOR PRESS PM. No. 36/ 1969<br />
CURTIN BY-ELECTION 2<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton t<br />
I congratulate Mr Garland on winning the Curtin<br />
by-election with what it appears will be an absolute majority.<br />
Voting in by-elections traditionally goes against<br />
the Government. In this particular poll, neither ourselves nor the<br />
Labor Party can draw much comfort from the figures. Factors<br />
influencing the drop in Liberal support included the large numbers of<br />
electors who failed to vote ( which is not unusual in by-elections in<br />
a blue ribbon seat) and the loss of Sir Paul Hasluck's personal vote.<br />
An interesting aspect was the relatively large<br />
vote polled by the Independent candidate, Mr Scoggins, who had<br />
campaigned on a non-party basis with social service questions as<br />
his exclusive issue. Social welfare is a matter concerning the<br />
Government and one on which it is having a thorough examiraion<br />
made. The figures can be of little encouragement to the<br />
Labor Party, whose candidate improved only slightly. Indeed, it<br />
is the smallest increase in Labor Party support in a Governmentheld<br />
seat at a by-election this decade.<br />
