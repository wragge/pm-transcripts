<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Neil, good to be with you again.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Apologies about the delay.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No problem at all.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>We'll take calls in a moment. Mr Howard, would you agree that</p>
<p>   this is probably the most testing time of your leadership as Prime</p>
<p>   Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there are a few challenges around but I've got my eye</p>
<p>   focussed on what is good for Australia.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is it the toughest time do you think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, it is always tough being Prime Minister. It is always tough</p>
<p>   being a party leader.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>We've got these ructions in the Coalition. I mean, it really</p>
<p>   does look as if you are going to have to fight to keep the Coalition</p>
<p>   together.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think the Coalition is in any danger at all. What's</p>
<p>   happened is that people, particularly from Queensland were unsettled</p>
<p>   by the result of the Queensland State election. It was after all</p>
<p>   a State election and it was the judgement of the people of Queensland</p>
<p>   on the politics of Queensland and whilst you can never completely</p>
<p>   isolate these things to one state you have to take care not to draw</p>
<p>   too many federal conclusions, but what is important at the moment</p>
<p>   is what is good for Australia, and the reason that I continue to</p>
<p>   support the sale of Telstra, and I noticed that the former National</p>
<p>   Party Deputy Prime Minister Doug Anthony this morning came out strongly</p>
<p>   in favour of that policy too, is that it is good for Australia.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But we do have obviously a disagreement about what is good for</p>
<p>   Australia. We have the federal President of the National Party criticising,</p>
<p>   well, asking questions over the tax policy saying we should delay</p>
<p>   it. Now, over race power as well. We have the economy, by some reports,</p>
<p>   heading into trouble. Telstra not settled down yet, the polls not</p>
<p>   good. Now you put that all together and it looks like a pretty bleak</p>
<p>   picture for John Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, one thing at a time. Let's deal with Telstra. Now, the</p>
<p>   reason that I support the sale of Telstra is simply this, that the</p>
<p>   30th of June this year, Australia's federal government</p>
<p>   debt was $82 billion. If you sell Telstra you'll get about</p>
<p>   $40 billion, so in one hit, you'll get rid of half the national</p>
<p>   debt of the Federal Government of Australia, and just think of the</p>
<p>   money you could spend on schools and roads and hospitals and all</p>
<p>   sorts of other desirable things with the interest saving on that</p>
<p>   $40 billion.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But surely the point is that you still have your partners, or at</p>
<p>   least, part of your partnership resisting these things. Now, how</p>
<p>   does the partnership survive when you've got argument over</p>
<p>   so many areas?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There are thousands of members of the National Party around Australia</p>
<p>   and there are thousands of members of the Liberal Party around Australia</p>
<p>   and you are not going to get everybody saying the same thing all</p>
<p>   the time on every issue. The thing that counts is that the policy</p>
<p>   making section of the National Party which of course are the elected</p>
<p>   members of Parliament which are part of the Coalition, they are</p>
<p>   part of that policy. Now, there's nothing strange about people</p>
<p>   from time to time having some disagreement, individual members having</p>
<p>   disagreement with a position taken by the Government. That happened</p>
<p>   with Labor Governments, it's happened with Coalition Governments</p>
<p>   in the past. This is not an easy time for the National Party, I</p>
<p>   understand that, but what really counts is that you look at what</p>
<p>   is good for Australia, not whether John Howard is being stubborn,</p>
<p>   or John Howard's being inflexible, or John Howard's willing</p>
<p>   to do this or that. I just simply ask the question when you look</p>
<p>   at Telstra, when you look at tax, what is good for Australia? And</p>
<p>   what is clearly good for Australia is to get rid of that huge federal</p>
<p>   Government debt and also to have some money over to spend on additional</p>
<p>   communications infrastructure in the bush. The same thing applies</p>
<p>   to taxation.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>So are you confident the parliamentary party, the National Party</p>
<p>   parliamentary party will support you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>And if they don't?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I just believe they will.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But if they don't?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's hypothetical.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay, on tax. And I asked you about this last weeks ago. There</p>
<p>   is nervous environment in the country, that nervous environment</p>
<p>   continues. In that sense, does the National Party president have</p>
<p>   a point. If you go ahead it increases the nervousness if there's</p>
<p>   GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I think now, because of Asia, it's all the more important</p>
<p>   for Australia that we change our tax system. If things were more</p>
<p>   settled in the Asia-Pacific region there may be a slightly lesser</p>
<p>   argument but it is all the more necessary for us to go the next</p>
<p>   step for our own sake once again, not because I want to have my</p>
<p>   way or because people are being inflexible but it is good for Australia</p>
<p>   that we have a fairer taxation system because that makes us stronger</p>
<p>   and makes us more competitive. So, I don't accept for a moment</p>
<p>   the argument that because of Asia we have to go easy on giving Australia</p>
<p>   a better tax system. It is because of Asia that we must press ahead</p>
<p>   and give Australia a better taxation system.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Because of what's happening in Asia and the economy in this</p>
<p>   country, does it affect the way, the type of tax reform you look</p>
<p>   at?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Not a great deal. It makes it all the more necessary, for example,</p>
<p>   to change the tax system so that our exports are more competitive.</p>
<p>   And the present tax system makes Australian exports uncompetitive</p>
<p>   and our new policy will make Australian exports more competitive.</p>
<p>   Now isn't that a reason for the sake of Australia, forget about</p>
<p>   the party politics of it, but for the sake of our country, we should</p>
<p>   give it in these difficult economic times a more competitive taxation</p>
<p>   system.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But what about race power. This is another area where the National</p>
<p>   Party president is...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there is no intention by the Government to sponsor any referendum</p>
<p>   of any kind on that subject.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you have the support of the National Party parliamentary party</p>
<p>   then?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's not even been raised with me.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Would you raise it with them?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, because it is not on my agenda.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>It's not going to happen?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay, you make the point what's good for Australia'.</p>
<p>   Obviously there's a difference of some views on what's</p>
<p>   good for Australia. Is the National Party overreacting to the One</p>
<p>   Nation thing?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I do think it has unsettled the National Party in Queensland. I</p>
<p>   just say again, that in Queensland, that election was a judgement</p>
<p>   on the Government of Queensland. Now, I'm sorry that the Borbidge</p>
<p>   Government was defeated. But I don't take One Nation lightly,</p>
<p>   but you deal with One Nation by having good policy and doing things</p>
<p>   that are good for Australia. The Australian public will support</p>
<p>   the Coalition if it does the right thing by the country and we have</p>
<p>   to go out and argue that. And the right thing by Australia at the</p>
<p>   moment in relation to tax is to give us a more competitive and a</p>
<p>   fairer tax system.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is it correct that you would rather resign than back away from</p>
<p>   tax reform?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I used that... I made that statement, yes I did, but in</p>
<p>   the context of simply saying, look I'm not going to.. if people</p>
<p>   say to me "Look John you've got to stop doing this, even</p>
<p>   though you think it is good for Australia because some people may</p>
<p>   like it" my answer to that is No, I'm not going to do</p>
<p>   that. I'll continue to do what is I believe, and what I know</p>
<p>   is good for Australia, irrespective of the political consequences,</p>
<p>   because that is, in the end, that is what you are in public life</p>
<p>   to do: to argue those things that you think are good for the country,</p>
<p>   and then the public makes a judgement. And if the public decides</p>
<p>   that what I'm arguing for is not in their opinion good for</p>
<p>   Australia, well, they won't support me, but if they do, they</p>
<p>   will. But you don't all the time calculate as to what might,</p>
<p>   for the next two weeks, have more support than something else. You</p>
<p>   just sit down and you say what is good for Australia, and then you</p>
<p>   go out and argue for it, and that is what I'm doing.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>This is the point I'm getting to about leadership though I</p>
<p>   suppose, that if, and as you say, if necessary, you are putting</p>
<p>   yourself of on the line aren't you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, all political leaders who believe what is good for their</p>
<p>   country do that, otherwise you are of no use to your country. I</p>
<p>   mean, what is the point of having a political leader, whether as</p>
<p>   Prime Minister or Opposition Leader, argues things entirely out</p>
<p>   of political calculation and never out of the public interest.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you have the total support of your own Party?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Are you aware of some mumblings in Victoria, the belief that you</p>
<p>   couldn't win an election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't know about that. There are always mumblings,</p>
<p>   always people get nervous about...</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Has anybody raised that with you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Are you aware of it happening?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Hmm. So you are confident you are leader til the next election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I would imagine so. I certainly expect so.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yeah. Do you feel it personally testing at the moment?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Not more than on some other occasions in the past. I've been</p>
<p>   through a lot, Neil.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But as Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it is challenging at the moment but we are dealing with some</p>
<p>   big things. There's a lot at stake. The future strength of</p>
<p>   the Australian economy is at stake.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, let's look at that. Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a very pessimistic</p>
<p>   report today heading into a recession. Are we?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I think that's too gloomy. But we are obviously being</p>
<p>   affected by the Asian downturn and it is all the more reason to</p>
<p>   have, as a Government of this country, a group of people who took</p>
<p>   the decisions that had to be taken two years ago.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The Federal Treasurer seems to be suggesting they'll review</p>
<p>   the economic forecasts, will you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's something that we will be influenced by the advice</p>
<p>   that we receive, but we took some measures a couple of years ago</p>
<p>   which were attacked by the Labor party and opposed by the Labor</p>
<p>   Party but if they hadn't have been taken we would now be in</p>
<p>   an awful mess. If we had followed Mr Beazley and Mr Evans'</p>
<p>   advice, the Australian economy now would be much more vulnerable,</p>
<p>   our interest rates would be higher, our inflation would be higher,</p>
<p>   our debt would be greater.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But are your forecasts for economic growth achievable?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The forecasts that were in the Budget have not been revised by</p>
<p>   the Treasury. We naturally have to rely on the expertise in the</p>
<p>   Treasury in relation to economic forecasts. You don't manipulate</p>
<p>   economic forecasts, you rely on the advice of your experts.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, your Treasury yesterday seemed to be saying they would be</p>
<p>   revised, it's down to 2.75 growth forecast.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Are you saying the Treasurer?</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, what Peter was doing was obviously always keeping open the</p>
<p>   possibility as has always been the case and always will be the case</p>
<p>   that economic growth forecasts could be varied, but we have not</p>
<p>   received any advice from the Treasury, I certainly haven't,</p>
<p>   and I don't believe the Treasurer would have either, because</p>
<p>   he'd have told me, that we have to revise them downward.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Even if it is not a recession which is  I think, are we heading</p>
<p>   into a period of negative growth?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I wouldn't even say that Neil. What is obvious is that</p>
<p>   the Asian economic downturn is huge, and it can't leave Australia</p>
<p>   unaffected but it won't damage Australia as much as it would</p>
<p>   have if we hadn't have done what we did two years ago, and</p>
<p>   if we were to be replaced by Mr Beazley and Mr Evans who believe</p>
<p>   in returning to deficit and debt and high interest rates, the Australian</p>
<p>   economy would be far more damaged than would otherwise be the case.</p>
<p>   And that really is the biggest political decision that will need</p>
<p>   to be made over the next few months. Do you want Mr Beazley and</p>
<p>   Mr Evans back in charge of the economy with their high deficit,</p>
<p>   high debt, high interest rate policies or do you want the present</p>
<p>   Government with its willingness to do things for the good of Australia</p>
<p>   such as taxation reform?</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The next few months we'll have to decide that will we?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You'll have to decide.. well, the next election has to be</p>
<p>   held by the first half, first bit of next year and we are now into</p>
<p>   July but I don't know when the election is going to be. We</p>
<p>   are going to release the tax policy soon, and we'll spend a</p>
<p>   lot of time explaining that to the Australian public.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is next week a chance for the tax package?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. No chance at all. I can tell you that.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yes, good, thank you. We'll take some calls. Hello Bill go</p>
<p>   ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning Mr Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hello Bill.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm pretty good.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>That's good. Look, from out in the average suburbs of Melbourne</p>
<p>   I've been looking at your performance on television, plus your</p>
<p>   Ministers. I can't get a handle on solid direction from your</p>
<p>   position and it is getting to the stage now, Sir, where I think</p>
<p>   the Liberal Party, with due respect to Tony Staley, is becoming</p>
<p>   crippled.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I obviously, Bill, don't agree with that.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Well, I just see that we are not getting any decisive pointers</p>
<p>   saying where we are going, and everything is being put off consistently</p>
<p>   and the despondency in the ...outside here in Victoria is getting</p>
<p>   larger and larger against the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you say we are putting things off. I thought we've been</p>
<p>   criticised for not putting things off. I've just spent 10 minutes</p>
<p>   talking to Neil about suggestions that we ought to put things off</p>
<p>   and the implication is that I'm wrong because I don't</p>
<p>   put them off and now you're coming on and saying that you're</p>
<p>   hearing all the time I'm putting things off. I don't know,</p>
<p>   you must be tuned into a different program. I mean I thought the</p>
<p>   criticism of me at the moment was that I'm not willing to put</p>
<p>   tax reform off, I'm not willing to put off the sale of Telstra,</p>
<p>   I'm not willing to put things off, now I won't put them</p>
<p>   off because they're good for Australia. Not because they're</p>
<p>   my prized personal possessions.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay, thanks Bill, thank you for calling. John is next, go ahead</p>
<p>   John.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yeah, Mr Howard how are you...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Might do better with this name.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Oh, this name, it's one thing we've got in common.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good. Is that all?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>That's about it I'm afraid.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh dear me, another one!</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Okay then well look the problem is that you've introduce a</p>
<p>   15 per cent surcharge on superannuation on incomes over $75,000.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Okay. The only problem what you've done is you've calculated</p>
<p>   that on gross income not on the actual person's superannuation.</p>
<p>   Now my superannuation is only calculated on my standard salary which</p>
<p>   is $40,000. I have no option, I can't go any higher than that.</p>
<p>   But I got a bill this week for a $1,020.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't understand that. If you'd like to send all the</p>
<p>   details of that to my office, just on the face of it it doesn't</p>
<p>   sound plausible because the purpose was to introduce that on peoples</p>
<p>   whose incomes were much higher level around the $70,000 mark. </p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Well, no....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>If your real income is only....</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>My salary is up around the $78,000 because.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I thought you said 40, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>No, my super is fixed at 40.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Your super is fixed at 40, yes.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>My super's fixed at 40 because overtime does not come into</p>
<p>   it.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>So with my employer right it's your superannuation is....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But you still earn $78,000 a year do you?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I see, well $78,000 a year means that you are amongst as an individual,</p>
<p>   you are amongst the 10 per cent of the Australian population which</p>
<p>   are the highest income earners.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay. Thank you John. Michael go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning Neil, and good morning Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, are you or Mr Costello aware of the Australian Tax Office</p>
<p>   change in position regarding investment in film production tax deductibility</p>
<p>   and that the intention of the Australian Tax Office is a four year</p>
<p>   retrospective tax reassessment of investors tax returns?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we certainly haven't authorised any retrospective application</p>
<p>   of tax in that area. I often get people who ring me up saying are</p>
<p>   you aware of what the tax office has done. You've got to understand</p>
<p>   the tax office under the law acts independently of the Government...</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>And they're not accountable to you.</p>
