Jj AUS'I'XA! IA , L<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 1 July 1983<br />
The Federal Goverrm-nt welcomes the High Court judgerent which confirms the<br />
Ccomnwealth's powers to act to preserve the wilderness of South West Tasmania.<br />
The importance of this area, which contains some of the last te: zerate<br />
wilderness in the world, has been recognised internationally as cart of the<br />
world's natural and cultural heritage through its listing in the World<br />
Heritage Register.<br />
Now that it is clear that the Comonwealth Government has the necessary po<br />
we will move promptly and responsibly to ensure that the wilderi. ess of the<br />
World Heritage area is preserved for all present and future Australians and<br />
for the world. The decision also protects a significant part of Tasmania's<br />
Aboriginal heritage.<br />
I am writing to the Tasmanian Premier, Mr Gray, offering Cononwealth financial<br />
support to ensure that the persons presently employed on the Gordon-below-<br />
Franklin dam project are properly looked after, through inccme miaintenance for<br />
up to one month while alternative employment opportunities are found.<br />
The Federal Government will also take appropriate steps to protect the<br />
interests of contractors engaged on the project.<br />
The details of the Federal Government's offer to Tasmania will be made<br />
public after it has been received by Mr Gray.<br />
We appreciate that this has been a very difficult problem for the Tasmanian<br />
Government and for many Tasmanians.<br />
The Federal Government recognises that the Tasnanian Government acted in what<br />
it believed was the interests of Tasmania.<br />
Now that the issue has been resolved, I give our unequivocal assurance that the<br />
Federal Government intends to work in a fully co-operative spirit with Tasmania<br />
in the conservation and managerrent of the wilderness area, and Ln the developrrent<br />
of alternative strategies for Tasmania's economic advancement.<br />
I have no ccment to make on the wider implications of the High Court's<br />
decision on the powers of the Cormonwealth. But I can say that we will always<br />
prefer to act co-operatively with the States rather than, as in the present<br />
case, being forced to assert the Commocnalth's constitutional pcers.<br />
There need be no fear of a rush to extend Ccomonwalth activities into new<br />
areas as a result of the High Court's decision. That would be totally at<br />
odds with our consensus-building approach to Government. </p>
