PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH VINCENT SMITH, RADIO<br />
JULY, 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
SMITH: Our special guest on the program this morning is the PM<br />
of Australia, who yesterday launched probably the most ambitious<br />
program of reform for Australia the complete revamp of<br />
relations between the Commonwealth and the States. The founding<br />
fathers had some almighty blues when they were putting together<br />
the Constitution and I suppose any future change will not be<br />
achieved without some disagreement. But the founding fathers<br />
said the scene almost 100 years ago, and it is fitting that any<br />
major review, any major change should be ready for the centenary<br />
of federation in the year 2001. Like the PM I hope plenty of the<br />
changes can be operating long before then however, for they are<br />
sorely needed.<br />
Good morning to you PM.<br />
PM: Good morning Vincent.<br />
SMITH: How are you?<br />
PM: I'm very well, and you?<br />
SMITH: Fighting fit, thank you.<br />
PM: Good on you mate.<br />
SMITH: You must be pleased with the reaction this morning.<br />
PM: Yes, it's been very positive and I think it reflects a<br />
great deal of credit upon our politicians, and the media and our<br />
people because I think there is an understanding that we've all<br />
got a responsibility, irrespective of our political persuasions,<br />
to try and do the best for our country now to get it in shape for<br />
the 21st century.<br />
SMITH: r suppose in a way the climate is right, it's almost<br />
been created hasn't it, for suggesting ouch reform.<br />
PM: I think the climate is good. We've got, I think, a<br />
range of very capable political leaders around the country now in<br />
the States and in Baying that, I don't, in any sense just reflect </p>
<p>PM ( cont) i the fact the majority are of my political persuasion<br />
because I went out of my way yesterday to point out that in NSW<br />
the Liberal leader there Nick Greiner has been very open minded<br />
and responsive to the sorts of things I've been saying.<br />
SMITHs Well he says he believes you're fair dinkum and he<br />
supports what you've talking about.<br />
PM: So the attitude is good. I think there is an<br />
understanding when I think particularly people have taken on what<br />
I've been saying recently that when you look at Europe, by 1992<br />
those twelve independent nations of the European community would<br />
have created a situation where there will be less impairment to<br />
the free flow of goods and services between those twelve nations<br />
than there is between the States of Australia. And I think that<br />
sort of hit people between the eyes and makes them realise that<br />
we've really got to do better.<br />
SMITH: It rather makes it an urgent task for us as well<br />
doesn't it?<br />
PM: It is and that's why I said yesterday, Vincent, that I<br />
don't want some long drawn out voluminous enquiry which looks at<br />
everything and then some years down the track says well here's<br />
our report. I want us to be able to deal with issues as we go<br />
along so that if something is capable of being fixed, quickly,<br />
then that's done. Other things of course will take longer but<br />
let's commuit ourselves to a process of change. It took me, I was<br />
very interested in your introduction, Vincent, it did take our<br />
founding fathers the whole of that decade of the 90' s in the last<br />
century to prepare for Federation. The first convention was in<br />
Sydney in 1891, then they went over to Adelaide in 1897, and then<br />
back to Melbourne in 1898, and it wasn't until the 1st of January<br />
1901 that Australia came into being. well we ought to realise<br />
that we should now use this decade leading up to the centenary of<br />
Federation in 2001 to make and consistently go on making the<br />
changes that are necessary to equip Australia to go with<br />
confidence and with the most efficiency into what's going to be a<br />
very, very tough* competitive 21st century.<br />
SMITH: On the Constitutional side, do you see it as a major<br />
re-write of the Constitution.<br />
PM: Not necessarily major, I mean it just depends what pace<br />
of change the people want. But I think there are some things<br />
that can be done pretty quickly. For instance, as I said<br />
yesterday, I think that we can get, at the next election, a<br />
referendum up and passed I would think, giving four year terms<br />
because whoever is in govt, it's better. I think everyone<br />
realises that if they have four years rather than three, to go<br />
about the process of government and Dr Hewson, I pay him credit,<br />
seems to share that view, so I think we can get agreement on </p>
<p>PR ( cont): that. Other Consitutional changes may taker longer<br />
but I think we ought to use this period, this decade to look at<br />
those changes in the Constitution on which we can get agreement,<br />
because the ninety years up till now have been barren basically.<br />
It's all been political controversy when it comes to referendums.<br />
So what I want is a process where we can sit down together, the<br />
political parties, the Constitutional lawyers and interest<br />
groups, and say well, can we get agreement on this or that issue<br />
for Constitutional change.<br />
SMITH: Would that anxiety for consensus tend to compromise<br />
some of the reform do you think?<br />
PM: Well I think the answer to that is without consensus<br />
and constitutional change you don't get change. That's what our<br />
history of the last ninety years shows.<br />
SMITH: So you have to have a consensus then?<br />
PM: The last time we got Constitutional changes was in the<br />
when you had a Conservative Govt proposing and Labor<br />
Opposition supporting the change in the Constitution to give<br />
power in regard to Aborigines to the National Govt. Now that was<br />
where you had bipartisanship. Unless you have that, change is<br />
very hard to get.<br />
SMITH: Do you think there will be Ican hear some of the<br />
clamoring now I suppose, people saying that this is just Canberra<br />
lusting after more power, a socialist scheme for centralised<br />
power. PM: Well this is bloody nonsense if I can be quite direct<br />
because as said yesterday what I'm about is putting everything on<br />
the table and if there are areas where it looks as though it's<br />
better to give the power or the delivery of the service back to<br />
the States, well, let's do it that way, if we can be persuaded<br />
that that's the best way of doing it. And yesterday I gave back<br />
a power, which is worth $ 400M. We have a bank account deposits<br />
tax and I said well look I'm prepared to hand that back to the<br />
states, it can be an area where they can make the decisions about<br />
that. It won't affect the need for central macro economic powers<br />
to be with the Commonwealth. So I'm not about trying to get miore<br />
power. I'm Just trying to get a situation where the citizens of<br />
this country are going to have their services that they want<br />
delivered in the most efficient way and if that means, for<br />
instance, in some areas the States saying well you can probably<br />
do that better alone, well we'll do that. In others, we are<br />
Baying well you can do it better in the States, well let's do it<br />
that way. Not everything will require the same sort of solution.<br />
SMITH: That offer yesterday, was that seen, or did you want it<br />
to be seen as a demonstration of what the Commonwealth is<br />
prepared to concede to the States. </p>
<p>PM2 I wanted it as an indication of my sincerity about the<br />
purpose of this exercise and it was something that the States<br />
wanted and I believed it was something that they could have.<br />
SMITH: What do you see as the most pressing need for change.<br />
PM: Well, it's very hard to put one priority but I<br />
nominated yesterday two areas where I thought we should really<br />
start working. There's a lot of room for combined effort to get<br />
better solutions in the area of health and social welfare<br />
delivery. Now if you look at the area of health, particularly as<br />
it affects our elderly citizens, you have this interchange<br />
between the Commonwealth and the States. The States are<br />
responsible for the hospitals, but we put an enormous amount of<br />
money into that and the hospitals are a service for our elderly<br />
people in many respects, but there in regard to their elderly<br />
people's accommodation, we're in the field of nursing homes and<br />
hostels. And we're both, Commonwealth and States, in the area of<br />
delivering services to the aged in their homes. Now inevitably<br />
where you have the States and the Commonwealth interacting in<br />
those areas of hospitals, nursing homes, hostels and domiciliary<br />
assistance, then there is overlap and there is duplication, not<br />
only of services but of monitoring of the delivery of services.<br />
Now I think those are areas where we ought to see change. In the<br />
area of transport, we've really got to do something about getting<br />
a more efficient, co-ordinated Australian transport system. So<br />
that's going to require a lot of co-operation between us and the<br />
States in the area of rail, so that rail ceases to be as it is<br />
nlow, an enormous financial burden upon the taxpayers but by<br />
getting both a more efficient co-operation between the States and<br />
a better integration with road services, that we can deliver to<br />
our economic enterprises in this country, a more efficient<br />
transport infra-structure.<br />
SMITH: You conceded yesterday that maybe there was a need to<br />
have a look at uniform non-bank financial regulation and under<br />
considerable heavy questioning.<br />
PM: Oh no, not under considerable heavy pressure, I didn't<br />
specifically include it in my speech, I knew I would get a<br />
question about it, and my answer was consistent with exactly what<br />
I had said in the speech, and that is, that we ought to have two<br />
criteria that we're aiming at in that area. One is efficiency of<br />
supervision and the second is uniformity. Now the way to do that<br />
as I will have it on the agenda for this special Premiers<br />
conference that I'm calling at the end of October, we'll have a<br />
lot of work done and consultation between the Commonwealth and<br />
the States beforehand, and I would hope that out of that process<br />
the States would agree on a system of supervision which they<br />
could all apply, and then the States would actually have the<br />
responsibility of applying that uniform effective system of<br />
supervision. </p>
<p>SMITH: Do you think there's been a change in the way in which<br />
the States think on matters like this, because it's taken an age<br />
to get anywhere near consensus on for example, uniform companies<br />
regulation.<br />
PM: Yes, that has been a slow process, but fortunately I'm<br />
able to say that the result of the work of my Attorney General#<br />
Michael Duffy, and now with greater response from the States, we<br />
look as though that we will be able to have the uniform system<br />
operating from the 1st of January of next year. Certainly it<br />
took too long, but it's an area which is absolutely necessary<br />
when we get that outcome.<br />
SMITH: Does it leave you a little bit disheartened about the<br />
prospects for consensus on some of the wider issues.<br />
PM: No not disheartened at all. I know it's not going to<br />
be a bed of roses and some issues will be more difficult than<br />
others but I don't think we've ever had in my time in politics a<br />
more propitious conjunction of circumstances than we've got now.<br />
As I look around the States I see a range of Premiers who I think<br />
are capable, and who are committed to change, and to say that the<br />
majority of these Premiere are of my political persuasion but I<br />
want out of my way yesterday, as I say, to indicate that Mr<br />
Greiner in NSW has a constructive approach, and I think the<br />
circumstances are right now. They understand that in times of<br />
economic constraint and challenge, we've just got to do, all of<br />
us, each govt has got to do our task as efficiently as possible.<br />
Now in some areas that may mean giving up something and letting<br />
others do it, and vice versa. And I think they all understand<br />
that now, better than they ever have before.<br />
SMITH: Will you be taking the Commonwealth's agenda to the<br />
October Premiers' Conference.<br />
PM: It won't be our agenda alone. What I've done is<br />
already indicated the things that I think ought to be on the<br />
agenda but I've written to the Premiers and said, now you also<br />
nominate what you want on the agendao and between now and then,<br />
we will have a working group of senior-level officials,<br />
Commonwealth and State, developing working papers on the items<br />
that both I and the States want dealt with.<br />
SMITH: And from that, things will get rolling pretty quickly?<br />
PM: Yes. I made it clear yesterday that I don't want a<br />
long drawn out process with some voluminous report years down the<br />
track, we'll look at that report. W~ hat I've said is there<br />
are some things that can be done quite quickly, where they can be<br />
identified and agreement achieved, let's do it, so that we've got<br />
a rolling program of change.<br />
SMITH: And you would be looking in the area of health for<br />
immediate start. </p>
<p>PMHS Well there's a lot of work to be done there<br />
Immediately, but I don't. I'm not being prescriptive about it and<br />
saying that's the only area but there may be others where we can<br />
do some things even more quickly.<br />
SMITH: The States may have some ideas.<br />
PM: Ohl * not may have, they will have, and I've invited<br />
them. I wrote to them yesterday morning so that they had my<br />
speech before I delivered it and the indication to participate<br />
and I know, that there will be a constructive response from each<br />
of them.<br />
SMITH: PM, thanks a lot for your time this morning.<br />
PM-. Thank you very much indeed, Vincent.<br />
SMITH: It's something the nation needs.<br />
