    <content><![CDATA[<p>PM: An important day for Canberra and for the nation, and hence the remarks I have made inside.</p>
<p>One or two other things I would just like to say briefly about the Government's position in relation to the new foreign investment rules on residential housing. You will have seen the Government's statement today.</p>
<p>I want to be absolutely clear cut about this, and that is, we want to make sure that Australian working families are not being priced out of their own family homes. That is why we have acted in the way in which we have done.</p>
<p>We want to make sure that foreign speculators are not going to force up prices for Australians seeking to buy their own home, buy their first home and we think this is the right course of action.</p>
<p>Finally for the first time, what you are going to have is a penalties regime applying to people who violate this law in the future; a penalties regime which will, for the first time, include the confiscation of any capital gain by any foreign investor flouting these laws.</p>
<p>This is an important measure in support of working families and those who are finding it tough in the housing market right now. One question and I have got to zip.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister can you give a guarantee that no individual taxpayer will be worse off under the Government's response to Henry?</p>
<p>PM: Can I say as I have said on many times before that the Government's response to Henry, the independent review of taxation will be delivered prior to the Budget.</p>
<p>I understand the Premier, the Treasurer has indicated a timeframe for that. And the Government's response to that independent review of taxation will be clear and we believe that that is the right course of action.</p>
<p>We think it is going to provide ample opportunity for appropriate public debate, as it should.</p>
<p>Future arrangements for our tax system are important for all participants</p>
