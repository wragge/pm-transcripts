    <content><![CDATA[<p>New laws to streamline the process for Australian families adopting through the Taiwan and South Korea programmes have commenced.</p>
<p>These laws will significantly reduce the timeframe to finalise adoptions, reducing stress on families at a time when they need to focus on supporting their child to feel safe and secure in a new home. These laws reflect the Government’s commitment to deliver reform on overseas adoption.</p>
<p>Families who receive an adoption compliance certificate from a Hague Convention country automatically have their adoption recognised under Australian law, however families adopting from Taiwan and South Korea have needed to obtain another adoption order in Australia.</p>
<p>This would generally be granted after a 12 month wait. Adoption orders issued in Taiwan and South Korea can now be recognised automatically. Families will also be able immediately to apply for citizenship for their child on arrival in Australia.</p>
<p>Although the Ethiopian intercountry adoption programme is closed, there are a number of families who are awaiting the finalisation of their adoption. These new laws will allow these adoptions to also be automatically recognised in Australia.</p>
<p>State and territory central authorities will continue the practice of supervising families following their return to Australia, to ensure compliance with requirements from overseas countries and to provide support when needed.</p>
<p>The Interdepartmental Committee on Intercountry Adoption that the Government announced in December last year continues to look at further opportunities to improve arrangements.  The committee has received over 100 submissions and we look forward to receiving its report later this month.</p>
<p>The committee’s report will help to inform discussion at the next COAG meeting.</p>
<p>Families who believe they might be affected by these changes should contact their state or territory for more information.</p>
