THE PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
TUESDAY, 13 MARCH 1973<br />
PRIME MINISTER: First there's an Executive Council appointment.<br />
The Executive Member of the National Pipeline Authority will be<br />
Mr James Donald. I can give you details of his career afterwards<br />
if you wish. Next we're sending our first Australian Government<br />
Trade Mission to the People's Republic of China. Dr Cairns will<br />
lead it. The business interests represented in the mission wili<br />
be led by Sir Ian McLennon, the Chairman of B. H. P. The other<br />
members we can give you afterwards also. Dr Cairns will be<br />
issuing a press statement on it.<br />
There were a very great number of Cabinet decisions th-is<br />
morning. Many of them were confirming decisions made by the<br />
Economic Committee and by the Urban and Regional Development<br />
Committee. Perhaps you can get details from Dr Patterson on the<br />
legislation for weirs on the lower Dawson River and assistance<br />
for the first stage of the Ross River Dam; from Mr Johnson on<br />
the terms of the new Commonwealth/ State Housing Agreement; from<br />
Senator Wriedt on the details of the fruit-growing reconstrucuion<br />
scheme and the rural reconstruction scheme. I can give you th. e<br />
general terms of the arrangements we are willing to enter into<br />
with New South Wales and Victoria about the Newcastle dockyLL.<br />
and the new dock in Melbourne. The Minister for Transpulc. a e<br />
Treasurer are authorised to negotiate an agreement with b,, u<br />
respective governments under which the Australian Governme..,<br />
provides the finance required for the construction of ilie , o ,-ka<br />
new docks on the condition tha, the dockyards will be o<br />
owned and operated by the Australian Government and the Neuw<br />
Wales Government in one case, by the Australian Governmen-t ' l<br />
the Victorian Government in the other case, the Australian<br />
Government's share in assets and management being commensura. te<br />
with its contribution. Mr Jones can give you more details o7 onis.<br />
These are matters upon which Sir Robert Askin and Mr Hamer ., ve<br />
written to me. They were also matters of course which were<br />
considered by an inter-departmental Committee under the lat<br />
government that it be left to us to make a decision and<br />
proposal. There's also a matter concerning Evans-Deakin<br />
Shipyards in Brisbane. I can give you details if you like<br />
but then Mr Jones can go into greater detail with that also<br />
if you wish. Also Mr Jones can give you the terms of the<br />
we are suggesting that the Australian Government and the<br />
Government should join in giving to maintain a shipping seo: v...<br />
King Island. I can give you a fair amount here but perhaps yoo<br />
might like to ask the Ministers concerned.<br />
Now then, there's to be amending legislation to the Pul.<br />
Service Act I suppose I'd better give you the details of l<br />
It really means that an acting Head of a Department will hwve.<br />
full authority that a Head has. There has been some doubt ou<br />
up till this stage. </p>
<p>Mr Beasley will be bringing in legislation for the Commonwealth<br />
Teaching Service. Mr Morrison made a submission which we endorsed<br />
on decisions taken by the Australian and Papua-New Guinea<br />
Governments. Senator Murphy will be bringing in legislation to<br />
amend the Book Bounty Act; to establish the Superior Court<br />
promised ten years ago; to permit us to ratify the Convention on<br />
Psycho-tropic substances; to appoint an ombudsman; and to<br />
establish an Australian Law Reform Commission. Senator Willesee<br />
will bring in legislation to amend the National Library Act;<br />
Mr Morrison to carry out Metric Conversion; and the last one is a<br />
proposal which we endorsed from Senator McClelland that there should<br />
be a Committee comprised of the Department of the Media., wlich will<br />
provide the chairman and secretarial services, the Departmei-of<br />
Education, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and<br />
the Department of the Treasury to inquire into the nature and<br />
extent of supplies and shortages of text and reference books<br />
required by primary, secondary and tertiary students and to<br />
recommend means of improving the supplies and overcoming the<br />
shortages. We have in mind that we'll seek the assistance of<br />
representatives of book publishing, printing and selling<br />
organisations including government printers and university<br />
presses. Those are the decisions we made or confirmed this<br />
morning. Mr Whitlam, I was wondering what happened to the F111.<br />
Has that been considered. If so, what has happened to it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There is a submission on that. It has not<br />
been determined by the Cabinet.<br />
Are there any hold-ups?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. But there might be a couple of score-of<br />
submissions which we haven't dealt with yet. We haven't<br />
determined this matter.<br />
Sir, at a press conference today the Malaysian Deputy<br />
Prime Minister made it clear that over-crowding would mahc the<br />
Australian squadrons at Butterworth unwelcome by 1976. but, ho u<br />
said that if the airfield facilities were expanded the Australian<br />
squadrons would still be welcome. My question, which 1 w. s going<br />
to address to Mr Barnard is: Will the Australian Governrmcnt help<br />
expand the airfield facilities or will the squadrons be withdrw.',<br />
in 1976?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is too far ahead to determine at this stage.<br />
By 1976 the Mirages will be pretty well obsolescent.<br />
In view of Malaysia's decision to withdraw from ASPAC I<br />
was wondering if Australia will follow the same line?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Wo won't withdraw from ASPAC at this stage. , W<br />
are considering our membership of ASPAC because, clearly, the<br />
usefullness of ASPAC is very limited indeed while Taiwan rcma-inj.<br />
a member because three of the members of ASPAC Japan, New Zealand </p>
<p>and Australia have now recognised the People's Republic of China<br />
and not Taiwan. There is a Standing Committee of ASPAC meeting<br />
in Bangkok at the moment. We are not attending it. We would not<br />
be attending a ministerial meeting if one eventuates.<br />
should have read to you incidentally another decision<br />
which will interest you. I hadn't written a name against it so<br />
that's how I overlooked it. Export incentives: We will extend<br />
!. he present l] cgi slo. tion for one year.<br />
Mr Wh. itlam, if I can ;. isk my weekly question on the American<br />
bases. Coul. d you tell us how you can reccncil. e the Australian<br />
Government's attitude as unnunc iated by you and Mr Barnard on<br />
conti. nuing the prence of the lses and the secrecy of the bases<br />
f. rstly with Labor policy on ANZUS which suggests that the ANZUS<br />
TrecLaty should be mi. d~ into a s. lightly less militaristic thing<br />
than it has been in the past, and secondly, now that the<br />
Australian Government has ratified H. i, Nuclear Non-proliferation<br />
Treaty, can you explain how we c; ni: conilinue either as part-owners<br />
or a;. s not owners at all to have thli No. r-hL West Cape Base which<br />
as everyone knows is concerned ih pi'laris submarines on our<br />
so L?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The future manage. rment or joint management of<br />
the North West C;. a p . Stiation wil. 1., be discussed by Mr Barnard as he<br />
told you. If this is inconsistent with the Treaty to which we<br />
are party, then that would have to be considered also that aspect.<br />
Prime Minister, supplementary to that question, at your<br />
Calucus Meeting last week we believe a substantial number, or tlie<br />
majority of those present actually voted in favour of a motion<br />
which would have allowed discussion of a proposal that Cabinet<br />
should reconsider Mr Barnard's statement. That was defeated<br />
because of a technicality. However, does the vote influence you<br />
to take the matter back to Cabinet for reconsideration?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm led to believe that this matter arose too.<br />
I was out of the Caucus when it happened. I was out discussing<br />
the reply to what was to be a no-confidence motion in the Gove'rnient<br />
or Mr Barnard on this subject. At any rate there has been nothi; g<br />
on the Cabinet Agenda about this.<br />
You are not interested to take it back to Cabinet as a result<br />
of the vote which you and I both understand occurred in the Party<br />
meeting? PRIME MINISTER: I think there are more pressing matters for the<br />
Cabinet to consider at this stage as you'll see.<br />
Sir, after your mooctings with Tun Dr. Ismail and President<br />
Sooharto how do you feel the Australia. n proposals for a new<br />
Asia-Pacific grouping are going how are they being received<br />
now in your view at this stage? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: I found Tun Ismail was interested as, of course,<br />
President Soeharto was in contemplating wider arrangements for<br />
regular discussion among all the nations of this region. I<br />
must say that when I answer questions like this, I'm not to<br />
be taken to endorse terms such as " grouping" which I think is<br />
the first time I've heard this one used. Also I know four-letter<br />
words are popular. People use the term " pact". Now nobody has<br />
suggested grouping; nobody has suggested pacts. What has been<br />
suggested and it's been suggested by the ASEAN nations at their<br />
meeting four weeks ago in Kuala Lumpur and it will be further<br />
discussed at their next meeting next month the prospect of<br />
having some wider forum for discussions. The particular relevance<br />
to Australia is that there is only one arrangement to which we<br />
are a party which would seem to have continuing validity like<br />
that's ANZUS I don't really think one could say it was a<br />
militaristic; it was the least militaristic of all the<br />
arrangements we've had. It wasn't made the basis for Vietnam or<br />
any other objectionable courses overseas. Similarly, Indonesia<br />
and Malaysia value an association with the other three members of<br />
ASEAN which also has continuing validity. The other arrangements<br />
to which Australia is a party SEATO, ASPAC, which we've discussed<br />
earlier, and the five-power arrangements are all anachronistic or<br />
objectionable in part or transitory. Now in these circumstances<br />
it's mere wisdom to contemplate contemporary arrangements which will<br />
have some future.<br />
Prime Minister, can you elaborate on the statement you made c<br />
in Parliament this afternoon that there were reasons why Australiacould<br />
not consider an approach to the International Court on<br />
Chinese nuclear testing?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Because the winds from the Chinese nuclear L&gt; s-.. ing<br />
don't come within thousands of miles of Australia. The winds from<br />
the French ones do. The basis of our claim is that the French are<br />
committing a nuisance in our environment and we are hoping that<br />
the International Court of Justice will take steps to restrain<br />
that nuisance; to enjoin the French from committing it the same<br />
way as can happen between neighbours within the jurisdiction of<br />
any of our domestic courts.<br />
That environment applies only to Australia..?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, no. It applies to all the countries of the<br />
same latitudes.<br />
Doesn't the same argument apply to China, that other countr-e..-<br />
are being affected by fallout?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. Not Australia. Australia is not discernabiy<br />
affected by nuclear tests by China. It is, we believe, discori:..,,. y<br />
affected by nuclear tests by France. It is a sheer climatic m,. i;, er<br />
that the winds encircle the world at particular latitudes. They<br />
don't go from one hemisphere to another. </p>
<p>Sir, are you accepting that with the return of the Pompadou<br />
Government then that the only way this matter can be settled to<br />
your satisfaction is going to the Court that you think the<br />
Pompadou Government will go on with the tests irrespective of any<br />
meeting you have in Paris?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We won't assume that; that the Pompadou Government<br />
will prsist with the tests. We will have the ministerial<br />
discussions which have already been the subject of discussions<br />
between France and Australia. The French suggested there should be<br />
discussions before an apprcach was made to the World Court. We<br />
accepted the suggestion and suggested that they should be<br />
ministerial discussions. The French accepted that suggestion.<br />
Will you go to Paris and London?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think it's unlikely that I'll go. I think it<br />
is likely that one of my senior colleagues will go, probably in<br />
Holy Week. Whether it's Maundy Thursday or Ash Wednesday you're<br />
getting a bit out of my ecclesiastical depth here. The Australian<br />
Parliament will not be sitting in the week in which Good Friday<br />
falls. That would seem to be a convenient week for Australian and<br />
French ministers to discuss this matter in Paris.<br />
Has any preliminary approach been made to the Court about<br />
the proceedings?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, no application has been made to the Cout;&gt;<br />
Mr Whitlam, until 101 days ago when Labor was in opposiiUio<br />
Labor members spoke frequently about the defence sign: ifica: lce o,<br />
Omega. I remember Mr Barnard giving a learned exposition on 1io%<br />
it could be used by nuclear submarines. Now when we contact<br />
Mr Barnard's office we are told it is purely a matter for Mr Jones.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That's right.<br />
When we talk to Mr Jones, we are told he doesn't want to<br />
talk about it. Will you tell us what your Government's attilud<br />
is to Omega what's going to happen about it, and do you expecany<br />
problems within the Party over this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It is a matter for Mr Jones and his Departme. V.<br />
There are no submissions from him on the subject.<br />
Is it of defence significance, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would believe it would have some defence<br />
significance. But 1 frankly don't know enough about it. I'm<br />
leaving it to him to brief mc. But, as rational men, you will<br />
know that there are ve ry few naiLgational, aids which dcn't have<br />
some defence significance. </p>
<p>Mr Barnard in the past has been quite outspoken about it.<br />
You don't feel. that if perhaps, as the expert in what's now the<br />
Cabinet, he should be consulted on this?<br />
PRIME!' MINISTER: He has responsibilities in defence matters. This<br />
is primarily, as far as I concern myself with it, a navigational<br />
matter. You agree with the previous government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: As farc as I know, this is primarily a navigational<br />
matter. It will be taken up by Mr Jones if it is taken up at al.<br />
Prime Minister, could. I ask you a question. As Member for<br />
Werriwa, how will you vote on the Bill of which notice was given<br />
last week to allow abortion on demand?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: In favour.<br />
Prime Minister, in view of the statements by two Ministers<br />
in favour of limiting Australia's population growth, can you<br />
state a general Government policy on this, or ha~ s the Government<br />
a. completely open mind pending the Bornie Report?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It's not of immediate concern to me I must<br />
confess. It's not a matter the Government has discussed.<br />
Everybody else i~ s discussing it. One would expect therefore thai-<br />
Ministers would be among those who discussed it. I don't know how<br />
long Professor Bornie is going to take over his report. hn<br />
it's a couple of years on the original timetable.<br />
On the Flll again, you mentioned that no determination had<br />
been made by Cabinet. Is this because of the lack of time or<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
No other reason?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
Q. There were no queries about some aspects of<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We didn't have time to determine this matter.<br />
Sir, will the R. A. A. F. still take delivery of the first pl<br />
aircraft on Thursday as planned?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know.<br />
A couple of weeks ago Mr Hartley said that the Defence<br />
Department was being runi by America ns. Your comment?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I bclicvc it is bceing run by Australians. I'm<br />
in a better position to know. </p>
<p>Do you think the Americans have any control within the<br />
Department? PRIME MINISTER: None whatever. Australians ccntrol the<br />
Australian Department of Defence.<br />
Prime Minister, in Tasmania last week a member of your<br />
Cabinet, Senator Wriedt, was reported as saying that there was no<br />
room in the Labor Party for the Socialist Left. Was this statemcnt<br />
made will. knowledge and your consent?<br />
PRIMLE MINISTER: I don't know. It wasn't made in my presence.<br />
will not comment on reports of what people have said unless 11vo<br />
seen a text.<br />
You didn't see a text at this stage?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
Sir, do you believe there is room in the Labor Party for the<br />
Socialist Left?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm not going to promote speculation on this<br />
issue. Prime Minister, in the Parliament ( last Thursday I think) o<br />
Treasurer, Mr Crean, said that the Government would be making q. ioe<br />
substantial changes in the Australian taxation structure forx , Ah,<br />
next budget. Can you assure the public that this will not inockj.-c<br />
greater taxation on some members of the Australian public?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There is no submission before Cabinet on thl. s<br />
matter. Qo: Have you any plans, Sir, for an overseas visit which woula<br />
include Great Britain and the United States this year?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There are no definite plans that I've made uG<br />
visit either Britain or the United States this year. It's quJLo<br />
possible I shall. It might help you to know that I have made<br />
definite plans to attend the South Pacific Forum in Apia in 11o i3<br />
Week; to visit Japan to attend the ministerial conference<br />
annual one between Japan and Australia, in Tokyo at the end<br />
of October; to visit the People's Republic of China on the v,-. y<br />
back; to visit Ottawa for the Commonwealth Heads of Government',<br />
Conference in August.<br />
Will you go to Washington during that trip, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think it is very likely, but no arrangeaenAts<br />
have been made. There are a very great number of invitations<br />
I've received Ambassadors and High Commissioners are brlng q:<br />
me personal letters from their Heads of Government or Heads oi<br />
State in great numbers. I told them that it will be pretty well </p>
<p>impossible for me to accept these invitations this year. I<br />
would hope to accept them next year or the year after. There<br />
is one particular one which I must try to accept this year<br />
India to which no Australian Prime Minister has made a visit<br />
since 1959.<br />
Mr Whitlam, have you received a report from the Foreign<br />
Al'tairs Department yet on the arguments for and against the<br />
Tieaty of Friendship and Commerce with Japan and can you say<br />
what your attitude would be on the merits of Australia signing<br />
such a Treaty?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I saw the paper on this a couple of months ago.<br />
I've not made up my mind on the subject, I've not discussed<br />
it with my colleagues. Anerica, Britain, Canada have such<br />
treaties. That weighs with me clearly.<br />
Qo: Prime Minister, would you say what youvould hope Dr Cairns<br />
mission to China would achieve?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Increased trade,<br />
Anything else?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well that will be good0<br />
I'm trying to clear up something Sir. Will the Cabiilt's<br />
failure to have time to deal with the Fll today delay the<br />
physically accepting the first ones later this week on<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. We're having a Cabinet meeting tomorrow " 6o<br />
deal with this and some other unfinished business.<br />
One other thing, Sir. When's Holy Week? Before Easter o'.<br />
the week after?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You were better instructed than I was in -these<br />
matters. You learnt them at school I had to learn them in the J'. r<br />
Force. Under James 1, whom I follow, Holy Week is in the week ii.<br />
which Good Friday falls. Easter Week is the following week<br />
You and Evelyn Waugh, Sir, are the only people I know who<br />
use the term.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, on my staff they refer to it as Pabsovei.,<br />
Sir, your Government is in favour of trade union amalgamaio,.:.<br />
Have you any views on the amalgamation of your political opponicns'<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is not a Dorothy Dix one As a mc ,, i<br />
genera] principle I am convinced that the two-party system is wh,<br />
makes the British Parliamentary system work. I believe that iV </p>
<p>been the experience in Britain, New Zealand, the United States,<br />
Canada, Australia. I believe that our Parliamentary system would<br />
work very much better if there were two parties contesting each<br />
election Federal and State each House, Federal and State.<br />
I believe that the multiplicity of parties debauches the system.<br />
Can I ask one final supplementary to that A public<br />
opinion poll published today says that 55 per cent of Australians<br />
are now in favour of ' first-past-the-post'. Is this likely to<br />
influence your decision announced to a meeting that you won't<br />
introduce it at the next elections but possibly the one after?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't believe that we should change the system.<br />
I undertook this before the elections. We should not change<br />
the system on which the next House of Representatives elections<br />
will be contested. I favour ' first-past-the-post' voting myself<br />
but that doesn't mean that I feel that we should change the<br />
system without having a mandate from the people. I therefore<br />
believe that the next House of Representatives elections would<br />
be contested on the present preferential system or at least on<br />
the optional preferential system.<br />
Gentlemen, I won't be able to give a Press conference next<br />
week. I will be in Canberra for the very special reason that<br />
the Yugoslav Prime Minister is visiting here in the course of his<br />
tour through the whole of this region and that is the day when<br />
there is going to be a Government House luncheon, and it is the<br />
only time when I can have talks with him. We are therefore also<br />
taking the opportunity of having Cabinet meetings morning and<br />
afternoon, and that Night I have a long-standing dinner ongageicint<br />
in Sydney with the High Court.<br />
Will you be having a private briefing with newspaper heads?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Not unless you insist. </p>
