PRESS, RADIO AND TELEVISION CONFERENCE GIVEN<br />
BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. JOHN GORTON, ON<br />
HIS RETURN HOME AFTER THE COMMONWEALTH<br />
PRIME MINISTERS' CONFERENCE, LONDON ,7r<br />
On Board s. s. cdl" S deN. S. W.<br />
PM. Good morning, gentlemen. It's nice to be back! Before<br />
I start on asking you whatever-questions you have in mind, I have got<br />
an announcement to make. That is that The Queen and the Duke of<br />
Edinburgh, at the invitation of the Governments of Australia and New<br />
Zealand, will visit New Zealand and Australia in March and April of<br />
1970. In both countries, they will take part in the celebrations of the<br />
bi-centenary of Captain Cook's voyage. Their visit to Australia will<br />
be confined to the Eastern States to the A. C. T. New South Wales,<br />
Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania. if it is any help to YOU, the last<br />
visit, according to the note I have, was made in February and March<br />
1963.<br />
Q. Some of the papers have said that the Commonwealth<br />
Conference, although to everyone's relief it didn't blow up into a fight,<br />
no-one is taking much notice of whether it did anything else. Do YOU<br />
think in view of Australia's increasing preoccupation with the South<br />
Eastern Asian region that the Commonwealth Conference this time<br />
achieved anything positive?<br />
PM. I don't think it achieved anything positive if you mean<br />
by that did they reach agreement on some plan or some prospect of<br />
combined action or some unified approach to some problems in the<br />
world. No, I don't think it did. What it did do was to provide a forum<br />
where differences of approach, which are natural when there are 28<br />
different countries gathered around a table, were able to be discussed<br />
moderately, temperately, and I think with an increase in understanding<br />
on all sides of the points of view, of the reasons for the points of view<br />
of the people sitting around that table.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, would you care to say how, and if,<br />
your thinking on defence has been affected by your talks in London?<br />
PM. I'll put your question around the other way: Would<br />
I care to say if my thinking on defence has been affected, and if so,<br />
how. The answer is no, I don't believe it has. That answers the<br />
second part too.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, why did you fail to support the<br />
suggestion that aid should be given to the lesser-developed<br />
Commonwealth countries? a / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
PM. I didn't fail to support any such suggestion. There<br />
was a suggestion though I don't remember it being discussed at the<br />
Conference in any detail that the Commonwealth should establish a<br />
multi-lateral aid fund under the control of the Secretary-General of<br />
the Commonwealth, Mr. Arnold Smith, and I failed to support that.<br />
Indeed, I didn't notice anybody else supporting it either, because we<br />
feel that we are contributin~ g already quite considerably through multilateral<br />
United Nations funds and prefer to keep our assistance to the<br />
Commonwealth on a bilateral basis.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, what do you think was the highlight of<br />
the Conference?<br />
PM. Well, I don't know. I don't think I could pick out for<br />
you any particular dramatic moment or any stage where crisis was<br />
almost reached and avoided, which was what I would understand<br />
" highlight" to mean. I don't think there was one. There were a<br />
number of Interesting matters all the way through.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, could you perhaps comment on your<br />
relationship with the African leaders? Mr. Hasluck said on his return<br />
that it was perhaps your smile that made things go so well....<br />
PM. Well, franldy, calling on my memory, the smiles of<br />
all the African leaders were far more beaming and they had far better<br />
teeth than I did:' They were far more attractive. I liked a number<br />
of them. Indeed, I didn't dislike any of them. I liked some more<br />
than others as one always does, whether they are African or Asians<br />
or Australians or English or whatever they might be. But we did,<br />
I think, get on in what seemed to me to be a completely friendly way.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, you appear to have struck up a special<br />
friendship with Mr. Wilson. Would you care to say if you see any<br />
tangible value in this relationship?<br />
PM. If you mean can I see that there is going to be some<br />
discernible difference in matters of trade or matters of defence or<br />
matters of some other specific content, no I can't. But I think there<br />
is tangible benefit, nevertheless, from a close relationship between<br />
the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Prime<br />
Minister of Great Britain. There must be.<br />
Q. Mr. Gorton, is there any prospect of the Canberra<br />
Five-Power conference going to Prime Minister level?<br />
PM. We haven't decided on that yet. We discussed it when<br />
we were sitting around whether it would be on a Prime Ministers'<br />
level or on a Defence Minister s'/ Foreign Ministers' level. It is<br />
obvious, of course, as far as Great Britain is concerned, that Mr.<br />
Wilson would not be coming out here for that conference. But as<br />
far as Mr. Holyoake or the Tunku or Harry Lee </p>
<p>3-<br />
Q. Mr. Wilson wouldn't be coming? Apparenly -the Labor<br />
Party are afraid that he might!<br />
PM. Are they? Well, I wouldn't know about that. But the<br />
question of whether the other four of us attend as Prime Ministers<br />
or not is left for further discussion amongst us.<br />
Q. What do y~ u expect to get out of this Five-Power thing?<br />
PM. Well, as you know, there has been for a considerable<br />
time working parties up in Malaya / Singapore since the last Five-Power<br />
conference, working out this, working out matters of various kinds.<br />
Indeed it was such a report from our own people in such a working party<br />
that led us to the decision already announced to base our troops at<br />
Singapore rather than remain in Terendak. By the time that the next<br />
conference is held I think that these kinds of discussions, at working<br />
level group by foreign service departments, by defence departments<br />
will have enabled more details as to the working out of the general<br />
arrangerrmnts<br />
Q. Do you expect then from this conference to be able to<br />
announce or decide what our role will be in the area?<br />
PM. It will help towards that.<br />
Q. You won't at that time be able to make a fresh...<br />
PM. I didn't say that. But if it didn't result in one being<br />
able to make a definite role statement, and a role is what I am talking<br />
of.. if it didn't enable that, then it would certainly, I think, have<br />
made a considerable advance towards the situation where that could<br />
be.<br />
Q. Will you be able to intimate to the other leaders<br />
PM. I think there will have been a lot of discussions on this<br />
before the meeting takes place, and when the meeting takes place, it<br />
could greatly help to crystallise it. You know, it was agreed at the<br />
last Five-Power conference that there would be another one held in the<br />
first half of this year, but the actual date on which it was to be held was<br />
not decided, nor was the place at which it was to be held decided.<br />
Q. Both these facts having now been decided, and it being<br />
Canberra, I would have thought the other Prime Ministers would expect<br />
you to be far more positive about our role after 1971<br />
PM. How do you know how positive I have been with other<br />
Prime Ministers?<br />
Q. You haven't discussed it with them?<br />
PM. No, not yet! a / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Q. Prime Minister, would you care to elaborate on your<br />
speech to the Australia Club on 17 January about fore~ ign investment<br />
on your terms. Can, you give us some idea of what these terms will be?<br />
PMK What I did was lay down general principles, in the<br />
speech to which you are referring, which we would like to see carried<br />
out. Those general principles being that we would wish to see tf I<br />
can put it this way more selective controls on the takeover of<br />
Australian companies, particularly by foreign companies, the sort of<br />
controls that Great Britain has and so many other nations have themselves.<br />
This is a matter being studied at the moment by the Eggleston Committee<br />
and no doubt we will be getting reports from them, and in the meantime<br />
the Treasury itself has been asked to make a study of the question too.<br />
In relation to the raising of debenture capital inside Australia by<br />
overseas firms, we have indicated that we would wish to see before<br />
debenture capital was raised in that way that an opportunity for<br />
participation in equity was given by those oversees firms. We have<br />
also indi~ cated in a general way that when some new enterprise is started<br />
with overseas capital, we would also like to see the opportunity for<br />
equity participation offered to Australians. This is the subject of<br />
study by the Treasury. The Treasurer informs me that the papers<br />
concerning th is which would come to the Economic Committee of<br />
Cabinet, are well advanced. Subsequently, of course, we would have<br />
to see what it was we were able to do of our own power and what it<br />
was that it would be necessary to be done by States Attorneys -General<br />
and our own Attorney -General, acting in concert.<br />
Q. You have spoken in terms of opportunity for equity<br />
and the necessity for some equity. Have you in mind any size equity<br />
per cent, 10 per cent even 1 per cent is the opportunity for some<br />
equit.....<br />
PM. Yes. I think we would need to have a far more definite<br />
indication than some equity. I would prefer to see the Treasury's<br />
papers and have full discussions on them before I would go any further<br />
than that.<br />
Q. At that time you might be able to make a statement?<br />
PM. Possibly.<br />
Q. While in London, did you meet again Taufa'ahau Tupou<br />
of Tonga, and if so, did you discuss supporting Tongan moves to join<br />
the Commonwealth?<br />
PM. No, I didn't meet him.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, just to return to that foreign<br />
investment question again. These guidelines.. are they in fact<br />
guidelines or just your thinking aloud on the subject? Is the Reserve<br />
Bank obliged to follow your remarks relating to this? a 0 </p>
<p>PM. They will be more than thinking aloud. They will<br />
be an indicLution, in more detail when the papers have been further<br />
advanced, as to what it is that we would wish to see and what it is<br />
that we could arrange to see did happen.<br />
Q. The position at the moment in relation to the raising<br />
of debenture . companies that have been well established here<br />
such as the ESSO organisation have been allowed to raise debenture<br />
funds. Do you intend to change this, or hope to change this?<br />
PM. ESSO/ BHP were allowed to raise debenture funds, I<br />
think not just for ESSO but for ESSO and BHP which is the Australian<br />
component of that company. Also, of course, they have brought in a<br />
great deal of proper overseas capital at the same time.<br />
Q. If I could just switch across to defence for a moment,<br />
Sir. In Kuala Lumpur, the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia<br />
indicated that Malaysia has firm ideas On what sort of a role Australia<br />
should play if it wishes to retain troops in Malaysia. In his own words,<br />
he expects Australia to get involved in intra-regional affairs. He was<br />
talking specifically of Sabah. When you were in London and you were<br />
speaking to the Tunku, did he spell this out to you or wasn't the subject<br />
raised?<br />
PM. The matter of the role of Australian troops in the area<br />
will be a matter for decision by the Australian Government and subsequent<br />
announcement by the Australian Government.<br />
Q. Was Sabah discussed specifically between yourself and<br />
the Tunku?<br />
PM. I don't think I will add anything to what I have just said<br />
to you.<br />
Q. Is this the sort of thing that you might cover in your<br />
promised statement to the House when Parliament resumes, Sir?<br />
PM. One would want to indicate the kind of role envisaged,<br />
not merely the disposition.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, did you gain anything from your<br />
talks with Mr. Trudeau?<br />
PM. Well, all I gained from talks with Mr. Trudeau was<br />
an underlining as it were of what lie has already said publicly that he<br />
felt himself that Canada should look more towards the Pacific and take<br />
more interest in the Pacific than perhaps she had done in the past. There<br />
was no opportunity for me to ask him to spell that out in more detail.<br />
Now, you asked me about anything significant. I think perhaps that is<br />
significant but not detailed and definite. / 6 </p>
<p>6-<br />
Q. Sir,.-you just indicated that -you* wanted to talk about the<br />
future role of our forces in your forthcoming Parliamentary statement.<br />
This must be an advance on your decision in December, when you spoke<br />
to us about this. Now what are the factors that have influenced you in<br />
the interim? You talk now about a disposition as well as a composition.<br />
PM. We have had further discussions, we have had further<br />
advice and we will be having yet further discussions. I would hope by<br />
then we could advauge, because after all, advance is the keynote of this<br />
Government.<br />
Q. Do you think your visit to Mr. Nixon will have any<br />
bearing..... I mean will you be able to spell out anything in the Five-<br />
Power talks before you talk to Mr. Nixon about America's role in Asia?<br />
PM. Well, according to the sort of timetable one envisages,<br />
the Five-Power talks would be in May and I would hope to have been<br />
able to visit Mr. Nixon before May.<br />
Q. Would you care to say when you will make your statement<br />
to Parliament on defence?<br />
PM. Oh, quite soon after Parliament meets. I wouldn't want<br />
to give you a definite day but as soon as possible after Parliament meets.<br />
Q. Mr. Gorton, when in Fiji did you discuss Fiji's<br />
future relations with Australia and did you meet the Chief Minister?<br />
PM. No, I didn't. I got off an aeroplane after having flown<br />
for I don't know how long and boarded the ship and went to sleep.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, I didn't quite catch the request over<br />
here, but were you indicating that your talks with Mr. Nixon would have<br />
a bearing on your attitude at the Five-Power talks?<br />
PM. I was indicating that the timetable envisaged was such<br />
that I would be likely to be speaking to Mr. Nixon before the Five-<br />
Power talks took place.<br />
Q. It follows therefore that his attitudes would influence<br />
our attitudes at the Five-Power talks?<br />
PM. Well, I can only refer to what I have just said, that I<br />
would be hoping to see him before the Five-Power talks took place<br />
in May.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, I take it that you have heard of our<br />
latest Parliamentary romance and your good wishes?<br />
PM. I read something in the ship's bulletin about it. I<br />
haven't heard in any detail if this is accurate. I gather it is accurate?<br />
If so, one extends the best of good wishes to both parties.<br />
Q. Did it come as a surprise to you?<br />
PM. PWM. ell, I had no inkling of it. </p>
<p>-7<br />
Q. Mr. Gorton, the Malays have indicated they would like<br />
to see an agreement emerging out of this latest conference, something<br />
to replace the present Anglo-Malaysian defence agreement. Do you<br />
think this is likely?<br />
PM. I don't see the necessity for it, at any rate now. The<br />
arrangements under which our troops are stationed in the country at<br />
present would seem to me, and according to my advice, would cover<br />
the stationing of our troops there. So it doesn't seem to me to be a<br />
question which does arise.<br />
Q. Have you been in consultation with President Nixon at all?<br />
PM. No. He has been pretty busy. There was a possibility<br />
which could have occurred of my coming back through Washington and<br />
having a completely informal half an hour or three-quarters of an hour<br />
with him on the day before his inauguration. This appeared to me to<br />
offer no great prospects of advantage to either of us and considerale<br />
disadvantage to him when he was getting ready for his inauguration the<br />
next day.<br />
Q. Sir, in view of the decision to do a study into a peaceful<br />
nuclear explosion in the North-West, has the Government moved further<br />
along towards signing the nuclear non-proliferation treaty?<br />
Pm. Our situation on that remains exactly as it has been....<br />
that we are in favour of it in principle, we want to make quite sure it is<br />
effective and efficient and also a good deal more information on a<br />
number of other aspects before we go any further.<br />
Q. There was a reference in the communique from the<br />
Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, Sir, to the Treaty.<br />
Did we take part in any discussions on it?<br />
Pm. No.<br />
Mr. Eggleton. Perhaps one final question, gentlemen.<br />
Q. Is there any suggestion, Sir, that our planes stationed<br />
at Butterworth will move across to Sabah?<br />
PM. No.<br />
Thank you. </p>
