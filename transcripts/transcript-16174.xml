    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister's Chief of Staff, David Epstein, today tendered his resignation with the intention of taking up a new role outside the Australian Government in the New Year. </p>
<p>âI'd like to thank Kevin Rudd for allowing me the opportunity of being Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister of a Federal Labor Governmentâ, Mr Epstein said.</p>
<p>âWhat began as a temporary assignment to lead Kevin Rudd's office to the last federal election turned out to be as successful as anyone could have hoped for, lasting longer than we first planned when the Prime Minister asked me to stay on to help manage Labor's transition to governmentâ.</p>
<p>âI recently advised the Prime Minister that I intended to move on by the end of the year, and I now need to decide on some options that are before me.â</p>
<p>âI'd particularly like to thank my wife and children for supporting me through thick and thin. I think it might be the last time they willingly let me say I am just going off to Canberra for a short time to work on an election campaign.â</p>
<p>âI'm proud to have contributed to a new Australian Government which can allow Australians to re-engage with each other and the rest of the world. There is much to be done, but I'm leaving knowing the foundations are there to do it.â</p>
<p>âSince early 2007, I've been privileged to work with people dedicated to making Australia a better place. They range from PMO staff, ALP ministerial and electorate staff, federal ALP Caucus members, Tim Gartrell and the ALP National Secretariat, the wider Australian labour movement and, since 24 November 2007, members of the Australian Public Serviceâ, Mr Epstein concluded.</p>
<p>Mr Epstein will leave the Prime Minister's Office formally on 14 November, after handing over responsibilities to Deputy-Chief of Staff, Alister Jordan, who will be appointed Chief of Staff. </p>
