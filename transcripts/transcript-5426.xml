PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 26 AUGUST, 1980<br />
STATEMENT TO PARLIAMENT: ENERGY POLICY<br />
AND RELATED RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT<br />
I would like to review the Government's energy policy and<br />
to outline the quite exciting prospects ahead for Australia<br />
in the area of resource development.<br />
Our energy policies are firmly in place and recent events<br />
serve to illustrate their correctness. Successes in this<br />
area are already evident; but in view of the uncertainties<br />
about future oil prices and supplies we cannot relax our<br />
efforts. Associated with the rapid increases in crude oil<br />
prices, there has been a dramatic increase in the demand<br />
for the energy resources with which Australia is richly<br />
endowed. It has provided Australia with great opportunities.<br />
Australia's objective must be to make the most of those<br />
opportunities, while continuing to reduce our vulnerability<br />
to disruptions of world oil supplies, and to further<br />
increases in world oil prices. The energy problem is a<br />
global problem. Failure to make appropriate adjustments<br />
will mean lower world economic growth, higher unemployment<br />
and inflation.<br />
Sustained economic growth in the remainder of the century<br />
will require further major changes in the Western world's<br />
energy usage patterns. Australia is participating in<br />
discussions on energy with our industrialised partners.<br />
within the International Energy Agency. The lEA has<br />
emphasised the need for measures to reduce levels of<br />
imports, to use oil more effectively, and to develop<br />
alternative energy sources. There is over-whelming agreement<br />
within the IEA that domestic oil prices must reflect fully,<br />
movements in internationally traded oil prices.<br />
The Venice Economic Summit in June agreed on the need to<br />
place maximum reliance on realistic pricing to reduce<br />
dependence on crude oil. These strategies represent a full<br />
endorsement of Australia's energy policies especially our<br />
crude oil pricing policy.<br />
Australia's position is one of considerable opportunity,<br />
but at the same time, of some risk to which I shall refer<br />
later. Our energy resources, combined with abundant supplies<br />
of many raw materials, create the opportunity for a large<br />
expansion in energy exports and in energy intensive resource<br />
developments. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
These developments will add greatly to our national product,<br />
to incomes and to wealth, and all Australians stand to benefit<br />
from being members of a wealthier society. The benefits of<br />
economic growth will, as always, extend far beyond those directly<br />
involved: they will extend to all sections of our society.<br />
Our potential is illustrated by increased interest in, and demand<br />
for, direct exports of energy sources from Australia primarily<br />
coal, but also increased desire to process raw materials<br />
in Australia: accelerated plans to increase coal-based<br />
elactricity generating capacity in Australia.<br />
The developments in prosp--ct will., of course, need to comiply<br />
with Government requirements in areas such as the environment,<br />
foreign ownership, and taxation. We are determined that all<br />
companies, both domestic and foreign owned, shall operate in<br />
the interests of all Australians. Australia recognises its<br />
responsibilities in an increasingly energy hungry world. Our<br />
rich resource endowment carries with it an international<br />
responsibility to make our resources available on fair terms<br />
and conditions to countries who are less well endowed than<br />
ourselves. Developed and developing countries alike are vitally<br />
dependent on stable and secure supplies of resources for their<br />
economic advancement and well-being. In turn', Australia expects<br />
consuming countries to provide stable access for our resources<br />
by way of long term contracts. This is absolutely essential<br />
if companies are to commit the huge amounts of risk capital<br />
which are necessary to bring Australia's resource projects on<br />
stream in the 1980s.<br />
Australia'. s greatest energy resource is coal, which comprises<br />
over eighty per cent of our identified energy resources. As<br />
well as providing seventy to eighty per cent of the country's<br />
electricity, coal is a major and rising export product, with<br />
total exports reaching 38 million tonnes in 1978-79. With<br />
increasing emphasis on coal-generated electricity throughout<br />
the world, Australian exports of steaming coal are expected<br />
to increase greatly in the future. The Government is determined<br />
that potential developments should not be held back by lack<br />
of necessary infrastructure.<br />
To this end, projects involving borrowings amounting to around<br />
$ 228 million to provide coal export facilities have already<br />
been approved by the Loan Council under the infrastructure<br />
program. In addition, the Loan Council has approved borrowings<br />
of $ 182 million for up-grading and electrification or the<br />
Waterfall-Port Kembla railway, primarily to facilitate haulage<br />
of coal to the new loader at Port Kembla. Possible infrastructure<br />
borrowings to finance electrification of other coal railways<br />
are under consideration. / 13 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Plans for the North-West Shelf project are firming up, with<br />
arrangements for the joint venturers to supply natural gas to<br />
Western Australia in 1984 and to commence exports of L. N. G.<br />
in 1986. The joint venturers have demonstrated their confidence<br />
in the project by letting contracts for construction of some<br />
of the major facilities, and arranging the borrowings to finance<br />
development of the project.<br />
Australia contains around 16 per cent of the Western world's<br />
low cost reasonably assured uranium reserves. Although<br />
anticipated growth of nuclear power programs in some countries<br />
has been reduced in the last few years, there are signs that<br />
the contribution which nuclear power can make to energy needs<br />
is being reassessed in the light of the over-riding priority<br />
of reducing reliance on oil:'<br />
As the cost of oil continues to rise, it is becoming increasingly<br />
attractive to process raw materials in Australia in preference<br />
to transporting them to other countries where energy costs are<br />
higher or where there is a doubt about the availability of the<br />
required energy. The availability in Australia of low cost<br />
coal-based electricity is of prime importance. The combination<br />
of low cost energy and plentiful supplies of raw materials has<br />
increased the opportunities for economic raw materials processing<br />
in Australia.<br />
The mos t outstanding example here is aluminium smelting. Annual<br />
smelting capaci . ty is expected to expand from 280,000 tonnes<br />
at present to about 1.3 million tonnes over the next five years,<br />
requiring the investm-ent of around $ 2.9 billion. Further<br />
aluminium projects under serious consideration could lift annual<br />
capacity to over two million tonnes in the second half of the<br />
1980s, bringing total potential inve-stment in the industry to<br />
around $ 4.5 billion. In addition, substantial new facilities<br />
are planned for the petrochemical industry, based primarily<br />
on hydrocarbon feedstock material from Bass Strait and the Cooper<br />
Basin. Investment in additional electricity generating capacity<br />
represents one of the greatest development challenges in<br />
Australia. Recognising the very high cost of, and long lead<br />
times asociated with the construction of electricity generating<br />
stations, the Commonwealth has taken a series of initiatives<br />
to encourage and assist the State authorities concerned.<br />
The Commonwealth has encouraged the States to bring forward<br />
proposals for coal-based electricity projects to be financed<br />
under the infrastructure program which it initiated specifically<br />
to facilitate the provision of public sector infrastructure<br />
required to complement the big prospective increase in private<br />
sector investment in development projects.<br />
Borrowings of $ 3 billion have been approved under this program<br />
for electricity generating projects with an estimated total<br />
cost of $ 7.4 billion. In addition, there are under examination<br />
further electricity generating projects proposed, including<br />
those by New South Wales and Queensland for which total<br />
borrowings of about $ 4.4 billion are being sought towards outlays<br />
of $ 9.1 billion, and further proposals from other States have<br />
also been foreshadowed. / 14 </p>
<p>-4<br />
It is difficult to convey the magnitude and importance to<br />
Australia of these developments. Projects already approved will<br />
add 40 per cent to Australian electricity generating capacity<br />
by about 1990. The proposals from New South Wales and Queensland<br />
currently being examined by officials involve almost half as<br />
much again.<br />
Installed generating capacity in Australia has grown dramatically<br />
since 1950: between 1950 and 1960 it grew by 165%~ or 3,500<br />
megawatts; between 1960 and 1970 it grew by 160% or 8,400<br />
megawatts; between 1970 and 1980 it grew by 71% or 10,000<br />
megawatts. On the basis of current plans, installed generating capacity<br />
is expected to rise by a further 9,000 megawatts by 1985 and<br />
a further 12,000 megawatts in the second half of the decade<br />
to reach about 45,000 megawatts by 1990. In this decade the<br />
increase in generating capacity is expected to be greater than<br />
in any previous decade, or even two decades. In 1979, the<br />
Commonwealth in conjunction with New South Wales, Victoria,<br />
South Australia, and Tasmania, set up a committee of inquiry<br />
into electricity generation and sharing of power resources in<br />
South-East Australia.<br />
The main function of the inquiry is to examine the feasibility<br />
of a strongly integrated electricity supply grid in South-East<br />
Australia. Resources-and energy related developments have an immense<br />
potential for generating economic growth in this country and<br />
raising the standard of living of all Australians, but the<br />
realisation of this potential could be imperilled if appropriate<br />
policies are not pursued.<br />
I refer p articularly to: our vulnerability to disruptions to<br />
supplies of crude oil and the need for appropriate energy<br />
policies to minimise the risk; the need for sound economic<br />
policies which will provide an economic environment in which<br />
the massive investments which will be required can be made with<br />
confidence; and the need for unions to play a positive role<br />
in this development, and to avoid the industrial. unrest which<br />
might put at risk major investments by adding to costs and<br />
uncertainties and might prejudice Australia's image as a reliable<br />
supplier. The Commonwealth will continue to consult with the<br />
trade union movement in every effort to improve the industrial<br />
relations climate.<br />
The National Energy Advisory Committee has estimated that if<br />
we do not find more oil * our self-sufficiency in naturally<br />
occurring crude oil is expected to fall from about 67 per cent<br />
today, to about 40 per cent in 1990, and to ten per cent by<br />
the year 2,000.<br />
In order to avoid increasing reliance on potentially unreliable<br />
overseas supplies of oil, Government policies need to be directed<br />
at reducing our dependence on crude oil and towards cushioning<br />
the effect in Australia of any external oil shock. </p>
<p>A6<br />
The cornerstone of our policy is the pricing of indigenous crude<br />
oil at import parity. When we introduced import parity pricing<br />
policy, we knew that it would not be popular; but we believed<br />
that it-was right, and necessary, for the future well-being<br />
of Australia.<br />
Import parity pricin g is vital to conserve our scarce supplies<br />
of liquid fuels, to encourage exploration for oil and to assist<br />
the development of alternative sources of energy this policy<br />
is clearly working.<br />
The case for the policy is overwhelming. It is vital that we<br />
should price our own supplies of oil at the value placed on<br />
them in world markets and not allow them to be used at<br />
artificially low prices. If we were to allow our irreplaceable<br />
indigenous oil reserves to be squandered used up at<br />
unrealistically low prices, it would be an act of extreme<br />
selfishness towards our children.<br />
Only by pricing indigenous crude oil to reflect world prices<br />
can alternative sources of energy, such as shale oil, ethanol,<br />
become viable and thus contribute towards reducing our dependenc6<br />
on imported oil. Because these developments will take time toh<br />
have their full effect we must begin to make-the necessary<br />
adjustments on a wide scale now. The choice we face is between<br />
paying realistic prices for petroleum products now or paying<br />
even higher prices later to producers in other countries when<br />
we may be unnecessarily dependent on expensive and uncertain<br />
supplies of imported oil. The crude oil-levy recovers for<br />
taxpayers generally a substantial part of the windfall profits<br />
which would otherwise accrue to domestic oil producers as oil<br />
prices rise. It has assisted the Government to meet defence<br />
obligations which could not be postponed, to help reduce the<br />
deficit, and to finance cuts in taxation applying from 1 July<br />
1980.<br />
Notwithstanding our adherence to import parity pricing for<br />
indigenous crude, the price of Australian petrol is-amongst<br />
the lowest of OECD countries for example, prices in Europe<br />
range from 550 a litre in the to 620in the United<br />
Kingdom and to 78d a litre in Italy.<br />
Australia's import parity pricing is based on the price set<br />
for " Arabian light", the lowest price at which a major part<br />
of the world's oil is traded. In addition, the Government has<br />
backed up its pricing policy with supplementary measures to<br />
achieve its desired objectives to which I should now like to<br />
refer. Conservation offers the most effective'means of reducing our<br />
reliance on oil in the short term, and has the potential for<br />
further gains as investments are made in energy efficient capital<br />
equipment, vehicles and buildings. Pricing of crude oil at import<br />
parity encourages conservation by ensuring that consumers make<br />
decisions based on realistic prices. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
To encourage conservation, the Government launched last November<br />
a national energy conservation campaign; introduced a national<br />
industrial energy management scheme to promote and foster<br />
efficient energy consumption patterns in industry; will be<br />
seeking a commitment from industry to establish and maintain<br />
energy management programs, under which companies will monitor<br />
energy use, establish goals for reducing energy use, and report<br />
this infcrmation through their industry association.<br />
The available evidence suggests that despite strong economic<br />
growth consumption of petroleum products is slowing in Australia.<br />
Whenever possible C * he Government wishes to replace the use of<br />
petroleum products by other, more readily available substitutes.-<br />
Again, of course, the prime incentive for such substitution<br />
is provided by realistic pricing of petroleum products arising<br />
from import parity pricing.<br />
Natural gas, which is already available in all mainland capital<br />
cities, and in many other centres, provides an attractive<br />
alternative to crude oil products for many use Irs. The Government<br />
is committed to extending natural gas pipelines to provide wider<br />
access to this energy source. Construction has commenced on<br />
a Sydney-Newcastle pipeline and will shortly commence on a line<br />
from Young to Wagga Wagga and Cootamundra. Plans have been<br />
approved for a spur line to Canberra and consultations are being<br />
held with New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia on<br />
the possible extension of the Southern lateral from Wagga Wagga<br />
to Albury. Such a line would-link the Victorian and New South<br />
Wales ga s distribution networks, an d the Cooper Basin and Bass<br />
Strait gas fields.<br />
In June last year, I announced a number of initiatives to<br />
encourage the automotive use of LPG. When it became evident<br />
that massive increases in the world price of LPG threatened<br />
this policy the Minister for National Development and Energy<br />
announced last April measures. designed to restore an element<br />
of certainty to potential automotive users of LPG by tying the<br />
price of LPG to that of indigenous crude oil. These measures<br />
also recognised the position of household consumers of LPG by<br />
providing a temporary subsidy of $ 80 a tonne. This will give<br />
households the opportunity to switch gradually to more suitable<br />
indigenous fuels such as natural gas and electricity.<br />
The Government's import parity pricing policy provides a basic<br />
framework within which alternative fuels can be developed. The<br />
Rundle Shale oil project is a classic example of the<br />
effectiveness of the Government's import parity pricing policy.<br />
The developers of this project have made it clear that the<br />
Government's import parity pricing has been crucial in their<br />
decisions to make the very large investments required in this<br />
project. This emphasises that if we are to compete internationally for<br />
capital, expertise and skills, we will only attract these to<br />
Australia with rewards which are internationally competitive. 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
The first stage of Rundle is expected to cost between<br />
$ 300 million and $ 400 million in 1979 values, and if it is<br />
successful to lead to a project costing many billions of dollars,<br />
and producing about 200,000 barrels of syncrude a day probably<br />
between 25 and 30 percent of our expected requirements at that<br />
time. Its output should come on stream as Bass Strait oil<br />
production declines in the early 1990s. Indeed, it is likely<br />
to be the largest project ever undertaken in Australia, and<br />
one of the largest in the world. Rundle is only one of several<br />
rich oil shale deposits. If it proves to be viable it will<br />
almost certainly lead the way with its technology in the<br />
development of a great new industry for Australia.<br />
Development work is being carried out to arrive at processes<br />
for the economic conversion of coal to oil. Joint ventures have<br />
been set up by Australia with Germany and Japan to investigate<br />
these possibilities. Another promising alternative to crude<br />
oil is ethanol, which can be produced from a number of vegetable<br />
products, such as grain, sugar cane, sugar beet. It has potential<br />
for use primarily as a petrol extender in blends containing<br />
10-20 per cent ethanol.<br />
The Commonwealth Government is providing funding to assist in<br />
an economic and technical evaluation of the potential<br />
contribution of fuel ethanol to Australia's liquid fuel needs.<br />
Ethanol for use as an on-farm or transport fuel has' been exempted<br />
from excise whether produced on the farm or commercially.<br />
Research into alternative energy sources and other aspects of<br />
energy use is necessary to develop viable techniques to reduce<br />
our dependence on oil. The Commonwealth is providing increased<br />
funding for a substantial research and development program.<br />
The response by oil explorers to the Government's policies has<br />
been very pleasing. Confidence of investors has been restored<br />
and exploration activity has increased dramatically. Import<br />
parity pricing has, of course, provided the certainty as to<br />
future returns which has underpinned this recent expansion in<br />
oil search activity.<br />
For instance, the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association<br />
now expects that expenditure on petroleum exploration and<br />
development will exceed $ 715 million in 1980, compared with<br />
$ 150 million in 1975. Last year 108 exploration and development<br />
wells were drilled in Australia and in 1980 it is expected that<br />
121 such wells will be drilled only 29 wells were drilled<br />
in 1975.<br />
The Government has been concerned to provide greater security<br />
of supply of petroelum products to Australian consumers. In<br />
the event of a major interruption to oil supplies we would need<br />
to have adequate stocks of both crude oil and petroleum products. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
Our greatest protection against disruption in international,<br />
oil markets is continued production from Bass Strait. The<br />
Government considers that a prudent objective for stock holdings<br />
in Australia is the equivalent of about 75 days of total<br />
consumption of crude oil and petroleum products. To put this<br />
objective into perspective, at the beginning of 1979 stocks<br />
of crude oil and petroleum products in Australia were equivalent<br />
to about 52 days consumption. They have now risen to about 67<br />
days, and discussions are being held with the oil industry to<br />
increase these stocks to the target level.<br />
Member countries of the IEA are required to hold a minimum level<br />
of stocks equivalent to 90 days of net oil imports in th~ e<br />
previous year. Australia easily complies with this<br />
requirement. Our oil and gas production facilities in Bass Strait<br />
and the associated onshore facilities in Gippsland mets some<br />
62 per cent of our domestic oil consumption and all Victoria' s<br />
natural gas requirements. The Government has taken action in<br />
consultation with Victoria and with Esso to enhance the security<br />
of these installations and to enable more rapid restoration<br />
of supply in the event of disruptions. The Government is acting<br />
to reduce further the risks of accidental collision by vessels<br />
with the offshore installations. On 6 June the Minister for<br />
Defence announced that increased surveillance and related<br />
activities were being, undertaken by units of the Australian<br />
Defence Forces,' including naval and air units, in the vicinity<br />
of the Bass Strait production platforms.<br />
Sound economic managem ent is of fundamental importance to thie<br />
realisation of Australia's great development potential. Continued<br />
downward pressure on inflat * ion and the avoidance of<br />
de-stabilising imbalances in the economy are pre-requisites<br />
for the very large investments required. The Government' s record,<br />
in this area is good and the recent Budget demonstrates our<br />
resolve to continue to pursue anti-inflationary policies.<br />
The Government's foreign investment policy is understood and<br />
accepted by foreign investors. It ensures consistency, equity<br />
and predictability for investors, while ensuring that Australians<br />
get maximum benefits from developments.<br />
Planning, development and operation of major projects involving<br />
the investment of very large sums require reasonable certainty<br />
about costs and timetables. Delays arising from industrial<br />
unrest which could adversely affect both costs and timetables<br />
must therefore be avoided. We also need to avoid industrial<br />
unrest in the production phase particularly in the mining<br />
sector, as disruption to supply can be a source of concern to<br />
our trading partners, as well as to prospective investors. An<br />
essential component of Australia's image as a reliable trading<br />
partner is our ability to meet contracts as scheduled. The<br />
Commonwealth will encourage consultation and co-operation<br />
between management and workers-in an effort to reduce the level<br />
of disputation and to provide a constructive industrial<br />
relations environment.<br />
Events of the past twelve months confirm that the Government's<br />
strategy is working. In 1979-80 consumption of petrol declined<br />
by 0.7 per cent, compared with an average annual increase of<br />
4.6 per cent in the five years precedinig full-import parity<br />
pricing. / 19 </p>
<p>-9<br />
In 1979-80 consumption of heating oil and fuel oil fell by 36<br />
percent and 8 percent, respectively, over 1978-79. Introduction<br />
of natural gas into Sydney is estimated to have saved the<br />
equivalent of 2 million barrels of oil in 1979. Esso and the<br />
Rundle partners have announced that they have signed heads of<br />
agreement todevelop the huge Rundle oil shale deposit.<br />
Exploration for oil has increased dramatically since the<br />
mid-1970s. The latest survey by the Department of Industry and<br />
Commerce has identified investment of $ 29 billion either<br />
committed or in the final feasibility stage in major resource<br />
and manufacturing projects, with some two-thirds being energy<br />
related. Investment in electricity generation and transmission<br />
exceeding $ 19 billion over the next decade has been foreshadowed.<br />
The policies being pursued by the Commonwealth will create the<br />
conditions which encourage the massive investments necessary<br />
to bring the potential resource-based developments to fruition.<br />
The investment of many billions of dollars in resource based<br />
development will stimulate economic growth and-employment. This<br />
investment, the growth of great new industries and the expansion<br />
of others will mean increased incomes and higher living<br />
standards for all Australians. This exciting prospect has<br />
relevance for-all of us: we all stand to participate in it.<br />
Our energy policies are firmly established and their success<br />
is already evident. The Commonwealth will continue to build<br />
on these policies to ensure that Australia is well placed to<br />
meet possible upheavals in the international oil markets. The<br />
measures I have outlined tonight evidence this determination.<br />
Mr. Speaker, in the statement-I have made,' I have provided an<br />
outline of the Government's energy policy and the prospects<br />
for resource development. For the information of Honourable<br />
Members, I now table a more comprehensive statement on these<br />
matters. 000---</p>
