OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
CANBERRA<br />
FOR PRESS 22 May 1978<br />
Joint Statement by the Prime Minister and the Victorian Premier<br />
NORTH-WEST ONE-STOP WELFARE ( NOW) CENTRE COBURG<br />
The Prime Minister and the Victorian Premier have announced<br />
that the NOW Centre, an experimental welfare centre established<br />
by the Royal Co: Lission on Australian Government Administration,<br />
will continue for a further period till June 1979. In addition,<br />
the Centre will expand its present space to include a ground<br />
floor area which will enable the provision of a complete range<br />
of services to the community as originally envisaged by RCAGA<br />
when it set up the experiment.<br />
The experiment will be evaluated during this extended period to<br />
assess the Centre's effect on access to government services<br />
and identification of local needs. Whereas the services at<br />
present provided from the Centre will continue to be provided<br />
in Coburg in the longer term, a decision on the Centre itself<br />
will depend on the results of this final evaluation. </p>
