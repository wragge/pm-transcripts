CEREMONY AT ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS,<br />
EDINBURGH SCOTLAND, ON 28TH<br />
Y 3NE, 1963<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister..-the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert-Menzies<br />
The fellow who lives my kind of life, Sir, moves<br />
along in a kind of rakefs progress. Itm invited to come here<br />
I'm greatly honoured I'm told that I will in effect take an<br />
oath to be a law-abiding citizen not for tile first time, Then<br />
when I say, " This, of course, will be a highly agreeable occasion<br />
with no speeches" the answer is, " 1Well we would like you to say<br />
a few words." A lew words. This is the most masterly understatement<br />
of the century and whenever I am told " a few words", I know<br />
that I am for it. You have discovered that too haven't you.<br />
Yes. " You're for it*" And, really, I felt that I was entitled<br />
to some kind of revenge because when we went in to the ceremony,<br />
never has any politician stood so straight and so silent<br />
( Laughter) as I did for so long. ( Laughter) Then instead<br />
giving me a ch" c: ir because if you give me a chair to sit on I<br />
can write an almost legible signature almost but when I have<br />
to stand up and do it, it is indecipherable ( Laughter) And so<br />
here I am, not knowing whether I am to be penalised or take my<br />
revenge, but I wontt take my revenge for too long.<br />
I was very amused well, " amused" is not the right<br />
word, Sir interested when you were reading the long statement<br />
to which I have by implication attached myself, because I listened<br />
to it and I thought, " Well, now, this is all a matter of protecting<br />
the interests of the College of Physicians and its members," My<br />
Public Orator wher3 is he now? Oh yes, there we are he<br />
produced one of the whimsies of the century when he sa~ d that<br />
there was a long and friendl association between the doctors<br />
and the lawyers, ( Laughter) This, I am bound to say, I have<br />
never previously observed, ( Laughter) because in my respectable<br />
days at the Bar when I was doing a lot of work, I appeared in a<br />
considerable number of medical cases.<br />
Well I am happy to say that by luck I usually<br />
appeared for the loctor ( Laughter) and that is a pretty difficult<br />
job because civil juries, presented by a child with a twisted<br />
arm or a man with a hole in the side of his face, will always<br />
say, " Oh, yes. Yes" This is what they call, loosely, British<br />
justice, you see. They say, " Oh, isn't that terrible. How would<br />
you like that to happen to you. They tell me these doctors have<br />
a defence fund." ( Laughter) And so if you whip the damages down<br />
by a Å 1,000 or Å 1,5O0, you are doing rather well.<br />
But I thought I observed at that time that there<br />
was a sort of occupational friction between Counsel and medical<br />
witnesses, and I think there was something in it, I gave it a<br />
lot of thought at the time. I used to confer with my medical<br />
witnesses and give them fatherly advice -or brotherly advice<br />
at that time of my life, filial advice -as to, you know, what<br />
to beware of, how to play this game, But I think I learned one<br />
of the truths at that time and I pass it on to you for what it<br />
is worth. A medical man is going to be called in a medical<br />
case, He is a doctor being sued for negligence and all the<br />
sentimental stuff piles up one end and there are medical witnesses<br />
to be called and they are eminent men, and like all eminent men,<br />
they have long since risen superior to the alphabet or the<br />
elementary textbook because they have gone beyond it, they've<br />
ooeeeeeee/ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
moved on to a different levl This is true of all of us who<br />
practise a profession. You become so concentrated on what you<br />
might call the upper reaches of the business that you almost<br />
forget the elementary things that you learned years ago, And<br />
of nourse the cross-examiner, like me, who knows nothing whatever<br />
in reality about anatomy or physiology or whatever it may be,<br />
says to the instructor, " What's the leading text-book on this2<br />
Itts a case on the elbow joint." ( Jones on Joints, I think,<br />
used to be the thing) " What is the last edition?" And you get<br />
that and you wrap towels around your head. My wife can remember<br />
me doing this kind of thing. And you swot up the text book and<br />
then you cross-examine some distinguished fellow who knows far<br />
more about it than you will ever know, and you get him to commit<br />
himself to a proposition, and then you say in that smart fashion<br />
that characterises a cross-examiner in a case of this kind, " Do<br />
tell me, is Jones on Joints a recognised textbook?" " Yes"<br />
" What would the last edition be? Would the 1 5th?" ( or whatever<br />
it might be) " Yes" " Now, I wonder if you would mind taking this,<br />
witness, at page 657 and reading out to the jury what it says,"<br />
after he has committed himself to the oppositci proposition.<br />
( Laughter) Well this you may say is indecent and although<br />
I used to think it great fun, I am free to admit that looking<br />
back on it, it was a rather shameful proceeding. But then I<br />
blame the medical witness who ought never to assume that Counsel<br />
is a fool and won't know the techniques of his own trade and<br />
practise them. So when I heard you say, Orator, this morning that<br />
there was an old and friendly association, I was very grateful,<br />
It seemed to me to argue on the part of the medical profession<br />
a quality of compassion and forgiveness which I think is<br />
completely remarkable,, ( Laughter) And the best proof of that,<br />
of course, is that, as you have pointed out to me, I am a<br />
physician in Australia and I am a physician here.<br />
Do you mind if I give you a little boastful remark,<br />
Sir? I mentioned it because I am still rattled by it. I am<br />
a gynaecologist and obstetri~ cian ( Laughter) of the Royal College<br />
( Laughter) though when they gave me a searching look they were<br />
not clear whether I appeared as practitioner or as a patient.<br />
( Laughter) I am a Doctor of Science in some university somewhere,<br />
I am an architect in fact, I have been given, except<br />
in the law about which I do kno. w something, I have been given<br />
honorary degrees and honorary fellowships which have been<br />
cunningly devised to relate to the things of which I am most<br />
ignorant. ( Laughter) This, I think, is very satisfactory.<br />
But at the some time Sir, I would like to recall<br />
the fact that I was able once to do the medical profession in<br />
my own country some sm.-all service. I was sitting in Opposition<br />
I was Leader of the Opposition in about 19418 when this happened<br />
when an amendment to the Constitution was being promoted by<br />
the then Government to give the Commonwealth Parliament power<br />
over medical health services, among other things. This had<br />
become necessary because a doubt had been exposed by the High<br />
Court and, of course, in a Federal system, you know, the limitations<br />
of power are constantly the subject of dispute in the<br />
courts. We, in Opposition, felt that the Commonwealth ought<br />
to have power to provide medical health and pharmaceutical<br />
benefits and things of this kind, but there was some anxiety<br />
in the medical profession as to whether this would enable thKe<br />
Government, which was a socialist government, to institute the<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
system of nationalised medicine. This was a very real apprehension<br />
and my little contribution to history is that for the<br />
first and only time in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament<br />
in Australia, the Loader of the Opposition got an amendment<br />
accepted to a constitutional bill and may amendment was to include<br />
in brackets " but not so as to include any form of civil conscription"<br />
which blew out all the prospect of a nationalised,, medical<br />
health service. It turned out later on that that was what it did<br />
because there was a challenge in the High Court on some bill<br />
that had been introduced, and the High Court upheld the effect<br />
of this amendment. I'm not quoting the words with precision,<br />
but it did prevent the creation in Australi" and does it<br />
permanently of what you might call a completely nationalised<br />
medical health service, Now that doesn't moan that you can't<br />
have a government medical service. Wre have one. I think we<br />
have a remarkably good one in Australia, but it is all based on<br />
the voluntary principle, on the basis of insurance with private<br />
effort and with Government subsidy and backing, but it loaves<br />
completely untouched the choice of the patient. The doctorpatient<br />
relationship remains free, inviolate, but when the<br />
treatment has occurred between the doctor of choice and the<br />
patient who has gone to him, then the paymunts that are made<br />
are adjusted ultimately through some insurance scheme like the<br />
Hospital Benefits Association. I have forgotten what the<br />
total is but by and large you can take it that about 90 per cent.<br />
of the fee in a normal case comes from one or other of those<br />
two sources. But the free choice of doctor by the patient<br />
remains and, if I may say so, we think this is not too bad and<br />
we think that this is increasingly known in other countries and<br />
approved of, perhaps envied in other countries.<br />
But I do simply say this, that I am most happy to<br />
have an obligation to defend the interests of the College and<br />
its members because I believe that in the new world, the world<br />
that we are living in the function of the medical man is<br />
increasingly important, increasingly difficult, lie is called<br />
upon for a most complex body of new knowlodge, new techniques<br />
and new expertise in this world, u believe that it is<br />
essential that the therapy of the individual confidence in the<br />
man should not be lost because I am sure that it is of tremendous<br />
importance and I am sure that you believe it too.<br />
Now, Sir, the only other thing I want to say to<br />
you, because I am really not making a speech but merely offering<br />
a few words, is that I have been a bit taken aback by discovering<br />
that there is an argument about how my name should be produced.<br />
( Laughter) It turns out that the Aberdonians say " Menzies"<br />
though I must say that the Lord Lyon this morning seemed to<br />
me to take a rather insistent view that it was " Mingies"<br />
( Laughter) and in Edinburgh they say " Mingies" and in these<br />
parts of Glasgow which have been adversely affected by the<br />
Irish, they call it " Menzies", So who is to know? All I can<br />
tell you is what I said was it to you, Sir? this morning<br />
that at one of these big Dinners in London where there is a<br />
red-coated Master of Ceremionies and where I myself heaven<br />
help me -have made many speeches to patriotic gatherings of<br />
800 people and 1,000 people and that sort of thing this old<br />
boy who runs through the name of the man he's announcing to<br />
the last flourish of " Justice of the Peace" you know<br />
wonderful business having introduced me about four times,<br />
nipped across to me this time and said and he had always<br />
delivered this in a Home Counties accent which was impeccable<br />
he came across to me and said, " Excluse me, Sir, but am I to </p>
<p>~ 1+<br />
introduce ye as ' Menzies' or by yelre proper namae?" ( Laughter)<br />
And I said, " By my proper namel by all means," and so out it came<br />
with a fine Doric quality, Home Counties entirely forgotten.<br />
The only other thing I want to say to you on this<br />
fascinating question of my nane is that in England, I think,<br />
more than in Scotlandl the pronunciation of names and of place<br />
names is calculated cunningly and wickedly to put the visitor<br />
at a disadvantage. ( Laughter) It is. I mean, people say,<br />
" Well, I visited they pause, and they 11say, I<br />
visited Beaulieu 11 only to be told it is " Bewley". W. ell this<br />
is very difficuli. It is like Cirencester " Cissister".<br />
Chichester which is called " Chychester" in Australia. This<br />
is all very difficult.<br />
Many years ago I found myself appearing in the<br />
Judicial Committee in a case which invv~ lved a patent of some<br />
novelty and the name of the case was Paper Sacks Ltd. versus<br />
Cowper, who was an eminently respectable solicitor in Sydney<br />
and a great friend of mine; but he was on the other side.<br />
His name had been given to this case for some reason of a<br />
techhical kind, and so it was Paper Sacks versus Cowper in<br />
Australia and versus " Cooper" before the Judicial Committee.<br />
One of my opponents in the case was a Sydney Counsel who<br />
discovered not only thzit Cowper had become " Cooper" by crossing<br />
the ocean but that Menzies had become " Mingies" in the course<br />
of the same voyag~ e, because the Judicial Committee had none<br />
of your hesitation they said "' Mingies," you see. And so<br />
this fellow from Sydney wrote some verse I'll just quote it<br />
to you. It has always stuck in my mind. It was rather nice; it<br />
was a nice double rhyming scheme. dhen I have given it to you<br />
I will conclude* It said<br />
Said M~ enzies to Cooper<br />
I swear like a trooper<br />
To be classed so it seems<br />
With the Chumleys ( Cholmondoleys)<br />
and Weems ( Wemyss)<br />
Said Cowper to Mingies<br />
Look here, Bob, the thing is<br />
To alter our names<br />
To Tompkins and James,<br />
All you have to do is to remember that simple quartet, you see,<br />
and all these things will be solved.<br />
Well, now, I mustn't resume my seat as they say in<br />
Parliament without telling you that you have given infinite<br />
pleasure today to three people my wife, myself and my eldest<br />
son who is here for the first time and to whom this experience<br />
will be unforgettable, and our joy is added to by the fact that<br />
we are in Edinburgh and the joy is further added to by the fact<br />
that we are among our friends and if I may say so, further added<br />
to by the fact that we are in a street and in a building and in<br />
a city in which, from time to time, you can see the work of the<br />
greatest architect of our age, or any age, Robert Adam. I hope<br />
I may say that in Edinburgh which has so much of his work,<br />
Thank you so much, Sir. We are delighted, we are<br />
honoured and you have filled us with happy memories. </p>
