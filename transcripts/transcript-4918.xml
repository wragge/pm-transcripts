LOAN COUNCIL FINANCING OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS<br />
The Commonwealth and State Governments, meeting as<br />
the Loan Council, today approved an entirely new borrowing<br />
program which will have a significant impact on Australia's<br />
development. The Loan Council, acting in accordance with guidelines<br />
set at its meeting last June, approved the first projects to<br />
form part of this new program.<br />
The projects approved cover all six States and<br />
provide for a total borrowing program of $ 1767 million over<br />
eight years, commencing with borrowings of $ 158 million . this<br />
financial year. This approval is the culmination of more than two<br />
years of intensive study and discussion. Work commenced in<br />
June 1976 on the examination of particular financing needs in<br />
the provision of infrastructure, especially for development<br />
projects. This work arose out of a concern that future major<br />
development projects, with financing requirements which could<br />
not be accommodated within normal " semi-government" borrowing<br />
programs, might be impeded unless a system of providing special<br />
additions to normal borrowing could be developed.<br />
At its meeting in June 1978, the Loan Council adopted<br />
= trrangements for infrastructure financing which set out guidelines<br />
for consideration by it of proposals for special additions to<br />
the normal annual " semi-government" borrowing programs and<br />
for overseas borrowing by authorities.<br />
I Under the guidelines, these special additions would<br />
be for proposals which could not be reasonably accommodated within<br />
resou. qces normally available to the Government and the authority;<br />
wohri cpuhb lpirco viudtei listeyr viecnetse rporfi skeisn; d s naonrdm wahlilcyh prhoavvei desdp ebcyi alGovernment<br />
significance for development. Factors which would properly<br />
be taken into account in considering proposals would include<br />
whether the project: ,/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
contributed to the development of Australia's<br />
national resources;<br />
contributed to the balance of payments;<br />
helped strengthen the structure of industry;<br />
contributed to emp Joyment.<br />
These additional borrowings were thus designed to<br />
provide essential facilities which would encourage productive<br />
enterprises to commence or expand. In many instances, the<br />
provision of new infrastructure would speed up the development<br />
of new export-oriented natural resource projects in<br />
decentralised areas.<br />
The Loan Council decided in June it would consider as soon<br />
as practicable later this year the first batch of projects<br />
submitted by the States within these guidelines. The<br />
Conumonwealth Budget was framed in the'knowledge that applications<br />
for such additional borrowings commencing in 1978/ 79 would be<br />
considered by Loan Council.<br />
The State Governments proposed a total of 12 projects<br />
for special borrowing under the program and since June these<br />
projects have been the subject of intensive examination and<br />
report by Commonwealth and State officials.<br />
In assessing its attitude to the projects, the<br />
Commonwealth has been particularly conscious of its overall<br />
economic managerent responsibilities and the need to ensure<br />
that the level of special borrowings approved, both in total<br />
and annual requirements, is consistent with the Commonwealth's<br />
fiscal and monetary policy objectives. There could be no<br />
question of allowing the level of special borrowings to<br />
compromise our steady progress towards economic recovery.<br />
Subject to this overriding economic policy constraint,<br />
the individual projects were assessed in relation to the<br />
program guidelines. one major group of projects approved will encourage<br />
further substantial private development of our natural resour-ces.<br />
The development of Australia's coal export industry<br />
r quire3 the provision of efficient port facilities for loading<br />
thlre coal. There are two coal-loader projects one from<br />
New South Wales, the other from Queensland. a Wt </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Port Kembla Balmain Coal Loader Project<br />
( special borrowing addition of $ 89 million approved)<br />
This involves a new coal loader and stockpiling<br />
facilities at Port Kembla, more than doubling annual<br />
capacity; and augmentation of the Balmain loader to<br />
increase its capacity significantly. This extra<br />
loader capacity is required to accommodate the expansion<br />
of mines in the West, South West and Southern coalfields.<br />
The project will enhance economic growth and nonmetropolitan<br />
employment in N. S. W.<br />
Coal Export Facilities at Hay Point ( Qld.)<br />
( special borrowing addition of $ 75 million approved)<br />
involving the provision, at Hay Point, south of<br />
Mackay, of on-shore facilities such as rail unloading<br />
and stockpile area and off-shore facilities including<br />
trestle and conveyor, a berth and dredging the<br />
special addition is for the off-shore facilities.<br />
The project will enable the development of major<br />
export coal projects ( German Creek and Oaky Creek)<br />
around which new townships will be developed. The<br />
coal development will add to Queensland State<br />
revenues through payroll tax, royalties and rail<br />
freight.<br />
Two other projects closely related to major private<br />
resource development will not involve immediate expenditure<br />
in 1978/ 79. However, approval now will indicate to the companies<br />
concerned that the necessary infrastructure is assured and<br />
encourage them to make favourable decisions for development.<br />
Redcliff Project<br />
( special borrowing addition of $ 186 million approved)<br />
plans to use liquid hydrocarbons from the Cooper<br />
Basin as feedstock for a petrochemical plant at<br />
Redcliff. The special addition of $ 186 million is<br />
to provide a power station, pipelines for liquids<br />
and gas and other infrastructure to service the<br />
petrochemical complex. The Redcliff project will allow<br />
the inmediate exploitation of natural gas liquid<br />
reserves which would ytherwise be flared and will<br />
accelerate the development of crude oil and condensate<br />
resources. It will provide significant regional<br />
benefits to South Australia.<br />
Dampier-Perth Gas Pipeline<br />
( special borrowing addition of $ 416 million approved)<br />
involving the construction of a pipeline to bring<br />
natural gas 1,500 kilometres from Dampier to Perth,<br />
for use in Perth and the South West of the State.<br />
b / 4 </p>
<p>4-<br />
The project is an integral part of the $ 3,000 million<br />
North-West Shelf project and will enable about half<br />
the natural gas resources to be consumied in Australia.<br />
Natural gas supplied to the Perth/ South West region<br />
will assist the future broadening of the industrial<br />
base of Western Australia.<br />
One other project provides infrastructure for a<br />
specific private developirznt.<br />
Wars ley Alumina Project<br />
( special borrow; ing addition of $ 41 million approved)<br />
involves the establishment of a bauxite-alumrina<br />
project in the South Wes-t of Western Australia the<br />
special additions are to provide railway and water<br />
supply facilities for the project. The infrastructure<br />
will contribute to the development of a national<br />
resources project which will provide employment in tne<br />
State and be a stimulus to decentralisation. I<br />
The second major group of projects approved will help<br />
to meet increased investment in the provision of electricity<br />
generating capacity. These projects are of a kind normally<br />
provided by public utilities and reflect the fact that additions<br />
to electricity generating capacity need to be. made in large<br />
blocks. The provision of adequate generating capacity is<br />
necessary for the continued development of Australian industry-.<br />
1hese projects are:<br />
Loy Yanq Power Station ( Vic.)<br />
( special borrowing addition of $ 343 million approved)<br />
a project comprising an open cut brown coal mine,<br />
two power stations and associated works located<br />
near Traralgon in the Latrobe Valley.. The project<br />
is the main element in the long-term expansion<br />
program for meeting Victoria's electricity needs,<br />
and will contribute to the development of Victoria's<br />
brown coal reserves. Industry development will be<br />
assisted and there will be a stimulus to employment. */ 51 </p>
<p>Hydro Electric Power Develop~ nent ( Tas)<br />
( special borrowing addition 6f $ 75 million approved)<br />
involving assistance in the funding of peak capital<br />
expenditure in the further development of Tasmania's<br />
hydro-electric power system. The large scale<br />
production of relatively low cost power, using<br />
Tasmania's abundant water resources, is a major<br />
factor in the development of the Tasmanian economy<br />
and an incentive for industrial investment.<br />
Eraring Electricity Project<br />
( special borrowing addition of $ 200 million approved)<br />
involving a major new power station at Eraring on.<br />
Lake Macquarie with associated mines and transmission<br />
lines together with major expansion at two other<br />
stations. The project is needed for the provision<br />
of adequate electrical energy in N. S. W. in the first<br />
half of the 1980' s. Proposed development in the<br />
coal and forest product industries might not proceed<br />
in its absence. Significant employment will bd<br />
created in both the construction and operating phases.<br />
Power Station Projecth ( Qld)<br />
( special borrowing addition of $ 130 million approved)<br />
including completion of the Gladstone power station,<br />
completion of the Wivenhoe pump storage hydro-electric<br />
project and work on first stage of the new Tarong<br />
power station. The projects will require the<br />
development of further coal mines and will make<br />
productive use of available water resources. The<br />
provision of adequate power supplies will aid<br />
Queensland industrial development.<br />
Pilbara Region -Power Supply Integration<br />
( special borrowing addition of $ 111 million approved)<br />
the power generating capacity in the Pilbaira region<br />
has developed in a fragmented manner by individual<br />
companies and the State Energy Commission is seeking<br />
to integrate the system. The integration will<br />
contribute to a rationalisation and more judicious<br />
use of resources and should help decentralisation,<br />
stimulate industria~ l demand and lead to increased<br />
employment.<br />
There are two other projects that do not fall into the above<br />
categories. / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
World Trade Centre ( Vic)<br />
( special borrowing addition of $ 56 million approved)<br />
The proposal covers the first stage of the World<br />
Trade Centre complex to be constructed on behalf of<br />
the Melbourne Harbour Trust on the edge of the central<br />
business district of Melbourne. Melbourne is<br />
Australia's leading export port and the proposed<br />
trade centre will be a focal, point 1for the development<br />
of overseas markets, making a positive contribution to<br />
Australia's balance of payments. In giving its<br />
approval to this project, the Loan Council agreed<br />
unanimously that approval was on the basis that no<br />
other State would in the future bring forward a<br />
similar proposal under the infrastructure guidelines.<br />
Water Supply Projects ( Tas)<br />
( special borrowing addition! of $ 35 million approved)<br />
involving the augmentation of supply to the Hobart<br />
metropolitan area and to the North Esk Region and<br />
the construction of a regional supply system for the<br />
North West of Tasmania. Each of the projects makes<br />
use of Tasmania' s abundant water resources and will<br />
contribute to industrial development in the Stae.<br />
As a result of this approval, the Tasmanian Premier<br />
agreed that his State would not be seeking any funds<br />
under the current National Water Resources Program.<br />
The additional borrowings approval by the Loan Council<br />
will be phased over the eight years beginning in 1978-79. The<br />
phasing of the projects is such * that there is a relatively<br />
steady borrowing requirement year by year. In 1978-79, the<br />
additional borrowings will be a maximum of $ 158 million. over<br />
the following five years, the annual additional borrowings will be<br />
1979-80 $ 393 million, 1980-81 $ 316 million, 1981-82 $ 3113 million,<br />
1982-83 $ 236 million, 1983-84 $ 283 million. The Commonwealth<br />
Government considers this program to be appropriate and<br />
consistent with the Government's fiscal and monetary policies<br />
and thus will assist in the nation's economic recovery.<br />
Attachment 1 shows the total sum approved for special<br />
borrowing, project by project, and the phasing. Attachment 2<br />
provides more detailed infomration on the individual projects.<br />
Loan Council decided that applications for overseas<br />
borrowing in connection ' with the approved projects will require<br />
3' aparate Loain Council consideration in the light of particular<br />
recauirements of the project concerned and economic and financial<br />
c. rcumstances at the time. In current circumstances,.<br />
applications for overseas borrowings in respect of the 1978-79<br />
approvals could be expected to receive favourable consideration<br />
by Loan Council. / 17 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
I would emphasise the care which has gone into the<br />
planning of this impurtant new initiative and the degree of<br />
co-operation attained between the Commonwealth and th4 States.<br />
Commonwealth and State Treasury off i 4ers have been wo ~ king<br />
together on the mratter since June 1916.<br />
The Program will be a continuing one to which new<br />
and worthwhile projects will be added as the initial projects<br />
progress and ' reach completion. Additions to the Program will<br />
of course be subject to Loan Council scrutiny against the<br />
program guidelines and the economic circumstances of the time.<br />
In view of the size of the initial project borrowings approved<br />
today and the concentration of these borrowings in the earlieryears,<br />
the Commonwealth indicated that it would not favour any<br />
additions to the. Program for the next three years.<br />
Loan Council acknowledged that the additional<br />
borrowings approved under this program will need to be borne<br />
in mind in considering the normal " semi-government" borrowing<br />
program in June.<br />
It was unanimously agreed that as far as possible,<br />
all capital equipment required for the projects should be<br />
purchased from Australian manufacturers.<br />
This important initiative is essentially a vehicle<br />
for the long term development of our nation and its resources.<br />
It is designed to strengthen and deepen our capital structure<br />
and hence increase our productive capacity.<br />
The projects will, in the shorter term, provide a<br />
useful addition to employment opportunities and will have longer<br />
term effects arising from privatg sector development which is<br />
encouraged and assisted by the infrastructure provided.<br />
This program is the start of a new era in Commonwealth/<br />
State co-operation in development.* More importantly, it<br />
provides tangible evidence of the confidence which all Governments<br />
in Australia have in our future development -it is our vote of<br />
confidence in the future of Australia. </p>

<p>ERARING ELECTRICITY PROJECT ( NSW)<br />
Brief Description A major new station at Eraring on Lake Macquarie of<br />
4 x 660 MW units, and associated mines and transmission lines,<br />
together with major expansions at two other stations ( Vales<br />
Point and Wallerawang) create a peak expenditure situation<br />
over the three years commencing 1978-79. Work for the first<br />
two units at Eraring has been in progress since 1977 and<br />
contracts have been let for some components of the other two<br />
units. Funding Arrangements A total of $ 682 million at June 1978 prices, will be<br />
required over the three years. $ 456 million of this is required<br />
for Eraring. The availability of funds from internal generation,<br />
depletion of reserves and normal loan allocations is anticipated<br />
to be $ 472 million, at June 1978 prices, leaving a shortfall<br />
of $ 210 million. Special additions are sought for this.<br />
Phasing Expenditure at June 1978 prices, in the three years<br />
commencing 1978-79 of $ 211, $ 238 and $ 233 million ( total<br />
program) and $ 87, $ 174 and $ 195 million ( Eraring). Very<br />
little flexibility exists in these timings. The special<br />
additions to borrowings will be required as follows:<br />
1978-79 1979-80 1980-81<br />
Sm 55 80<br />
General Comments Project is needed for the provision of adequate<br />
electrical energy in New South Wales in the first half of the<br />
1980' s. Proposed developments in the coal industry and forest<br />
product industry might not proceed in the absence of clear<br />
indication of energy availability.<br />
Improvement of employment opportunities in a country<br />
region a peak of 1,100 workers will be employed during<br />
construction and some 1,700 will be required for operating the<br />
power stations and coal mines. </p>
<p>COAL LOADING FACILITIES ( NSW)<br />
Brief Description New coal loader and stockpiles for Port Kembla<br />
to more than double annual capacity to 15 million tonnes<br />
and to increase from 70,000 to 110,000 tonnes the size of<br />
ships that can be handled. Augmentation of Balmain loader<br />
and stockpiles to increase capacity from 2.8 to 4.5 million<br />
tonnes per annum and ship size from 40,000 to 55,000 tonnes.<br />
Tenders called for some parts of the works, others in<br />
advanced stages of planning.<br />
Funding Arrangements Expected cost at June 1978 prices of $ 89 million.<br />
Other commitments of industry and Maritime Services Board<br />
necessitate financing in full by special additions.<br />
Phasing Special additions required in the three years<br />
commencing 1978/ 79 of $ 24, $ 32 and $ 33 million at June<br />
1978 prices. Delayed completion would be at the expense<br />
of economic development, employment and sales of export<br />
coal. General Comments Exports of coal from the West, South West and<br />
Southern Coal fields already exceed loader capacity.<br />
Mines cannot expand unless loaders are provided and the<br />
increased ship sizes able to be handled will aid market<br />
diversification. Will benefit balance of payments through<br />
increased export earnings.<br />
Benefits for non-metropolitan employment: will<br />
aid decentralisation; will contribute to New South Wales<br />
State revenues.<br />
I </p>
<p>LOY YANG POWER STATION ( VIC)<br />
Brief Description The Loy Yang project is a major base-load power<br />
development comprising an open cut brown coal mine, two power<br />
stations, each with an installed capacity of 2000 MW, and<br />
associated works located near Traralgon in the Latrobe Valley<br />
( approximately 160 kilometres from Melbourne).<br />
Preliminary work on the Iroject commenced on site<br />
early in 1977 and all major contracts for the first 2000 MW<br />
stage have been let.<br />
Funding Arrangements The project, to be constructed by the State Electricity<br />
Commission of Victoria, is estimated to cost $ 2,050 million at<br />
June 1978 prices. Special additions to the Commission's borrowing program<br />
totalling $ 343 million at June 1978 prices, are required to<br />
assist in financing the initial stages of the project.<br />
Phas ing The special additions to borrowing would be required<br />
as follows: $ m 1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 1981 -82 1982-83<br />
88 37 119 64<br />
It is essential for construction work to continue<br />
as planned in order to ensure that the first generating capacity<br />
will be available for commission in 1983/ 84.<br />
General Comments The Loy Yang project is the main element in the<br />
State Electricity Commission's long-term expansion program<br />
for meeting Victoria's electricity needs.<br />
During construction of the project there will be<br />
some 1,500 people directly employed. On completion the<br />
project will directly employ an additional 1,000 persons in<br />
the Latrobe Valley. </p>
<p>WORLD TRADE CENTRE, MELBOURNE ( VIC)<br />
Brief Description The proposal covers the first stage of the World<br />
Trade Centre complex proposal for construction by the<br />
Melbourne Harbour Trust on the edge of the central business<br />
district of Melbourne. The first stage of the complex comprises<br />
the world trade centre itself, a trade mart and office<br />
accommodation foi organisations and firms having a close link<br />
with overseas trade, including the Melbourne Harbor Trust.<br />
Tenders have been called for this stage of the project.<br />
Funding Arrangements The project will be constructed by the Melbourne<br />
Harbor Trust and a special addition of $ 55.9 million is sought<br />
to the Trust's borrowing program.<br />
A decision on the availability of funds is required<br />
to enable work to commence during the last quarter of 1978<br />
calendar year.<br />
Phasing The special addition to borrowing would be made as<br />
f oll1ows: 1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82<br />
24 20 2<br />
As tenders ' have been called work could commence as<br />
soon as funds have been approved.<br />
General Comments Melbourne is Australia's leading export port.<br />
The proposed trade centre will be a focal point for the<br />
development of overseas markets and for information on<br />
commodity prices, freight and insurance. By promoting export<br />
opportunities for Australian industry it could make a positive<br />
contribution to Australia's balance of payments.<br />
During the construction period the project will<br />
provide employment for more than 1,000 people. In operation<br />
it is exp~ ected to increase the efficiency of port administration.<br />
I e </p>
<p>COAL EXPORT FACILITIES AT HAY POINT ( OLD)<br />
Brief Description Provision of new coal loading facilities at Hay Point,<br />
south of Mackay, to be operational by 1981 to meet planned coal<br />
export growth. On-shore facilities include rail unloading and<br />
stockpile area while off-shore facilities include trestle and<br />
conveyor, a berth and dredging.<br />
Proposed capacity is 12 million tonnes per annum with<br />
provision for future expansion to 24 million tonnes per annum.<br />
Funding Arrangements Estimated cost of facilities is $ 115 million at<br />
current prices. Proposed that private sector ( coal developers) will<br />
provide finance for the on-shore facilities by way of security<br />
c'eposit on shared basis, approximate cost $ 40 million.<br />
In addition private sector will meet the cost of other mining<br />
infrastructure ( township facilities, major railway improvements,<br />
power and water supply). This cannot be fully quantified at<br />
this stat e but the cost of railway improvements alone for the<br />
first tL-wo mines ( which will use only half the proposed capacity)<br />
will be approximately $ 100 million.<br />
Proposed that State meet the cost of off-shore<br />
facilities, estimated cost of $ 75 million at current p~ rices<br />
all b. T special additions.<br />
PhasingZ 1979-80 $ 40 million, 1980-81-$ 35 million.<br />
Detailed planning and construction needs to commence<br />
by end 1978 to enable facilities to be ready for use by 1981<br />
when the first mining project is expected to begin shipments.<br />
General Comments The provision of the facilities will enable the<br />
development of major export coal projects in Queensland ( German,<br />
Creek and Oaky Creek). The projects will contribute significantly<br />
to Australia's balance of payments through increased export<br />
earnings. There would be additions to Queensland State<br />
revenues through payroll tax, royalties and rail freight.<br />
It is expected that townships of around 4,000-5,000<br />
people will developed for each mine. </p>
<p>I. POWER STATION PROJECTS ( OLD)<br />
Brief Description To cover projected growth in demand, additional<br />
electricity capacity will be required over the next five<br />
years, including completion of Gladstone power station<br />
by 1981 ( additional 550 MW).<br />
Completion of Wivenhoe pump storage<br />
hydro-electric project by end of<br />
1983 ( 500 MW), and<br />
Work on first set of new Tarong power<br />
station to be completed by 1985<br />
( total. Tarong 1,400 MW).<br />
Funding Arrangements Total requirement is in excess of $ 1,200 million<br />
( at current costs), $ 130 million of which is required as a<br />
special addition balance to be funded internally including<br />
normal loan allocation.<br />
Phasing 1979-80 $ 70 million, and 1981-82 260 million.<br />
Approval required now to enable planning of development<br />
and level of power tariffs.<br />
General Comments The projects are needed to maintain power supply<br />
in the State at anticipated levels. The stations at Gladstone<br />
and Tarong will require the development of further coal mines;<br />
while Wivenhoe will make use of avcilable water resources.<br />
The development of industry in Queensland will be aided by the<br />
provision of adequate pover supplies. </p>
<p>REDCLIFF ( SA)<br />
Brief Description The project plans to use liquid hydrocarbons from<br />
the Cooper Basin in South Australia as feedstock for a<br />
petrochemical plant at Redcliff. The special addition to the<br />
Loan Council borrowing program is to provide a power station,<br />
pipelines for liquids and gas and other infrastructure to<br />
service a petrochemical complex at Redcliff. The current<br />
status is that Dow Chemical ( Aust) Ltd is ready to carry out<br />
detailed feasibility studies as soon as infrastructure is<br />
assured. Funding Arrangements Total investment in the Redcliff project is estimated<br />
at W95 million ( in 1978 prices).<br />
A private sector component of $ 649 million<br />
is to be financed by Dow and the Cooper<br />
Basin Producers.<br />
A public sector component for infrastructure<br />
of $ 256 million is to be funded by:<br />
South Australian Government $ 253.5 million<br />
Australian National Railways $ 2.8 million.<br />
A special addition of $ 186 million is<br />
required by South Australia as part of<br />
its contribution.<br />
Phas ing The special addition to borrowings would be raised<br />
as follows: 19-0 1980-81 1981-82 1982-83 1983-84<br />
$ m 11 70 96 4 4<br />
General Commients The Redcliff project will allow the immediate exploitation<br />
of natural gas liquid reserves which might otherwise be lost<br />
flared). It will contribute positively to the balance of<br />
payments in export earnings and by substitution for products<br />
that would otherwise be imported caustic soda; vinyl<br />
chloride monomer). The project will provide significant regional benefits<br />
to South Australia. The Redcliff complex will provide direct employment for<br />
710 people; and it is estimated that the total increase of 1420<br />
jobs -, ill result. The project should create nearly 4500<br />
construction jobs during its peak phase. </p>
<p>THE PILBARA REGION POVER SUPPLY INTEGRATION ( WA)<br />
Brief Description Because of the rapid development of the Pilbara since<br />
the early 1960' s, electricity supplies in the region could not<br />
be provided by the State Government and individual mining<br />
companies developed their own electricity systems. The State<br />
Energy Commission is seeking to progressively assume its full<br />
normal role in -the Pilbara region with the intention of ultimately<br />
supplying all customers, industrial, commercial and residential.<br />
The present fragmented approach to the provision of power in the<br />
region is wasteful of resources. Currently there are ninety<br />
one generating units spread over eleven separate medium sized<br />
systems operated by five different organisations.<br />
Funding Arrangements All capital. expenditure * for the interconnections<br />
and additional plant will be raised by the State Energy<br />
Commission. In June 1978 prices $ 111 million will be needed<br />
and the total amount is sought in the form of special additions<br />
under the infrastructure financing guidelines.<br />
Phas ingr The timing of expenditures is estimated to be<br />
million in 1979/ 80, $ 11 million in 1980/ 81, $ 15 million<br />
in 1981/ 82, $ 16 million in 1982/ 83 and 1983/ 84, $ 27 million<br />
in 1984/ 85 and $ 21 million in 1985/ 86. However this timing<br />
will depend on the pace of development in the region which is<br />
difficult to predict.<br />
It is essential. that integration take place prior<br />
to any fuither major expansion of the mining industry since<br />
power facilities normally take longer to construct than a<br />
mining expansion.<br />
Genera. Comments The proposal will contribute to a rationalisation<br />
and more judicious use of resources. The existence of an<br />
integrated power supply will lower the relatively high costs<br />
of power involved in numerous small plants.<br />
The proposal should help decentralisation and by<br />
stimulating industrial demand lead to increased employment. </p>
<p>WATER SUPPLY PROJECTS ( TAS)<br />
Brief Description Special adelitions are required over the next five<br />
years to assist in the funding of peak capital expenditure<br />
required for augmentation of and construction of new water<br />
supplies in three separate areas of Tasmania. The projects<br />
are: The augmentation of supply to the Hobart<br />
metropolitan area by the Metropolitan<br />
Water Board;<br />
The constru: ction of a regional supply<br />
scheme by the North West Regional Water<br />
Authority; and<br />
Augmentation of the Nort h Esk Regional<br />
Water Supply by the Rivers and Water<br />
Supply Commissi~ on.<br />
Funding Arrangements Total capital expenditure on the three water schemes<br />
in the five year period comff. enci ng 1978/ 79 is estimated to be<br />
million at early 1978 prices. Allowing for amounts to be<br />
funded from ordinary loan sources, special additions of<br />
million are reqiuired.<br />
Phasing The special additions to borrowings are required<br />
as follows: 1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 1982-83<br />
Sm 10 8 8 5 4<br />
Project has a planned construction period of<br />
six years and was commenced about one year ago. Project ( 3)<br />
has beer. commenced and should be completed in 1980/ 81.<br />
Project has not yet been started.<br />
Any delays to the planned schedules of works relating<br />
to all three projects will result in further shortages of water<br />
and more severe rationing of domestic supplies.<br />
General Comments Each of the projects makes use of Tasmania's abundant<br />
water resources and will contribute to industry development and<br />
thus to employment. The projects have indirect implications<br />
for Australia's balance of payments through the supply of water<br />
essential to industrial processes. </p>
<p>DAMPIER-PERTH GAS PIPELINE ( WA)<br />
Brief Description The construction of a pipeline to bring natural<br />
gas from Dampier 1,500 kilometres to Perth, and for marketing<br />
the gas in the South West of the State. The project is a<br />
key component of the North West Shelf gas development which<br />
involves the production of natural gas for the Pilbara, Perth<br />
and South West of Western Australia and liquified natural gas<br />
for export. The Joint Venturers developing the North Rankin<br />
Gas Field are well advanced with their feasibility and design<br />
studies of the overall project and are scheduled to make a decision<br />
with the State in the latter part of 1979 whether or not to<br />
proceed. Funding Arrangements Private sector investment in the North West Shelf<br />
Gas Project is estimated at $ 3,000 million in 1978 prices.<br />
The public sector expenditure in the pipeline is estimated at<br />
$ 442.5 million ( June 1978 prices) of which $ 416 million is<br />
required as a special addition under the infrastructure financing<br />
guidelines. Phas ing Latest timing estimates of expenditure of the<br />
$ 416 million special addition ( June 1978 prices) are $ 133 million<br />
in 1982/ 83, $ 263 million inl983/ 0' 4, $ 17 million in 1984/ 85<br />
and $ 3 million in 1985/ 86.<br />
A decision on the availability of funds is required<br />
now to enable the Energy Commission and the Western Australian<br />
Government to firmly declare their ability to proceed and<br />
enable the developers to compile their feasibility and design<br />
studies an~ d make a decision on the whole North-West shelf gas<br />
project by September 1979.<br />
General Comments The pipeline is an integral part of the proposed<br />
North-West Shelf gas development and will enable about half of<br />
the natural gas resources to be used for Australian consumption.<br />
The natural gas supply from Dampier to Perth/ South-West region<br />
will help broaden the industrial base of Western Australia.<br />
The project should assist the balance of payments by allowing<br />
imported fuel oil to be replaced by gas.<br />
The pipeline project will employ directly some 1000<br />
to 1500 people during the construction phase lasting 18 to<br />
24 months. </p>

WORSLEY ALUMINA PROJE~ CT ( WA)<br />
Brief Description The establishment of a bauxite-alumina project in<br />
the South West of Western Australia with an initial alumina<br />
capacity of 1 million tonnes per year is proposed. Bauxite<br />
will be either railed or transported by conveyor to the<br />
refinery and water requirements for the first stage of the<br />
project will be piped from t'ie Wellington Dam. The special<br />
additions to borrowing programs are to provide the railway<br />
and water supply facilities.<br />
Punding Arrangements Assuming bauxite is railed to the refinery the<br />
private sector investment in the total development is estimated<br />
at $ 695 million ( June 1978 prices).<br />
Total public sector investment is estimated at<br />
million ( June 1978 prices) and special additions of<br />
$ 41.1 million ( June 1978 prices) are sought for the provision<br />
of water supply and rail facilities which will be funded entirely<br />
by the public sector.<br />
Phasing The proposed phasing of the borrowings is:<br />
1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82<br />
SM9 20 12 1<br />
A decision on the availability of funds is required<br />
now to facilitate construction planning programmed to begin<br />
in January 1979.<br />
General Comments The infrastructure proposal is associated wuith a<br />
private investment project that will contribute to the<br />
development of national resources. The alumina project will<br />
generate export income.<br />
The construction of the Worsley refinery will provide<br />
100 construction jobs initially, rising to a maximum of 1600<br />
withan average of 1000 for the duration of the construction<br />
period. The operation of the project will require 164 persons<br />
employed at the mine site and 605 persons at the refinery. </p>
<p>HYDRO ELECTRIC POWER DEVrELOPMENT ( TAS)<br />
Brief Description Special additions are sought over the next five<br />
years to assist in the funding of peak capital expenditure in<br />
the further development of Tasmania's hydro-electric power<br />
system. Two specific projects will be involved, namely the<br />
Pieman River Power Development and another, probably the<br />
Lower Gordon Power Development. The Pieman Scheme was commenced<br />
in 1975 and is now scheduled for completion in 1986.<br />
Construction of the Lower Gordon Scheme is scheduled to start<br />
in a substantial way in 1981/ 82.<br />
Fund injZ Arrangements At January 1978 prices total estimated capital<br />
expenditure by the Commission for the five years commencing<br />
1978/ 79 will be $ 347 million. After allowing for contributions<br />
from internal funds and normal loan allocations, special<br />
additions of $ 75 million are required.<br />
Phasing million per annum for the five years beginning<br />
in 1978/ 79. The decision is required now to enable the capital<br />
construction program to proceed as planned so that the power<br />
system will be able to meet the demands placed on it.<br />
General Comments Water is one of Tasmania's most widespread natural<br />
resources and the large scale production of relatively low<br />
cost hydro-electric power is a major factor in the devellopment<br />
of the Tasmanianeconomy. Production of additional power is<br />
required to meet normal long-term growth as well as supplying<br />
needed increments for major industries.<br />
The Commission employs an outside construction force<br />
of 900 men, together with additional support staff of at least<br />
200. </p>
