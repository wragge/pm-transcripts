NOTES FOR A SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA, THEFON, E, G. 1ITLAM,<br />
Q. C. IN REPLY TO A WELCOME BY THE BURGERMEISTER OF HAMPURG, SATURDAY,<br />
18 JANUARY 1975<br />
1. MY VISIT TO HAMBURG COMES AT THE END OF A LONG AND BUSY PROGRAM<br />
IN EUROPE. I CAN THINK OF NO HAPPIER CONCLUSION TO MY VISIT THAN<br />
A DAY SPENT IN YOUR CITY, THE TRADITIONAL ' GATEWAY TO FUROPE'<br />
IS FOR ME A DEPARTURE GATE, NOT AN ENTRY GATE. TT WILL BE THE AST<br />
MEMORY I CARRY WITH ME OF MY PRESENT JOURNEY, I THANK YOU, MR PURGERMEISTER,<br />
AND THE SENATE FOR THE CORDIAL WELCOME YOU HAVE GIVEN TO ME AND MY WIFE,<br />
2. THIS IS MY VISIT TO HAMBURG; MY WIFE'S SECOND, VF ARE DELIGHTED<br />
TO BE AMONG PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEFT THEIR MARK INDELIBLY ON MY COUNTRY'S<br />
HISTORY AND CULTURE, PY THE MIDDLE OF THE .1TH CENTURY, GERMAN<br />
MERCHANTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM HAMBURG, WERE WELL ENGAGED IN TRADE<br />
WITH AUSTRALIA. HAMBURG CONSULATES WERE ESTABLISHED IN AUSTRALIA<br />
IN THE 1.84I AND ONE OF THE FIRST GERMAN SHIPS TO VISIT " ELBOURNE BORE<br />
THE NAME OF THE OLD HAMBURG MERCHANT FAMILY GODEFFROY. SINCE .1Ã¸ 4 MORE<br />
THAN lT., ry GERMAN PEOPLE HAVE MIGRATED. TO AUSTRALIA. NE OF THE<br />
EARLIEST GERMAN IMMIGRANTS WAS THE HAMBURG MATHEMATICIAN CARL LUDWIG RUMKER<br />
THE FIRST GOVERNMENT ASTRONOMER OF NEW SOUTH ! ALES. PF DISCOVERED<br />
IN THE SOUTHERN SKIES FOUR NEW COMETS, AND PREPARED A CATALOGUE OF<br />
17, fln HEAVENLY BODIES BEFORE RETURNING HOME AS DIRECTOR OF THE PAMBURG<br />
OBSERVATORY. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
3, QNE OF AUSTRALIA'S BEST KNOWN LANDSCAPE PAINTERS, FANS IHFYSEN,<br />
WAS BORN IN HAMBURG. HE EMIGRATED TO SOUTH AUSTRALIA AS A CHILD IN<br />
1884. ANOTHER EARLY IMMIGRANT FROM HAMBURG WAS PERNARD HALTERMAN.<br />
HE DISCOVERED THE WORLD'S LARGEST SPECIMEN OF RFEF GOLD, AND MORE<br />
IMPORTANTLY HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR INTRODUCING GERMAN LAGFR PFER<br />
TO AUSTRALIA. SUCCEEDING GENERATIONS OF AUSTRALIANS HAVE HONOURED<br />
HIM AND HIS HOME CITY FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO OUR NATIONAL LIFE.<br />
4. HAMBURG HAS BEEN PROMINENT IN AUSTRALIA'S TRADE WITH THE FEDERAL<br />
REPUBLIC. MANY GOODS FROM AUSTRALIA ENTER GERMANY THROUGH THE<br />
PORT OF HAMBURG AND AN EVER INCRFASING PROPORTION OF YOUR EXPORTS<br />
TO AUSTRALIA GO THROUGH THIS PORT. HAMBURG HANDLES APPROXIMATELY<br />
PER CENT OF ALL AUSTRALIAN TRAFFIC THROUGH GERMAN PORTS,<br />
SHIPPING AND SHIPBUILDING HAVE LONG BEEN SIGNIFICANT IN THE<br />
ECONOMIC RELATIONS BETWEEN US. IN 1888 THE GERMAN-AUSTRALIA STEAMSHIP<br />
COMPANY WAS FOUNDED', AND ITS SUCCESSOR, THE HAMBURG AMERICA I. INEo HAS<br />
CONTINUED THE SERVICE TO THE PRESENT DAY, MANY OF THE CONTAINER SHIPS j<br />
WHICH NOW PLY BETWEEN EUROPE AND AUSTRALIA, WERE BUILT IN HAMBURG<br />
SHIPYARDS.<br />
6. I KNOW OF HAMBURG'S LONG HISTORY OF FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE.<br />
THE WORD ' FREE ' OCCURRED IN THE EARLIEST CHARTERS OFYJOUR CITY FROM<br />
THE EMPEROR: RARBAROSSA, AND HAS CONTINUED TO THIS DAY IN THE TITLE<br />
OF THE ' FREE AND HANSEATIC CITY THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE HAVE THIS<br />
SAME FREE AND INDEPENDENT SPIRIT, LIKE YOU WE ATTACH GREAT IMPORTANCE<br />
TO THE RESPONSIBILITIES WHICH FREEDOM PLACES ON OUR CITIZENS.<br />
VOLUNTARY MUNICIPAL SERVICE WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS ONE OF HAMPURG'S<br />
OLDEST TRADITIONS, IS A FEATURE OF AUSTRALIAN LIFE, </p>
<p>7. MY WIFF AND I ARE MOST GRATEFUL FOR THE INVITATION TO VISIT YOUR<br />
GREAT CITY AND FOR THE HOSPITALITY YOU HAVE SHOWN US, I LIFT<br />
MY GLASS TO THE SENATE AND STATE OF PAMBURG AND INVITE YOU ALL TO<br />
DRINK TO THE CONTINUING FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION BETWEEN OUR PEOPLES. </p>
