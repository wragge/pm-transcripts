COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
DEFENCE<br />
( Ministerial Statement)<br />
[ From the Parliamentary Debates,' 25 February 1969] " 4,<br />
Mr GORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
-by leave-Mr Speaker, the purpose of<br />
this statement is to inform the House of<br />
what the Australian Government is prepared<br />
to do militarily in Malaysia-Singapore<br />
after the British withdrawal from those<br />
areas and to set this in the context of our<br />
general interest in, involvement in and<br />
thinking concerning the region. It is not to<br />
be thought that we look on our activities<br />
in that region as being purely, or mainly,<br />
military. Any examination of our policy in<br />
relation to our neighbours of the north will<br />
show that we have encouraged them to<br />
develop policies promoting political stability<br />
and economic growth, promoting their own<br />
defence capabilities in association with our<br />
own forces and those of our allies and in<br />
promoting regional co-operation.<br />
Indeed, -the stability and security of the<br />
area rests on many things. It rests on the<br />
avoidance of territorial or other disputes<br />
between the countries in the region. It rests<br />
on the economic progress of those coun-tries<br />
and on the capacity and willingness of rulers<br />
there to see that that economic progress is<br />
reflected in the raising of the standards of<br />
living of the ordinary people. It rests on<br />
peaceful co-operation between those countries<br />
in many fields. And these are the bases<br />
without which there will not * be endurin.-<br />
stability. 12398/ 69 Therefore, these are the goals which Australia,<br />
through diplomatic effort, through<br />
economic assistance, through assistance in<br />
the field of trade, will strive to help these<br />
countries at-tain. For this is fundamental to<br />
the Australian Government's approach-a<br />
positive, co-operative effort to encourage<br />
and assist peaceful change and progress. Yet<br />
just as ultimate stability depends on progress<br />
and rising standards of living, so does the<br />
possibility of progress depend on maintaining<br />
immediate stability. And provision for<br />
defence is necessary to help provide that<br />
immediate stability. Indeed, helping in conditions<br />
of stability to accelerate progress,<br />
and helping by military means to preserve<br />
conditions of stability, are two sides of the<br />
one coin. And the military action we propose<br />
to take in the area to our immediate<br />
north is the side of the coin that concerns<br />
us in this statement.<br />
Just a little over a year ago Great<br />
Britain announced a considerable acceleration<br />
in the pace and scale of the withdrawal<br />
of British forces from Malaysia-Singapore.<br />
Those forces are to be totally withdrawn.<br />
The withdrawal is to be completed by the<br />
end of the calendar year 1971-and the circumstances<br />
under which they may return to<br />
assist in an emergency are unknown. For<br />
Malaysia, Singapore, New Zealand and ourselves<br />
this latest announcement underlined </p>
<p>the fact that an era had ended. During<br />
the lifetime of any one of us sitting in this<br />
House British forces have been stationed<br />
in Malaysia-Singapore to keep, or try to<br />
keep, peace and stability in that region.<br />
During the Second World War, and<br />
since, Australian and New Zealand forces<br />
have assisted in that task and Malaysian<br />
and Singaporean troops have contributed<br />
also. For our part we contributed to the<br />
long drawn out military measures which<br />
defeated the Communist subversion campaign<br />
in Malaya, externally inspired and<br />
sustained, which became known as the<br />
Emergency. We contributed to the military<br />
measures which repelled the raids and infiltrations<br />
during the sad days of Confrontation.<br />
We contributed, with New Zealand,<br />
Malaysia and Singapore, to a force the<br />
backbone of which was provided -by British<br />
forces-seen to be there and known to be<br />
backed by all the resources and reinforcements<br />
which Great Britain could, if necessary,<br />
send them. Now all that has changed.<br />
The major power will be withdrawn. It is<br />
no longer a contribution to the efforts of a<br />
major power which we will all be called<br />
upon to make. It is a substitution for the<br />
efforts of a major power. And such a substitution<br />
must fall far short of what previously<br />
existed and be of a different<br />
character. Faced with this basic change, we and the<br />
other nations concerned have had to<br />
reassess our position and then discuss with<br />
one another what each of us should do in<br />
the light of such reassessment. There have<br />
been almost continuous consultations at all<br />
levels-military and civilian, political and<br />
technical-on steps to be taken to meet the<br />
changing situation. Over a period of time the<br />
plans of each of us have been influenced and<br />
shaped by what has been thought and<br />
suggested by the others and by the contributions<br />
each has felt itself able to make,<br />
or to be prepared. to make in the future. Our<br />
own starting point was and is that we are<br />
a part of and are situated in the region.<br />
Hence security, stability and progress for the<br />
other nations in the region must also contribute<br />
to the security of Australia We<br />
cannot fail to be affected by what happens in<br />
our neighbours' countries. What affects their<br />
security affects our security. Again, if<br />
economic development in the region is to occur at the pace required, and if the<br />
stability needed for this is to be maintained,<br />
the immediate economic support of great<br />
nations outside the region, and the potential<br />
military support of great nations outside the<br />
region, will be needed.<br />
Australia, the most industrially and technically<br />
advanced nation in the region, surely<br />
would not wish, in these circumstances, to<br />
refrain from -helping the region in all ways.<br />
We could not turn our hacks on our neighbours,<br />
refuse to help provide forces for their<br />
security, and wash our hands of the possible<br />
consequences to them and to ourselves. Yet<br />
there were obviously several possible courses<br />
for us. One theoretical course was to withdraw<br />
all our forces from Malaysia-<br />
Singapore at the time that Britain's withdrawal<br />
is completed; to withdraw into<br />
Australia behind a sea frontier and turn our<br />
backs completely on the region as regards<br />
providing military assistance, except for a<br />
willingness to assist in United Nations<br />
action. We reject this utterly. It is contrary<br />
to our historical actions in Korea, in Vietnam<br />
and in the region of which I speak,<br />
and it is contrary to our future interests.<br />
Were we, with our potential, to do this we<br />
could scarcely expect smaller countries in<br />
the region to be encouraged to protect themselves<br />
or larger countries outside the region<br />
not to be affected in any future decision they<br />
might have to make should the region be<br />
endangered. For us, the question has never<br />
been whether we should play a part<br />
militarily, but how we should play that part.<br />
A second possible course was to decide<br />
to withdraw all our military forces, of all<br />
arms, at the same time as Britain withdrew,<br />
but to assure Malaysia-Singapore that we<br />
retained an interest in their military<br />
security, that we had not withdrawn to our<br />
island Australia from which we would<br />
never make a sally to assist them, but that<br />
we would, if and when we judged it necessary,<br />
be prepared to despatch military<br />
forces to their shores to help them. This<br />
course could well cast doubt on our<br />
sincerity of purpose as far as Malaysia-<br />
Singapore and other countries of the region<br />
were concerned; and it had also obvious<br />
military drawbacks.<br />
It is much easier to despatch aircraft<br />
from Australia to assist in another area of </p>
<p>the region if Australian aircraft are already<br />
situated on a base in that area, and operating<br />
from it, and in possession of or provided<br />
with all the complicated equipment<br />
needed to service and maintain and guid. 2<br />
such aircraft. It is much easier to despatch<br />
ground forces to an area if, in that area,<br />
there is a securedly held base and the<br />
headquarters and command and signals and<br />
supply complex is already set up and<br />
operating and needing only expansion<br />
instead of construction de novo. And of<br />
course, it is much easier for a country<br />
which is to be assisted to believe that it will<br />
be assisted if forces from the country which<br />
may provide such help are there and are<br />
visible. We therefore, took the view that<br />
while a capacity for swift additional<br />
assistance should ' be maintained within<br />
Australia, yet it was essential for some<br />
forces, to ' be stationed within Malaysia-<br />
Singapore itself. In so stationing them we<br />
are doing not only what we believe right<br />
but also what these countries want us to do.<br />
Accordingly we are prepared to maintain<br />
and are planning to maintain forces of all<br />
arms in that area after the British withdrawal-<br />
without setting any specific terminal<br />
date.<br />
The forces planned to be retained will<br />
consist of 2 squadrons of Mirages, totalling<br />
in all 42 aircraft, and stationed at Butterworth<br />
in Malaya, except for one section<br />
of 8 aircraft which will be stationed at<br />
Tengah in Singapore. In addition, both<br />
ourselves and the New Zealanders will each<br />
maintain a naval ship in the area at all<br />
times for purposes of protection and not<br />
merely for purposes of training. Further,<br />
we are planning to maintain, in conjunction<br />
with New Zealand, a 2 battalion<br />
organisation of ground troups of which the<br />
Australian component excluding personnel<br />
required for headquarters, cornmunications<br />
and the Jungle Warfare Training School<br />
in Malaya to which we shall contribute<br />
will be approximately 1,200 men. These<br />
troops, in accordance with the advice<br />
tendered to us by our military advisers on<br />
military grounds, and because of the considerable<br />
financial savings involved will be<br />
based at Singapore, although one company<br />
will be detached in rotation to Butterworth<br />
except on occasions when the whole force<br />
is training either at the Jungle Warfare<br />
School or elsewhere in Malaysia. It has. of course, already been accepted by all<br />
concerned that for purposes of defence,<br />
Malaysia and Singapore are indivisible.<br />
Consequently, no matter in what part of*<br />
the Peninsula ( including Singapore) our<br />
forces are stationed, we regard them as<br />
: being there in order to assist the security<br />
and the stability of the whole of that<br />
Peninsula. Now, Mr Speaker, having specified the<br />
Australian Forces which we are prepared<br />
to dispose in this way, I wish to indicate the<br />
conditions under which they will be there<br />
and the role which we envisage they will<br />
fulfil. They will be stationed in t ' he area<br />
under existing arrangements, the terms of<br />
which are governed by our association with<br />
the Anglo-Malayan Defence Agreement.<br />
Should that Agreement in the future cease<br />
to be operative we would wish general<br />
understandings rather -than specific treaty<br />
obligations to be worked out with the countries<br />
concerned and ourselves. Olur forces<br />
will not, of course, be there or remain there<br />
unless their presence continues to be<br />
actively desired by -the governments of the<br />
countries in which they are stationed. While<br />
there, they are not intended for use, and<br />
will not be used, for the maintenance of<br />
internal civil law and order which is the<br />
responsibility of the government concerned.<br />
Their presence, and their military cooperation<br />
with Malaysia and Singapore, are<br />
not directed against any other country in<br />
the region, and this we believe is well understood<br />
and accepted. Indeed, * by helping to<br />
strengthen the defences of one part of the<br />
region it is hoped that -they will indirectly<br />
contribute to the stability of the whole.<br />
Their presence in Malaya and Singapore,<br />
and their participation in training and military<br />
exercises with Malaysian and Singaporean<br />
troops will we believe have value in<br />
helping to build the indigenous defence<br />
capacity of both Malaysia and Singapore,<br />
will -provide additional security while that<br />
indigenous defence capacity is built up, and<br />
will make it more possible for Malaysian<br />
troops to be assigned to other parts of<br />
Malaysia should -the Malaysian Government<br />
so desire. They will. be available-<br />
our troops-subject to the usual<br />
requirement for the Australian Government's<br />
prior consent for use against<br />
externally promoted and inspired Comnmunist<br />
infiltration and subversion of </p>
<p>the kind which became familiar during the<br />
Emergency and which is judged by our<br />
military advisers to be the most likely form<br />
of aggression in the area.<br />
Our advice is that the greatest threat to<br />
stability and security arises from the possibility<br />
of insurgency in South East Asian<br />
countries which could ultimately expose us<br />
to threat by the spread of Communism in<br />
an insecure and -unstable Asia. We have<br />
seen insurgency associated with direct military<br />
action in Vietnam and whilst the<br />
decision to employ our forces is, as it<br />
always has been, a matter to be determined<br />
by the Australian Government at the time,<br />
and in -the circumstances of the time, these<br />
forces will be available to oppose any insurgency<br />
which is externally promoted,<br />
which is a threat to the security of the<br />
region and which is -beyond the capacity<br />
of the forces of Malaysia and Singapore to<br />
handle. It is clear however that at some time in<br />
the future it could be possible that a situation<br />
might arise when the scale of such subversion<br />
and infiltration from outside--or<br />
some other organised threat to the region at<br />
present unforeseen---could be such that<br />
Australian resources alone would be insufficient<br />
to support successfully the forces<br />
of Malaysia and Singapore. If such a situation<br />
should arise we would have to look to<br />
the support of allies outside the region and<br />
-the scale of Australia's continued effort<br />
would in that case have to be decided in the<br />
light of all the circumstances that then<br />
prevail. What they would be we cannot now<br />
know and we cannot therefore now make,<br />
precise decisions. But we can, and<br />
have decided, that we are -prepared to<br />
dispose part of our forces in the manner<br />
I have described. At the same time we shall<br />
continue our efforts to help with the training<br />
of local Malaysian and Singaporean forces<br />
which we expect will be increased in size<br />
and capacity, and to provide financial<br />
assistance for defence aid aimed at assisting<br />
Malaysia and Singapore to build up their<br />
own defence capacity.<br />
We have, to date, allotted some $ 41m<br />
for the supply of equipment to the<br />
Malaysian armed forces, the Royal<br />
Malaysian Police, and the Singapore armed<br />
forces-and we have allotted $ 4m for the<br />
provision of specialist training courses in<br />
Australia and for meeting part of the cost of Australian servicemen seconded to the<br />
Malaysian armed forces. This programme<br />
has been and is continuing in close consultation<br />
with the Malaysian and Singapore<br />
defence authorities.<br />
Side by side with military measures to<br />
promote regional defence and co-operation,<br />
the Government has pursued and will<br />
pursue active measures in other fieldsdiplomatic<br />
and economic. The Australian<br />
Government is itself in regular contact with<br />
all the governments of the region of South<br />
East Asia and with other governments with<br />
a direct interest in the region, either through<br />
bilateral dealings or by participating in the<br />
work of international organisations. It has<br />
been our endeavour to play a constructive<br />
role in helping to ease tensions and to<br />
reduce or eliminate causes of friction. We<br />
have seen it as a positive task to help promote<br />
political and economic conditions<br />
which will allow the independent countries<br />
of the region to proceed with their programmes<br />
of national development in an<br />
atmosphere of confidence.<br />
The basis of security for the region is<br />
weakened when there are divisions within<br />
the region-divisions that threaten to get<br />
out of hand and to lead to serious clashes.<br />
Of course, there will be differences of<br />
opinion between countries and interests will<br />
not coincide on all matters but it is not an<br />
impractical aim to try to have some assurance<br />
that differences will not lead to armed<br />
clash and that no country in the region need<br />
fear for the security of its own borders.<br />
Where differences exist within the region,<br />
their settlement should be sought by peaceful<br />
means and by peaceful means only,<br />
and various ways of achieving this exist.<br />
Some of them are directed at the removal<br />
of the causes of disagreement, others are<br />
directed at creating an atmosphere in<br />
which solutions can be sought. One possibility<br />
that has appealed to us as an aim<br />
is the attainment of a non-aggression pact<br />
or pacts whereby the countries of the region<br />
would declare their intention of never resorting<br />
to force against one another and of<br />
respect for existing territorial boundaries.<br />
I do not regard this as being the total<br />
answer to the problems of regional security<br />
and regional development, but it could be<br />
a most useful and stabilising element in<br />
a total approach. It is not capable of immediate<br />
achievement. As in so many matters. </p>
<p>we shall have to feel our way forward,<br />
making progress as conditions permit. The<br />
countries of the region, including Australia,<br />
cannot force anything on one another, but<br />
by trying to understand one another's<br />
interests and aims and broadening our<br />
co-operation with one another the conditions<br />
for still closer co-operation will be<br />
created. One of the difficulties at present disturbing<br />
the region is the dispute between the<br />
Philippines and Malaysia over Sabah. For<br />
our part we respect the territorial integrity<br />
of all the countries in the region within<br />
their existing boundaries. And we believe<br />
all governments in the region should do<br />
the same. We recognise Malaysia as the<br />
rightful successor to Britain in Sabah and<br />
we believe that the people of Sabah have<br />
already exercised the right of self determination.<br />
We believe, too, that the Philippines<br />
would not wish to prosecute its claim<br />
by armed attack and indeed the former<br />
Minister for External Affairs was assured<br />
of this by the Government of the<br />
Philippines. Bearing in mind that the use of Australian<br />
forces is always a matter for decision<br />
by the Australian Government-and that<br />
that decision will be made in the light of<br />
our judgment of all the circumstances at any<br />
given time-we believe that the best contri-<br />
12398/ 69-2 bution we can make to the peaceful settlement<br />
of that dispute is by diplomatic means.<br />
Mr Speaker, this statement has confined<br />
itself, as I said it would, to the question<br />
of what we are prepared to do in Malaysia-<br />
Singapore after the end of 1971. It has<br />
touched on the disposition of part of our<br />
forces. Our military advisers have for some<br />
time, knowing that we wished to provide<br />
for the possibility of such disposition and<br />
in the context of their new strategic assessment,<br />
been working on plans for the future<br />
composition and equipment of Australian<br />
forces which will give us flexibility-a<br />
capacity for home defence which will also<br />
allow us to contribute in accordance with<br />
our treaty agreements of SEATO and<br />
ANZUS. This study is still proceeding.<br />
But I commend to the House the<br />
decisions here announced: That we are<br />
-prepared to provide to the region in which<br />
we live military -assistance for which<br />
Malaysia and Singapore have asked-military<br />
assistance visible to them-and an<br />
assurance that both we and they share a<br />
common purpose in being prepared to combat<br />
that Communist inspired military subversion<br />
which our advisers consider to pose<br />
the major threat to the region. I present<br />
the following paper:<br />
