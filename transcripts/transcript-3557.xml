United Kingdom<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister at the Mansion House, London, on<br />
19 December 1974<br />
I suppose I would be less than human if I did not<br />
feel some sense of awe-even some slight<br />
trepidation-at the prospect of addressing this<br />
august gathering in this historic hall. An Australian<br />
Prime Minister who comes to London is<br />
made very much aware of his country's British<br />
origins and its place in the scheme of things. He<br />
is subtly reminded of the actions and reputations<br />
of his predecessors, of the rich and<br />
intricate fabric of history, law and tradition that<br />
has shaped his country and the very nature of<br />
his office. For an Australian Prime Minister,<br />
London can never be just another city or Britain<br />
just another country-however much a proud<br />
and self-assertive people would like to think<br />
them so.<br />
I must confess that by past standards my<br />
present visit to London has been somewhat<br />
brash and unorthodox. It is more than two years<br />
since a Labor Government was elected in<br />
Australia, yet this is the first time I have spoken<br />
to a British audience. My coming out in London<br />
has been unconscionably delayed. A generation<br />
ago no Australian Prime Minister would have<br />
engaged in talks with Robin Day and David<br />
Frost before talking to the Secretary of State for<br />
Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. No<br />
Australian Prime Minister would have visited<br />
Brussels before visiting London. Very likely, no<br />
Australian Prime Minister would have visited<br />
Brussels at all. There was a time when<br />
Australia's main involvement with Europe was<br />
on the battlefield. The real decisions on<br />
Australia's trade, on her economic and financial<br />
policies, on her foreign policies, on the very<br />
borders of her States and Territories, were taken<br />
in London. We were the creation of a great trading<br />
empire at the height of its influence and prestige. We were the last frontier of European<br />
colonial might. When Australia was settled<br />
there was literally nowhere further for the<br />
European to go. To me it is strikingly symbolic of<br />
the link between British political and mercantile<br />
power that the word ' corporation'--the very<br />
name of this ancient assembly-has come to<br />
denote both the municipal government of London<br />
and the great network of financial institutions<br />
that for so long influenced the destinies of<br />
the Australian people.<br />

<p>It is a commonplace to say that the world is rapidly<br />
changing. Yet never has the truth of that<br />
statement been more manifest than today. Little<br />
that we have taken for granted, little to which<br />
we are accustomed, little even that we hold<br />
dear, has remained unaffected by the events of<br />
the past thirty years, and especially by the pace<br />
and scope of change in the 19 70' s. I do not<br />
need to tell you of the difficulty and complexity<br />
of the economic problems that confront every<br />
western trading nation -Australia and Britain<br />
among them. In Australia's case, not only has it<br />
been necessary to accept changes in our thinking<br />
and national life: it has been necessary to<br />
welcome and promote changes. Since my<br />
Government was elected it has pursued a new<br />
course in its foreign affairs. We have sought a<br />
more distinctive and independent role for<br />
Australia, especially in our own region. We<br />
have established new friendships and contacts<br />
with other nations. While this has meant some<br />
reappraisal of our traditional arrangements, the<br />
changes we have made have not been at the<br />
expense of old and proven friends. I want to<br />
emphasise this; our policies were a response to a growing spirit of self-confidence and selfreliance<br />
in Australian society. We have<br />
developed a keener sense of national independence.<br />
And I must say, in all frankness, it was<br />
high time we did.<br />
Some people-more in Australia than in<br />
Britain-have regarded Australia's foreign poli<br />
cies in recent years as some sort of aff ront to Bri<br />
tamn; an insult to the Mother Country. Let me be<br />
personal for a moment. I don't suppose there is<br />
anyone in Australia, certainly no one else who is<br />
still in public life, who has a greater love for<br />
Britain than I have. Against very strong advice,<br />
from friend and foe alike, I insisted on coming<br />
here for Christmas. What better proof could<br />
there be of my British sympathies. Not many of<br />
my countrymen have a greater respect for<br />
Britain's institutions and traditions than I do-a<br />
greater knowledge of your history, a greater<br />
affection for your language, your laws, your<br />
literature, your unique intellectual traditions of<br />
moderation, detachment, tolerance and liberty.<br />
In saying this I don't want to sound boastful or<br />
ingratiating. I want to dispel the impression that<br />

<p>Australia's attitude to Britain has been churlish<br />
or nit-picking. What we seek is a more mature<br />
and contemporary relationship with Britain-a<br />
relationship based on a growing sense of<br />
national pride and purpose.<br />
For more than twenty years successive Australian<br />
Governments saw our continent as a<br />
small and insignificant country, an outpost of<br />
European civilisation, exposed to the tides of<br />
communism which threatened to engulf the<br />
region, and prey to the covetous attentions of<br />
our neighbours. These feelings were heightened<br />
by a sense of geographical isolation, racial<br />
and cultural, which established the main directions<br />
of Australia's foreign relations from 1950<br />
onwards. They ultimately led us to commit<br />
Australian forces to the Viet-Nam War. They<br />
led us to tolerate the increasing overseas ownership<br />
and control of our industries and<br />
resources. By December 1972 the external<br />
environment and Australia's Government had<br />
changed. Our perceptions of Australia's place<br />
and role in international affairs had changed.<br />
We never were small and insignificant. Our<br />
economy is a good deal larger than the econom<br />
ies of many European nations. We have ended<br />
our military involvement in Viet-Nam. We have<br />
recognised and established diplomatic relations<br />
with all the countries in Asia and with many<br />
other countries which were formerly ignored by<br />
Australia. We have been a helpful and cooperative<br />
neighbour in our region. In the United<br />
Nations we have given steadfast support to the<br />
causes of self-determination, disarmament and<br />
anti-colonialism.<br />
To a great extent the new directions in our<br />
foreign policy have been influenced by Britain's<br />
example. In 1972 we established formal relations<br />
with the People's Republic of China:<br />
Britain had done so in 1949. We withdrew our<br />
forces from Indo-China: Britain had never committed<br />
such forces. I doubt if anyone in this<br />
country would take it amiss if I declared that<br />
Australia's involvement in Viet-Nam had been<br />
a mistake. It was a mistake, and only now are<br />
we repairing the damage. Britain herself was in<br />
the forefront of the great post-war movement<br />
which brought self-determination and<br />
independence to a host of former colonial states.<br />
Once when Australians travelled to Europe,<br />
every port and stop-over was ruled from London-<br />
Singapore, Colombo, Aden, Suez, Malta, Port Said, Gibraltar. One of the triumphs of<br />
British foreign policy has been the peaceful and<br />
orderly transfer of power to the new selfgoverning<br />
nations.<br />
In the light of these changes, it was inevitable<br />
and natural that Britain's relationship with<br />
Australia would change too. The impetus for<br />
change did not come from Australia alone.<br />
Britain's historic move towards Europe meant a<br />
change in her attitude to her Commonwealth<br />
partners. Australia did not oppose or resent<br />
Britain's involvement in Europe. Enlightened<br />
opinion in my country welcomed and<br />
encouraged it, just as the great financial institutions<br />
of this city welcomed and encouraged it.<br />
True enough, Britain's entry into Europe meant<br />
some adjustment, a difficult adjustment, in<br />
Australia's pattern of trade, but this process of<br />
adjustment had begun with Britain's first<br />
attempt to join the European Community in the<br />
early 1960' s. Since that time Australia has<br />
sought to diversify its trade in an effort to reduce<br />
our dependence on the British market. In<br />
1961-62, some 20 per cent of our exports<br />
were directed to Britain. Britain was our principal<br />
export market. Now, nearly two years after<br />
Britain's entry into the European Community,<br />
we sell only 6.5 per cent of our exports to<br />
Britain. Many of our new markets are among the nations<br />
of the Commonwealth, the great majority of the<br />
members of the Commonwealth now lie in and<br />
around the Indian and South Pacific Oceans. In<br />
a geographical sense, Australia is much closer<br />
to the new Commonwealth than Britain herself.<br />
Far from being on the periphery we are much<br />
nearer the centre. It is Britain, if I may say so,<br />
that has become the outpost of European civilisation<br />
in an organisation essentially oriented<br />
toward Asian, Pacific, Indian Ocean and Caribbean<br />
States. You hear a lot of disparagement of<br />
the Commonwealth but you will never hear it<br />
from Australia. The Commonwealth today provides<br />
the world's largest regular forum for<br />
meetings of Heads of Government. In this<br />
respect it has no parallel, and Australia has<br />
given the Commonwealth its fullest and most<br />
active support.<br />
It is against this background of economic and<br />
political change that Australia has looked afresh<br />
at her traditional relationship with Britain. There<br />
are some things we have changed. Many of the </p>
<p>things we have changed have been essentially<br />
symbolic, but no less important for that. Many<br />
of the changes would have been made whichever<br />
government was in power in Australia;<br />
indeed some of them had their origins in decisions<br />
taken by my predecessors. One of our<br />
first acts as a government was to amend Her<br />
Majesty's Royal Style and Titles in Australia.<br />
That change had the warm personal approval of<br />
the Queen and the overwhelming endorsement<br />
of the Australian people. The result is that<br />
Queen Elizabeth II is now properly, proudly and<br />
officially designated ' Queen of Australia'. She<br />
has always been Queen of Australia; now she<br />
bears the title, I am proud of it. It is an entirely<br />
contemporary and appropriate title. It takes<br />
account of popular feeling. It makes the<br />
monarchy a closer and more relevant institution<br />
for Australians.<br />
We decided it was time Australia had a distinctive<br />
national anthem and abandoned knighthoods<br />
and other awards conferred in the name<br />
of the British Empire. Other nations like Canada<br />
had taken this course and public opinion in<br />
Australia was fully in sympathy with such<br />
changes. We no longer confer knighthoods in<br />
the name of an empire that has ceased to exist.<br />
We retain God Save The Queen on occasions<br />
when Her Majesty is present or when it is<br />
especially important to emphasise our links with<br />
the Crown, but our official anthem, the only<br />
anthem recognised by the Australian Government,<br />
is Advance Australia Fair. All the evidence<br />
suggests that Australians want an<br />
anthem of their own. There is nothing particularly<br />
surprising about this; it would be more<br />
surprising if they didn't. Yet there are Australians<br />
who see the choice of an anthem and<br />
the rejection of Imperial Titles as an insult to the<br />
Crown. I regard our preference for an Australian<br />
anthem as a perfectly natural reflection of Australian<br />
maturity and I am convinced that the Bri<br />
tish people do likewise.<br />
I give you another example. Six years ago an<br />
earlier Australian Government-a conservative<br />
government-abolished appeals to the Privy<br />
Council in London from judgments of the Australian<br />
High Court. That decision was accepted<br />
in Australia without dissent. In the same way,<br />
for the same reasons, my Government has<br />
sought to abolish appeals to the Privy Council<br />
from the Supreme Courts of the States. Our proposal has been resisted by the States. I<br />
merely say this: no people with an ounce of selfrespect<br />
would allow decisions made by their<br />
own judges, appointed by their own governments<br />
and sitting in their own courts, to be<br />
overruled by judges sitting in another country<br />
and appointed by the Government of another<br />
country. We still retain procedures by which the<br />
Governors of the States are commissioned by<br />
the Queen-not as Queen of Australia but as<br />
Queen of the United Kingdom. The commissions<br />
are countersigned not by the Premier<br />
of the State but by the British Secretary of State<br />
for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. I do not<br />
think it unduly chauvinistic of Australians to<br />
object to such a procedure. I do not think I am<br />
alone in seeing something absurd in the proposal<br />
to have a Queen of Queensland. Is there to<br />
be a Queen of Alberta and a Queen of Prince<br />
Edward Island? These are matters affecting<br />
Australia's standing and reputation as a contemporary<br />
independent nation.<br />
Two of the great things we have inherited from<br />
Britain are our tradition of judicial independence<br />
and our parliamentary democracy. For a variety<br />
of reasons, including the present strains on the<br />
world economy, our democratic system has<br />
come under challenge and in many countries is<br />
afflicted by instability and frequent changes of<br />
government. It is imperative that countries like<br />
Australia and Britain ensure the survival of robust<br />
democracy and individual liberty. I look<br />
forward to discussions with your Prime Minister<br />
on how the fabric of our democratic society can<br />
be stengthened during the present economic<br />
crisis. In saying this I do not want to adopt the<br />
mantle of a prophet of doom. In Australia, as in<br />
Britain, governments face serious problems of<br />
inflation, a slowing down of growth and, for us,<br />
a high level of unemployment. But these temporary<br />
factors, unfortunate as they are, should<br />
not obscure the fundamental long-term<br />
strength of our economies. Must we admit that<br />
only the Soviet Union among industrial and<br />
trading nations can avoid unemployment and<br />
inflation?<br />
There has never been a time when the institutions<br />
of government, the parliaments, the<br />
courts-not only in Australia but in all<br />
democracies-were more in need of strengthening.<br />
There has never been a time when the<br />
problems of society posed a greater challenge to </p>
<p>the ingenuity and skill of governments. There<br />
has never been a time when democratic institutions<br />
have been so sternly challenged. In my<br />
own country this year we saw the Upper House<br />
in the national Parliament for the first time<br />
refuse Supply to the elected government and<br />
force a general election. It was a gross breach of<br />
a hitherto unchallenged convention. Moreover,<br />
so complex and cumbersome are Australia's<br />
electoral laws that the new Parliament could not<br />
convene for three months. Where else could a<br />
Parliamentary democracy be without a Parliament<br />
for so long?<br />
Many in Britain may be aware that some of<br />
Australia's State Governments have resented<br />
some of the initiatives of my Government.<br />
Indeed, after my visit in April last year Premiers<br />
and State Attorneys-General flocked to London<br />
to beseech the British Government to save them<br />
from the Australian Government. The point in<br />
issue can be solved within the Australian judicial<br />
system established by the Australian<br />
Constitution. There is no possible advantage to<br />
Britain in embroiling the Queen, the Government<br />
or the Courts of Britain in such Australian<br />
domestic disputes. I shall not go into such matters<br />
here, except to say this: The great lesson of<br />
the Australian federal system, as in the<br />
American, Canadian and West German federal<br />
systems since the War, has been the need for<br />
greater involvement, greater responsibility, on<br />
the part of the national government. I give two<br />
illustrations. In the two Australian States with<br />
the largest populations it had become obvious<br />
for a decade that only through the involvement<br />
of the national government could the people in<br />
new areas secure access to essential public services<br />
such as health, higher education and public<br />
transport. In the two States with the largest<br />
areas, it had become obvious that only the<br />
national government could safeguard Australian<br />
control of the vast new natural resources<br />
discovered in the past ten years. I believe the<br />
federal system can be made to work, as it has<br />
worked in other democracies, if the States<br />
accept that Australians are one people, with<br />
national interests and legitimate national aspirations,<br />
and that there are some government<br />
services and responsibilities that can only be<br />
adequately provided and exercised if the Federal<br />
Government is involved.<br />
Those who see in some of our recent actions concerning Britain a manifestation of some strident<br />
new nationalism or anti-British feeling<br />
have completely misread our intentions and<br />
mistaken the mood of our people. What<br />
Australia istrying todoisestablish an independent<br />
indentity in the world and especially in our<br />
own region. We have grown up. Our actions are<br />
in no way anti-British. They are simply pro-<br />
Australian. I speak to you frankly because I<br />
know there can never be any questions about<br />
the enduring strength of Australia's ties with<br />
Britain and the British people. The vast majority<br />
of our people are of British stock. We wish to<br />
build on British institutions. I believe that our<br />
understanding and affection will deepen, rather<br />
than diminish, as Australia assumes her rightful<br />
place as a proud and independent nation, with a<br />
distinctive role and a distinctive voice in her<br />
region and in the world at large. </p>
