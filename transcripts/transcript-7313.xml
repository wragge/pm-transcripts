CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DZLiVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
HOUSING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION CONFERENCE<br />
BROADBEACH 23 APRIL 1988<br />
It has been three years since I have had the pleasure of<br />
addressing the HIA Conference. They have been momentous<br />
years for the Australian economy and for all Australians.<br />
They have been a testing time for our community a time<br />
which has required a degree of sustained restraint<br />
unprecedented in peace time.<br />
And it is pleasing to be able to say that the hard work is<br />
beginning to pay off.<br />
Three years ago the headlines were trumpeting the falling<br />
dollar, falling terms of trade, a blow out of the balance of<br />
payments and rising inflation.<br />
Today each of those indicators is moving the other way.<br />
Our current account deficit has fallen by one-third,<br />
relative to GDP.<br />
our currency has stabilised.<br />
Our terms of trade stopped falling in 1987 and actually<br />
increased. Inflation ig'trending down from a post-depreciation peak of<br />
almost ten per cent to an expected 6 per cent or so by June<br />
with a prospect of getting down to around 5 per cent a year<br />
or so later.<br />
Moreover: The economy continues to grow strongly;<br />
Investment is picking up;<br />
The Budget is in surplus; 006002 </p>
<p>2.<br />
We have created over one million jobs since April 1983,<br />
over 80 per cent of which were created in the private<br />
sector and we have halted and reversed the growth of<br />
Commonwealth employment; p<br />
The unemployment rate has fallen further and now stands<br />
at 7.4 per cent comparded with 10.1 per cent in April<br />
1983. But if the massive explosion in workforce<br />
participation since then had not occurred, the<br />
unemployment rate would now be 4.3 per centl and<br />
Most importantly for this group, the housing industry is<br />
expanding rapidly.<br />
That is an enviable record of achievement one that we can<br />
all take pride in.<br />
It would be tempting to say that, having acnieved so much,<br />
we can now afford to sit back and relax because there in<br />
nothing more to do.<br />
But the fact is that it will be some years yet before we<br />
reach so comfortable a position.<br />
It now takes four times the export effort to service our<br />
international debt than it did in the early eighties.<br />
And our current account deficit is still high enough to<br />
ensure that our international indebtedness continues to grow<br />
each year as a proportion of GDP.<br />
The reality is that we need to stabilise our indebtedness so<br />
that we can maximise the extent to which our productive<br />
effort can be used to increase our living standards rather<br />
than those of our creditors. To do that we need to reduce<br />
the current account deficit further.<br />
What does that require of us at present?<br />
Let me outline for you today the essential tasks required of<br />
Government and the community to achieve that goal. while<br />
these are tasks that involve all Australians, these are some<br />
particular ways in which the housing industry is<br />
contribueing, and can continue to contribute, to the overall<br />
effort. First it requires that Government fiscal policy remain<br />
appropriate to the task.<br />
This Government's record of fiscal management needs no<br />
recounting in detail here.<br />
Having turned a prospective $ 10 billion deficit to a surplus<br />
and having turned back the real growth of Budget outlays,<br />
our fiscal achievements are second to none.<br />
The May Statement, which Paul Keating will deliver on may<br />
will continue the task. 0060013 </p>
<p>The current indicators suggest that domestic demand has been<br />
running a little faster than we would have desired.-<br />
Government policy notably our fiscal policy is already<br />
set to tighten progressively, which will help moderate<br />
demand growth.<br />
Nevertheless, we recognise that", more needs to be done to<br />
contain public sector demand and the assoc9ited drain or<br />
domestic saving.<br />
Accordingly the may Statement will have to incluce some neow<br />
cuts in Government spendina.<br />
And when we convene the Premiers Conference and Loan Council<br />
earlier in may we will be looking to a further contribution<br />
to restraint by the States.<br />
However let me make it clear that, because we in the<br />
Commonwealth have achieved so much in recent years and<br />
because of the improvement under way in our current account<br />
and revenue positions the massive spending cuts of recent<br />
years are not required on this occasion.<br />
Our objective is to ensure that real outlays growth in the<br />
Commonwealth Budget remains negative.<br />
The States must recognise that the overall mix of borrowing<br />
and spending by the public sector as a whole must also be<br />
kept consistent with modest growth in public sector demand<br />
and with a further reduction in the Public Sector Borrowing<br />
Requirement. Such an approach will moderate demand without recourse to<br />
excessively high interest rates.<br />
It is an approach therefore which will help to sustain the<br />
pick up in investment and, not least, investment in<br />
housing.<br />
The second component of what ' we as a community need to do<br />
now is to continue the overhaul of our industrial structure<br />
to enable it to meet the needs of the world economy today<br />
and tomorrow.<br />
As we promised in the last Federal election campaign, this<br />
task is proviae3ng the focus of much of the activity of the<br />
Government in particular, through the work of the<br />
Structural Adjustment Committee of Cabinet.<br />
it will also provide a major theme of the May Statement.<br />
In particular, the Statement will initiate further reform of<br />
the business tax system and further progress in the-gradual<br />
winding back of protection, which is sapping our export<br />
potential.<br />
We seek a lea~ er, more efficient, more flexible, more<br />
outward looking economy.. 006004 </p>
<p>The Government~ s record of reforw his area is<br />
unsurpassed. our major achievements include deregulation of the financial<br />
sector, the foreshadowed ending of the two airlines<br />
agreement, reform of public administrrtion, progressive<br />
reduction of protection in the context of Industry plans, a<br />
start to reform of education and training systems, reduced<br />
regulation of business wherever possibli. ind not least of<br />
all substantial tax reform.<br />
Reflecting the importance which we attach to this sector,<br />
the housing industry has had a special place in this<br />
process. Deregulation of the financial sector, coupled with our<br />
decision in March 1986 to let interest rates on new<br />
mortgages follow market trends, unlocked a large reservoir<br />
of loan funds for home buyers.<br />
Demand for loans has accelerated markedly in recent months,<br />
in line with the sharp decline in mortgage rates.<br />
So much so, indeed, that the Indicative Planning Council<br />
expects 1988-89 to see nearly 148,000 starts, which compares<br />
with the annual record of 153,000 we set in 1984-85.<br />
However the task of reforming our economy is far from over.<br />
We still have work to do towards minimising our domestic<br />
cost structures, maximising the incentives for improved<br />
efficiency and encouraging Australian suppliers to seek out<br />
and win markets against the best of our foreign competitors.<br />
Last week Senator Button announced substantial, immediate<br />
reductions in protection for passenger motor vehicles.<br />
Further reductions are to be phased in between now and 1992.<br />
The benefits of greater efficiency and ultimately, lower<br />
vehicle prices are widespread and accrue to industry and<br />
individuals alike.<br />
These reforms are a substantial first instalment on the<br />
packaqeoi" measures which the Treasurer will be announcing<br />
in the MayStatement.<br />
Its thrust will be clear: to build a better Australia.<br />
one which has the verve and flexibility to cope with a<br />
rapidly changing, highly competitive world.<br />
one which is less reliant on raw materials exports and<br />
thus more reliant on value added processing,<br />
manufactures and services. 006005 </p>
<p>There is always a risk when programs of ma~ or reform are<br />
implemented that individuals or groups will Beek to champion<br />
those elements which favour them and disparage the<br />
remainder. Such a narrow, sectional approach in this t,. x<br />
would be shamefully short-sighted because it wouldtimpe..<br />
the task of reconstruction which ultimately is essential If<br />
we are to rebuild our living standards.<br />
our policies have produced an economy which is competitive<br />
and which is experiencing rapid employment qrowth and<br />
falling unemployment.<br />
This provides the context in which we can undertake the kind<br />
of phased fundamental restructuring which we now require<br />
without the massive dislocations which attended the attem'<br />
of less far-sighted Governments.<br />
while we are so heavily in hock to our creditors we simply<br />
cannot afford to let this golden opportunity pass.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Our third taGk as a nation is to remain competitive.<br />
Through the continuing coope ration of the union movement,<br />
real unit labour costs have declined by more than 10 per<br />
cent since 1983.<br />
Sustained wage restraint, coupled with massive depreciation<br />
of our currency, has dramatically improved the<br />
competitiveness of our manufacturing and service industries.<br />
This is particularly so compared with suppliers from Japan,<br />
the United States and Europe.<br />
The pleasing thing is that so many manufacturers and service<br />
industries are taking advantage of it.<br />
The volume of manufacturing exports has risen by more than<br />
per cent over the past two years.<br />
The volume of exports by the services sector has also<br />
recorded a strong increase, so much so that our services<br />
deficit has fallen by around 25 per cent over the last two<br />
years. Our tourism sector has of course made a major contribution<br />
to this but the efforts of large numbers of other<br />
entrepreneurs have also been rewarded with a niche overseas.<br />
And I am pleased to be able to say that the housing -y<br />
has made an important contribution to this trend.<br />
Clearly the key to maintaining the competiti'venessa which has<br />
allowed those successes is firm control of costs.<br />
Appropriate wiages outcomes and the conscientious pursuit of<br />
higher productivity remain crucial to our fight to retain<br />
competitiveness so we can regain lost living standards. 006006 </p>
<p>But as Prime Minister I am also aware ot the more immediate<br />
human implications of an economic strateav which has meant<br />
real wage declines.<br />
The increases in our economic competitiveness have been won<br />
at the expense of increased, hardship for many Australian<br />
workers. That is a fact which we have attempted over the years to<br />
compensate through a series of measures aimed at increasing<br />
socialsjustice within our society within the<br />
responsibilities of our steadily reducing budget deficit.<br />
These have included an unprecedented assault on child<br />
poverty through the new Family Allowance Supplement, real<br />
increases in pensions, the introduction of Medicarp and the<br />
creation of a fairer taxation system.<br />
We have also, through the First Home owners Scheme :,. nd<br />
through real increases in public housing spending, helped<br />
put a roof over many families' heads a fact which the HIA<br />
readily acknowledges.<br />
Perhaps most significantly, we have created nearly oa;-<br />
million new jobs since we came to office a rate of Jobs<br />
growth twice that of the industrial world.<br />
However it is true that many Australian families are still<br />
finding the going tough.<br />
In particular, there are families who, while not being<br />
wealthy, are earning more than would entitle them to<br />
Government assistance, such as the Family Allowance<br />
Supplement, which is aimed at low income earners.<br />
They are the * families who are putting their financial effort<br />
into buying their own home and thus are not entitled to<br />
rental assistance.<br />
They are families who are working hard, including doing a<br />
lot of overtime work, to win security for themselves and the<br />
best possible chance for their kids.<br />
We recognise these middle-income earners have made their<br />
sacrifi-tes over the years of essential restraint and now<br />
deserve Government efforts to seek to repay those<br />
sacrifices. I'm not saying we can or should lift the lid on wages.<br />
That would be self-defeating because it would postpone the<br />
day when we can reduce our national dependence on<br />
international creditors.<br />
What I am saying is that the Government recognises that now<br />
is not'the time for further massive cuts in real wages.<br />
Barring unforeseen calamities, those days are behind us. 006007 </p>
<p>7.<br />
In current circumstances of gradual improvement in our<br />
underlying economic condition, including falling inflation<br />
and a shrinking current account deficit, we can expect that<br />
over the next year or two real disposable incomen 411 h<br />
maintained and gradually increased.<br />
That will provide the basis for the Government's approach to<br />
the Conciliation and Arbitration Commicair-the time of<br />
the next National Wage Case.<br />
However, nominal wage gains are only part of the living<br />
standards story We will deliver sig~ nificant personal tax<br />
cuts in the lie of this Parliament<br />
The combination of wages increases consistent with fallin9<br />
inflation and personal tax cuts consistent with responsible<br />
fiscal outcomes can provide the relief which wage earners<br />
particularly the middle income earner seek and deser"'. a<br />
a pace which the economy can afford.<br />
Of course ultimately the only sure way to sustained rapid<br />
growth in living standards is through rapid productivity<br />
growth. This is a task for both employers and employees. In<br />
this industry, like all others, we need a firm resolve to<br />
use the available mechanisms to achieve genuine and on-going<br />
improvements in productivity.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
Government policy has a major -in some cases the major<br />
role to play in each of the three areas for community action<br />
that I have identified so far: fiscal restraint, economic<br />
restructuring and international competitiveness through<br />
wages policy and mechanisms to encourage productivity<br />
increases..<br />
The principal responsibility for the last element that I<br />
wish to address today, however, lies elsewhere.<br />
Without forward looking business attitudes we cannot hope to<br />
meet and conquer the challenges of today's highly<br />
competitive world market.<br />
There is much we in4* Government can do to facilitate change<br />
and we will do whatever we can. But in the end it is up to<br />
individuals and business planners like you to identify<br />
opportunities and seize them.<br />
As a community we need the preparedness to take risks and to<br />
search for new investment opportunities.<br />
We need a willingness to innovate, to develop new products<br />
and markets and to explore new opportunities both at home<br />
and abroad.<br />
We need a greater commitment from workers and<br />
entrepreneurs alike to training and skills formation. 00G008 </p>
<p>8.<br />
AS this industry knows well, myopic approaches to<br />
apprenticeship and other forms of training may save cash<br />
flow in a downturn but only at the subsequent cost of labour<br />
shortages and inflexibilities.<br />
we need a hard look at our collective attitudes to quality,<br />
design and reliability of tupply.<br />
It is heartening to see that so many employers and workersboth<br />
in this industry and elsewhere appreciate both the<br />
gravity of theae tasks and the rewards which come to the<br />
brave. Indeed many of the firms represented here today are<br />
spearheading our national drive to diversify our export<br />
effort by selling housing and construction services abroad.<br />
In part icular, the Australian housing industry has " on tap"<br />
the professional people and the products to contribute to<br />
the housing development of our neighbouring countries.<br />
I urge all of those involved in this industry to seek out<br />
opportunities in this area. There can be no doubt that<br />
whether the Australian industry regains the status of a<br />
world champion performer hinges on its ability to take up<br />
this challenge.<br />
In the end it is up to you, the manufacturers, suppliers and<br />
builders to recognise long term advantages and seize the<br />
opportunities. For our part, we in Government will continue to do our best<br />
to nurture and foster this outward-looking approach.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I have been asked before concluding my keynote address to<br />
perform one small task.<br />
Your National Executive has invited me to launch the<br />
inaugural issue of your Association's monthly national<br />
newsletter, " National Housing Update".<br />
The newslietter promises to be a valuable, and probably from<br />
time to time controversial, new means of communication<br />
within your industry and so I have much pleasure in<br />
launching it. 00( 3009 </p>
