CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRIME MINISTER LEE KUAN YEW<br />
PARLIAMENTARY LUNCH 15 APRIL 1986<br />
PRIME MINISTER LEE<br />
I AM DELIGHTED TO HAVE YOU WITH US IN AUSTRALIA AGAIN. OVER<br />
THE YEARS YOU HAVE BEEN A FREQUENT VISITOR HERE AND, WHILE I<br />
HOPE THAT YOU HAVE ALWAYS FELT VERY WELCOME, I THINK THAT<br />
YOU WILL HAVE NOTED IN YOUR CONTACTS WITH AUSTRALIANS A<br />
STEADILY INCREASING WARMTH AND INTEREST TOWARDS SINGAPORE<br />
AND TOWARDS EAST AND SOUTH EAST ASIA GENERALLY.<br />
WHEN I REFLECT UPON AUSTRALIAN PERCEPTIONS OF ASIA TODAY I<br />
SEE VAST AND WELCOME DIFFERENCES COMPARED WITH 20 YEARS AGO.<br />
AT THAT TIME MANY AUSTRALIANS VIEWED OUR REGION AS TROUBLED,<br />
EVEN THREATENING. THE INTRINSIC CAPABILITIES OF THE PEOPLES<br />
OF ASIA FOR ENTERPRISE, SOUND ADMINISTRATION, ADAPTATION AND<br />
CO-OPERATION WERE UNDERRATED. BUT THAT IS TRUE NO MORE<br />
BECAUSE AUSTRALIANS HAVE WITNESSED THE FLOURISHING OF ALL<br />
THESE THINGS OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES.<br />
WHEN AUSTRALIANS THINK OF ASIA NOW THEY DO NOT THINK OF A<br />
REGION ENTIRELY PROBLEM FREE NO REGION AND NO NATION,<br />
AUSTRALIA INCLUDED, IS THAT. BUT WE THINK OF ADMIRABLE AND<br />
IN SOME CASES TRULY REMARKABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH PERFORMANCES,<br />
THE EFFECTIVE COMBINING OF TECHNOLOGICAL MODERNISATION WITH<br />
EXISTING CULTURAL TRADITIONS, EXAMPLES OF MAJOR POLICY<br />
TRANSFORMATIONS, AS IN CHINA, AND GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS IN<br />
BUILDING INSTITUTIONS FOR REGIONAL CO-OPERATION, NOTABLY<br />
ASEAN. PRIME MINISTER, YOU HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE FOREMOST LEADERS IN<br />
THIS PROCESS OF FUNDAMENTAL AND BENEFICIAL CHANGE WHICH WE<br />
HAVE WATCHED UNFOLD IN ASIA. YOU HAVE PRESIDED OVER TWO<br />
DECADES OF STRONG ECONOMIC GROWTH. TAKING AS A STARTING<br />
POINT SINGAPORE'S CENTRAL ROLE AS AN ENTREPOT AND A<br />
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS HUB IT HAS BECOME AN ECONOMIC<br />
METROPOLIS FOR ALL OF SOUTH EAST ASIA. </p>
<p>THIS PERFORMANCE BY YOUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN PART OF THE WIDER<br />
PHENOMENON OF THE SURGE AHEAD OF THE SO CALLED NEWLY<br />
INDUSTRIALISED COUNTRIES. THIS, IN COMBINATION WITH THE<br />
EARLIER ASCENDANCY OF JAPAN TO THE STATUS OF A MAJOR GLOBAL<br />
AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC FORCE, HAS MADE THE PACIFIC RIM THE<br />
AREA OF GREATEST ECONOMIC DYNAMISM IN THE WORLD IN RECENT<br />
TIMES. THROUGH THE SAME PERIOD AS THESE CHANGES WERE OCCURRING IN<br />
ASIA, AUSTRALIANS WERE STEADILY COMING TO TERMS WITH A NEW<br />
AND DIFFERENT WORLD, A WORLD IN WHICH OUR INTERESTS BECAME<br />
CLOSELY INTERWOVEN WITH THE COUNTRIES OF OUR REGION.<br />
THE SIGNIFICANCE TO AUSTRALIA OF ASIA AND THE PACIFIC HAD<br />
ALREADY BECOME APPARENT IN STRATEGIC AND SECURITY TERMS<br />
BEFORE IT WAS APPARENT IN ECONOMIC TERMS. THE DRAMATIC<br />
ECONOMIC CHANGE FOR US CAME WITH THE IMPACT ON OUR TRADE<br />
PATTERNS OF TWO DEVELOPMENTS. THE FIRST WAS THE RAPID<br />
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF JAPAN. THE SECOND WAS THE ENTRY OF<br />
BRITAIN INTO THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY, A GROUPING WHOSE<br />
POLICIES HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON<br />
TRADITIONAL AUSTRALIAN EXPORTS.<br />
THE FIRST OF THESE CHANGES LED TO JAPAN BECOMING AUSTRALIA'S<br />
MAJOR TRADING PARTNER AND THE SECOND TO THE DISINTEGRATION<br />
OF OUR PREDOMINANTLY AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS TO EUROPE AND,<br />
MORE RECENTLY, TO COMPETITION IN THIRD MARKETS FROM HEAVILY<br />
SUBSIDISED AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. THE MAJOR RE-ORIENTATION<br />
IN OUR TRADE PATTERNS, TOGETHER WITH THE SHIFT TO THE<br />
PACIFIC BASIN AS THE MAJOR CENTRE OF TRADE AND ECONOMIC<br />
GROWTH, HAS CHANGED THE FUNDAMENTALS OF AUSTRALIA'S<br />
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS.<br />
HOWEVER IT IS NOT ENOUGH SIMPLY TO RECOGNISE THAT THE<br />
INEVITABLE REALITY OF OUR GEOGRAPHY, AND AUTONOMOUS ECONOMIC<br />
FORCES IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD, HAVE WORKED TOGETHER TO MAKE IT<br />
NECESSARY FOR AUSTRALIA TO FOCUS ON ASIA AND THE PACIFIC IN<br />
THE CLOSING DECADES OF THIS CENTURY. THAT CONJURES UP TOO<br />
PASSIVE AND DETERMINISTIC A PICTURE. I WANT TO SAY INSTEAD<br />
THAT WE WILL BE AN ENTHUSIASTIC PLAYER IN THE ECONOMICS OF<br />
THE REGION, EMBRACING THE OPPORTUNITIES WHICH OUR<br />
ADVANTAGEOUS GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION OPENS UP, AND RELISHING<br />
THE PROSPECT OF CLOSER INVOLVEMENT WITH PACIFIC RIM ECONOMIC<br />
GROWTH. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS IS PARTLY A MATTER OF OUR ADOPTING<br />
APPROPRIATE POLICIES IN AUSTRALIA ITSELF. MY GOVERNMENT IS<br />
PLACING CONSIDERABLE EMPHASIS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MORE<br />
DYNAMIC AND INTERNATIONALLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIAL BASE.<br />
THIS IS REFLECTED IN OUR APPROACH TO INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING<br />
AND THE MOVEMENT TO LOWER LEVELS OF PROTECTION. THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN STEEL AND CAR INDUSTRY PLANS, AND THE EXTENSIVE<br />
MOVES MADE TO LOWER INDUSTRIAL PROTECTION TO MINIMUM LEVELS<br />
ON COMPUTERS AND OTHER HIGH TECHNOLOGY ITEMS ITEMS OF KEEN<br />
EXPORT INTEREST TO COUNTRIES SUCH AS SINGAPORE HAVE<br />
TOGETHER SECURED A QUALITATIVE CHANGE IN AUSTRALIA'S IMPORT<br />
REGIME. THESE POLICIES WILL CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ABILITY TO<br />
INCREASE OUR TRADE WITHIN THE REGION AS BOTH AN EFFECIENT<br />
AND COMPETITIVE SUPPLIER OF AUSTRALIAN PRODUCTS AND AS A<br />
MARKET FOR GOODS FROM OUR NEIGHBOURS. </p>
<p>WHILE AUSTRALIA AND SINGAPORE WILL BOTH BENEFIT UNILATERALLY<br />
FROM THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR REGION WE SHOULD ALSO BE ALIVE<br />
TO OPPORTUNITIES WHERE THE BUSINESS INTERESTS OF BOTH OUR<br />
COUNTRIES COULD GAIN FROM WORKING TOGETHER TO SECURE JOINT<br />
VENTURE PROJECTS OR INCREASED MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. OUR<br />
RESPECTIVE INTEREST IN THE POSSIBILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH A<br />
NEW, DYNAMIC CHINA SEEMS PARTICULARLY SUGGESTIVE OF SUCH<br />
CO-OPERATIVE APPROACHES.<br />
TO NOTE THE VITALITY OF PACIFIC RIM ECONOMIES IS NOT TO DENY<br />
OR IGNORE CURRENT PROBLEMS AND THE NEW CHALLENGES THEY POSE.<br />
THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE REGION<br />
MUST OPERATE IS NOT AN EASY ONE. POOR COMMODITY PRICES, FOR<br />
EXAMPLE, ARE TAKING A TOLL ON SOME OF THE MAJOR ASIAN<br />
ECONOMIES AS THEY ARE ON AUSTRALIA. I AM AWARE, PRIME<br />
MINISTER, THAT SINGAPORE'S VIRTUALLY UNSURPASSED RUN OF<br />
ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS SLOWED. YOUR GOVERNMENT HAS EMBARKED<br />
UPON A SUBSTANTIAL RE-EVALUATION OF ITS ECONOMIC POLICIES<br />
WITH A VIEW TO RESTRUCTURING AND RE-ESTABLISHING THE<br />
CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH. SINGAPORE IS NOT ALONE IN FACING<br />
THAT KIND OF PROBLEM BUT YOU ARE DOING IT WITH<br />
CHARACTERISTIC DETERMINATION AND PURPOSEFULNESS.<br />
BUT CLEARLY NO AMOUNT OF SOMETIMES PAINFUL BUT ESSENTIAL<br />
ADJUSTMENT IN THE DOMESTIC ECONOMIC POLICIES OF SINGAPORE,<br />
AUSTRALIA OR ANY. OTHER COUNTRY WILL BE EFFECTIVE IF IT IS<br />
STYMIED BY TRENDS IN THE INTERNATIONAL TRADING ENVIRONMENT<br />
WHICH ARE HOSTILE TO GROWTH. AUSTRALIA AND SINGAPORE SHARE<br />
A COMMON CONCERN ABOUT DEVELOPMENTS WE HAVE OBSERVED IN THE<br />
INTERNATIONAL TRADING SYSTEM OVER RECENT TIMES. TRENDS<br />
TOWARDS PROTECTIONISM AND BILATERALISM ULTIMATELY ARE TO THE<br />
DETRIMENT OF ALL TRADING NATIONS.<br />
DURING MY FORTHCOMING VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE<br />
I WILL SEEK TO IMPRESS AUSTRALIA'S CONCERNS WITH<br />
PROTECTIONIST TRENDS AND TO HIGHLIGHT THE EXTREME IMPORTANCE<br />
TO ALL COUNTRIES OF ENSURING THE COMMENCEMENT OF AN<br />
EFFECTIVE AND BALANCED ROUND OF MULITLATERAL TRADE<br />
NEGOTIATIONS. AUSTRALIA ATTACHES PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO THE ISSUE OF<br />
SUBSIDIES ON AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS. AUSTRALIA'S INTERESTS IN<br />
THE NEW ROUND NEVERTHELESS EXTEND BEYOND THE AGRICULTURAL<br />
QUESTIONS. WE ALSO CONSIDER IT ESSENTIAL THAT PROGRESS BE<br />
MADE ON OTHER MATTERS OF MUTUAL INTEREST TO SINGAPORE AND<br />
AUSTRALIA. THESE INCLUDE VOLUNTARY RESTRAINT ARRANGEMENTS,<br />
LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS, PRODUCT STANDARDS AND TRADE IN<br />
SERVICES. I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE RESPONSE OF COUNTRIES IN THE<br />
REGION TO MY PROPOSAL THAT WE JOINTLY EXPLORE THE SCOPE FOR<br />
CO-OPERATION IN ORDER TO MAXIMISE OUR REGION'S INFLUENCE ON<br />
THE NEW ROUND OF MULTILATERAL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS. IN<br />
PARTICULAR I WISH TO RECORD MY APPRECIATION OF THE STRONG<br />
SUPPORT THAT SINGAPORE HAS PROVIDED TO THIS PROCESS.<br />
VALUABLE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN IDENTIFYING AND<br />
DEVELOPING SHARED PERCEPTIONS IN THE PREPARATION FOR THE NEW<br />
MTN ROUND. </p>
<p>I 1 4.<br />
MR PRIME MINISTER<br />
OVER THE YEARS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND<br />
SINGAPORE HAS DEVELOPED GREAT SUBSTANCE AND DEPTH. NOT JUST<br />
THE STRENGTH BUT THE WARMTH OF THE AUSTRALIA-SINGAPORE<br />
RELATIONSHIP IS REFLECTED IN THE EASE WITH WHICH WE ARE ABLE<br />
TO MOVE IN ONE ANOTHER'S COUNTRIES, THE MANNER IN WHICH-WE<br />
ARE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE, THE WAY IN WHICH WE CAN FEEL AT<br />
HOME WITH ONE ANOTHER AND OUR ABILITY TO SPEAK FRANKLY BUT<br />
WITH FRIENDSHIP AND UNDERSTANDING NOT ONLY WHEN OUR<br />
PERCEPTIONS CONVERGE BUT WHEN THEY SOMETIMES DIVERGE.<br />
PRIME MINISTER, I AM SURE THAT YOU AND MRS LEE HAVE FELT<br />
THIS WARMTH DURING YOUR CURRENT VISIT TO AUSTRALIA, AS YOU<br />
HAVE ON PREVIOUS OCCASIONS AND I KNOW THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE<br />
TO FEEL IT AS YOU TRAVEL AROUND OUR COUNTRY. YOU ARE MOST<br />
WELCOME HERE AMONG US AND I WISH YOU A MOST PRODUCTIVE AND<br />
ENJOYABLE STAY. </p>
