    <content><![CDATA[<p>P. M. No.  98/ 1962</p>
<p>I am delighted to learn that Her Majesty The Queen has conferred Privy Councillorships on the Judges of the High Court of Australia.</p>
<p>The practice in Great Britain is to confer Privy Councillorships on Judges on their appointment to the Court of Appeal. I have long thought, having regard to the very high standing of the High Court in Australia, that the<br />same rules should apply here. I had the opportunity of discussing this possibility during the Prime Ministers' Conference in London in September and I was very pleased to give it my wholehearted support.</p>
<p>It has not been decided to what extent the Judges will assist the Judicial. Committee. This is a matter for arrangement be tween the Lord Chancellor and the Chief Justice.</p>
<p>CANBERRA,<br />21st December, 1962o</p>
