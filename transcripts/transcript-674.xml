    <content><![CDATA[<p>P. M. No.Â Â 98/ 1962</p>
<p>I am delighted to learn that Her MajestyÂ The Queen has conferred Privy Councillorships on the JudgesÂ of the High Court of Australia.</p>
<p>The practice in Great Britain is to conferÂ Privy Councillorships on Judges on their appointment to theÂ Court of Appeal. I have long thought, having regard to theÂ very high standing of the High Court in Australia, that the<br />same rules should apply here. I had the opportunity ofÂ discussing this possibility during the Prime Ministers'Â Conference in London in September and I was very pleasedÂ to give it my wholehearted support.</p>
<p>It has not been decided to what extent theÂ Judges will assist the Judicial. Committee. This is aÂ matter for arrangement beÂ tween the Lord Chancellor and theÂ Chief Justice.</p>
<p>CANBERRA,<br />21st December, 1962o</p>
