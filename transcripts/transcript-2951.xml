THE PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA,<br />
TUESDAY, 12 JUNE, 1973<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Thanks for waiting ladies and gentlemen.<br />
As you know, we have had a particularly long day of Cabinet<br />
committees and Cabinet meetings today and we weren't able to<br />
get through as early as usual. But, after all, there usen't<br />
to be press conferences after Cabinet meetings were there?<br />
I can't give you all the decisions because some of them require<br />
meetings, of the Executive Council or consultations with all the<br />
Premiers or at least messages to some of the Premiers. But I<br />
will give you the other matters. Now because I have come<br />
straight from the meeting you will have to bear with me while<br />
I look them up, and I mightn't be able to give you the full<br />
background to all of the matters because I have just brought<br />
the essential headings. We decided to develop the district<br />
of Sanderson near Darwin by constructing the neighbourhood units<br />
of Malak and Karama and associated works and to refer to the<br />
Public Works Committee designs for the whole project. We<br />
decided to amend the Lands Acquisition Act in certain respects.<br />
Perhaps you would rather me give you the details there if you<br />
want them. We made a decision about not proceeding with the<br />
phase-one development of the proposed Australian Government<br />
offices at Melbourne as proposed in the report of the Public<br />
Works Committee and we made some other plans about the use of<br />
the balance of the property there. We decided to enter into<br />
negotiations with the Sydney Cove Re-development Authority<br />
for the acquisition of a site on which to erect a new Customs<br />
House and there were some associated matters concerning an<br />
environmental impact statement. We decided to stabilise land<br />
prices in the Northern Territory along the lines agreed between<br />
the Premiers of New South Wales and me on 25 January last in<br />
respect to Albury/ Wodonga. We are proposing to the Premiers<br />
of Queensland and Western Australia that there should be a<br />
Northern Development Council under the Chairmanship of the<br />
Minister for Northern Development. The Council would be attended<br />
by Australian Ministers whose particular responsibilities occurred<br />
at any particular meeting. We have decided that three-quarters<br />
of the amount of D. F. R. B. pensions should be adjusted by the<br />
Superannuation Bill formula and that adjustments take effect<br />
from the first pension payday in the new financial year. We<br />
are referring to the Public Works Committee a proposal to<br />
erect a Workshop, Stores and Plant Pool Complex for the<br />
Department of Works at Kewdale, Western Australia. We will amend<br />
the Wireless Telegraphy Act to exclude references to Papua New<br />
Guinea. There are several other matters concerning Papua New<br />
Guinea which I will be giving you in a moment. Revaluation<br />
assistance for secondary industry will be made available to<br />
applicants which will be defined as a company and all its<br />
subsidiaries. There was a view that an applicant might be one<br />
subsidiary company although the whole complex of companies of which<br />
it was a part were not adversely affected at all by revaluation. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
We adopted the Report of the Tariff Board on Synthetic Rubber<br />
Latex. We decided to extend the Cellulose Acetate Flake Bounty<br />
Act until the end of June 1976. We decided to approve the<br />
proposals for an international code to regulate Liner Shipping<br />
Conferences at the International Conference which Mr Jones is<br />
attending in that regard. our decisions on the Karmel Committee's<br />
Report on Schools will be discussed with the Premiers at the<br />
conference with them at the end of the month. But there are a<br />
couple of decisions which I can give you arising out of the<br />
Karmel Report at the moment. We have decided to establish as<br />
a statutory body a Curriculum Development Centre. I can give<br />
you or Mr Beazley can give you further details of that legislation<br />
as we have decided so far. We have also decided to establish<br />
an Education Research Institute to undertake an expanded program<br />
of co-ordinated research such as hitherto has been carried out<br />
by the Australian Advisory Committee on Research and Development<br />
in Education. We have decided to amend the Papua New Guinea<br />
Act to enable the appointment of a judge to their Supreme Court<br />
whose qualifications and experience have been obtained outside<br />
Australia and to permit the appointment of a judge under a<br />
contract for a limited term. We approved, in principle, the<br />
arrangements made by Mr Jones and Mr Morrison with Mr Somare<br />
and Mr Jephcott about the Papua New Guinea national airline.<br />
We have approved in principle, but without commitment to funds<br />
at this stage, the establishment of an atmospheric baseline<br />
monitoring station and the provision of a number of regional<br />
atmospheric stations in Australia. We will make this decision<br />
known to the first meeting of the U. N. Governing Council for<br />
Environmental Programs which is meeting at the moment. We have<br />
endorsed the continued production of the Nomad aircraft and<br />
technical support for the project. Further details I can give<br />
you or Senator Bishop, the acting Minister for Supply, can<br />
give you. Finally, we have approved other amendments of the<br />
Papua New Guinea Act to facilitate self-government by 1 December<br />
or as soon thereafter as possible. This, as you know, has<br />
already been the idea, the principle accepted by the<br />
Papua New Guinea Government and House of Assembly as well as<br />
by the Australian Government. Once Papua New Guinea has selfgovernment,<br />
the Administrator. will be known as the High Commissioner.<br />
When Papua New Guinea achieves independence he will be known as<br />
or there will be an Australian High Commissioner there. There<br />
has been some difficulty with title there, of course, because<br />
the British precedence would have dictated that the official<br />
should be known as Governor. That title would not be accepted<br />
in Papua New Guinea now.<br />
Are there any questions? </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Q. The West Australian Premier in London yesterday accused<br />
the Federal Government of a breach of faith on States' rights<br />
charging you with misinterpreting Labor Party policy. He<br />
referred to a previous Labor Attorney-General, Dr Evatt,<br />
assuring the States that the steps now taken would never be taken.<br />
Could we have your reaction to that please?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I wouldn't comment on a report at this distance.<br />
There has been no breach of any undertaking given by any of my<br />
predecessors. Q. What's your reaction to the 29 per cent fee rise announced<br />
by the doctors, and also your reaction to their statement that<br />
fee rises will not be negotiable?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I was away last week. I am not familiar with<br />
the details here. Mr Hayden ought to comment on that.<br />
Q. In recent weeks you have been highly critical of the States<br />
on the question of off-shore rights and the action of the six<br />
State Premiers in their petition to The Queen. The six State<br />
Premiers have now declared their unanimous opposition to the<br />
Commonwealth's off-shore legislation and to the aboliton of<br />
appeals to the Privy Council. If in the attitude you have<br />
adopted on this question you are expressing federal A. L. P. policy,<br />
do you propose as a delegate to the Federal Executive or the<br />
Federal Conference to move to discipline the three State Labor<br />
Premiers concerned Messrs Dunstan, Reece and Tonkin. If not,<br />
could you be accused of grandstanding?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That's a very sharp question coming from you<br />
Sir. I will be taking no steps to discipline any of the<br />
Labor Premiers. There is no question that the Australian Government<br />
has followed to abolish appeals to the Privy Council and to assert<br />
the Australian Government's jurisdiction over the territorial<br />
sea and the seabed beyond low-water mark are the policy of the<br />
Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party's policy<br />
is binding on its members of parliament in the State Parliament<br />
no less than in the Australian Parliament. The principle of<br />
abolishing appeals to the Privy Council has stood since the<br />
Federal Conference of the party in 1908, when it was adopted<br />
unanimously. Nobody since has ever quibbled at this policy.<br />
And I wouldn't imagine that there are many people in public<br />
life who would not think it proper that the legal disputes between<br />
Australians should be settled within Australia by Australian<br />
judges appointed by Australian governments. The policy as<br />
regards off-shore resources was laid down at the party conference<br />
in Launceston in June 1971.<br />
Q. While you were away Sir you were bleeped by Sir Frank Packer<br />
on Channel 9. I was wondering if you had any comment on that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I did read something like that. But, I<br />
mean, I am well content if Sir Frank Packer just bleeps me<br />
instead of distorts me.<br />
Q. Sir, can you tell us the words that were bleeped and who<br />
was the Bishop you were referring to? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: Now the interviewer didn't mention any Bishop's<br />
name, nor therefore did I. But if the mitre fits.<br />
Q. Your on record in past as saying several times that you<br />
approve the New South Wales method of pre-selection of candidates,<br />
at least up till 1970, which was by branches rather than by<br />
Federal Executive by State Executive, and you used this, I<br />
think, against the Victorian method of pre-selection by State<br />
Executive. Can you tell us now whether you approve of the new<br />
method for Senate Upper House State Upper House candidates which<br />
the New South Wales Conference has put through, or do you go along<br />
with your Minister for Urban and Regional Development, Mr Uren,<br />
who seems to think it is retrogressive move?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It's true that I preferred the method which has<br />
been adopted to choose candidates for individual seats in New<br />
South Wales over the method which used to be adopted for choosing<br />
candidates for individual seats in Victoria. In my own view, and<br />
I'm not a delegate to any State Conference and I haven't been<br />
a delegate to any State conference since I have been a member of<br />
parliament but to give my own view, I believe the method of<br />
choosing candidates now adopted in Victoria is the best in<br />
Australia. Q. Sir, do you support Mr Uren's stand against the way the<br />
new system was adopted in New South Wales?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't comment on what my colleagues are<br />
reported to have said. I didn't hear Mr Uren. I don't think<br />
he was speaking from a text. I know, because he has shown me,<br />
that he has written a letter to the Sydney Morning Herald<br />
complaining of the misrepresentation and misquotations in the<br />
editorial in their paper today. And, I trust, that the Sydney<br />
Morning Herald will have the simple honesty and honour to<br />
publish Mr Uren's letter.<br />
Q. Could you tell us the circumstances in which Mr Uren showed<br />
you this letter. Did you intervene in this dispute between<br />
him and Mr Ducker, the New South Wales President?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Now, whatever way I answer that question, you<br />
will expect me to endorse your assertion that there is a<br />
dispute between Mr Uren and Mr Ducker. I have not spoken to<br />
either concerning the newspaper reports. Mr Uren gave me,<br />
this afternoon, a copy of the letter which he has sent to the<br />
editor of the Sydney Morning Herald.<br />
Q. On the Karmel committee report. Can you tell us if Cabinet<br />
approved the financial recommendation for 1974 and 1975?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have nothing to add to what I have already<br />
said.<br />
Q. While you were away last week, the Queensland Government<br />
decided not to accede to the request from your Government to<br />
take control of Aboriginal affairs. What if anything, is<br />
your next move. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: We haven't had time to consider this. We won't<br />
take as long to consider it as the Queensland Government did.<br />
We will carry out the obligation which the Australian people<br />
overwhelmingly imposed on the Australian Parliament and<br />
Government at the referendum in 1966.<br />
Q. Well how exactly will you go about this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well let's discuss it.<br />
Q. The discussion on the code of conduct for Liner conferences<br />
at the UNCTAD ME-eting came-up today. Was that decision consistent<br />
with the announcement that Mr Jones made sometime ago that<br />
per cent of Australian mineral exports would be carried in<br />
Australian flag vessels.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Minerals are not carried in liners, even on the<br />
Australian runs.<br />
Q. At the National Press Club last week, Dr Cairns told us<br />
that he had a conversation with the Prime Minister of<br />
Prince Sinhanouk's in exile. The Prime Minister asked him<br />
for Australia's moral influence to procure a halt to the bombing<br />
of Cambodia by the Americans and to bring about discussions between<br />
Prince Sinhanouk's government and the Lon Nol regime, and<br />
Dr Cairns said he had brought this to the attention of the<br />
Australian Government. Has anything been done about this yet?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Based on reports of what Dr Cairns had said<br />
to the National Press Clb my Department of Foreign Affairs<br />
did consult with him. There seemed to be some indication in the<br />
report that Australia might be able, or expected, to take some<br />
steps to bring together the disputants in Cambodia. An then<br />
enquiries were made overseas from several quarters. There seems<br />
to be some misunderstanding of reports of what was said, by<br />
whom or to whom. We have studied the texts of statements made<br />
by various parties including those of Prince Sinhanouk and<br />
conclude that at this stage there is no role for Australia as<br />
a mediator. If, however, we were to be asked by all parties to<br />
the present conflict to mediate or play some role in bringing the<br />
opposing sides together for talks, we would be prepared to<br />
consider it. On present indications, however, such a request<br />
seems unlikely.<br />
Q. At the end of your discussions with Mr Marshall Green, the<br />
new United States Ambassador, on Friday, you suggested that<br />
you might have something to say about those discussions at your<br />
press conference today.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Did I?<br />
A. Yes.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I never, and I don't think any of my<br />
predecessors ever have, made any comment after discussions of<br />
that character.<br />
Q. Well you did suggest to us on the steps, Sir, that you might<br />
have something to say at your press confereACe today about the<br />
discussions, </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well we must have misunderstood each other<br />
because.... Let's be quite plain about it. No parties to any<br />
such discussion every give accounts afterwards. I never have.<br />
Q. Can you say anything at all about your proposed trip to<br />
Washington as a result of these discussions?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. No. I said I would keep you fully informed.<br />
I have no further information for you.<br />
Q. My question relates to parliamentary privileges. If I may<br />
background this question a little bit, as far as the right to<br />
report proceedings is concerned, I understand that parliament<br />
inherits the privileges of the House of Commons which date back<br />
to the 18th century. This, in fact, does not provide a strict<br />
right to report proceedings in federal parliament. Would you<br />
agree that it is time that parliament legislated to define what<br />
its privileges are, especially in relation to journalists?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would like to see Parliament do this but<br />
I know that predecessors of mine have all said the same thing<br />
and we have never got round to doing it. I would hope that<br />
the Privileges committees on the two Houses might do something<br />
about it. I know that Mr Enderby, who is on the House of<br />
Representatives Privileges committee, has this very much in mind.<br />
But I must be quite frank with you, there's so much that has to<br />
be done by way of legislation that I can't hold out any hope that<br />
we will get around to it very quickly. It's something that<br />
really parliamentary committees can deal with. It's not something<br />
that the Government has to do alone. I am not saying Government<br />
hasn't got some responsibility in this respect but really the<br />
privileges committees of the two Houses of this parliament could<br />
do it preferably jointly.<br />
Q. Have you yet received the report from the Task Force headed<br />
by Dr Coombs?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
Q. The New South Wales Branch of the R. S. L. has suggested that you<br />
swear allegiance to the Queen?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The New South Wales Branch has?<br />
A. Sub-branch.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I am going by A. BC. reports which are<br />
prima facie accurate. I think it was the Inverell sub-branch.<br />
A. I apologise. Well, irrespective.... They require under<br />
their rules that you swear allegiance to the Queen or relinquish<br />
membership </p>
<p>-7-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, if they care to write to me I will give<br />
them the addresses of the half dozen R. S. L. sub-branches of which<br />
I am a member or an associate member. And they can move there<br />
I don't think they will get any support for it.<br />
Q. Did your comments in Adelaide on Sunday mean that the<br />
Federal Government intends to withdraw its support for wheat<br />
stabilization. And if so, when? If not, can you clarify those<br />
remarks? PRIME MINISTER: No. It didn't mean any of those things. What<br />
I was saying I mean I don't know how many of you were in<br />
Adelaide but what I was pointing out to the convention of the<br />
Labor Party in Adelaide on the weekend was that any Government<br />
has to decide on priorities. It has to make choices between<br />
different desirables and there are some things to which the<br />
Labor Party is committed, which it has initiated, there are<br />
others which its predecessors or opponents initiated or support<br />
and we will obviously in the Budget context have to make choices<br />
between such matters and I gave two illustrations. Of course<br />
I made no commitment in these matters. Incidentally, this<br />
becomes very difficult as you know, when I am asked at a<br />
press conference to make comment on some newspaper report,<br />
sometimes in another State. Well, communications should not be<br />
so difficult in that respect, but I notice there was a terrific<br />
to-do while I was in India about something I said it was on<br />
a T. V. interview about Waltzing Matilda. Now I'm not<br />
committing myself. I would hope that we would do something<br />
better than Waltzing Matilda or better than God Save The Queen.<br />
But what I said to this interviewer on Delhi T. V. was that<br />
judging by the correspondence received by the committee on this<br />
matter Waltzing Matilda is the favourite. I'm not committing<br />
myself to it, but as I've said previously Waltzing Matilda<br />
would scarcely be appropriate in my view at say a State Funeral.<br />
I don't overlook the fact that the last couple of lines or so<br />
are often rendered in rather a funeral way. It is very difficult<br />
gentlemen, you know when you are asked at one press conference<br />
something based on a report of an earlier one, sometimes<br />
thousands of miles away.<br />
Q. Have you given any consideration to the obstruction of<br />
legislation by the Senate, and if so what action will you take?<br />
Will you call the House of Representatives back?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I haven't discussed this with my colleagues.<br />
Perhaps I should say that I don't propose, as at present advised,<br />
to call the Reps back. The reason why I should say this at<br />
this stage is that when I made an earlier statement on this I<br />
was going on the view that amendments which the Senate made and<br />
which are unacceptable to the House of Representatives, should<br />
be do declared unacceptable by the House of Representatives<br />
promptly, so that the three months can commence from that<br />
declaration by the House of Representatives. There has been a<br />
legal view to this effect, but since then I have taken advice and<br />
their seems to be another view and probably a wider view that<br />
the three months dates from the time that the Senate made the<br />
amendments and the fact that the House of Representatives later<br />
refused to accept those amendments isn't a necessary starting<br />
point for the three months. It is enough if, for instance, </p>
<p>-8-<br />
the House of Representatives says we won't accept these<br />
amendments and forthwith sends the bill up again.<br />
Q. It doesn't need to be knocked back a second time.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. Well I'm not sure about the details there.<br />
The point is, when I was speaking earlier I thought that the<br />
three months could only date from the time the House of<br />
Representatives rejected those amendments. Now once the three<br />
months, in the prevalent view, dates from the time the Senate<br />
made the amendments which the House of Representatives later<br />
declares that it will not accept. So there will be no need to<br />
call the House of Representatives together to declare them<br />
unacceptable.<br />
Q. Have you had legal advice on this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
Q. Over the past few days, have you gained the impression<br />
that the United States Administration would like the Australian<br />
Government to modify or change the direction of its foreign<br />
policy away from its independent stance?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. This is a very well phrased question<br />
but I have not got such an impression.<br />
Q. Do you support the principle that Ministers in your<br />
Government who receive substantial living-away-from-home<br />
allowances when they are in Canberra should have the right to<br />
have subsidised homes' provided for them by the Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The allowance is paid, as I understand it, in<br />
respect of any period that a minister lives away from the place<br />
which he designates as his home. Some ministers designate<br />
Canberra as their home. I think, as Prime Minister, I designated<br />
Canberra as my home although, so far, ( I've held the job for six<br />
months) I have not put in for any travel or away-from-home<br />
allowances. I don't know when I will get around to it. I'm<br />
not quite sure what the situation is. But away-from-home<br />
allowance is based on where you declare your home to be.<br />
Q. What I am getting at Sir, should ministers who receive<br />
substantial salaries be able to rent Government houses at $ 16<br />
or $ 19 a week when the ordinary member of the public can't do so?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I believe that ministers should be able to rent<br />
houses in Canberra if that enables them to do their job better.<br />
And I believe that they shouldn't get any advantage as regards<br />
rent. There is no case, I am told, where they do. At the same<br />
time I don't believe that they should pay any higher rent than<br />
other people.<br />
Q. Have you, Sir, got the impression over the past three or<br />
four days that President Nixon will be in Washington when you<br />
make your visit there at the end of July.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That question isn't so well phrased. I have<br />
got nothing to add. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
Q. Have you got any further information on the Australian<br />
Yugoslavs in jail in Yugoslavia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No I have had no more information than that<br />
which was given in the Senate last Thursday.<br />
Q. On the question of ministerial housing again, Sir. Do<br />
you believe that ministers should go to the top of the priority<br />
list for housing or flats.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Close to it. A minister has an important job<br />
to do and in many cases that job can be best done by him living<br />
in Canberra.<br />
Q. Why can't the ministers rent~ from private enterprise?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Many of them do. Most of them do.<br />
Q. Sir, India belongs to the Commonwealth you would agree<br />
with that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: My word and likes to remain in it.<br />
Q. Well, this is a little out of your camp, but could you ask<br />
your P. M. G. whey they refuse to give India the Commonwealth<br />
press rate: five pence a word for the press rate against three<br />
cents a word in the Commonwealth?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I will find out. One of the very great things<br />
that Britain did for the world was the Penny Post and I believe<br />
that there is within the Empire, wasn't it, I don't think it<br />
was all over the world. And I believe there is very great<br />
advantage in having as cheap communication rates as possible<br />
between all members of the Commonwealth. And I regret to hear<br />
that this is not the case with India. One reason, of course,<br />
whey we get so much news out of Singapore is that the rate applies<br />
there, whereas, of course it conspicuously doesn't apply to<br />
Indonesia which isn't in the Commonwealth. I am surprised to<br />
learn that it doesn't apply to India, and I will follow up<br />
what you say.<br />
Q. Has Cuba made an approach to the Australian Government to<br />
open consular relations with your Government, and if so, what<br />
would be your reply?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I see there has been something in the papers<br />
while I have been away about this. Months ago, the question was<br />
raised of Cuba having a Consulate or Consulate-General in<br />
Australia. We took the attitude that the amount of business that<br />
Australia had with Cuba didn't yet justify a consulate. These<br />
are the countries in Latin America which do have consulates in<br />
Australia. Some of these, incidentally, are only honorary consuls.<br />
That is, certainly the case in Central America. There is<br />
Bolivia, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Equador, Guatamala,<br />
Haiti, Honduras, Panama and Venezuala. In embassies we have<br />
representatives from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Peru<br />
and Uraguay. So Cuba's trade with Australia doesn't justify<br />
consular representation at this stage. </p>
<p>Q. Would we do any more business with Haiti than we do with<br />
Cuba? PRIME MINISTER: I think that is honorary.<br />
Q. What reasons did Cuba advance to the Australian Government<br />
or representatives for wanting a consulate in Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I forget what the Really, it was quite<br />
some months ago.<br />
Q. You gave an interview to a Melboure newspaper, " The Age",<br />
in which you referred<br />
PRIME MINISTER: To the distinguished editor of " The Age", who<br />
was fortunate enough to have it syndicated in many other papers.<br />
Q. You said that since the Labor Government came to power<br />
diplomatic relations have been established with every country<br />
in Europe except Albania.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That's right.<br />
Q. So, one was left wondering why Albania?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We feared the charge of cossetting communists<br />
if we opened diplomatic relations with Albania. Let me hasten<br />
to assure you: we recognise Albania. Even our predecessors<br />
recognised Albania, but frankly we haven't got round to establishing<br />
diplomatic representation with Albania. Perhaps to be complete,<br />
we recognise but do not have diplomatic representation in Andorra,<br />
Lichtenstein, San Marino and Monarco, although there is a<br />
distinguished Australian resident in Monarco.<br />
Q. Sir, was that a serious reply when you said you feared<br />
the charge that we were cossetting communists?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, of course if wasn't a serious reply. No,<br />
the fact is that there is not, at this stage, a sufficient amount<br />
of business to justify having diplomatic representation even<br />
on a multiple basis with Albania. I dare say that we shall,<br />
but the representation we have established in Europe has been<br />
with countries which have considerably more sometimes quite<br />
substantial relations, with Australia, namely, Poland, I beg your<br />
pardon, East Germany, Cyprus and the Vatican.<br />
Q. On the question of Cuba, Sir, did you seek the opinion of the<br />
Australian Ambassador in Washington as to the likely American<br />
view if we did exchange or have some<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I forget, but I doubt it.<br />
Q. We have not taken any cognisance of the likely American<br />
reaction? PRIME MINISTER: I suppose we did. Of course one takes this into<br />
account. But the point is, there are quite a number of Latin<br />
American countries which would have an equal claim to consular<br />
representation as has Cuba. Where we have concentrated on<br />
diplomatic representations is in Europe and in East Asia, and in </p>
<p>-11-<br />
Southern Asia. And in those cases our representation is almost<br />
complete. But, for instance, there are many Commonwealth<br />
countries in the Caribbean with which we have no diplomatic or<br />
consular representation.<br />
Q. What I'm getting at, sir, is: Were we influenced in not<br />
having diplomatic relations with Cuba because we feared that this<br />
might offend the United States Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It would have been one factor. But not the sole<br />
factornor necessarily the predominent factor. You look at the<br />
Commonwealth countries in the Caribbean with which, at this stage,<br />
we don't have diplomatic representation. The fact is that there<br />
is a limit to the number of people that we can have representing<br />
us overseas even, as is so often the case now, on a multiple<br />
basis. We can't over-stretch our resources.<br />
Q. Isn't it very rare to reject an application to set up a<br />
consular office here? Is is absolutely necessary that you<br />
reciprocate it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Etiquette would require it, yet. But don't put<br />
it on the basis of rejection.<br />
Q. My understanding is that they asked.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I suppose our answer was " Not at this stage".<br />
Don't get the impression that there is a rejection in the sense<br />
of never or we won't.<br />
Q. It was the way you phrased your answers, that it was<br />
necessary we reciprocate.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It would be the usual thing. And there was a<br />
case, as you know, quite recently, within the last two years,<br />
where another country withdrew its ambassador, closed its embassy,<br />
because after many many years we had never established an embassy<br />
in that country. And there was another a few years ago where<br />
the same thing happened. The fact is that if you accept an<br />
ambassador or consul from another country the normal thing is the<br />
proper thing is to reciprocate. And at this stage in our<br />
resources, Cuba can't be justified. </p>
