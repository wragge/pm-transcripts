SOUTH AFRICA'S WITHDRAWAL FROM COMMONWEiLTH<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
The Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs,<br />
Mr. R. G. Menzies, said today that the Government had been<br />
considering the practical consequences, as they would affect<br />
Australia, of South Africa's ceasing on 31st May to be a member<br />
of the Commonwealth. Certain consequences would follow automatically.<br />
South Africa would no longer participate in Commonwealth<br />
Conferences or in various Commonwealth Committees and schemes<br />
set up for the benefit of Commonwealth countries. Also the<br />
designation of the Australian representative in South Africa<br />
would be changed from High Commissioner to Ambassador and the<br />
formalities for this were in hand.<br />
Mr. Menzies pointod out that Australia's relations<br />
with South Africa went back over a long period and covered a<br />
wide field. In some matters, such as trade, finance and civil<br />
aviation, these relationships were not dependent on Commonwealth<br />
membership and would be unaffected by South Africa's ceasing to<br />
be a Commonwealth country.<br />
In a number of other matters, however, the<br />
relationships between the two countries were covered by<br />
legislation. In some cases, South Africa was referred to by<br />
in otitics, it came within the scope of the laws<br />
concerned by virtue of being part of Her Majesty's Dominions.<br />
The need to nake any legislative adjustments to moot the now<br />
situation was now under study. However, the Government did not<br />
propose to make any alteration in existing legislation for the<br />
tiro being. Mr. Menzios referred specifically to the Nationality<br />
and Citizcnship Act. This Act, as it stood, offered the sae<br />
trea-m..: nt in Australia to South African citizens as to other<br />
British subjects. No alteration to the Act was contemplated<br />
for the present at least.<br />
In conclusion, Mr. Menzies said that the Australian<br />
Government would be guided by the desire to avoid any abrupt<br />
or unnecessary disturbance to existing arrangements with South<br />
Africa which served the mutual convenience of both countries.<br />
However, there night need to be some adjustments over a period<br />
in the light of particular developrents, including the<br />
policies which might be adopted by South Africa itself.<br />
