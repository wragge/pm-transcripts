Prime Minister Julia Gillard today announced that additional safety measures would be implemented at "The Gap" at Watsons Bay in Sydney to help prevent suicides at the notorious hotspot.</p>
<p>The Gap at Watsons Bay is a unique geographical site which has tragically become known as a high-profile suicide hotspot.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said the work would be progressed as a priority following recommendations by the Australian Suicide Prevention Advisory Council and consultation with the Woollahra Municipal Council.</p>
<p>The Gillard Labor Government will provide up to $1.1 million in funding to the Woollahra Municipal Council for infrastructure to reduce suicide and self-harm at the site.</p>
<p>Woollahra Municipal Council has consulted widely with residents, mental health providers, police and other interested parties to develop a comprehensive Gap Park Master plan that will, among other improvements, reduce the incidence of suicide and self-harm at the site.</p>
<p>The government is already providing funding to Lifeline for the provision of a 24-hour crisis support line at The Gap to provide ready access to individuals who may be considering suicide at the site.</p>
<p>Minister for Mental Health and Ageing Mark Butler said the funds were in addition to the Government's election commitment to provide $9 million to local governments to improve safety and infrastructure at well-known suicide hotspots.</p>
<p>"The government has committed to redoubling our national efforts to prevent suicides around the country. This funding is an extra step towards this goal.</p>
<p>"The funding for hotspots is just one component of the Government's $276.9 million Tacking Action to Tackle Suicide package to be delivered from over the next four years from 2011 - 2012," Minister Butler said.</p>
<p>Other important measures include:</p>
<p> * 	Greater access to mental health services for those at the greatest risk of suicide, including psychology and psychiatry services, as well as non-clinical support to assist people with severe mental illness and their carers with their day-to-day needs ($113.9 million);<br />
 * 	Increased funding for direct suicide prevention and crisis intervention services as Lifeline and providing funding to improve safety at suicide 'hotspots' ($74.3 million);<br />
 * 	Provision of more services and support to men, who are at greatest risk of suicide but least likely to seek help ($22.8 million); and<br />
 * 	Promotion of good mental health and resilience in young people, to prevent suicide later in life ($65.9 million).  </p>
