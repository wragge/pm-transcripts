PRESS STATEMENT NO. 175<br />
22 January 1974<br />
AUSTRALIAN INVESTMENT OVERSEAS<br />
The Prime minister, Mr Whitlan announced today a new<br />
Australian Government policy for overseas investment, especially<br />
in developing countries.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that much Australian investment would take<br />
place in any case in overseas countries and it was the intention of<br />
the Australian Govwrnment to encourage investment which would meet the<br />
type of criteria applied to investment in Australia.<br />
It was the intention of the Australian Government to do all it<br />
can to ensure that Australian investment in overseas countries will<br />
benefit the people in those countries and will be favourable to<br />
ownership and control of enterprises by people in the countries in<br />
which it is made and will have advanced labour relations and<br />
environmental policies. It is expected that all Australian investment<br />
will be in accord with the policies of the governments of the countries<br />
in which it is made.<br />
Mr Whitlam said it was a major objective of the Australian<br />
Government to strengthen its economic relations with developing<br />
countries, particularly in its neighbouring regions. Many developing<br />
countries in the Asian and Pacific regions have expressed a desire for<br />
increased Australian private investment. The Australian Government<br />
recognises the contribution that Australian private investment<br />
accompanied by technical know-how and managerial skills can make to<br />
the development and growth of such countries.<br />
The Australian Government also fully appreciates the desire of<br />
these countries to regulate foreign investment in accordance with their<br />
own national aspirations and development plans. Consequently the<br />
Australian Government was anxious to encourage private Australian<br />
investment in developing countries on a joint venture basis in<br />
accordance with those. countries' social and economic development plans<br />
and their investment policies and procedures. The Australian Government<br />
will use its best endeavours to interest and encourage Australian<br />
enterprises to participate in those specific fields of development in<br />
which it is indicated Australian investment would be particularly<br />
welcomed and which would be in the joint interests of both countries. </p>

Mvr. Whit'am said that the Government would amend the Export<br />
Payments In~ suran~ ce Corporation Act to broaden the scope and the<br />
overseas investment insurance scheme, which at present restricts<br />
the availability of insurance cover to those investments which<br />
provide export benefits to Australia and assist in the production and<br />
marketing of goods overseas. The Government proposes to broaden the<br />
eligibility criteria to provide that all new worthwhile direct<br />
investments which can assist in the economic and social development<br />
of an overseas country will be eligible for insurance cover. Also, in<br />
recognition of Papua New Guinea's expressed desire for increased<br />
Australian investment to further its social and economic development<br />
plans, it is proposed to extend the scope of the overseas investment<br />
insurance scheme to cover new eligible investments in Papua New Guinea.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that the amending legislation would provide for<br />
investments made between now and the enactment of the legislation<br />
would be eligible for consideration under the expanded scheme.<br />
In order to encourage partnership between Australian interests<br />
and investors in the host country concerned, concessional premium<br />
rates would continue to apply when the investment is a joint venture<br />
with local interests.<br />
in addition, Mr. Whitlam, said the Australian Government had<br />
decided to establish an overseas investment feasibility fund of<br />
$ 250,000 to assist Australian companies to meet the costs of preinvestment<br />
feasibility studies in developing countries. The fund will<br />
be administered by the Department of Overseas Trade.<br />
The Australian Government also proposed, where appropriate to<br />
negotiate bilateral investment guarantee agreements with overseas<br />
countries. Mr. Whitlam said that, in view of the important interrelationship<br />
between trade and investment, the Government was seeking<br />
in official bilateral trade negotiations with neighbouring countries,<br />
to have included in trade agreements, where mutually desired, a clause<br />
related to investment.<br />
Furthermore, Mr. Whitlam said the Australian Government would<br />
give early consideration to acceding to the international convention<br />
for the settlement of investment disputes.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said these measures will complement existing measures<br />
for promoting private direct Australian investment in developing<br />
countries. Such investment is already facilitated in a number of ways<br />
by the Government. Under existing policy, for example, exchange contro:<br />
approval is readily given to all direct investments overseas which<br />
include a significant measure of Australian managerial participation<br />
and the expert of managerial and technical skill. Also, Australian<br />
taxation legislation contains uftiilaterial provisions which protect<br />
Australian residents against the possibility of double taxation on<br />
revenue generated overseas.<br />
In addition, Mr Whitlam said the Department of Overseas Trade<br />
provides assistance to potential Australian investors in a variety of<br />
ways, including the publication of investment climate studies, the<br />
sponsoring of investment survey missions and the assistance of the<br />
Trade Commissioner Service. An amount of $ 100,000 had been provided<br />
in the 1973// 74 Budget to strengthen such services.<br />
All of these measures, Mr. Whitlam said, clearly indicated the<br />
Australian Government's desire to see increased flow of Australian<br />
investments to developing countries in areas of activity welcomed<br />
by those countries and in harmony with their economic and social goals.<br />
