TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, ROMA BUNGIL CULTURAL CENTRE, ROMA,<br />
2 AUGUST 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Minister, Fred Daly died today.<br />
PM: Yes. I was very sad about that Fred was a great Labor person, a<br />
great soldier, a great supporter of the Labor faith. He carre to the<br />
Parliament in 1943, he saw the last years of the War, he was in the<br />
Chifley Government, and, of course, he was a Minister in the Whitlam<br />
Government. And he was one of those people who kept the<br />
continuity between Labor Governments you know, the link between<br />
Curtin and Chifley, to Whitlam, and then on to the rest of us. And<br />
throughout his retirement, of course, he encouraged other Australians<br />
to understand the Parliament, and the Government, but most<br />
especially the Labor Party. I know his family will be very distressed<br />
at his loss, as will many-Labor people.<br />
J: Prime Minister, what are you saying about your other Labor colleague<br />
in Western Australia?<br />
PM: Just that he's the clown we have in Western Australia. John H-oward<br />
has a circus over there...<br />
J: What would you like to see done?<br />
PM: I object to people speaking to racist, anti-Semitic organisations like<br />
the League of Rights. And he has persisted in doing this, and it<br />
reflects poorly on'the Labor Party, and I have made that position<br />
clear in the past.<br />
J: ( inaudible) spoken to ' Campbell lately?<br />
PM: No. </p>
<p>TEL: 2. Ru9.95 4: 06 No. 012 P. 02<br />

J: Have you taken his comments about you personally?<br />
PM: Its been on before you know this is not the first time.<br />
J: Can you intervene?<br />
PM: I have got a Party that has got mature structures. I don't have to<br />
scurry away like John Howard did from Perth. You know, I saw<br />
John Howard in Sydney at the Miss Saigon show the premiere on<br />
Saturday night, and I said ' Clark Kent must have grabbed you from<br />
behind a curtain how did you get here on time?". He must have left<br />
that Western Australian conference at such a speed, leaving what<br />
Reg Withers calls a civil war behind him. You see, what's on in the<br />
Western Australian Liberal Party is something akin to what was on in<br />
the Labor Party in the 1950s it's a major party split. This is not an<br />
altercation this is a major party row a major split. And that, I think.<br />
Is a real burden for the Liberal Party that in one of its States they<br />
are completely at war.<br />
J: Are you concerned Graeme Campbell has taken attention away from<br />
the Liberal split?<br />
PMV: I think that the Liberal split is so great that it will take more than even<br />
Graeme Campbell's eccentricities to divert attention away from it.<br />
J: But it must be a burden to you?<br />
PM: I am terribly burdened here this morning. I'm just broken-hearted<br />
just grief-stricken.<br />
J: Are you concerned over the escalating diplomatic row with France?<br />
PM; I'm concerned to see that the French understand the Australian<br />
protest, and they are starting to register that now. And the recall of<br />
the Abassador is, I think, recognition of the fact that the<br />
Government's protest and indeed, the protest of all Australians has<br />
been registered in France. Now, it's effecting now French business<br />
with the region, it is affecting French standing in the region, and the<br />
French don't like it. But we don't like their capricious decision to<br />
continue to detonate nuclear weapons.<br />
J: Is there any problem in this protest excluding a company? is it<br />
breaking the law for political reasons?<br />
PM: No. You can't... mean, what offends us about France is that it is a<br />
u" 11iUU1rdcy. * TOU expect. aemocracies to Denave Dexter inan artronting<br />
smaller nations, and doing it particularly in this way outside it's own<br />
metropolitan area. So, I think, this sort of admonition is the price the<br />
French are going to have to wear. </p>
<p>TEL: 2. Ru9.95 4: 06 No. 012 P. 01'<br />

J: Prime Minister, do you have any expectations the French will<br />
retalliate?<br />
PM. I'm not sure I'm not sure what they will do. But there is a lot of<br />
reaction as well in Europe, and now North America as well, about the<br />
French decision, and we saw President Chirac in the European<br />
Parliament being affronted by a protgM rdI-ink we are going to<br />
see more of that.<br />
J: Are you concerned that Australia won't have a French Ambassador<br />
now?<br />
PMV: he's been recalled I don't know how long he has been recalled for.<br />
J: Are there going to be further protests by Australia?<br />
PM; We will be registering as we have now as the Labor Party has all<br />
through the 1 980s, we registered our opposition to nuclear testing in<br />
the Pacific, and we will keep it up.<br />
J ( inaudible). . price we are going to have to pay?<br />
PM: I'm not sure what the French will do.<br />
J: They have indicated now they are considering their options?<br />
PM: Okay. But I mean, let them be judged by what they do.<br />
J: ( inaudible).. . will there be consideration now of sending a ( frigate)?<br />
IPM: You send a frigate if you want, . you send a Naval ship for Naval<br />
business, And I don't want to see an Australian Naval ship be turned<br />
away by a French frigate with our tail between our legs. I mean, if<br />
you send a Naval frigate out there, you would send it out there to do<br />
Naval things. Now, I don't think the Australian community want an<br />
Australian ship firing on a French ship, so therefore we won't be<br />
sending a frigate.<br />
J: Senator Ray has hinted that further action against<br />
companies... .( inaudible)...?<br />
PM:. We will be doing more. But I think we are continuing to see what we<br />
might best do to continue to register our protest, and that's obviously<br />
because this Is going to be a rolling matter, we will be considering<br />
these things in that context.<br />
J: Are you worried about the slide in the latest polls? </p>
<p>TEL: 2. Ruy. 95 4: 06 No. 012 P. 04~<br />
PMV: Oh well I mean there is only ohe poll that matters, that is on election<br />
day.<br />
J: Prime Minister, what are the things Australia could do about it?<br />
PM; Well there is a heap of things and we have mentioned some of them<br />
before. But there is no point here, I don't think, running through them<br />
all.<br />
J. Mr Keating what is it like to be back in Queensland?<br />
PM: I Oh I don't know whether you should say that. I mean the Labor Party<br />
has won. There's that story about Eddie Ward. He walked out of the<br />
ballot room and they said " How did you go? He said, " I walked in".<br />
" What was your majority?" " One." So I mean the fact is who is the<br />
Premier Vpyjn Goss. And I think that the strength that the Goss<br />
Government has brought to the Queensland economy is going to be<br />
well recognised over time and to Its society and certainly with the<br />
Federal Government. Queensland has been one of the great growth<br />
States of Australia and that is coming off the policies of two<br />
Labor Governments. And I mean I think this is what is going to matter<br />
In the end. That is, where the recognition will be.<br />
J: Don't you have to turn Queensland around before you..<br />
PM; I I have never accepted Federal implications.<br />
J: Not necessarily out of Queensland, but as it stands?<br />
PM: The greatest Federal implication in Queensland is there is a Federal<br />
Press Gallery which must find a Federal implication in every matter<br />
that is, the Federal implication.<br />
J: So you are rejecting the notion that you are on the nose here. in<br />
Queensland?<br />
PM: Well the thing is I could have answered all these questions in the<br />
same way, put In the same cycle, at the last Parliament and, I think,<br />
you know, the questioners got their answer on polling day.<br />
J: When are you going to call an election?<br />
PM: Well I have answered that question on umpteen occasions.<br />
J: farmers...<br />
PM:. Whether it is translated Jntd votes, or not, I don't think is singularly<br />
Important. What is important is whether the rural community, whether<br />
the farm community, farming families in Australia, can maintain their<br />
viability through a period of prolonged drought. I mean I think that is </p>
<p>T4E: 0L6.: 925N. o R. u0 12<br />
the thing which the Graingrowers, Ian ._ Mc~ arlane, under his<br />
leadership, and others have s hUo the ederalGovernment and as<br />
I have said, we have now got around $ 600 million coming into this<br />
program. We have got 5,500 farm families getting income support and<br />
it Is. I think, I hope in areas of particularly exceptional drought<br />
circumstances holding the rural community together. I hope that Is<br />
the case. If we get follow up rains, I mean nothing will break the<br />
drought better than rain, not income from the Federal Government.<br />
But the Government Is there to do its part. To help the farm<br />
community in general and graingrowers keep their families together<br />
and keep their farms together through this period of prolonged<br />
drought, which is now quite exceptional five years in some cases. So<br />
I am hoping It helps and that we get the follow-up rains. I think this is<br />
the sort of partnership that matters. It Is not a case of simply listening.<br />
I made the point, good governments listened and bad governments<br />
listened. But itIs what is actually done. I think what we saw here was<br />
a large change In policy which is working, which was put together<br />
cooperatively by rural organisations and the Federal Government, the<br />
Labor Government. And I am very pleased about it and very proud of<br />
it.<br />
