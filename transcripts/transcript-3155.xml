PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 184<br />
February 1974<br />
PHOSPHATE FERTILIZERS BOUNTY<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, today announced that<br />
the Government had decided that the Phosphate Fertilizers Bounty<br />
should be allowed to expire at 31 December 1974. Mr Whitlam said<br />
that the decision was being announced well before the ending of the<br />
bounty to give primary producers and the fertilizer industry time<br />
to make appropriate adjustments to their planning.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the phosphate fertilizers bounty<br />
meant the payment to the fertilizer manufacturers of $ 12 a ton<br />
of standard superphosphate and an equivalent amount in respect<br />
of available phosphorus in other fertilizers produced and sold<br />
for use as fertilizer in Australia. The bounty is paid with the<br />
intention that the full benefit be passed on to the end-user.<br />
Total payments under the bounty to 30 June 1973 amounted to just<br />
over $ 337 million and in 1972/ 73 to $ 56.6 million. Most of the<br />
benefit of these payments goes to users in the more prosperous<br />
rural industries. The bounty was introduced in 1963 to emphasise the<br />
benefits arising from the use of superphosphate. This aim has been<br />
well met and it is no longer appropriate for this expensive charge<br />
to be carried by the taxpayer.<br />
