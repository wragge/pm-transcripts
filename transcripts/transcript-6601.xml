TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, CANBERRA, 10.15am,<br />
SUNDAY 3 MARCH 1985<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Well, your initial reaction Mr Hawke?<br />
Well I'm basically pleased with the result. That so<br />
called jewel in the crown of liberalism is still looking rat er<br />
tarnished. It's in our hands federally and still very soil---.-<br />
in Mr Cain's hands at the State level. He's lost some sea: s, and<br />
that wasn't entirely unexpected, but he has a very comfortable<br />
working majority. He has therefore created a record in winning<br />
two elections in a row for Labor. He's created another record<br />
in having control of the Upper House as well. So I congratulate<br />
Mr Cain. I congratulate the people of Victoria in returning a<br />
Labor Government. It's one which will enable us to work toge-: er<br />
for the good of the people of Victoria and the people c, Australia<br />
as a whole.<br />
JOURNALIST: How do you explain the swing away from Mr Cain,<br />
Mr Hawke? Well if you look at elections throughout histcr the<br />
normal pattern is a bit of a swing against governments. If Vsu<br />
want to realise the opposite of that, if governments -7 cw. er<br />
were always getting swings to them you'd never get a ,:: ance Cf<br />
government. Mr Cain had to take some fairly tough decisic.. s in the<br />
area of taxes and charges and I think that probably toLd against<br />
him a little. But you've got to remember he has a cofortable<br />
working majority.<br />
JOURNALIST: Some commentators this morning are saying that t* e<br />
swing should be a concern both to you federally and also to Å“ outh<br />
Australia and Western Australia with elections coming up.<br />
Well, I repeat the point I've just made. If you think<br />
that governments in power always get swings to them, the lcgi=<br />
of that is quite clear you never get a change of governmrent.<br />
It's governments in power, and particularly in difficult ti-e<br />
like the present the last few years have been tough econc-ic<br />
times and committed responsible governments like those of =-: salf<br />
and Mr Cain have had to take some tough decisions. And* when .7u<br />
take some tough decisions you get some resentment in scre z aar: ers.<br />
In our case we believe that the assets test was something wwahsa=<br />
responsible and needed to be done for the welfare of people ncw </p>
<p>P. M. cant and into the future of this country. Well we got<br />
a bit of a kick for that. So it's governments who do things that<br />
get a bit of a kick. But the important thing is the majority<br />
stayed with us both federally and in Victoria. Now you ask about<br />
Mr Bannon in South Australia and Mr Burke in Western Australia.<br />
I have no doubt at all that in each of those States they will be<br />
returned. When they come up for election, in Mr Bannon's case<br />
this year, Mr Burke doesn't have to go until the beginning of<br />
next year, and that will keep us in a position where % we have<br />
Labor in power federally and in four out of the six States. It's<br />
a very good situation.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke do you think these federal and State swings<br />
against Labor will discourage tough decisions in the second terms<br />
of both these Governments.<br />
We'll take the decisions that have to be taken in the<br />
interests of the people of Australia at our level and i baelieve<br />
Mr Cain will in Victoria. You see it would have been easy if, if<br />
you take our case federally, it would have been easy to take the<br />
course of saying, oh well, if you do something about the assets<br />
test that won't upset people. Well we knew it would upset people<br />
and undoubtedly that cost us some support, not only in the older<br />
age group but in some other age groups.<br />
JOURNALIST: A~ re you still willing to upset people if necessary?<br />
If it's necessary in the interests of the people as a whole<br />
I've consistently shown my preparedness to do that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke do you think the federal events of the<br />
last few weeks effected the result of Victoria the MX and so<br />
On. No, quite clearly if you look at the polls the problem that<br />
we had there for a brief period federally which wasn't so much<br />
the MX as such but the public airing of differences within the<br />
Party that was soon turned around. No, I don't believe that<br />
had any impact at all.<br />
JOURNALIST: He's made history by doing it twice. Do you think<br />
he can go on and do it three times.<br />
Well, yes. You realise Peter that it's a four year term<br />
this is the first time * that there's a four year term so Mr Cain<br />
won't have to face the electors till ' 89 and that's a long, long<br />
way away. But on the basis of looking at the performance of his<br />
first term which I think was solid and responsible I have no reason<br />
to believe that with another four years with the opportunity to<br />
implement a sensible program, which he can do now with control<br />
of both Houses, I would think at the end of that period he could<br />
be confidently looking forward to a third term.<br />
JOURNALIST: You were talking about tough decisions. Which tough<br />
decisions do you think contributed to the swing away from Mr Cain. / 13 </p>
<p>S3.<br />
I referred to the fact that he's had to put up taxes and<br />
charges during this period to enable him to have an appropriate<br />
budgetary setting within which to undertake expansionary policies.<br />
And I think that stuck a bit against him. </p>
