PRIMEST MINISTE 19 November 1979<br />
OPERATION TENNIS<br />
I very much regret that I have been sidelined by doctors and<br />
am unable to attend the launching today of Operation Tennis.<br />
As you know, I have been involved in the project since its<br />
very beginning and it is most encouraging to know that from<br />
today action will move from around the table on to the tennis<br />
courts. The initiative represents a significant attempt by the Government,<br />
Custom Credit, the John Newcombe and Tony Roche to<br />
reassert Australia's tennis supremacy. I believe that sport is<br />
important to all Australians. So is achievment.<br />
It has been a source of concern to many Australians for some<br />
time now that our once seemingly bottomless pit of tennis<br />
players, guided by great men like Harry Hopman, have suddenly<br />
dried up. This special pilot scheme aims to redress this position.<br />
Talent identification at national level whether in sport,<br />
scholarship or the arts is a difficult but important goal.<br />
Talent identification and the realisation of potential is what<br />
this scheme is all about.<br />
All young Australians now have a chance, that for some time has<br />
been denied to them, to join the list of illustrious men and<br />
women players of the past.<br />
I am excited by this prospect and shall take an active interest<br />
in the continuing development of Operation Tennis. I look<br />
forward to meeting its first champion.<br />
' The initiative of the Government's Sport and Recreation Department..<br />
and its Minister, Mr. Ellicott, have been of great help in<br />
getting the scheme off the ground.<br />
With Custom Credit and the Lawn Tennis Association of Australia<br />
we have organisations whose dedication to tennis development is<br />
already proven. I commend them on their sponsorship.<br />
I congratulate John Newcombe and Tony Roche in New South Wales,<br />
Ashley Cooper in Queensland and Alan Stone in Victoria not only<br />
for the pleasure that they and other Australian men and women have<br />
given us on the tennis courts of the world but also for now<br />
agreeing to pass on their knowledge and enthusiasmp,. through this<br />
project, to tomorrow's champions. 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
This is the spirit and the sense of challenge that we must<br />
capture in all Australians in the<br />
I know it will bring new achievements in the Australian tennis<br />
world and I join with all Australians in wishing you early<br />
success. z 7 </p>
