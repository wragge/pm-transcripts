I PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, RAAF BASE FAIRBAIRN, 24 AUGUST 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what do you think of the , pilots<br />
resigning?<br />
PM: Well, it's a tactic that they're using. All I am<br />
saying is that we will continue in cooperation with airlines<br />
to do everything we can to provide the best available<br />
service while this matter is resolved.<br />
JOURNALIST: And that's got to be a considerable payout by<br />
the airlines, do you think that will create an economic<br />
problem for them?<br />
PM: Well, it may create some problems, but there are going<br />
to be, as a result of the action of the pilots, a lot of<br />
problems for a lot of people. But the important thing is<br />
there would be infinitely greater and longer lasting<br />
problems if we were to succumb to this absolutely untenable<br />
demand by the pilots. So when you are confronted with a<br />
situation of an unacceptable demand which would create, as I<br />
say, longterm and unsustainable difficulties for the<br />
Australian economy then you have to take action which, in<br />
turn, will involve some--difficulties but not of such a long<br />
lasting nature. It's as simple as that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you expect this to happen?<br />
PM: Well, we have contemplated it as a possibility, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: should Qantas be carrying more domestic<br />
passengers? PM: They are going to be carrying a great number of<br />
passengers, passengers that would normally be carried by the<br />
domestic airliners interlining passengers coming in from<br />
overseas or about to go overseas from other ports,<br />
passengers in that category, I understand, will be carried<br />
by Qantas.<br />
JOURNALIST: The pilots say that they'll be looking for work<br />
overseas. Would you be sanctioning pilots coming in from<br />
overseas to work on our planes? </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM: If these Australian pilots have such a commitment to<br />
their country that they want to leave their country, that's<br />
their decision. In those circumstances, if we could get<br />
pilots from overseas it would be appropriate if that could<br />
be done. But you've got to understand that we haven't gone<br />
into this thinking that it was some simple issue, easily<br />
resolved. The simple and undisputable fact is that if<br />
Australia was to cop a 30 percent increase to pilots, then<br />
the whole wage system would break down and the economy would<br />
be fractured and I believe irreparably. I'm not going to<br />
allow that to happen.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the Opposition says<br />
PM: Who says?<br />
JOURNALIST: The Opposition says<br />
PM: Which part of the Opposition because, you see<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Blunt<br />
PM: Mr Blunt says, but what you've got to understand on<br />
this issue as in just about everything on which they open<br />
their respective mouths, there are different Opposition<br />
positions. One says we've inflamed it, one says we should<br />
have drastic legislation to almost incarcerate them. So I'm<br />
afraid when we're talking about the Opposition, as on most<br />
things, you're talking about an uncoordinated collection of<br />
people who just can't make up their mind, a unified position<br />
about anything. Now this country would be in a mess if it<br />
took notice of the ravings of the Opposition about anything<br />
and they would be on this.<br />
ends </p>
