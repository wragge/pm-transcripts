Prime Minister Julia Gillard today officially opened the new and already highly popular community learning centre in Wyndham Vale.</p>
<p>The new centre is providing a comprehensive range of much needed services for the people of Wyndham Vale, which is one of Wyndham's fastest growing areas.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister toured the Centre with Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, Simon Crean today.</p>
<p>The Centre has maternal and child health consulting rooms, kindergarten rooms, consulting areas for agencies and Government departments, a community learning area with 16 computers, a youth lounge area and a library.</p>
<p>The library features state of the art technology which allows people to check-out electronically tagged books themselves.</p>
<p>The Centre has seen around 7,000 people use its facilities each week since July this year. The library alone now has 5,000 patrons and nearly 350 members.</p>
<p>The Gillard Labor Government provided more than $2.3 million to help build the Centre, working closely with the Victorian Government and Wyndham City Council. </p>
<p>The funding came out of the Government's $1.1 billion Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program which supports local infrastructure projects, like the Centre, across Australia.</p>
<p>More than $83 million has been allocated to help build projects under this program in the western Melbourne region alone.</p>
<p>For example, the Gillard Government provided $9 million to help build a state of the art kitchen which prepares essential meals on wheels services for several local councils in the Hobson's Bay area.</p>
<p>The new Brimbank Gardens Community Hub and sporting complex at Derrimut received $3 million for construction from the Gillard Government.</p>
<p>The Government also provided nearly $3 million to help build the Milleara Family and Community Hub with the Moonee Valley City Council, incorporating a child care centre, a maternal and child health centre and kindergarten.</p>
<p>Wyndham is the fastest growing local government area in all of Victoria  -  and the third fastest in Australia.</p>
<p>Wyndham Vale is one of Wyndham's growth fronts with a population expected to increase from today's 18,000 residents to nearly 40,000 by 2026.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government is working hard to jointly establish the right facilities to meet the growing needs of communities like those in Wyndham.</p>
<p>Great community projects like these are providing thousands of jobs opportunities around the country.</p>
<p>Many local tradespeople and suppliers were engaged during the construction of the new centre at Wyndham Vale which now supports 20 permanent jobs. </p>
