PRIME MINISTER<br />
PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF SEC, GRAFTON RACECOURSE<br />
AUGUST 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: I don't want this evening to spend any time at length<br />
talking about the most recent situation in the Gulf other than<br />
to say this. I of course repudiate completely the nonsense<br />
that has been spoken by some that the decision which I, on<br />
behalf of the Australian people and after consultation with my<br />
colleagues, announced last Friday was one that followed simply<br />
from a conversation with my friend George Bush. The issue of<br />
a possible Australian involvement in the catastrophe of the<br />
Gulf had arisen earlier in the week as a result of discussions<br />
that commenced in Washington. By the time I spoke with George<br />
Bush last Friday morning I had had the opportunity of thinking<br />
deeply about this issue, of consulting my colleagues. And it<br />
was a decision taken, the most serious decision probably I've<br />
taken in the period as Prime Minister, not at the behest of<br />
the President of the United States, but with a full sense of<br />
the responsibility which I believe I had as leader of this<br />
country, and in the great traditions of Australia, that<br />
Australia should not simply be heard but that Australia should<br />
be seen. When the fundamental values for which tens of<br />
thousands of Australian men and women have died in previous<br />
conflicts, when they were an issue, and the rights and the<br />
freedoms of a small nation were in question, that the voice of<br />
Australia would be heard and that that voice would be backed<br />
by action. It was, as I say, the most serious decision I've<br />
had to take as Prime Minister but in the end it was also an<br />
easy decision because I believe the issues were straight<br />
forward. It is my great hope, my great hope that in the days<br />
that now pass before our three ships arrive in the Gulf area<br />
that good sense will prevail on the part of the leadership in<br />
Iraq, because I can assure you it is my dearest wish that that<br />
should happen and that our men should not be exposed to<br />
danger. Because the welfare of the people of Iraq, the<br />
welfare of the people of the region obviously depends upon<br />
those sensible decisions being taken. The force of Australia<br />
will be used within the context of the United Nations and<br />
elsewhere to attempt to bring about that result, it's quite<br />
clear live been talking about these major changes that<br />
have been occurring in the relations between the super powers<br />
that we have the privilege of living in one-of the most<br />
important and indeed one of the most optimistic periods of the<br />
whole of the post-war period. Because it can be said that<br />
never has there been a more substantial basis for expecting<br />
that the world will be free from the threat of nuclear<br />
annihilation. enda 1.1 amb= 990T8a. ow lutodailuaozc-r= IT-00-GQQT<br />
