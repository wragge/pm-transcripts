FOR MEDIA MONDAY, MAY 26 1980<br />
PRESENTATION OF<br />
SILVER JUBILEE GIFT<br />
This is a very happy occasion indeed. Three years ago, to<br />
commemorate Her Majesty's Silver Jubilee, we offered Her Majesty<br />
a filly or a horse.<br />
Then it was only a thought, an idea, but very nearly three<br />
years later, we have the result for which we thank Colin Hayes<br />
and Dr McDermott who is part owner of its dam.<br />
It has been a long and extensive exercise. A number of mares<br />
were mated for the northernseason and I know quite well that<br />
Colin Hayes was not going to make a final selection until he<br />
thought that there was a filly good enough and fast enough<br />
to carry Your Majesty's colours to victory in the United Kingdom.<br />
I am quite sure that not only he, but hundreds of thousands<br />
of Australians will be following the career of this, as yet<br />
unnamed, filly, and will be wishing the new owner all the best<br />
and very many victories in the years ahead.<br />
Your Majesty, I have very great pleasure, on behalf of the<br />
Australian Government and the Australian people, to present<br />
to ycu the Silver Jubilee gift from all the people of Australia. </p>
