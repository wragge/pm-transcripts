Prime Minister Julia Gillard today hosted Prime Minister Tuilaepa of Samoa in Canberra as part of his official visit to Australia as a guest of the Federal Government.</p>
<p>Australia's relationship with Samoa is one of the closest we have in the Pacific region.  It  embraces strong political, economic, and people to people links and a shared vision for a prosperous and democratic Pacific region.</p>
<p>The links between our two nations are further strengthened by the more than 40,000 people of Samoan ancestry living in Australia who make a valuable contribution to our community.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tuilaepa's visit has provided an opportunity to continue the close partnership between Australia and Samoa.</p>
<p>The two leaders held a bilateral meeting this morning where they discussed important regional issues including the restoration of democracy to Fiji, climate change and economic development.  This was followed by an official luncheon hosted by Prime Minster Gillard.</p>
<p>The Prime Ministers also signed an agreement to increase funding under the Australian Sports Outreach Program (ASOP) Samoa.  This agreement will provide $1 million over three years to use village-level sport as a way of providing leadership opportunities for young men and women and to promote a healthy lifestyle in Samoa. </p>
<p>Prime Minister Tuilaepa also used his visit to thank nine Australians who supported Samoa's recovery following the September 2009 Samoan tsunami.</p>
<p>At the peak of the tsunami response, Australia deployed 108 emergency and medical personnel and 29 tons of critical emergency supplies.  </p>
