    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth Government will deliver $4 million to assist the Very Special Kids Hospice in Melbourne to purchase the property that has been its home for 21 years.</p>
<p>The Very Special Kids Hospice is a purpose-built facility offering 24 hour nursing care for children with life-threatening conditions and a family services clinic.</p>
<p>Services provided free of charge include counselling, specialist care, sibling support and bereavement support.</p>
<p>Every year, Very Special Kids supports more than 900 Victorian families with children suffering from life threatening conditions.  </p>
<p>As parents, we wish there was not a need for such a facility, but sadly there is.</p>
<p>Children’s hospices do the work of angels. They are places of love and kindness during times of pain and grief.</p>
<p>Each year, Very Special Kids raises 70 per cent of its operating budget through tireless fundraising by its army of volunteers, community support and loyal donors.</p>
<p>There is a critical need for the services and support that Very Special Kids provides Victorian families. </p>
<p>Securing the purchase of the site in Malvern is vital for this much-loved organisation and the families that it supports.</p>
<p>This funding will help provide certainty for the children and families who rely on the services and support of Very Special Kids’ dedicated staff and volunteers. </p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government’s contribution of $4 million towards the purchase of this property brings a permanent home for a very special organisation a big step closer.</p>
