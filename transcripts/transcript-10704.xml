    <content><![CDATA[<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Fresh from his induction as a living national treasure last night,</p>
<p>   welcome the man who has to deal with all these issues and many,</p>
<p>   many more. The Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard.</p>
<p>Good one Geoff, Go Johnnie Go, very nice, how appropriate. You</p>
<p>   wouldn't have heard that one before!</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I haven't actually.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>We see a few St. George supporters.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I saw them. Marvellous, wonderful, I am the patron of that great</p>
<p>   club. Good day to come.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>How will they go this year?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I hope they do better than last year. But they have got a</p>
<p>   few of their players back and I saw Mark and some of the team last</p>
<p>   week when we got one of the commercials ready for the new NRL and</p>
<p>   I hope it will be a good year for them.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Well all the very best.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>As I mentioned, last night I saw you at the function for 100 people</p>
<p>   being inducted as National Living Treasures. You were involved in</p>
<p>   that and inducted as well. Given the history of Australia being</p>
<p>   a bit of a sort of the tall poppy syndrome in this country, celebrating</p>
<p>   success like that, does that mean we are turning the corner rather</p>
<p>   than cutting down our achievers?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think as we approach the 100 years of Federation we are looking</p>
<p>   a bit more reflectively and positively on what we have achieved,</p>
<p>   and who we are, and what we represent than we used to. And some</p>
<p>   of that cynicism is going. It won't go altogether and it shouldn't</p>
<p>   either. One of the great strengths of Australia is that we have</p>
<p>   a certain protective scepticism and that allows us not to get to</p>
<p>   carried away with what people say or do. But I think we are getting</p>
<p>   a nice happy balance now in a way that we perhaps didn't have</p>
<p>   before. And we really have achieved so much. And I said last night</p>
<p>   that when I walked into that room and saw those people it felt like</p>
<p>   a fast forward of my life over the last 40 odd years. The sporting</p>
<p>   people like Dawn Fraser and Ken Rosewall, who I sort of remember</p>
<p>   from much earlier years, the political figures that I have either</p>
<p>   been along side or opposing the culture figures, the writers, the</p>
<p>   musicians, people like Slim Dusty, who is sort of about as much</p>
<p>   an icon of Australia as you get. A terrific night.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Very, very good list there. You also spoke at the function last</p>
<p>   night and talked about other very important Australians, we will</p>
<p>   look at that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER (Extract from speech to Living Treasures function):</p>
<p>And I have to say feeling it very personally that I said goodbye</p>
<p>   yesterday to a 110 true living national treasures. And I know that</p>
<p>   all Australians will be united in their hopes and prayers for the</p>
<p>   safe return of those people.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, sending people off to war could not be an easy decision.</p>
<p>   I am sure it was very difficult. But when you close your eyes at</p>
<p>   night knowing that that personal responsibility is John Howard the</p>
<p>   Prime Minister's responsibility, knowing they may be maimed</p>
<p>   or killed, how do you cope personally?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it is not easy. I talk to my wife about it, I talk to other</p>
<p>   people who are close to me about it. I used the expression the other</p>
<p>   day that. I did it with a sense of dread. Not that I think it was</p>
<p>   the wrong decision but I am very conscious that it may result in</p>
<p>   that. And as I flew across to Perth I looked out of the aircraft</p>
<p>   window and just thought, over a period of an hour, an hour and a</p>
<p>   half, of what I could say to those men that meant something, that</p>
<p>   was honest, that didn't try and conceal what might be ahead</p>
<p>   of them. I tried to convey to them why we had taken the decision</p>
<p>   and how we felt about what they were doing and I really was able</p>
<p>   to talk to each of them, to shake each one by the hand and look</p>
<p>   them straight in the face and answer their questions.</p>
<p>They were a tremendous bunch of blokes. They were marvellous. They</p>
<p>   had that sort of wonderful sort of cheeky, larrikin spirit, but</p>
<p>   very disciplined, highly intelligent, eager to go, but comprehending</p>
<p>   of what might be ahead. And they really made me immensely proud.</p>
<p>   But it isn't easy. But you have to summon the capacity to understand</p>
<p>   what you are doing, in an emotional sense, but to put against that</p>
<p>   the overall national interest. It's not easy sometimes. And</p>
<p>   I could have some sleepless nights ahead.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>We know that was a private moment when you spoke personally to</p>
<p>   them. The media was excluded and I certainly wouldn't want</p>
<p>   to infringe on that privacy, but what sort of questions, if you</p>
<p>   are able to tell us, what sort of questions do they ask their Prime</p>
<p>   Minister when they are going off to war?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well one of them asked me why the campaign in 1991 hadn't</p>
<p>   been taken a step further, and Saddam Hussein completely attacked</p>
<p>   and annihilated? And I answered that by giving them the answer that</p>
<p>   General Colin Powell has given me back last year when he was in</p>
<p>   Australia and I asked him that very same question. And he gave the</p>
<p>   answer that, at </p>
<p>one stage the Iraqi army was left without any weapons, without</p>
<p>   any tanks and many of the allied pilots were saying they didn't,</p>
<p>   from a moral point of view, didn't like the idea of shooting</p>
<p>   completely defenceless people. And I thought that made a lot of</p>
<p>   sense as an answer. These judgements are very difficult. Now, they</p>
<p>   are the sort of questions that I was asked and ....</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>So did Colin Powell feel as if Saddam Hussein couldn't survive</p>
<p>   again?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, that wasn't in that context, it was in the context of</p>
<p>   1991. I mean our objective, if we have to use military force on</p>
<p>   this occasion, our objective is to remove those weapons of mass</p>
<p>   destruction.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Well looking at that issue it is all about the fact Saddam Hussein</p>
<p>   won't let the UN delegates in for a very, very good look. But</p>
<p>   this has been going on for quite a while. Why has the President</p>
<p>   of the United States decided to move now? What was the imperative?</p>
<p>   Was there some extraordinary piece of frightening intelligence that</p>
<p>   he received about some plan that he had to move and it was imperative</p>
<p>   to move now?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We have reached a point where every single reasonable opportunity</p>
<p>   for him to comply with the United Nations requests has been given.</p>
<p>   And we have sort of reached that end point. All of these things...</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>So there is no other top secret agenda?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, well, no.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Then why isn't France there? We are a bit lonely, there is</p>
<p>   Britain, the United States...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no we are not lonely. The British are involved, the Canadians</p>
<p>   are involved, the New Zealanders are involved, a number of the Arab</p>
<p>   States are providing facilities for take-offs and basing and so</p>
<p>   forth. And you can't assume that a country like France, if</p>
<p>   military action is needed, you can't assume that a country</p>
<p>   like France won't get involved.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>You don't think we are looking at another Vietnam?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I don't. It has got no comparison with that at all.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Indonesia is in the middle of what some people think is a real</p>
<p>   melt-down, almost a civil war. Is Indonesia a security threat to</p>
<p>   Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. What happens in Indonesia is immensely important to Australia</p>
<p>   because it is our nearest neighbour, it is the largest Muslim country</p>
<p>   in the world and we have got very close associations with it. And</p>
<p>   I am watching what is happening there very closely. The Indonesian</p>
<p>   economy is taking a fearfully hammering and there has been a huge</p>
<p>   reduction in the wealth of that country almost overnight. And I</p>
<p>   worry about the, you know, the potential if the situation is not</p>
<p>   repaired. I worry about the potential for internal trouble. You</p>
<p>   shouldn't write Indonesia off. I am sure that in the medium</p>
<p>   to longer term Indonesia will recover. There is a great deal of</p>
<p>   natural wealth and whatever criticism may be levelled at President</p>
<p>   Soeharto, he has been remarkably successful amongst Asian leaders</p>
<p>   and he has turned that country around in quite a dramatic fashion.</p>
<p>   Now he runs it differently from the way we would run Australia.</p>
<p>   I mean it is a different system, it is a different culture.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>If they go to civil war...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think there will be a civil war.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>But if they do, the worst case scenario, you worry about the potential,</p>
<p>   you just said that...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I worry about the potential for social disorder. I think</p>
<p>   civil war is far too strong an expression.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>That potential for civil disorder then, how would that reflect</p>
<p>   and impact on us?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well in a direct security sense it doesn't. And the other</p>
<p>   point I must make here is that economically Australia is not greatly</p>
<p>   effected by what is happening in Indonesia. The two countries that</p>
<p>   we trade with most in Asia are Japan and Korea. We have some economic</p>
<p>   links with Indonesia but it is more the proximity of the country</p>
<p>   and so forth and its size as a Muslim country that is so important</p>
<p>   to Australia.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Would you have some more time to spend with us, there are so many</p>
<p>   issues I know people are interested in?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I would be very happy to stay.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>We are very grateful for your time today. We will take a break</p>
<p>   on Midday and we will be back with the Prime Minister.</p>
<p> [Commercial break]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hello there, hi.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Welcome back to Midday we are still joined by John Howard our Prime</p>
<p>   Minister. In fact, in the break Mr Howard asked if he could come</p>
<p>   over and meet some of our guests today and this gentleman in the</p>
<p>   front, in fact, had a wonderful comment. Sir, would you repeat it?</p>
<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:</p>
<p>This is a great country because we can talk to our Prime Minister</p>
<p>   and we can have a referendum without a war. Most other countries</p>
<p>   have a war before they sort out problems of change at our Convention</p>
<p>   and so forth.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That is absolutely right. The great thing about that thing we had</p>
<p>   in Canberra was that, everybody had a, there was a whole lot of</p>
<p>   views, different ages, huge cross-section of the community and we</p>
<p>   could do it without rancour. And I came away thinking to myself:</p>
<p>   well no matter what the result of it all is, we are going to hang</p>
<p>   together, there will be no problem and we will sort it out. Nobody</p>
<p>   else is going to have anything to do with it and I think that is</p>
<p>   terrific and what you said is absolutely right. It is the greatest</p>
<p>   place in the world and we do have that quality of being able to</p>
<p>   talk to each other directly and say our piece in a very blunt fashion</p>
<p>   when we feel like it and I have been the recipient of some blunt</p>
<p>   comments over the years and still am. I find sometimes I get them</p>
<p>   when I go walking in the morning.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Do you have a comment, gentlemen? Actually we may wander back unless</p>
<p>   there is another comment that anybody else would like to make to</p>
<p>   our Prime Minister. This is a wonderful opportunity to get straight</p>
<p>   to the heart.</p>
<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:</p>
<p>I just wanted to say that I don't envy your position having</p>
<p>   to send troops off to possible war and just so that we get to say</p>
<p>   this to you, it is really good, because I wouldn't want to</p>
<p>   do it. So I admire you for that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is very hard. I mean, it is the right decision from the country's</p>
<p>   point-of-view but I feel the personal part of it. I mean, there</p>
<p>   were 100 of them in the room and I shook each hand and tried to</p>
<p>   talk to them. It was difficult but they were, their spirit is tremendous</p>
<p>   because these are amongst the most highly trained people in Australia</p>
<p>   and they regard themselves - quite rightly - as the best in the</p>
<p>   world and they are and it gives you a tremendous sense of pride.</p>
<p>   But I hope, and we all pray, that there be no shots fired and just</p>
<p>   somehow-or-other this madman will see the sense of backing down</p>
<p>   and we don't have to send them into action. I really do.</p>
<p>Hello. What's your name?</p>
<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:</p>
<p>Sonia.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hi Sonia.</p>
<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:</p>
<p>Nice to meet you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Very nice to meet you. Have you been here before, to one of these?</p>
<p>AUDIENCE:</p>
<p>Not one of these. My friends came yesterday.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yesterday, you must love it. It is a good programme. She does a</p>
<p>   terrific job. She really does.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Ok, Mr Howard, talking about the republic, in terms of the republic,</p>
<p>   were you surprised at the number of your Party colleagues who were</p>
<p>   supporting a republic.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I have known that for a long time. Look, it is one of these</p>
<p>   things that, sort of, defies Party lines and so-forth. I mean, I</p>
<p>   am not. I just think that the present system works pretty well but</p>
<p>   the public will decide it. I don't think, out there, people</p>
<p>   are thinking about it a lot...</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>One of the issues are....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>People are far more interested in fixing the taxation system and</p>
<p>   far more interested in the mortgage interest rates and all those</p>
<p>   sorts of things. They are the things that really matter to people.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Ok, and we will get to those. But may I ask one question, we are</p>
<p>   now going to have a referendum. It has now been decided as part</p>
<p>   of the republican movement that a president will be elected by the</p>
<p>   politicians. I think a few crumbs get thrown to the public, we nominate</p>
<p>   a few people, but politicians decide. What will the differences</p>
<p>   in power between a president, who is elected by a politician, and</p>
<p>   the current Governor-General, will the position, literally, just</p>
<p>   be a ribbon cutter?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The aim is that it will be essentially the same...</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>But the Governor-General can fire the Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, but only in very unusual circumstances.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>But will those powers still remain?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, that is the idea. That's the purpose of this. I mean</p>
<p>   the idea is that you, instead of having a Governor-General, you</p>
<p>   will have a President and at the moment the Governor-General is</p>
<p>   the defacto Head-of-State but the legal Head-of-State is the Queen</p>
<p>   and the idea of the referendum is that you remove the Queen altogether</p>
<p>   and you have a President who exercises the same powers as the Governor-General</p>
<p>   does. That is the idea.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Ok, let's move on to the waterfront, I know it is a, sort</p>
<p>   of, slight left turn here, that has escalated those problems this</p>
<p>   morning. It has also been suggested this morning that Peter Reith</p>
<p>   may in fact employ some of the same rules Bob Hawke applied during</p>
<p>   the pilot strike, he basically busted the union, sacked the pilots,</p>
<p>   sacked the union. Will Peter Reith, will John Howard sack the wharfies?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The purpose of this is one thing and one thing alone and that is</p>
<p>   to generate more jobs for Australians. The reason we want a better</p>
<p>   waterfront is not to bash up a union, that's not the purpose.</p>
<p>   I have got no argument with unions as such, I just want a more efficient</p>
<p>   waterfront.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>How will you get that result?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you will get a more efficient waterfront if you have more</p>
<p>   competition and you have lower costs on the waterfront and it means</p>
<p>   we can sell more abroad and if we can sell more abroad...</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>The wharfies disagree. They don't like your ideas.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they are wrong. I mean every study has shown that large parts</p>
<p>   of our wharf operations are highly inefficient.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>They may be wrong but they are still standing firm. What will you</p>
<p>   do?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we will continue to do what we have done now and that is create</p>
<p>   a law that allows competition and I admire what the farmers of Australia</p>
<p>   are doing. The farmers of Australia have set up a company that has</p>
<p>   gone into competition and they will employ non-union labour and</p>
<p>   that is how it should be. Until now, if you are not a unionist,</p>
<p>   you can't get a job on the Australian waterfront, full stop.</p>
<p>   Now that is wrong.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>But you know the wharfies aren't going to play ball with you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there comes a point when the Australia population will not</p>
<p>   accept something that is unreasonable. Now, we are dealing here</p>
<p>   with highly paid people. I mean these are not the battlers of the</p>
<p>   trade union movement. Many of them earn $100,000 a year. They are</p>
<p>   not battlers. They are the elite of the trade union movement and</p>
<p>   they have privileges that battlers in the trade union movement elsewhere</p>
<p>   in Australian don't have. And we want lower costs on the wharves</p>
<p>   so our exporters can do more business overseas and employ more Australians.</p>
<p>   Now that is what it is all about.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>So you don't think they will be sacked like the pilots were</p>
<p>   sacked?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I am not taking any sort of analogy from anybody else. I</p>
<p>   mean we changed the law to allow non-union labour onto the waterfront</p>
<p>   and we have now got a farmer owned company that is going into business</p>
<p>   and going into competition with existing stevedores. Now that is</p>
<p>   terrific. It is like anybody opening up a new business and if they</p>
<p>   can provide competition, get the prices down, we all benefit and</p>
<p>   there are more jobs.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Interesting, the fact that your favourite movie is On the Waterfront.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It was a great movie. I thought Rod Steiger and Marlon Brando,</p>
<p>   they were a great combination in that. There are some great lines</p>
<p>   in that movie.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>"I could have been a contender", that's the famous...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>"I could have gone somewhere, I could have been something</p>
<p>   and you said no we are going for a price on Wilson and I had to</p>
<p>   take a dive", that's what he said. It was a great movie.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>You do a better impression than that at parties, I am sure.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I better not chance my arm.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>An election. Predicting an election. I guess today, on Midday</p>
<p>   live, you are not going to tell us what the election date is going</p>
<p>   to be?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>A girl has got to try.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>She has. It will be sometime.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Spoken like a good politician.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The right time. It is not due until March of next year and I....</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>The sort of factors you have got to think about when you are figuring</p>
<p>   out a judgement on an election date - and I would just like to bring</p>
<p>   this in, so you can figure this into the calculations when you are</p>
<p>   trying to determine a date - numerologically speaking, according</p>
<p>   to Henry Conlon, we asked him to do your numbers, Mr Howard, and</p>
<p>   do you know the last couple of years have been a pinnacle 11 for</p>
<p>   you, a fabulous cycle.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Eleven.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>The best, you can't get any better than that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Out of ten.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>I think it goes 1 to eleven, but it has been a great cycle for</p>
<p>   the last few years for you and, in fact, this very year you are</p>
<p>   in, is a year 6, which means it could be very good for an election,</p>
<p>   for you, John Howard. In fact Bob Hawke won his 83 Election</p>
<p>   in his year 6, so does that give you more confidence?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Very interesting factor that. Very, I hadn't taken that, that's</p>
<p>   a very interesting piece of research. I will keep that in mind.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Oh, we have actually got the whole chart here.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The whole book?</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>I have got the whole...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Can you slip me a copy?</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>This is John Winston Howard's numerological chart. I'll</p>
<p>   hand this along to you. Not a problem. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>And when the election date is called, hey, you heard it here first.</p>
<p>   It could be this year?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'll take the sheet, yes.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>GST, we must pass by quickly, Mr Costello is out selling the GST.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, he is out selling lower tax. I mean this whole tax reform is</p>
<p>   about having a fairer tax system. Do you know at the moment we all</p>
<p>   have a family car and you pay 22 per cent sales tax on a family</p>
<p>   car but if any of you could afford to buy a lear jet, which I can't,</p>
<p>   and wonder whether any of you can, I don't think so, you don't</p>
<p>   pay any sales tax on that but you pay 22 per cent on a family car.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>But it was so tough for John Hewson to sell it, he didn't</p>
<p>   do it...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Forget about, with due respect to my former leader, that's</p>
<p>   history.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>If Mr Costello doesn't sell it well, who gets the blame?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we are going to sell lower taxation and a fairer taxation</p>
<p>   system, very well indeed, because it is not about a broad-based</p>
<p>   indirect tax, it is about making the whole system fairer and better.</p>
<p>   And that includes, it must include, significant reductions in personal</p>
<p>   income tax because if we don't fix it by the year 2000, the</p>
<p>   average person, on average weekly earnings, is going to be paying</p>
<p>   47 per cent at their margin on their weekly income and that is ridiculous,</p>
<p>   absolutely ridiculous.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Your other passion is cricket, yesterday Cheryl Kernot was on,</p>
<p>   in her capacity as patron of women's cricket, you know Australian</p>
<p>   girls, the Australian Women's Cricket team are World Champs.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They are. I met them after they, in fact the first day of the Test</p>
<p>   in Sydney, I had the opportunity of meeting them all and I can also</p>
<p>   say that I have got the rare distinction that the captain of the</p>
<p>   Australian Women's Team.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Belinda Clarke.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Belinda Clarke, and the Captain of the Australian team, Mark Taylor,</p>
<p>   they both live in my electorate and I really feel particularly privileged</p>
<p>   and I think it is a marvellous coincidence, given the passion I</p>
<p>   have for cricket.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>When Cheryl was with us yesterday, I asked her if she had a question</p>
<p>   she'd like to address to you. So if you would observe.</p>
<p>Kernot:</p>
<p>I would like to know if he is going to invite the women cricketers</p>
<p>   to the Lodge, the way he invites the men cricketers to the Lodge?</p>
<p>Kennerly:</p>
<p>Good point I will bring that up.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, of course.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Of course. Do you have a date?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I have got to wait and see their programme for the season and they</p>
<p>   have got a tour going to, I think, England and Ireland. Look I would</p>
<p>   love to do that and there are a number of other women's teams</p>
<p>   that I also want to honour, the hockey, the netball and the women's</p>
<p>   sporting achievements in Australia are just, they have broadened</p>
<p>   and soared, over the last few years and I think that is terrific.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>So the women's team will be coming to the Lodge for a reception.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Or Kirribilli. Whichever suits them most.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Okay, delight to have you with us, Mr Howard. We thank you very</p>
<p>   much for taking so much time and, audience, I hope you have enjoyed</p>
<p>   that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
