FOR PRL. SS 10 MARCH 1977<br />
COMMONWEALTH DAY 1977<br />
The fourteenth of March 1977 will be the first occasion on which<br />
member countries of the Commonwealth will simultaneously celebrate<br />
Commonwealth Day.<br />
Previously Commonwealth Day was celebrated in Australia on the<br />
second Saturday in June in conjunction with The Queen's Official<br />
Birthday celebrations. The new date for Commonwealth Day, the<br />
second Monday in March of each year, has been chosen so that<br />
the Commonwealth as a whole is able to celebrate its common<br />
heritage on the same day and increase public understanding o[<br />
the Commonwealth.<br />
Commonwealth Day presents a unique opportunity for Australians<br />
to re-affirm their commitment to the Commonwealth association<br />
and to gain a better understanding and knowledge of Commonwealth<br />
affairs. We, in Australia, are most fortunate that this year's<br />
celebration of Commonwealth Day will coincide with the visit<br />
by Her Majesty The Queen.<br />
I expect that State Governments and the many Commonwealth<br />
Societies will arrange appropriate functions and that educational<br />
authorities will ensure the significance of the day is<br />
adequately celebrated in schools. 00Oooo0OO </p>
