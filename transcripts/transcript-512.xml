UNITED STATES NAVAL COMMUTNICATIONS STATION AT NORTH WEST CAPE<br />
STATEMENT Y TE PRTIME MTNISTERT TL RT, ' lONe R G MNZIEN,<br />
" H-, THOEroTSE" Of RFe EITL 1V<br />
As Honourable Members are aware, the United States<br />
Naval Authorities have for some time been investigating possible<br />
sites and studying the feasibility of establishing a Naval<br />
Communications Station in Western Australia. Following these<br />
investigations the United States Government has formally rcques'ed<br />
permission to establish and operate such a station at North West<br />
Cape. The Commonwealth Government has approved the request.<br />
The Western Australian Government, which has been kept<br />
informed, has already rendered considerable assistance in the<br />
initial survey activities, It has expressed its desire to cooperate<br />
to the fullest possible extent in the project an offe,<br />
which is greatly appreciated by the Commonwealth Government.<br />
The purpose of the Station, which will include a complex<br />
antenna system high powered transmitting and receiving equipment,<br />
and administrative and supporting facilities, is to provide radio<br />
Scommunications for United States and allied ships over a wide<br />
area of the Indian Ocean and the Western Pacific.<br />
The power supply required for the Station will be<br />
provided by conventional type diesel motors,<br />
The total area of land affected by the project will be<br />
about 28 square miles, Cf this area, all except about 4 square<br />
miles will continue to be available for such activities as<br />
grazing, subject for technical reasons to restrictions on certain<br />
types of construction or installations,<br />
The estimated capital cost of the Station itself will be<br />
of the order of Å“ A33million. Substantial additional funds will be<br />
required for such things as housing and family amenities. The<br />
United States Government will meet in full the expenditure<br />
Srequired for both the construction and operation of the Station,<br />
which will be without cost to the Australian Government.<br />
Construction is planned to commence as soon as possible<br />
and will be at its peak from early 1963 to late 1965. During this<br />
period employment on the project is expected to be between 800<br />
and 1000 people. In the construction of the Station, the maximum<br />
practicable use will be made of Australian contractors, labour anr:<br />
materials. Detailed liaison will be established between the<br />
United States Authorities and appropriate Australian Departments<br />
and Authorities to achieve this.<br />
Present plans provide for an eventual population in the<br />
area, to operate and maintain the Station, of approximately 450,<br />
including both United States and Australian oprsonnel and their<br />
dependants. Married quarters and essential comuunity facilities<br />
will be provided for these people. A detailed agrooeent is bein2<br />
worked out with the United States Government to cover the status<br />
of American personnel who will be in Australia in connection wi. h<br />
the Station. </p>
<p>2.<br />
In addition to normal inter-service technical and<br />
administrative liaison bet-een the United Stctes Authorities<br />
responsible for the Station and co-operating Australian<br />
Departments and Services, arrangements will be made for<br />
consultation between the two Governments on matters relating to<br />
the Station and its use. The facilities of the Station will be<br />
available to the Australian Forces.<br />
The matters to which I have referred will be embodied<br />
in a formal agreement between the two Governments which is now<br />
being prepared. This will be announced in due course.<br />
The establishment of this Station in Australia will<br />
mark an important step in the steadily increasing defence cooperation<br />
between the two countries. It will make a highly<br />
significant contribution to general allied military capability in<br />
this area. It is within the spirit of co-operation envisaged<br />
under the ANZUS Treaty, under which the parties agreed to<br />
co-ordinate their efforts for collective defence for the<br />
preservation of peace and security. </p>
