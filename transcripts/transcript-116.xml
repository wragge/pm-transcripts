SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER RT. HON. R. G. MENZIES<br />
AT THE CANB~ iRA UNIVERSITY C6LLEGE, 12TH-OCTOBER1959<br />
. Get~ mn. Mr. Chairman, Principal, Vice-Chancellor, Ladies and<br />
As a rule when I'm required to wear one of these<br />
funny hats, and I've read the instructions that the hat should<br />
be kept on during the speeches I make a mere token of it and<br />
I take it off, but, funny as itis, I think I'll keep it on today,<br />
under the circumstances.<br />
I think we've all been delighted to hear the narrative<br />
given to us by Dr. Dickson: it's a very checkered history,<br />
but it's a very brave one and a very good one, and of course the<br />
development of the student body in recent years has, I think,<br />
been quite remarkable and perhaps, a few years ago-, it might<br />
have been quiteunexpected.<br />
Now you've been told that in the near future decisions<br />
will be made I don't propose to anticipate them. I'm<br />
fairly familiar with the views of Professor Burton on these<br />
, matters he has a persuasive manner I've heard views from<br />
other people and all I can say is that we hope that whatever de<br />
-cision we take, whioh must be taken nov~ within " he next week<br />
or two, will be in the best interests, as they say, of all concerned.<br />
But in the meantime I just want to say this to you at<br />
this particular occasion., whatever the future form of Government<br />
may be, there can be no doubt whatever that the time is<br />
oveicdue for the provision for this body of barning, whatever<br />
its actual structural future may be, the provision for it of<br />
proper accommodation, and by proper Accommodation I mean, in<br />
the first place, plenty of space. I dare say in the case of<br />
my own University the one over which Sir George Peyton operates<br />
with such distinction, those who founded it many years ago<br />
thought that they were being almost extravagant in their allocation<br />
of grounds and today it's rather hard, as I discovered-the<br />
other day, to find your way through the interstices between the<br />
buildings, all of which to add to thc confusion of the lay<br />
mind, has been constructed in strangely varied architectural<br />
s tyl e. Sydney University is another example of how the passage<br />
of * timeio and the -growth of the corimunity, and the demand<br />
for space can render all early anticipations quite inadequate.<br />
And therefore I'm very glad to know that as a result of the<br />
variety of discussions that have occurred there is, at any<br />
rate, in hand, a proper allocation of space. That's very important;<br />
a little substracted from, I think, by the Working<br />
Men's Club, but as I came along here today I thought: " Well<br />
there may be soiiething in this", because, knowing what I do<br />
about students, I'm sure that it would be very easy for them to<br />
establish a Students' Union, not the usual Students' Union but<br />
a Trade Union, though that, of course, might connote a certain<br />
amount of useful labour, and they will form a Students; Union,<br />
affiliate themselves with the local Trades Hall, become memibers<br />
of the Club and ultimately squeeze out all the other occupants.<br />
I just throw out that suggestion without any malice and without<br />
prejudice, but at any rate on space, thank Heavens, we don't<br />
need to be very maean about it in this City and I hope we never<br />
will be, In the second place, of course, it is essential<br />
start putting on one side all these intangible elements which<br />
make a University, these great things which make a University,<br />
and which could make a University in a series of tents, if it<br />
caxie to that, it is essential, in my opinion, that there </p>
<p>* 00 </p>
<p>2.<br />
should be adequate academic buildings and here is a good start:<br />
this block, the Science block, these, I hope are merely the beginning<br />
of a series of building operations which will give to<br />
this institution an adequate home, adequate accommodation, something<br />
that will not only provide all the things " hat are needed,<br />
but will provide them with dignity and with permanence.<br />
And in the third place and this, I think, is a matter<br />
that we must pay more and more attention to if Canberra is<br />
to attract into itself a body of full-time students, it can't<br />
expect, and I hope it won't expect to attract them only from<br />
the local citizenry. It is not a all desirable that any University<br />
Foundation in this City should be regarded as a purely<br />
local affair; it must provide its attraction for people from<br />
all over New South Wales, from older Universities that are overcrowded,<br />
and if it is to do that, then there must be, of course,<br />
residential accommodation. I have from first to) last been tremendously<br />
keen on that, that we should have, not only the Arts<br />
building and the Science block and the other academic buildings,<br />
as I'll describc them, but that we should also step out to provide<br />
accommodation for the student body.<br />
And at best I would just like to make one remark which<br />
I hope will prove provocative. Just as it would be a calamity<br />
for any University, whether it's one or two, in this City to regard<br />
itself as catering only for an official Capital, so I believe<br />
it would be a very great calamity if all residential accomamodation,<br />
if all Colleges of residents, should be regarded<br />
as Government Institutions, which might just as easily be referred<br />
to as Hostels, as by any other name. This is not just<br />
a matter for Government. Just as in the Universities, the older<br />
Universities, you have splendid residential Colleges which<br />
have been established by the Churches in Australia, which provide<br />
the foundations for residential studies, which Church<br />
foundations can do so well provided they have, as indeed they<br />
have., an instinct for scholarship and quality and character so<br />
I an hoping that, as times goes on, we will find the great 6hurches<br />
of Australia willing to recognise the inevitable future of<br />
education in Canberra and to take their part in establishing<br />
residential Colleg es on the lines of these with which we are<br />
familiar in the other Universities.<br />
So I think all those remarks may be made, getting wetter<br />
and wetter as tine goes on, irrespective of what decision<br />
may be made on the structural future.<br />
All I want to say is that nobody, least of all myself<br />
regards the position of this College as being static; it has<br />
developed; it must grow; it must more and mere provide for<br />
the student body, primarily, in the first instance the undergraduate<br />
student body, opportunity for the higher learning. It<br />
is indeed one of the unforeseen results, I think, of the increase<br />
of our population and of the stirring of minds in the<br />
course of the ' lar, that the population of Universities, the<br />
number of people willing and anxious and competent to receive<br />
University instruction has grown so enormously.<br />
I can remember the tine when, believe it or not, I<br />
was President of the Students' Representative Council at the<br />
University of Melbourne and the total student population was<br />
fourteen hundred Perhaps that explains how I was elected<br />
( laughter) but that was the total constituency, fourteen hundred,<br />
and now where we used to talk in hundreds, we talk in<br />
thousands. ihl the developments even since the Murray Report<br />
have shown that the growth of student numbers, or desired<br />
student numbers is far g roater already than even that highly<br />
competent coni~ tee imagined would be the case.<br />
And therefore we are not here, taking part in some-</p>
<p>0<br />
0 0 </p>
<p>3.<br />
thing that is small and is, perhaps, expected to remain smail,<br />
we are, I believe, taking part today in a ceremony which will<br />
be regarded as quite historic in the developrment of Canberra,<br />
the first of a number of steps to be taken which will bring<br />
distinction to this place, which will provide proper facilities<br />
for instruction and association, for conversation as well as<br />
for study, for playing as well as for work, and therefore, Sir,<br />
I have the greatest pleasure in the world in taking part in<br />
this proceeding I must say that I was relieved when I heard<br />
my friend George Peyton say a few kind words about my activities<br />
in relation to Universities, because only this morning,<br />
in an eminent Melbourne newspaper I read that some man, occupying<br />
some official position, and therefore qualified to talk,<br />
said that it was high time that the Prime Minister woke up to<br />
the fact that there was a University problem in Australia and<br />
so George I will use your testimonial i~ f I commit the unpardonable<br />
error of making a reply.<br />
I have the greatest pleasure in being here, Ladies<br />
and. Gentlemen and I deeply sympathise with you for having had<br />
to become , retter and wetter as the minutes have gone by. I<br />
will now step across is that right? and perform that mysterious<br />
act known as " Setting the Fonair ~ sir Ãµ yccfrom<br />
all my past experience that if it is leo. to mie to set it<br />
prope3rly, it will never be set at all. </p>
