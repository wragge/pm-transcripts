Jjj AU ~ ALIA( Press Statement<br />
24 April 1975<br />
STATEMENT BY THlE PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA, THE HON.<br />
E. G. WHITLAM, ON ARRIVAL IN LIMA, PERU<br />
I am delighted to be in Peru and the historic<br />
capital of Lima. This is the first visit to Peru by<br />
an Australian Prime Minister indeed to any South<br />
American country but it is not the first by a minister<br />
of the Australian Labor Government. The Minister for<br />
Foreign Affairs, Senator Willesee, visited Peru in 1974<br />
during a tour which took him also to Mexico, Venezuela,<br />
Argentina and Brazil. my visit will therefore build, at<br />
the highest level, a firm and established friendship<br />
between our countries, and develop the diplomatic and<br />
economic links which exist between us.<br />
I believe there is scope for both our countries<br />
to work together more closely and to seek a deeper<br />
understanding of each other's views. Australia and Peru<br />
were members of the United Nations Security Council for 1973<br />
and 1974; there are opportunities for further co-operation<br />
in the United Nations. We. share many interests and<br />
attributes in common. We are both medium powers;<br />
we are both Pacific powers; we were both once colonies<br />
of European powers; we are both rich in resources and<br />
dependent for our economic well being on the export and<br />
development of those resources. Above all, we both<br />
believe there is a role for the medium powers in<br />
shaping a world order based on peace and social justice.<br />
I look forward keenly to my stay in this<br />
important and respected country and to my talks with<br />
President Velasco, Prime Minister Bermudez and other<br />
ministers. With my Special Minister of State, Mr Bowen,<br />
and my officials, I hope to discuss our bilateral commercial<br />
relations, scientific and cultural co-operation, arms<br />
control, resources and the law of the sea and to exchange<br />
views on world problems in our different regions.<br />
Australians admire the efforts of the Peruvian people to<br />
develop their nation and preserve its economic independence<br />
in the same sturdy spirit with which they asserted* their<br />
political independence a century and a half ago.<br />
I hope my visit will help us both move closer* to our<br />
common goals of national progress and international<br />
co-operation.<br />
