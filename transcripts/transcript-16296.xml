    <content><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Queensland Premier Anna Bligh today announced they will begin the search for Australian Hospital Ship Centaur.</p>
<p>They have agreed to a $4 million cap for the search.</p>
<p>The Centaur was sunk without warning by a torpedo from a Japanese submarine on 14 May 1943 about 50 miles east north-east of Brisbane. Of the 332 persons on board, only 64 survived. It is understood three Centaur survivors are still alive.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said he hoped the search might provide closure for those survivors and the families of those who perished in the tragedy.</p>
<p>âI think it is proper that we should make this attempt, not only to provide closure to the families of the victims and the survivors, but to honour the victims themselves,â Mr Rudd said.</p>
<p>âWe know that this search will be very challenging because of the nature of the ocean floor in the area where the ship was lost.</p>
<p>âIf we are successful it would mean that we could go about protecting this very significant site - the final resting place of 268 Australians.â</p>
<p>Ms Bligh thanked the Prime Minister for responding to her request to jointly undertake the search.</p>
<p>âIf we can find the Centaur, it will be of considerable emotional significance for many of the relatives of those lost on her.</p>
<p>âThis site is part of our State and nation's history and we should try and find, preserve and protect it.</p>
<p>âFor them and their families it is right that we try to find and mark its exact location.</p>
<p>âThe 268 Aussies and their lost ship are reminders of what we as families, a State and a nation have lost in war. It is right that in our remembering them we can say exactly where they lie,â she said.</p>
<p>A Joint Steering Committee will be established and will call for tenders in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The Premier wrote to the Prime Minister on the 14th of May 2008  -  the 65th anniversary of Centaur's sinking.</p>
