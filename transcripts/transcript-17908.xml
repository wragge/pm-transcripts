Prime Minister Julia Gillard today opened a new medical teaching and education centre in Darwin that will for the first time enable students to undertake an entire four-year medical degree in the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>The centre at Charles Darwin University will play a crucial role in providing training support for medical students during their first two years under the new Flinders University Northern Territory Medical Program.</p>
<p>This program is helping to train more Indigenous doctors to work in Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>This will help address the severe medical workforce shortages and retention issues in the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>Up to 24 students began the course this year, with enrolments increasing to 40 per year in the future.</p>
<p>Improving the health workforce is a vital part of the Gillard Labor Government's national health reforms.</p>
<p>These reforms ensure doctors, nurses and allied health professionals are trained and equipped to work in areas where they are most needed.</p>
<p>The Government is making it easier for people to see a doctor when they need one and is training an extra 6,000 extra doctors over ten years.</p>
<p>We know that positive training experiences often influence where doctors choose to practice. That is why giving trainee doctors positive experiences in the Territory is so important.</p>
<p>Flinders and Charles Darwin Universities and the Australian and Northern Territory Governments have worked together on developing the Northern Territory Medical Program.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government is providing capital funding of $27.8 million over three years for the Flinders University NT Medical Program, $14 million of which will fund the new teaching and education centre.</p>
<p>An additional $6.6 million is being provided over four years from 2010-11 towards running costs.</p>
<p>Only 1.6 per cent of the national health workforce is made up of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</p>
<p>As at December last year, there were 153 Indigenous doctors working in Australia - up from 90 in 2001.</p>
<p>The new teaching and education centre will help train more Indigenous medical students in the Territory and encourage a significant number to stay and practise there when they finish their degree.</p>
<p>This will contribute to closing the health gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. </p>
