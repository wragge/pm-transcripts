PRIME INISTE 94/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
RELEASE OF THE APEC EMINENT PERSONS GROUP REPORT:<br />
" IMPLEMENTING THE APEC VISION"<br />
I warmly welcome the third report of the APEC Eminent Persons Group,<br />
" Implementing the APEC Vision", which was presented to Prime Minister<br />
Murayaxna, the 1995 chair of APEC, in Tokyo today.<br />
The APEC Eminent Persons Group was first established in 1992 to develop an<br />
independent vision for APEC to the year 2000. It contains distinguished<br />
representatives from all APEC member econormies, participating in their own<br />
capacities, under the chairmanship of Dr Fred Bergsten of the United States.<br />
Australia's representative on the Group is the Hon Neville Wran. I would<br />
particularly like to thank him for the significant contribution he has made to this<br />
latest report and over the past three years to the work of the Eminent Persons<br />
Group. Last year at their Bogor meeting APEC leaders took the historic decision to<br />
achieve the goal of free and open trade and investmnent in the region by 2010 for<br />
industrialised countries and 2020 for developing countries. The Eminent Persons<br />
Group's 1994 report, " Achieving the APEG Vision: Free and Open Trade in the<br />
Asia-Pacific", was instrumental in putting before leaders the importance of such a<br />
goal. In this latest report the EPG has focussed on fleshing out its ideas on issues<br />
it regards as central to the achievement of the Bogor commitments.<br />
I particularly agree with the report's central proposal that it is essential for<br />
APEC to move promptly, decisively and credibly to implement the visions of<br />
Blake Island and Bogor.<br />
The EPG report contains a number of valuable ideas we would strongly support.<br />
It urges that liberalisation within APEC be undertaken on a comprehensive basis<br />
with agreed timetables and principles. It recommends that APEC take as<br />
forthcoming an approach as possible to implementing our Bogor decision to<br />
accelerate, deepen and broaden our Uruguay Round commitments and it proposes<br />
a way forward for APEC in areas such as dispute mediation, investment and </p>
<p>standards. It has proposed that APEC should deepen its cooperation on monetary<br />
and macroeconomic issues and it has made suggestions for deepening<br />
developiient and technical cooperation in APEC, as an integral part of<br />
community building in the Asia Pacific region.<br />
The report will be a significant source of ideas on which leaders can draw in<br />
Osaka to take forward the APEC vision for trade and investment liberalisation<br />
within the region.<br />
