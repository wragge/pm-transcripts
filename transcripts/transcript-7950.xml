PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AT THE INDUCTION CEREMONY FOR HMAS WESTRALIA<br />
AT H14AS STIRLING 12 MARCH 1990<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Today marks an important step forward in the development of<br />
Australia's defence self-reliance. And not just because H-MAS<br />
Westralia is about to expand the capacities of our Western<br />
fleet, important and welcome as that is.<br />
I can announce today that Australia has proposed to the United<br />
States that the Australian Defence Force take over and operate<br />
the North West Cape Naval Communications Station.<br />
My Government put this proposal to the United States last<br />
month, and last week the US Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney,<br />
wrote back to Kim Beazley welcoming it and agreeing to the<br />
opening of negotiations. These will begin soon.<br />
This development is a landmark in building Australia's selfreliance<br />
and a measure of the maturity of our relationship<br />
with the United States.<br />
North West Cape has functioned as a joint facility since 1963.<br />
its primary purpose is to communicate with submerged<br />
submarines. The Station is becoming more and more important to Australia's<br />
own defence forces. It provides the only means of<br />
communicating with our submerged submarines, and we use that<br />
capability extensively.<br />
Under current arrangements, one of the Station's submarine<br />
communications channels is continuously used by the RAN.<br />
North West Cape will become even more important to Australia<br />
over the next ten years, as our new submarines join the RAN.<br />
They will make the submarine squadron an even more crucial<br />
element of Australia's defence and Australia's defence selfreliance.<br />
For Australia, North West Cape remains absolutely vital. T1<br />

<p>The operation of North West Cape as an Australian defence<br />
facility will therefore further enhance our drive for selfreliance.<br />
It shows that Australia is itself willing to take<br />
the responsibility for ensuring that this essential element of<br />
our submarine capability is maintained.<br />
Australia's proposal has been made at a time when the United<br />
States is re-examining its strategic role and<br />
responsibilities. The Australian Government strongly supports a continued United<br />
States involvement in the Asia/ Pacific region and I know<br />
that President Bush's Administration is fully committed to<br />
maintaining that involvement.<br />
We recognise that over the coming years it will be harder for<br />
the United States to sustain the huge commitment it has borne<br />
in the Pacific for so long.<br />
The United States has developed new ways of communicating with<br />
its submarines, and they are deploying fewer submarines in our<br />
region. North West Cape remains important to the United<br />
States but not as vital as it used to be.<br />
Under our proposal, Australia would manage the Station and<br />
facilitate the passing of United States signals through it to<br />
US Navy submarines.<br />
So, as well as enhancing Australia's self-reliance, our<br />
proposal makes a new and constructive contribution to<br />
modernising the alliance in changing times, and to supporting<br />
our shared interests in the stability of the Asia/ Pacific<br />
region. A few years ago a significant number of Australians resented<br />
and opposed the presence in Australia of what were widely<br />
misunderstood to be ' US bases" including at North West Cape.<br />
Now, as a result of the deliberate policies of my Government,<br />
such misconceptions are rare.<br />
We have made it clear to the Australian people that these<br />
facilities are indeed jointly managed and we have also<br />
increased the degree of Australian management in them.<br />
At the same time, we have demonstrated that these facilities<br />
perform tasks that are of critical importance and value to<br />
Australia's own needs, both in enhancing our own security and<br />
in promoting the great global goals of disarmament and arms<br />
control verification goals which my Government has actively<br />
sought to advance in our broader bilateral and multilateral<br />
policies. So, as we signal this landmark change in Australia's<br />
responsibilities in relation to North West Cape, I take pride<br />
that it has been my Government that has achieved this<br />
transformation in public opinion, and I believe all<br />
Australians can take pride that our defence self-reliance is<br />
being so effectively advanced. </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
HMAS Westralia, based here in Western Australia, will give the<br />
ships of our western fleet the ability to undertake extended<br />
operations throughout our region and make an important<br />
contribution to our defence self-reliance.<br />
Self-reliance demands that our defence forces can protect<br />
Australia on their own which means defending all of Australia.<br />
That is why we are building a two-ocean navy.<br />
Under the Government's defence strategy, Australia's maritime<br />
forces will play an increasing role in our defence in the<br />
years ahead. We are finding that as we re-shape our force<br />
structure to meet the unique demands of our strategic<br />
environment, maritime forces are becoming more important.<br />
We have responded to this by building new frigates,<br />
submarines, minehunters and survey ships, and, of course, by<br />
buying the Westralia.<br />
in the air, we are developing the maritime strike capabilities<br />
of our airforce by fitting our aircraft with modern guided<br />
weapons, building strategically-located airfields, and<br />
developing air-to-air refuelling.<br />
And we are building the Jindalee radar system to give us<br />
unparalleled surveillance of our maritime approaches.<br />
our over-riding priority in developing our defence forces is<br />
the direct defence of Australia. Our commitment to this<br />
priority was confirmed by the unique and highly successful<br />
Kangaroo 89 exercise across northern Australia last August.<br />
We also value the capacity which modern maritime forces based<br />
here in Western Australia give us to contribute to security in<br />
our wider region.<br />
And that itself is part of a wider policy, to which we are<br />
deeply committed, of comprehensive engagement with Asia and<br />
the Pacific. It includes our concern with and involvement in<br />
the political issues of the region, as demonstrated by the<br />
Government's efforts to contribute to a solution of the<br />
Cambodian tragedy. It includes our determination that<br />
Australia must be enmeshed with the economic dynamism of Asia<br />
and the Pacific, a goal which we have pursued through our<br />
initiative to establish a new mechanism for economic<br />
cooperation linking regional countries.<br />
HMAS Westralia will play a significant role in our defence<br />
and, in that way, in our larger goal of regional stability. I<br />
am delighted to be here for her naming by Mrs Gration and to<br />
see her take her place in the Royal Australian Navy. </p>
