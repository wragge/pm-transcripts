FOR PRESS 30 APRIL 1978<br />
ST. PATRICK'S SCHOOL, PORT FAIRY<br />
This is a very special day for the people of Port Fairy.<br />
I'm delighted to be with you at this wonderful school.<br />
It's a school with a long and colourful history as you<br />
know the original school was built over 130 years ago.<br />
That " school" was one classroom for eight grades, and two<br />
teachers. Today, with its 180 students and seven full-time teachers,<br />
and with these extensions, St. Patricks reminds us of what<br />
can be achieved by work in a local community.<br />
Much progress has been made since my last visit in 1973. I<br />
know that is in no small measure due to the untiring efforts<br />
of Sister Rosalie and Father Kiniry in particular.<br />
of course, this wonderful project would not have been completed<br />
without the wholehearted efforts of a great number of men,<br />
women and children of this parish. You have made a magnificent<br />
contribution and deserve the highest praise. Your work reminds<br />
us of the real role that communities are playing in projects<br />
such as this throughout Australia.<br />
It is surely a classic illustration of one of the great strengths<br />
of Australian society and that is the willingness of people to<br />
work together for the wider benefit of the community.<br />
The people who " put in" to make this day happen, certainly lived<br />
by the unwritten law that says: " It's not what you get out of<br />
life, but what you can put into it"..<br />
Although the Government in Canberra has contributed a significant<br />
grant to this project, I would not be here today to open these<br />
extensions if it had not been for your work.<br />
The Government that I lead has long supported the concept of<br />
freedom of choice in education and diversity in the range and<br />
type of educational institution. We recognize and actively<br />
encourage the right of parents to -choose the kind of education<br />
they believe best for their children whether in state or<br />
independent schools. We therefore have a commitment to support<br />
non-government schools. / 2 </p>
<p>It is well worth remembering that these schools educate<br />
about 20% of our total school population over 600,000-students<br />
which, if they were enrolled in the state school system would<br />
place an enormous strain on that system and its resources.<br />
Of course, in providing an alternative system, non-government<br />
schools add a further dimension and diversity to Australian<br />
education and certainly enrich educational experiences.<br />
Their contribution on issues of concern and innovations in<br />
education in this country have been important in the past and<br />
I-am sure they will continue,<br />
As far back as 1963, the Liberal Country Party Government<br />
commenced assistance to non-government schools for limited<br />
capital purposes. That assistance was widened in 1970 by<br />
the Coalition Government which initiated the principle of<br />
providing direct per capita grants and extending assistance to<br />
primary as well as secondary schools.<br />
Consistent with our desire to help non-government schools we<br />
introduced the concept of providing a minimum of 20% of average<br />
running costs per pupil in government schools for recurrent<br />
grants. Further progress has been made'towards reaching that<br />
target in 1978.<br />
These days we are constantly reminded of rising costs and this<br />
applies particularly to education expenditure. The Government<br />
has been concerned about this question of costs in education.<br />
We have therefore decided to launch a study with the states into<br />
building costs in both Government and non-Government schools<br />
throughout Australia.<br />
This study will specifically identify the differences in costs<br />
between states. We want to achieve greater efficiency and<br />
economy based on a more detailed knowledge of building options<br />
and their relative costs.<br />
The study will identify reasons for difference in cost and give<br />
publicity to them. I am hopeful the results will be available<br />
later this year.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a great day for St. Patricks<br />
and a great day for this community.<br />
Governments State and Federal have played an important part<br />
in making this day possible. But let me again emphasise that this<br />
day belongs to the people of Port Fairy and this parish.<br />
The spirit, the initiative, and the willingness to co-operate<br />
that is in evidence here is fair testament to the strength of<br />
community pride in this small corner of Victoria.<br />
It's fair demonstration of the confidence you all have in the<br />
future of this district. As your local member in Canberra, and<br />
as Prime Minister, I'm delighted to be here today. This school<br />
and this communit1-y will continue to grow and prosper. The<br />
quality of the people here will make certain of that. It gives<br />
me great pleasure to formally open the extensions of St. Patricks.<br />
