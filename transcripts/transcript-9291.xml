PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
NEW SOUTH WALES ALP DINNER, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, SYDNEY,<br />
WEDNESDAY, 27 JULY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Bob ( Carr), Terry ( Sheahan), John Della Bosca, Neville and Jill ( Wran),<br />
Lionel and Clare ( Bowen), my parliamentary colleagues, Mr Speaker and<br />
distinguished ladies and gentleman.<br />
Well, it is a bumper audience. It's the largest I've seen in this room, and I've<br />
been to many of these over the years, and I thank you very sincerely for the<br />
tribute you pay us in coming. I thank Bob also for his very generous words<br />
towards me and for the thought, the good thought, that the things we have to<br />
do are to do things together and to get things done because as we all know in<br />
public life, and in business, the system runs itself. What matters are the<br />
changes. And the changes are promoted in the public sphere by Ministers<br />
and, in the case of leaders, by Prime Minister's and Premiers, by<br />
Governments, and that whole co-operative notion that Bob has just raised is<br />
of course, central to that.<br />
Now, I want to see Bob Carr as the Premier of NSW. It's not particularly<br />
because I don't get on with John Fahey, it's just that he won't do anything.<br />
Now, the thing is, this is not a partisan remark, you go to Queensland all<br />
sorts of things happen. You go to Victoria, you can get things to happen, but<br />
you can't get them to happen in NSW. Because, this is the state where major<br />
when is the last time you ever heard of a major project starting in NSW?<br />
this is the state where they crimp them off. This is the state where there's a<br />
scandal a week. There's someone falls out of the ministry every second<br />
week, and out of the Parliamentary liberal party every off week. And that's<br />
how it goes along. But above all else, the public interest doesn't get a go<br />
because the place isn't going ahead. And here we are, with the most<br />
conducive circumstances and it's not happening. </p>
<p>But Bob touched on a theme when he started to speak, saying we've always<br />
had and I think we, the Labor party, or certainly, certainly since the period<br />
when Neville was Premier, beginning with his governments a great<br />
relationship with business in NSW, particularly in Sydney. And we think, I<br />
know it's unfashionable, that we've got to earn our freight. And we try and be<br />
relevant, and we like you to be relevant too. And we see a relationship<br />
between us. But Jeffrey Kennett is down there hopping into the business<br />
community in Victoria today, I don't know if you read that, those little bon mots<br />
there saying, you see if you're not part of the Ron Walker squad, well you're<br />
not in it. If you can't join o1' Potato-face Ron and his crew, you're not in the<br />
game. And if you don't line up the way they like, well then you get a serve<br />
from Jeffrey.<br />
And then of course, you had Mr Downer a couple of weeks ago, saying to a<br />
question from some journalist naive it must have been saying: " well, Mr<br />
Downer, what have you got to say about what the Christian churches had to<br />
say about you today?", and he said:, " Oh well, the key point here is the<br />
Christian Church are in my good book at the moment." You see, you've got to<br />
have a lot of front to say a thing like that.<br />
But it comes from, you know, those days when he was in Stoke Lodge in<br />
London for so many years, going down to see the British Conservative Party<br />
in the House of Lords. And of course, there, all the Church elders sit in the<br />
front pews. And it's a case of who's running who. It's a case of whether the<br />
State sort of runs the Church, or the Church this is the sort of game he's in.<br />
Now, that's his view of life, of course this is right at the time, dare I say, that<br />
Prince Charles is saying well I don't think there should be just one official<br />
church in Britain, but Alexander Downer says well, the Christian Church is in<br />
my good book at the moment. Giving them a hint that, you know, all those<br />
Bishops out there, they better stay there. Meanwhile, in the great southern<br />
state, the business community has got to line up with Ron's little team<br />
otherwise Jeffrey will not approve of them and he'll admonish them as the<br />
case may be. Now, the Labor Party I mean, poor silly us we're out there<br />
saying look, can we do some more for you? 5per cent GOP growth, 3.5 per<br />
cent employment growth, under 2 per cent inflation, we're still working at it,<br />
stock market back to 1987 levels. The profit share in the economy, with no<br />
historic precedent, spreading enterprise bargaining through the workforce,<br />
creating structures in the Asia-Pacific for trade, but somehow there's a game<br />
we're not on to, you know.<br />
I mean I thought today, sort of said something about it. You know, here was<br />
the news from the conservatives that the Citizen Initiated Referendum was<br />
now off the agenda, that the potpourri of constitutional changes was to be<br />
scrapped. Now this was Mr Downer's sole policy since becoming the<br />
Opposition Leader. The Citizen's Initiated Referendum, the support for 4<br />
year terms after Mr Reitli, by the way, was promoting these, was the<br />
principle opponent of the 4 year term measures to prevent the<br />
Commonwealth signing international treaties. Now this is the potpourri of<br />
reforms. I mean, some reform. You see, clip the Commonwealth's wings so </p>
<p>the Commonwealth can't sign international treaties, and put a time limit on<br />
double dissolution bills. Well, that's really going to change the way we live.<br />
Now, and I thought, well here I was this morning at the launch of the<br />
wonderful history of the Australian Olympic movement written by Harry<br />
Gordon it was a very nice event and here were these journo's rustling<br />
around for a comment about the Citizens Initiated Referendum, and of course<br />
overnight we had Tim Fischer saying it was a law-making cancer, and then<br />
Alexander Downer stepping back from it, giving the journo's the hint that<br />
during the day that he would walk away from it. And they're all asking, you<br />
know, is the Prime Minister going to give us a comment? And of course, silly<br />
me, I'm interested in the inflation rate. You know, I'm such a dag, I'm actually<br />
interested in the inflation rate. And there it came out at under 2 per cent.<br />
Decelerating the trend inflation down from 2.1 to 1.9 per cent in the face of<br />
the fastest growth in the Western world. With all the attendant influences for<br />
inflation for interest rates and for everything else. And I thought, I normally<br />
give you know one hopes you know a studied.. . well the underlying rates<br />
are down to such and such and such and such, meanwhile back at the<br />
coalition ranch, they're hopping out of these Citizens Initiated Referenda<br />
and you've got to say, what's going on in the public debate in Australia,<br />
really? What is going on in this country? I mean, what about a bit of rejoicing<br />
in the fact we got 5 per cent growth? And Western Europe has got about<br />
per cent. What about a little bit of rejoicing in the fact that our workforce has<br />
seen the value of wage restraint for employment and we are sitting today with<br />
further confirmation that inflation is decelerating and we've broken the back of<br />
a 20 year scourge with double digit inflation, and comprehensively broken it,<br />
and watching this year, 3.5 per cent employment growth. I saw buried on<br />
page 2 of the Australian and the only paper that reported it last week from the<br />
IMF: Australia and Canada leading the world in employment growth 3.5 per<br />
cent OECD leading us. Not page one, not splashed over the front page of<br />
the Herald, down on page two. But at least Tthe Australian reported it. On<br />
the back page of the Economist, where they have the OECD, the 27 member<br />
states of the OECD economies, each month, this month what's the little<br />
banner flash across it? ' Australia . dot. dot. dot... still ahead of the pack.'<br />
Still ahead of the pack. Well God you wouldn't know it here. You wouldn't<br />
know it. But people in business know it, and people in the community know it<br />
because we are coming back very strongly and we are doing it in a way that<br />
is going to be great for Australia, with low inflation.<br />
People say to me, I had someone ( journalist) ask me today, you know, " The<br />
polls say you are arrogant, what have you got to say about that?" I said,<br />
' Well, if people knew me as much as you do, they would like me much more<br />
than they do now, and when you get to know him, you sort of can't help but<br />
like him" that sort of thing. And they said, " oh yeah, ok, well that's the<br />
answer to that one, what about the next one? And, it went on like this. They<br />
got down to saying, " well look, you know, Mr Downer is ahead of you." I said,<br />
" yeah well that's very strange isn't it, because this guy is a policy free-area.<br />
He hasn't got any policies." I said, " let me just tell you something here, it was<br />
only six months ago that Bronwyn Bishop was ahead of me". And she was, </p>
<p>she was. She was preferred Prime Minister. So you see, you cannot react to<br />
this stuff, you've got to let it wash over you a bit, but I think it is worth, you<br />
know, worth actually saying.<br />
You really wonder what has happened to public comment in Australia, where<br />
it used to be the case the news was where the weight was. An editor wrote<br />
his stories where the weight of the news was and people would give you the<br />
story and let you read it. And you would make your own mind up about it.<br />
But now, it's never the weight, its the angle. You know, its the poll, its<br />
someone new, its not the weight. And the reason why the weight is the<br />
weight is because it affects everybody. And so the Government has been<br />
concentrating on weight while the coalition and other people are into floss<br />
and nonsense and I think the weight matters but you feel like getting out on a<br />
loud haler because its almost a dark secret about the things that really<br />
matter. Now, I just want to say a couple of things about the Government in this term<br />
of office because, I think, it is worth saying. In the last election campaign,<br />
John Hewson said we would have a double-dip recession and a depression.<br />
He said we had all the workers in the gun sights. Remember the gun-sight<br />
ad?. In fact, we are growing faster than any western economy and we have<br />
had 3.5 per cent employment. growth. The Government focused on that<br />
recovery. The One ' Nation spending is now running strongly. We are<br />
spending $ 1 million a day on the rail system right this minute. From<br />
Brisbane to Melbourne and a standard gauge across to Adelaide, all that<br />
spending is going on. We pulled the right policy lever with One Nation, when<br />
private spending was down, we put public spending up and we pulled<br />
Australia out of the recession faster than any other Western country. We've<br />
now got it up and running and we are still yet to have, in full measure, the<br />
investment phase come through and I'm pretty sure its going to come through<br />
strongly. So it is going to go on. We've had first public demand, then public<br />
demand in housing, then consumer spending and housing, and now,<br />
investment: a rolling recovery. So we concentrated on that recovery. And<br />
it's coming through. And you can imagine the claims, had the coalition won<br />
the election. It would have been all their doing. They would have said " oh<br />
remember the Government the former Government members were down<br />
there, has us in a recession all this growth is because we're in office. The<br />
growth is here because of the policies of the Federal Government the<br />
Federal Labour Government and the success is there because of the<br />
commitment which the Australian people have given to the recovery. And I<br />
think Australians deserve the chance to rejoice in their own work and we<br />
should acknowledge the fact that the place is coming up very strongly.<br />
Now a number of things have occupied us since the election, since March<br />
1993. Let me just run through them quickly: there was Mabo, APEC, Hilmer,<br />
the White PapeRr Working Nation the Accord and the new jobs<br />
arraii-emrents and the-Republic. Let me just say a couple things about each<br />
one. Let me say something -about Mabo. Now, for a lot of people, Mabo is an<br />
extraneous matter, it doesn't affect them immediately, they live in the cities, </p>
<p>it's not a matter which comes their way. But ask yourself this. How many<br />
Governments and how many countries could cope with the fact that its most<br />
supreme of Courts said that native tradition and custom is a source of<br />
national common law and that there's a native title in the common law? What<br />
do you do with a decision like that? That means that every title in this country<br />
issued, and certainly since the Racial Discrimination Act of 1975 was<br />
introduced, was under question. And in mining, that's most of it. That's the<br />
great mining tracks of Queensland and Western Australia and New South<br />
Wales and South Australia and there's big pastoral areas and it could be<br />
resolved by one court case after another, one claim after another, which<br />
would take 20 or 30 years, but how would we go for certainty of title? How do<br />
you resolve all of the legal uncertainties? What happens when a bank says<br />
"$ we are no longer supporting your facilities, because you can't guarantee us<br />
title?". That is what it meant. But the opportunity of Mabo was to make right<br />
a wrong. To overturn the fiction and the untruth of terra nullius and to repair<br />
something which should have been repaired in our history long ago. And that<br />
was to say to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians we will be the<br />
stronger, and this place will be the fairer when we are all as one and we<br />
share in this country equally. That was the promise of Mabo and the<br />
Government took it up. And the other thing is, we were not going to leave the<br />
High Court out to dry. Now, you often hear these Tories tell you, we believe<br />
old law and order, they get law and order out every half a dozen years.<br />
They're always in favour of the law and the rule of law but remember the catcalling<br />
and the attacks upon the Court from those who formally were great<br />
supporters of this institution until it happened to say something that they<br />
didn't like. And we had the Justices make what I think was a courageous<br />
decision; not one that could work in terms of an administrative solution, but as<br />
a point of principle, a courageous decision and it was for the Government to<br />
take the opportunity and to preserve the Court's prestige and encourage them<br />
to make such decisions.<br />
And so from a clean sheet of paper, we put together one of the largest pieces<br />
of property and cultural law of its kind in the world with lovely straight lines of<br />
logic after long consultation with Aboriginal people and as a consequence,<br />
we brought certainty to all those titles; we have given the opportunity for<br />
those with the traditional association with the land to claim it, we got a chance<br />
to hold our head up and say that we are no longer going on with the lie that<br />
there were no people here at the time of European settlement. Beyond that,<br />
of course is the land fund which extends the rights to land for those who can't<br />
avail themselves of Mabo. In doing all that we did it in 13 months. It would<br />
have taken, I'm sure, the United States 10 or 12 years, or somewhere else.<br />
And there are a lot of lawyers in this room. Look at the property laws of New<br />
South Wales a great collection of tomes it's a most complex area of the<br />
law. But to start from a clean sheet of paper and say " how do we build this<br />
structure?" We've done it. And we did it with the consultation with the<br />
Aboriginal community who for the first time negotiated with the national<br />
Government as never before, and both Houses of Parliament passed it. And<br />
we will now see it coming into affect the tribunals are being established. </p>
<p>Now apart the inherent decency of it, when you go to Asia now, people say<br />
" that's very interesting because these European tribes never give anything<br />
away and maybe the Australians have turned over a new leaf. Maybe they<br />
really mean what they say. They want to be in it with us and we approve very<br />
much of the way they treat their indigenous." Now I think that is important to<br />
Australia. I think Mabo was important for what it meant, it was important to do<br />
for our self-esteem and for the simple justice of it and it was not just done, but<br />
it was done in a way that I am sure most Governments couldn't have<br />
contemplated. It was one of the things we have done in the last 15 months<br />
and a coalition Government wouldn't have done it. They opposed it tooth<br />
and by jowl all the way and John Hewson described it, as we brought the Bill<br />
from the Senate then back into the House of Representatives to support the<br />
last amendments, as " a day of shame".<br />
Now, that's the difference between weight and quality and no quality and<br />
nonsense and it is one of the things we have done. Let me move on.<br />
APEC. Neville is Australia's eminent person on the APEC Eminent Person's<br />
Gr7. Weaeseigt ul nAi-Pacific economic community. We<br />
are seeking, from our country, to interest others in a structure which turns<br />
what was a co-operative sort of mini OECD information sharing secretariat<br />
into an executive head of government body. Now, we worked this initiative<br />
up. I pedalled my way around the Pacific through most of 1992. Neville<br />
worked on the Eminent Person's Group. Our Foreign Affairs Department put<br />
their shoulder to the wheel and gradually we got people to support it. So<br />
much so, with some real confidence, I was able to say to President Clinton<br />
that I believe that it's possible to put together a head of governments' meeting<br />
for the Asia-Pacific, but we needed a catalyst for it to happen. That catalyst<br />
came when Bill Clinton extended the invitation for people to attend in Seattle<br />
last year.<br />
When those fifteen leaders sat down, half the world's production and over<br />
half the worlds population sat down there with them. And, for the first time in<br />
our long history, Australia was at a very big table. But, not only that, a table<br />
which it, in some substantial part, had put together itself. This Labor<br />
Government did that.<br />
I had Alexander Downer a couple of weeks ago saying ' I don't think we ought<br />
to be having foreign investment in the measure we're having it'. He caballed<br />
the fact we are investing abroad. Last week he was saying ' we belong to<br />
Oceania, we don't belong to Asia.' Now, if one wants to get technical and go<br />
back to the atlas, we are in the bottom end of the South-Pacific and we<br />
belong to Oceania or what used to be called Oceania. But, 75 per cent of<br />
our exports are in the_ Asia-Pacific. That's where the markets are growing 6 to<br />
8 per cent a year. So, wFitfprice the Liberals being able to conceive, much<br />
less put it together, when they are even disputing the fact we're in the region<br />
that APEC is all about. But, the Government has pursued it. Neville has just<br />
come back from an Eminent Persons' meeting and I've just met President<br />
Soeharto to talk further about the upcoming meeting which is in Indonesia in </p>
<p>November at Bogor and we have every prospect there of advancing the<br />
APEC agenda.<br />
And, when Australia is linked and linked well into the Asia-Pacific, when are<br />
exports are growing as they are now rapidly by these bilateral linkages, but<br />
as we multi -lateral ise, multi-lateral agreements within the Asia-Pacific area<br />
then we are really going to see Australia plugged in in a way it has never<br />
been plugged in before. Because, we are not part of natural growth areas or<br />
big markets like the European Community. We don't have contiguous<br />
borders with France or Spain or anywhere else, or North America. We are<br />
not part of NAFTA. We are an island continent. We've got to do it ourselves.<br />
We've got to be part of something if we can we must create or be a part of<br />
something someone else can create with us. But, if we get set in the Asiapacific,<br />
we are set for at least a century.<br />
Now, that's what this Government is about. It is about that sort of weight. Not<br />
citizens initiated referendums and mucking around over treaties or saying the<br />
Queen doesn't matter, she is irrelevant and quaint. It's not about that sort of<br />
babble. We are about things that matter.<br />
Then there is Hilmer. Hilmer is an attempt to the Hilmer Report on<br />
competition polity--is-an attempt to make the States' authorities as open to<br />
competitive pressures as the rest of us are. I mean, there are a lot of unions<br />
here tonight. They have been open to competitive pressures. They have had<br />
to find themselves a productive place in Australian enterprise. They have<br />
had to adjust the way in which they are organised. They have had to adjust<br />
their awards. They have had to amalgamate unions. They have had to<br />
restructure. They have had to accept productivity related wage adjustments.<br />
They have had to adjust. Business has had to adjust. But, the States are<br />
sitting taking hundreds of millions in monopoly rents, out of electricity, out of<br />
water, out of gas, out of ports, and sticking them into State budgets. And<br />
what the Commonwealth is saying is " well, hang on, we'ye now opened<br />
Australia up by knocking the tariff wall over, removing exchange control, we<br />
have got a free flow of funds, a free flow goods, we've got natural advantages<br />
in this country. We have got a coal seam right down the east coast of<br />
Australia. We've got quite a large supply of natural gas. We have got natural<br />
advantages, we can actually promote ourselves, give us a comparative<br />
advantage. God knows how hard it is to get a comparative advantage and we<br />
are trying to open this up". And we got the States to agree at the last COAG<br />
meeting the Council of Australian Governments to do that.<br />
But, I got a letter in the mail this morning from Jeffrey. He is on my mind<br />
today Jeffrey. Most of the time I like him, but I don't much today. But,<br />
anyway, he said we are not going to be in this reform unless the<br />
Commonwealth pays for it. Well, when we cut tariffs in the 1 980s, I don't<br />
remember the Americans giving us a cheque. When we did things that cost<br />
the Commonwealth budget, no one paid for us. So, they are saying well look,<br />
we'll introduce these reforms, but if you pay for it. Well, anyway, we are<br />
going to argue about that, but the important thing is the quality of the reform. </p>
<p>Get these competitive changes in the States authorities of this country and<br />
the Commonwealth authorities and we've already got the competitive<br />
disciplines in business and we are off and running. You know, you are flat<br />
out holding Australia back. It is another issue. We are going to debate it<br />
soon at COAG. It is another issue of enormous weight.<br />
And then there is, of course, the White Paper Working Nation. I said on<br />
election night that we wouldn't forgiet the long-term unemployed. People may<br />
say " well, that's the Labor Party, it is a party of compassion, it believes in<br />
these things, these people are part of its natural constituency." All that is<br />
true. But, what's also true is that we will make a tragic mistake as a country<br />
believing you can have an underclass. Believing that we can move on those<br />
of us who are well off, got a job, some incomes, some assets that we can go<br />
off and pick up the joy of a recovery, but the people who carried the shock or<br />
the absorption of a lot of the change are left as long term unemployed people.<br />
And, we are yet to see how societies live with underclasses. The United<br />
States is now trying to handle it. So is Britain and the British people have<br />
shown over the years they'll take a hell of a lot of pressure and a lot of social<br />
stress because they are a very strong and robust people.<br />
But, this is a new era, a really new era of two speed societies. What we<br />
decided in March 1993 at that election is that Australia would be one society.<br />
Now, it is all very easy and well to say " oh well, yes of course that is decent<br />
rhetoric, you expect the Prime Minister to say one society". But, while, we<br />
say one society, we mean one society. When the Liberals say one society,<br />
they don't mean it. They mean one society for those well off and the others,<br />
well, they can just take their place further down the queue. And, you have got<br />
to draw a line under it and you've got to say, well, should 350,000 people be<br />
long term unemployed? And at any rate, where is our labour market<br />
complementation, skills formation going to come in this recovery? It is not<br />
going to come from migration as in others. It is going to come from the labour<br />
market. We have to train, re-train those 350,000 people and get them back<br />
into work.<br />
In the next four years, we will spend $ 10.5 billion on labour market programs<br />
creating 650,000 places a year. Now, the unemployed I can't remember the<br />
exact number, it is around 900,000 odd 650,000 places will actually be<br />
created by the Commonwealth. We are going to be spending $ 10.5 billion<br />
over four years an enormous contribution but one which we've put with a<br />
declining trajectory of our deficit to go and do that. We will be personally<br />
case managing that is one to one one person talking to another person<br />
about their employment background, their educational attainment's, their<br />
skills, their aptitudes, one to one we are going to be case managing, next<br />
year, 560,000 people. This is an absolute revolution in social policy. This is<br />
the first country in the world which will have done this and as always, it will<br />
only be done by a Labor Government.<br />
And, it will mean, that we will get people back into work. We are also saying<br />
that we won't accept the fact that any young person under 18 slips out of the </p>
<p>9<br />
system. If they slip out we will personally case manage them back into the<br />
mainstream education system or into training or into work.<br />
The same with the training wage. In terms of apprenticeships and<br />
traineeships, there is going to be a huge expansion in apprenticeships and<br />
tranineeships and, of course, all of this comes on top of these massive<br />
participation rates in schools. Ten years ago the Liberals were happy<br />
enough to see four kids in ten complete secondary school. This year it is<br />
over eight in ten. Next year it will be nine in ten 40 per cent of them are<br />
now streamed through university and we are now building the TAFE system<br />
beside the universities to take the balance so that the whole of that group<br />
to 19 which we will regard now as a period of vocational preparation, will go<br />
on to become part of the clever country, the smarter society, the trained<br />
workforce and the ones that drop out the young people who drop out we<br />
will pick them back and put them back in. And, in secondary school, in Years<br />
11 and 12 for the students who know they are not going on to a tertiary<br />
education, we are going to start to give them accreditation for TAFE courses<br />
in Years 11 and 12, for units of TAFE in Years 11 and 12 and some work<br />
experience. So, their lives pattern starts in Years 11 and 12.<br />
I mean, these are the things that the White Paper means. It is not just a one<br />
day Parliamentary flash in the pan. It is a change to the way we live. It is a<br />
restatement of our values Labor values that say, one nation we will be, an<br />
inclusive society we must remain.<br />
Finally a couple of words about the republic. I'd turn no, we can't turn the<br />
pictures over, it would be rude. We will never fully appreciate or exercise the<br />
full limits of Australian sovereignty and Australian aspirations whileever our<br />
head of state is the monarch of another country.<br />
It stands to reason that the Australian head of state should be an Australian<br />
person. It is as simple as that. It is not some frumped up, phoney<br />
constitutional set of grab-bag potpourri like the citizens initiated referendum,<br />
or crimping the Commonwealth's right to sign an international treaty, or<br />
mucking around with the time a Bill can qualify for a double dissolution which<br />
is a little bit of political nit picking and messing around. It's the real thing. It's<br />
the real thing that matters to us. Now, here we are with all these great<br />
changes in this country and the whole country has been in them knocking<br />
down exchange controls, watching our investors go off shore. You know, 12<br />
or 11 years ago, we have 3 per cent of our GOP invested abroad. This year it<br />
is 20 per cent. This year it is $ 80 billion in"-esfed abroad $ 80,000 million of<br />
Australian funds are invested abroad. If it wasn't you could cut our debt by<br />
$ 80,000 million. But, are we better with the debt and investment abroad.<br />
Well, of course we are, because we are in those markets building organic<br />
positions. Now, we have seen those chances. We've seen the tariff wall come down.<br />
People are saying if you do that you will kill our manufacturing. What's<br />
happened? Manufacturing production has doubled. Manufacturing exports </p>
<p>have tripled in the time since. I mean, there was a time in that crazy debate<br />
with John Stone, you know, the great Treasury guru saying " well, we don't<br />
think you can have a competitive manufacturing sector beside an<br />
internationally competitive primary exports sector because wool, wheat and<br />
minerals will over value the exchange rate and that will produce cheaper<br />
imports, so you can't have a manufacturing sector." Well, you didn't have to<br />
be a political scientist or a graduate of the London School of Economics or<br />
somewhere to know that that was absolute balderdash. And, we've knocked<br />
the tariff wall over and what's happening? All the innovative companies are<br />
going for it look at the McKinsey Report. Hundreds born global. Didn't<br />
starve domestic industries at all, just straight out into exports.<br />
I was up there in Indonesia two weeks ago at a huge trade fair which had<br />
everything from St Vincent's Hospital and the Austin Hospital in Melbourne to<br />
the water authorities to the electricity authorities to the big product companies<br />
like BHP and Pacific-Dunlop to the smaller innovative companies and the<br />
telecommunications companies like AWA, represented here tonight, the<br />
retailers, and there is Australia out there, going out to the world to do all<br />
these things. And, we put these changes into place, but we can never really<br />
say " here we are.. ". here we are," borrowing the monarch of another country.<br />
So, here we are, we're not quite certain of ourselves, not quite sure, but look,<br />
we are getting our pecker up, we are getting our confidence up, but we are<br />
not quite confident enough to put an Australian in the job. So, for the moment<br />
we will keep on borrowing the Queen of Great Britain. But, when she goes<br />
abroad she promotes Britain and British goods. But, when the Governor-<br />
General goes abroad, and he went recently to some of the old Soviet States<br />
as you know, and they had to ring the British Embassy to find out whether<br />
they could receive him. Ding-a-ling, " Mr Ambassador, look the Australian<br />
Governor-General wants to come and see us, is it ok?"<br />
Now, this is the head of state that Alexander Downer wants us to have the<br />
deputy of a foreign monarch. And, of course, we can't have it. That<br />
nonsense has got to stop. So, the Government is saying this and we will, in<br />
this debate, at the appropriate time and some of that is going to be sooner<br />
rather than later, put down very clearly where we think the debate should go.<br />
So, you round the things up. Mabo, APEC, Hilmer, the White Paper, the<br />
spread of enterprise bargaining which is now we expect to see 80 per cent<br />
of federal awards by 1996, turning this rigid labour market into a flexible one,<br />
the republic, all of these things are the things of weight and of value. And the<br />
Liberals, there they are out with their Alexander Downer said, and let me<br />
just quote him here, he said ' Australians are entitled to reasonably detailed<br />
policies from both parties'. He said that eight weeks ago. This week he said<br />
' the forthcoming policy statement will be only very general in nature'. So, in<br />
other words they are going to hand us pap.<br />
And, of course, you know why with the Liberals, you see, in 1984 they had<br />
Andrew Peacock as the Leader. Now, Andrew went around pulling faces<br />
serious faces, happy faces, funny faces right throughout the 1984 election </p>
<p>and he lost it because he didn't stand for anything. And, the Liberals said<br />
ofoh, well, I suppose it's only one loss, but we ought to learn our lesson. Let's<br />
not get in the habit of having the Labor Government around, we'd better get<br />
someone with some policies." So, they said " we'll get John Howard." Now,<br />
John was a former Treasurer, he had a bit of a clue about the economy<br />
made a bit of a mess of it but still a clue about it. A few crude notions, a tax<br />
bribe he had in the so-called ' Boxhill tax package', out he went and we blew<br />
the tax package to pieces, his numbers fell away all over the place and he<br />
started articulating his policies, particularly some of his immigration policies<br />
and he lost. They said, " the problem is here you don't go fighting elections<br />
with policies. You don't fight elections with policies, you fight the Government<br />
who has got policies, you have notions and you attack the Government. You<br />
don't have policies." So they went back to Andrew Peacock. And, Andrew<br />
was out again a bit older, a bit smarter, but not much and in the 1990<br />
election, you know, flim-flam again stuff, no policies, you know, as sure as<br />
night follows day remember that one you know, as sure as night follows<br />
day. The went through that for three weeks and they lost again. So, it was<br />
really then back to the drawing board, all the hard heads the Petro Georgios<br />
and the all back to something. With, really, three elections on the trot lost,<br />
they can't have that, " look the problem really is we have got to have policy.<br />
Let's find a policy guide. Now, there is Hewson. There he is, a professor of<br />
economics, he went all right in the election campaign, we will get him." So,<br />
they give him the job. He is the Leader. Before he knows it he is shadow<br />
treasurer and next thing he is the Leader. And, then he starts and he thinks,<br />
" well, what I'll do, I'm really on a roll here so I'll really go for the big one<br />
Fightback, the consumption tax, I'll take a big slap of income form the low<br />
paid, kick it up the wealthy, we'll knock off Medicare, give the doctors a break,<br />
the lot, we'll really have dot pointed policies -T'is dotted and ' T's crossed." He<br />
had policies, but they were the wrong policies and, of course, he lost. So,<br />
they said, " you can't win with policies, you've got to go back" so they've got<br />
Alexander. That's what I said the other night. See, if you go Peacock to Howard soft,<br />
hard Peacock to Hewson soft, hard, soft. Soft, hard, soft, you get the<br />
pattern. Now the pattern is that Downer is the softie again and, of course,<br />
this is where the flim flam polices come from.<br />
Meanwhile, the Government, naively is back on the weight Mabo, APEC, the<br />
recovery, Hilmer, the White Paper, enterprise bargaining, the republic, but,<br />
he is going to give you feeling about his policies. Give you some little things<br />
and meanwhilePeter Reith will run off with some and if they don't go to well<br />
they'll get pulledbackiJ__ he republic, the monarchy, he was going to take the<br />
Government to the wall and, me in particular, on the monarchy and when I<br />
had an opportunity and I did in France, I was encouraged by Francois<br />
Mitterand, I mean, he can be a bad influence on people Francois sometimes<br />
about republics and I come out and said that I think Australia should be a<br />
republic, that we can't have the monarch of Great Britain and straight away<br />
Alexander one step back, two steps, two weeks later the Queen didn't matter,<br />
she was irrelevant and only quaint. </p>
<p>12<br />
The thing about Alexander Downer is he stands for nothing. Seriously, he<br />
stands for nothing. He is a policy flake and he'll go the way of policy flakes,<br />
and that is to the political graveyard. Now, there is some distance between<br />
now and then, but I've got a route mapped out for him.<br />
Now, they have had a tremendous go, and of course, they think that's what<br />
the game is. So, this thing about Alexander Downer is is he thinks he is<br />
currency. Well, he is, but he is pre-decimal. He is back there in the 1950s<br />
and so whenever they have a new idea the Liberals it is always back to<br />
some idea. It is never forward. They always believed in going back.<br />
So, there it is. This is going to be an interesting period for Australia because,<br />
I think, we are on the verge of a change of quality to our economy, to our<br />
society and inflation is, I think, a measure of that, of our social compassion, of<br />
our sense of inclusion, for the first time living near the biggest and fastest<br />
growing markets in the world, with linkages we've never had before, we've<br />
never been in a decade of this promise not ever.<br />
So, what I say to Australians is let's take up the challenge. Let's rejoice in the<br />
challenge. Let's take it up and let's go for it. And, let's get the weight back<br />
into the newspapers. Let's get the real issues back in the public debate and<br />
let there be some understanding about the merit of big policy outcomes and<br />
not see great national achievements, like today, again with inflation frittered<br />
away in the flim flam comments what passes for the public debate, covering<br />
an Opposition that have run out of ideas, with a leader who hasn't the<br />
courage or the wit to fabricate any.<br />
That's why the Labor Party is the great party of change in this country. It's<br />
already made huge change in the last decade and we'll go on to make more.<br />
And, in this State let me finish were I began in this State, as Bob Carr said,<br />
you'll never do better than a really conducive working relationship between<br />
the Prime Minister of Australia and the Government of the Commonwealth<br />
and the Premier of New South Wales and the Government of New South<br />
Wales. And, when Bob Carr is the Premier and a Labor Government is here,<br />
New South Wales will join the recovery which it's not doing to date and then<br />
when the bigger State kicks along, the whole of the country will kick along.<br />
And then, when you come again, we can report further progress. Thank you.<br />
ends </p>
