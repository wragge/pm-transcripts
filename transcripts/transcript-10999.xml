<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Joining me now from Canberra is the Australian Prime Minister, John</p>
<p> Howard. We'll find out more about the outlook for the economy</p>
<p> from his point of view. Now, Prime Minister Howard, very good numbers</p>
<p> coming out from Australia lately on the economy, do you think though</p>
<p> that with a global economy still on the slowdown Australia can keep</p>
<p> up the pace?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, so far we have done a lot better than many predicted and a lot</p>
<p> of us thought. We have had much stronger growth than many expected</p>
<p> and the outlook as we have come into 1999 remains very strong. You</p>
<p> ask me where we are going to be in six, nine or 12 months time. I</p>
<p> think we will still be performing very strongly. Just how strongly</p>
<p> I think it's impossible to say but all of the indicators are</p>
<p> very, very positive and we are very pleased that we are now getting</p>
<p> the benefits of a lot of reform measures the Government undertook.</p>
<p> We got our budget in order, we are now in surplus after inheriting</p>
<p> a deficit of $10.5 billion. We have got very low interest rates historically,</p>
<p> low inflation. We have undertaken, of course, a massive tax reform</p>
<p> programme and if we can get that through a hostile Upper House in</p>
<p> Australia and if the will of the people on that issue can be validated</p>
<p> by Parliament's action then I think that will underwrite and</p>
<p> even stronger economy years into the future.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>We'll take a closer look at those tax reforms in just a moment</p>
<p> Prime Minister Howard but let's go a little more specific into</p>
<p> your outlook for the economy, at least for this year. What are you</p>
<p> looking at in terms of growth?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the official forecast is for the coming....for 1999/2000</p>
<p> is two-and-three quarters and it's three-and-a-half (sic) for</p>
<p> the current year. We have recorded five per cent for the year to the</p>
<p> September quarter which is very much stronger than we expected. Now,</p>
<p> those outcomes can move around but all of the indications over the</p>
<p> last few months are very positive indeed.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>People though are saying that the consumption could slow down this</p>
<p> year, partly because of the whole tax picture. Do you think that's</p>
<p> going to happen?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, nobody can seriously argue that because of the tax changes consumption</p>
<p> will slow down this year because the major changes don't come</p>
<p> until the 1st of July in the year 2000. But the general</p>
<p> outlook for business investment, all the consumer confidence surveys,</p>
<p> inflation at 1.6 per cent, interest rates at 30 year lows. When you</p>
<p> add all of those together you have got a very buoyant picture but</p>
<p> we don't take anything for granted. We certainly have outperformed</p>
<p> most other countries but we don't take anything for granted.</p>
<p> We still need to keep on pressing forward with further reforms. One</p>
<p> of the things we do want to achieve, of course, is to make Australia</p>
<p> much more attractive as a financial centre for the region. And one</p>
<p> of the great benefits of the tax reform package is that it will make,</p>
<p> when it's implemented, it will make financial transactions in</p>
<p> Australia attract a much lower rate of tax. And it will therefore</p>
<p> make our security markets and investment in Australia as a financial</p>
<p> centre a lot more attractive.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>A lot more attractive than say the traditional Asian financial centres</p>
<p> such as Singapore and Hong Kong?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I am not into the business of talking any other centre down</p>
<p> but I am into the business of talking up places in Australia like</p>
<p> Sydney - and talking up the lifestyle, the fact that we have a very</p>
<p> stable legal system. We have one of the best supervised and most effectively</p>
<p> prudentially regulated banking systems in the world. We have a very</p>
<p> stable political system. We, of course, have a marvellous lifestyle.</p>
<p> We have low inflation, low interest rates and if we can get our tax</p>
<p> reform package through we are going to have a very benign climate</p>
<p> for the trading of securities and financial instruments in Australia.</p>
<p> So, you add all of that together and it's a pretty attractive</p>
<p> package. Now, I don't talk anybody else down, I merely talk my</p>
<p> own country up.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well, while Australia is also trying to attract foreign companies</p>
<p> basing themselves in Australia, a lot of Australian companies are</p>
<p> doing very well. Newscorp just today reporting big profits. Qantas</p>
<p> actually bucking the trend of other regional airlines and also showing</p>
<p> that it can be flexible. What is it about Australian companies do</p>
<p> you think that has let them ride this financial crisis around the</p>
<p> world and actually do very well?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we have delivered a very strong domestic economy, we have delivered</p>
<p> a budget surplus and that has underwritten the whole, sort of, aura</p>
<p> of strength you find in the Australian economy now. We have, of course,</p>
<p> operated a flexible exchange rate and that has meant that in some</p>
<p> of the markets we have lost because of the Asian downturn, we have</p>
<p> recovered in other parts of the world. The Australian trading profile</p>
<p> now is very multilateral. The Asian-Pacific region is very important</p>
<p> to us and it is still, in terms of countries like Japan and Korea,</p>
<p> a very important destination for our export but so is Europe and so</p>
<p> is North America. And the free-flowing operation of a flexible exchange</p>
<p> rate has really worked very strongly in Australia's favour.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>As has the relatively lower Australian dollar compared to the American</p>
<p> dollar?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I never get into too much specific comment on exchange relativities.</p>
<p> I merely say that a flexible exchange rate system, which of course</p>
<p> embraces our relationship with all other currencies, means that you</p>
<p> can adjust far more easily and adjust with far less pain than if you</p>
<p> have a rigid or more interventionist exchange rate system.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Howard, you have been mentioning the budget surplus</p>
<p> quite often. What does this mean then in terms of a tax reform, that</p>
<p> your Government then has more leeway and doesn't have to worry</p>
<p> so much about revenue?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's partly the case but the great value of getting the</p>
<p> budget into surplus is that it has helped bring down interest rates</p>
<p> and it has helped create a climate of economic confidence in Australia.</p>
<p> Because if we had not got our budget in order the rest of the world</p>
<p> would have looked a lot more negatively towards us. And they look</p>
<p> at us and they see a very strong budget position and they see a Government</p>
<p> that is determined to take the measures to deliver that and that really</p>
<p> has helped boost international as well as domestic confidence in Australia.</p>
<p> But the lower interest rates have helped enormously.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>A good point Prime Minister, Australia at the moment is enjoying the</p>
<p> spotlight as a place of good economic performance, stability at a</p>
<p> time when many countries around the world are looking quite shaky.</p>
<p> Do you think it can show itself to be a model in the future for the</p>
<p> rest of the world?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you never want to make extravagant claims in these situations,</p>
<p> I mean, we are not running around saying that what we are doing is</p>
<p> necessarily a model because every country has to run its own show</p>
<p> according to its own demands and its own requirements. But certainly</p>
<p> I find the Australian economy stronger, the people of Australia more</p>
<p> confident about the strength of the Australian economy and business</p>
<p> people in Australia more resilient and optimistic than probably at</p>
<p> any time over the last 20 or 30 years. Now, that is a measure of the</p>
<p> underlying confidence. There are patches of Australia which are still</p>
<p> doing it very hard. Many of our farmers are still being unfairly treated</p>
<p> by the perverted world markets which still shut a lot of agriculture</p>
<p> out and we don't intend to drop our cudgels on their behalf.</p>
<p> We have very efficient farmers, the most efficient in the world in</p>
<p> many respects but they still face very heavy layers of protection</p>
<p> in parts of Europe and in parts of Asia and we would like to see those</p>
<p> barriers broken down. But overall, people are very optimistic and</p>
<p> very positive about Australia's future. They feel that we have</p>
<p> reached a new layer of economic stability that we haven't had</p>
<p> for a long time.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Many many things to talk about Prime Minister Howard. Please do stay</p>
<p> with us while we go into a commercial break and you viewers too we</p>
<p> have many more things to discuss with the Australian Prime Minister</p>
<p> John Howard who joins us from Canberra.</p>
<p>[Commercial break]</p>
<p>Welcome back to the programme, another top story this afternoon, Indonesia's</p>
<p> president BJ Habibie says today that he wants the issue of East Timor</p>
<p> to be resolved by January 1st in the Year 2000. Habibie</p>
<p> told the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Jakarta that</p>
<p> : "as a friend we will let the East Timorese decide by themselves".</p>
<p> Jakarta is offering autonomy to the disputed former Portugese colony</p>
<p> which was invaded in 1975, and Habibie said last month that if the</p>
<p> East Timorese reject autonomy, the Indonesian Government will discuss</p>
<p> offering it independence. But today was the first time that he mentioned</p>
<p> a specific time frame for any such move.</p>
<p>Well, let's talk about how Australia feels about the developments</p>
<p> in East Timor as well as other issues. We are talking to the Australian</p>
<p> Prime Minister John Howard who joins us from Canberra.</p>
<p>Thank you for staying with us on Trading Day Prime Minister</p>
<p> Howard. East Timor, Australia has been very active on that issue for</p>
<p> several years and yet just recently Australia said it would back movements</p>
<p> for more autonomy but not independence. Now, Jakarta itself is talking</p>
<p> about giving independence. Has Australia, sort of, found itself cut</p>
<p> short on this issue?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. We have not opposed independence. What we have said is that we</p>
<p> would prefer autonomy within Indonesia. But at no stage have we said</p>
<p> that we would be against independence if that is what ultimately the</p>
<p> people of East Timor want. But what must be understood here is that</p>
<p> an independent East Timor not being part of Indonesia would be more</p>
<p> vulnerable, more susceptible to economic pressures, a lot more lonely</p>
<p> and a lot more in need of outside help than an East Timor that was</p>
<p> part of Indonesia. Now, Indonesia has significant economic difficulties</p>
<p> of her own and obviously there's a stretch capacity there to</p>
<p> help but clearly if East Timor of its own volition, and that's</p>
<p> important of course, remains part of Indonesia then it's going</p>
<p> to be, I think, in a slightly less vulnerable position. But at the</p>
<p> end of the day our position is that if the East Timorese people want</p>
<p> to be completely independent, that is their right. And in fact I wrote</p>
<p> to the Indonesian President before Christmas indicating a shift in</p>
<p> Australian policy along the lines that I have explained and that obviously</p>
<p> was one of the developments that was taken into account by the Indonesian</p>
<p> Government.</p>
<p>But we acknowledge at the end that the wishes of the Indonesian people</p>
<p> (sic) ...the East Timorese people were able to determine the matter,</p>
<p> but we would encourage both the East Timorese and the Indonesians</p>
<p> to examine very hard, think very hard as to whether some basis of</p>
<p> a continuing association through autonomy within the Indonesian State</p>
<p> might not be chosen in preference to full independence.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You have been in close contact with Jakarta on that but are you giving</p>
<p> that same counsel directly to the leaders of the pro-independence</p>
<p> movement in East Timor?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, they are very conscious of our position and the Australian Foreign</p>
<p> Minister, Mr Downer, will have the opportunity over the next few weeks</p>
<p> when he goes to the region, to Indonesia and so forth, to talk to</p>
<p> figures as it were in both camps and to put our point of view. They</p>
<p> are very conscious of what our point of view is and we think it's</p>
<p> important that they examine autonomy. But if in the end independence</p>
<p> is the way people want to go then we would want the transition to</p>
<p> independence to be arranged in a very orderly fashion because suddenly</p>
<p> being left alone when you are fundamentally quite weak economically</p>
<p> and you have got inadequate infrastructure is going to be very, very</p>
<p> difficult. And I think people should think ahead and keep those sorts</p>
<p> of things in mind. And, of course, this is of great importance to</p>
<p> Australia because we have an historical association with East Timor</p>
<p> stretching back to World War II and of course it is very close to</p>
<p> the Australian mainland and we feel a sense of deep responsibility</p>
<p> and that is why we are urging the course of action I have outlined</p>
<p> on both the Indonesians and the East Timorese.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>There is talk though that in your camp there's actually quite</p>
<p> a division on how to approach this issue. How do you reply to that</p>
<p> Prime Minister Howard?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What, inside our Government?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Inside your Government.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no division inside the Government. There's the obvious sparring</p>
<p> between the Government and the Opposition. The division on this issue,</p>
<p> and I don't want to get domestic politics onto your programme,</p>
<p> but there's been quite a division inside the Opposition Party</p>
<p> with their current spokesman on foreign affairs attacking the former</p>
<p> Foreign Minister. But as far as the Government itself is concerned</p>
<p> there is no division within our ranks on the issue, none at all.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Let's move to the general issue of Asia, well not issue, but</p>
<p> Asia in general Australia's relations with it. How much of a</p>
<p> role do you see Australia playing in the recovery of Asia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, very significant. Remember that Australia was the only country</p>
<p> apart from Japan to participate in the three IMF rescue packages for</p>
<p> Indonesia, Korea and Thailand. And over the last 18 months due in</p>
<p> no small measure to our economic strength we have been able to be</p>
<p> a very good friend, what I call a regional mate, of the Asian-Pacific</p>
<p> region and to help it a great deal. Now, within our own capacity we</p>
<p> will continue to play a very positive role. We are deeply and abidingly</p>
<p> part of the Asian-Pacific region and whilst we have very important</p>
<p> links with other parts of the world we have very deep links with the</p>
<p> Asian-Pacific region. And I think Australia is increasingly seen as</p>
<p> a partner in the region for the rough as well as the smooth, for the</p>
<p> long-term as well as the short-term and because we are able to help</p>
<p> countries in their difficulties we are seen as a more durable participant</p>
<p> in the Asian-Pacific scene.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>One of the rough patches you yourself brought up Prime Minister Howard</p>
<p> that of agricultural products, you brought up how Australian farmers</p>
<p> are being hurt by protectionism in Asia. Can you elaborate on that.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, not only Asia....</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Yes, not just Asia but also other markets. What would you like particular</p>
<p> Asian countries to do, open up in what areas?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we would like the same sort of attitude taken towards agricultural</p>
<p> exports as is increasingly taken towards exports of manufactured goods</p>
<p> and services. Now, there's a great resistance to that in a number</p>
<p> of countries and Japan is one of course where there is still very</p>
<p> strong....there is still a very strong resistance to a number of</p>
<p> agricultural exports in Australia. The way to handle it is to get</p>
<p> a new World Trade Organisation around a new, if you like, Uruguay</p>
<p> type round going as soon as possible. And I am very heartened by the</p>
<p> support that the Americans have recently given to that through President</p>
<p> Clinton's state of the union message and we as a relatively small</p>
<p> country that has a very efficient agricultural sector, our best hope</p>
<p> is freer trade in that area. I use the expression freer rather than</p>
<p> free because you will never get, I suppose, completely free trade</p>
<p> but you will get freer trade.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So much to talk about including Australia's hosting of the Olympics</p>
<p> in the year 2000. Do stay with us we are talking to the Australian</p>
<p> Prime Minister John Howard from Canberra.</p>
<p>[Commercial break]</p>
<p>We are talking to the Australian Prime Minister John Howard who joins</p>
<p> us from Canberra. Prime Minister Howard, the issue of Australia possibly</p>
<p> becoming a republic up for referendum soon, how do you see Australia</p>
<p> going into the new millennium?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think whatever happens in the outcome of that referendum Australia</p>
<p> will go into the new millennium as a united, stable very optimistic,</p>
<p> very tolerant country. I don't know what will happen in the referendum,</p>
<p> I personally am not in favour of a republic because the present system</p>
<p> of Government works exceptionally well and I never believe in changing</p>
<p> something that works exceptionally well. But there is a free vote</p>
<p> for the Government members and we'll see what happens.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Onto another thing that's happening in Australia soon the Olympics</p>
<p> in the year 2000, Australia preparing for that. How do you think it's</p>
<p> been affected by this scandal surrounding the IOC?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think everybody would have preferred that we hadn't have</p>
<p> had those events surrounding the IOC and I am strongly in favour of</p>
<p> a thorough investigation of any complaints, I am strongly in favour</p>
<p> of the whole thing being transparent but it will be a great event.</p>
<p> Sydney will do it in its stride, Sydney will be absolutely lustrous</p>
<p> and welcoming and a great centre of hospitality and I think it will</p>
<p> be a fabulous event and Australians will love it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Unfortunately we are out of time.</p>
