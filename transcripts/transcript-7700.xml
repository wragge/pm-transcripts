TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, HYATT HOTEL, CANBERRA<br />
8 AUGUST 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: You knew all along did you?<br />
PM: No I didn't. I just thought that's what would happen.<br />
Well, I really talked about it yesterday. I've had the<br />
opportunity of working with Geoffrey over a number of years<br />
on different issues. I like him as a man. I respect him as<br />
a politician. I think he will be an intelligent and<br />
compassionate Prime Minister. Certainly the relationship<br />
between our two countries will not only not be diminished<br />
but will go on I think to further strengths. His<br />
relationship with us is close. I was able before he was to<br />
visit the Soviet Union to give him the opportunity of coming<br />
here and having briefings from our people because we had a<br />
broader range of experience and facilities that was<br />
available to him here. I know he appreciated that very<br />
much. I can also beat him at golf.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what's your reaction to the wage case<br />
decision? PM: I really haven't had the opportunity of examining it<br />
yet in all the detail I'd want. I'd prefer to make a<br />
comment on that later on thanks.<br />
