STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
MOURA MINERS<br />
The mine disaster at Moura touches us all. Today the hopes and prayers of<br />
all Australians will be with the eleven men and their loved ones.<br />
What has happened there Is a terrible reminder of the dangers which<br />
mineworkers continue to face, and the anxiety which their families and<br />
communities must endure.<br />
In recent years the people of Moura have suffered more than their share of<br />
tragedies. So long as a glimmer of a chance of rescue remains we earnestly<br />
hope that they will be spared another.<br />
