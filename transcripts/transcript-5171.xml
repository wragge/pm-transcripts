PRIME MINISTER: DONATIONS TO KAMPUCHEA TO BE TAX DEDUCTIBLE<br />
DOORSTOP, CANBERRA<br />
Question Prime Minister, what prompted the decision:. to make donations<br />
for Kampuchea tax deductible?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The matter was raised by the Treasurer and the Foreign. Miniister.<br />
You know the long-standing policy of all Australian governments<br />
that aid from Government sources should be official aid<br />
controlled by the Government, directed where the Government's<br />
own bureau believes is most desirable.<br />
We have not in any sense inhibited people from giving privately,<br />
but it has not been tax deductible so they have borne the<br />
tctal cost of what they have provided in terms of foreign aid.<br />
We decided that that, in a sense traditional approach, ought<br />
to be altered in this case because of the severity of the<br />
problems in Kampuchea, because of the degree of harm and hurt<br />
to tens upon tens of thousands, probably to millions, of people<br />
in that particular country. Also of course having in mind<br />
the history of Kampuchea over the last several years. It is<br />
not only the Vietnamese invasion that is causing very, tragic<br />
hardship, the activities of the Pol Pot regime before that<br />
involved anything up to two million people losing their lives.<br />
It is one of the greatest human tragedies. We felt this would<br />
encourage some additional aid to go to Kamnpuchea and also felt<br />
that the Australian people would welcome this opportunity<br />
to participate in a very real tragedy in a very direct way,<br />
so that people themselves could feel involved and do what<br />
they could to help.<br />
Question Do you have a proposal for supervision to ensure the aid<br />
gets through.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There is the Kampuchean aid fund, and we are quite sure that<br />
the people involved in that will want to do what they can to<br />
make sure that aid gets through to those who really need it.<br />
So far as Kampuchea is concerned for everyone, for Governments,<br />
for the United Nations it is a very real question and it<br />
is a difficult-question because it is not going to suit our<br />
purpose and it will. not suit the purpose of the Australian<br />
people who provide funds if the aid ends up by providing<br />
additional support to the Vietnamese invading armies. We will<br />
need the closest possible supervision. That means the closest<br />
that we can provide in the circumstances of Kampuchea. When the<br />
next aircraft goes to Kampuchea, Andrew Peacock has already<br />
made a decision that officers of his own Department and the aid<br />

Prime minister ( continued)<br />
bureau should travel to Kampuchea so that we can have a<br />
direct-input from Australian sources of the way in which<br />
the aid is being handled. It is all a very very difficult<br />
question. That only means we have to work harder at it.<br />
to try and make sure that aid goes where it is most needed.<br />
Question Prime Minister, on that tax relief question, you described<br />
it as a breakthrough in the Parliament. Do you see it as the<br />
forerunner of breaking through to allow people who make donations<br />
to all overseas aid<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We made the decision in a limited way. It is for this<br />
financial year. It is for the Kamnpuchea relief fund. It is<br />
obviously going to throw into debate the whole question of<br />
Australia's foreign aid, but we felt that we ought to make<br />
an exception in relation to Kampuchea for the reasons that<br />
I have outlined.<br />
Question But nothing on Freedom From Hunger or anything at this stage?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No. At this stage the decision is strictly for Kampuchea,<br />
for Kampuchean relief and it is restricted at this time<br />
for aid provided through this financial year. If people think<br />
that that is too limited, that it should have been wider, that<br />
at least is a very considerable break with the practice of<br />
some decades. I believe it will have very widespread and<br />
wholehearted Australian support. </p>
