FOR PRESS. P" 1 102/ 1971<br />
PREMIERS' CONFERENCE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. William McMahon<br />
During my recent absence overseas, it was proposed<br />
by the Premier of New South Wales and supported by some other<br />
Premiers that a special Premiers' conference be held to<br />
discuss the economic situation.<br />
The Government has given full consideration to this<br />
proposal and I have forwarded letters to the Premier of 3ew<br />
South WTales and all other Premiers advising them of this decision.<br />
I have informed the Premiers that in view of the<br />
scheme being put in hand for Commonwealth ( rants to the States for<br />
employment creating activities in non-metropolitan areas, the<br />
easing of restraints on bank lending including the large reduction<br />
in the statutory reserve deposit ratio applying to the major<br />
trading banks, and the significant reduction in interest rates9 on<br />
Government securities, I believe it would be more appropriate to<br />
hold a Premiers' conference, as has been done in the last two years,<br />
during the month of February.<br />
By then, of course, all parties will be in a better<br />
position to assess the impact on the economy of the measures that<br />
have already been taken.<br />
Accordingly, I have suggested to the Premiers that the<br />
meeting be held about mid-February and I await from them their<br />
reaction as to the actual dates I have proposed.<br />
CANBERRA, 17 December, 1971. </p>
