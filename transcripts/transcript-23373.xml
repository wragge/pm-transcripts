    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today marks 100 days since the last successful people smuggling venture to Australia.</p>
<p>The last successful people smuggling venture to Australia occurred on 19 December last year. During the same 100 day period a year ago (20 December 2012 – 29 March 2013), 66 illegal boats carrying 3,879 people arrived.</p>
<p>This is the longest period without a successful venture since before the Howard Government’s strong border protection policies were abandoned by Labor and Kevin Rudd in August 2008.</p>
<p>The Coalition went to the last election with clear policies to stop the boats.  We are delivering on our pledge to stop the boats.</p>
<p>The Government has made difficult but necessary decisions to secure our borders and restore what Labor had destroyed.  These strong policies are saving lives.</p>
<p>Operation Sovereign Borders is working as intended.  We acknowledge the work and dedication of the people and agencies across government in making this happen.  They are doing a great service for our nation.</p>
<p>The people smugglers now understand that the way to Australia is closed. We are putting the smugglers out of business.</p>
<p>Under Labor over 800 boats arrived carrying more than 50,000 people, including more than 8,000 children.  This catastrophic policy failure resulted in over 1,000 lives lost at sea and $11 billion in Budget blowouts.</p>
<p>The progress we are making in strengthening our borders is restoring confidence in our migration programme.  We are an immigrant country and a successful immigration programme requires that it operate with integrity.</p>
<p>While this milestone recognises the progress that we have made, the Government remains resolute in our determination to stop the boats.</p>
