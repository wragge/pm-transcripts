    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well ladies and gentlemen I have called this news conference to inform you and to inform the Australian people that this morning I obtained the approval of His Excellency the Governor General for a major re-structuring of the federal ministry.  These changes will continue in the process of renewal and regeneration, they will reinforce the Government';s commitment to its goals for Australia, of national security, economic strength and social stability. It will indicate to the Australian people the absolute determination of this government to avoid any sense of passivity or any sense of complacency or inertia, we have an important task and that is to govern well in the interests of all of the people of Australia and that remains the central preoccupation.  We do not take the support of the Australian people for granted and I hope in the changes that I am about to announce that will be further reinforced and indicated.</p>
<p>The major changes are as follows, Philip Ruddock will become the new Attorney General, Daryl Williams will become the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Tony Abbott will move from the position of Workplace Relations to the position of Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson will become the Minister for Family and Community Services and also Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in the Status of Women, Amanda Vanstone will become the Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.  There will be one new Cabinet Minister, and that will be Kevin Andrews who will move from the position of Minister for Ageing to become the Minister for Workplace Relations.</p>
<p>There will be two additions to the outer Ministry, Senator Ian Campbell from Western Australia will become the Minister for Territories, Local Government and Roads, and Julie Bishop, the Federal Member for Curtin in Western Australia also, will become the new Minister for Ageing.  It will be apparent from those announcements that there is one very senior Minister who will not be in the next Ministry and that is Senator Richard Alston and that is as a consequence of his decision as communicated to me recently that he intended to retire from the Senate in the near future.  I want to take this opportunity of recording my immense appreciation to Richard Alston for many years of service to the Liberal Party, to the Coalition Government and to the people of Australia.  He is a former President of the Victorian division of the Party, he entered the Senate in 1986 on the death of Alan Missen, in Opposition he served in a number of Shadow portfolios and in the last seven and a half years he';s not only been the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate but he';s also been a very powerful and effective Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts.  And I do want to say to you Richard, you have done a wonderful amount of work for the Government and for the Liberal Party, you will be missed, his departure is entirely his decision and it is, I know, a cause of regret to many of his colleagues but that is his decision which I fully understand and respect.</p>
<p>I intend to appoint Senator Minchin, who is the Minister for Finance, as the new Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate.</p>
<p> In the past few days Mr Wilson Tuckey and I have discussed his future and he told me that it was not his expectation that he would serve as a Minister in the event of the Government being re-elected at the next election and that as a consequence of this we have both agreed that it';s appropriate that he not be included, or re-included, in the Ministry as a result of this reshuffle.  I want to thank Wilson Tuckey for the work that he has done as a Minister, the energy that he';s bought to his portfolio, his commitment to regional Australia, his understanding of the challenges and the problems of regional Australia.  He';s been a very strong advocate of those portfolio interests over a very long period of time.</p>
<p>The new Minister for Territories, Local Government and Roads, will be Senator Ian Campbell.  Senator Campbell has had a very strong performance as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, he will continue to be the manager of oppositionâ¦ of rather, Government Business in the Senate and joining the Ministry in Mr Anderson';s portfolio, and its been slightly renamed you will observe, he';ll be the Minister for Territories, Local Government and Roads.  And I think he';ll bring a great deal of energy and strength to that position.</p>
<p>I';ve decided to appoint Julie Bishop, who';s been the Federal Member for Curtin since 1998, to be the new Minister for Ageing.  Prior to entering Parliament Julie Bishop was a partner in one of the very largest law firms in Australia and had a very strong professional career before coming Canberra.</p>
<p>  De-Anne Kelly, the Member for Dawson, will on the recommendation of the Deputy Prime Minister, become the new Parliamentary Secretary to both Mr Anderson and Mr Vaile.  Mr Anderson and Senator Ron Boswell have had a discussion and it';s been agreed that that change should take place as a consequence of those discussions.  I want to record my respect and thanks and affection to Ron Boswell, he';s one of the great fighters of Federal Parliament, he';s a great defender of the interests of Queensland and a person who';s always had the courage to stand up to extremist groups in rural Australia and elsewhere in the Australian community.  Senator Boswell will continue to serve as Leader of the National Party in the Senate.</p>
<p>I';ve also taken the opportunity to make some other changes to Ministerial arrangements to further focus and strengthen the position of the Government.  I';ve decided in addition to his current portfolio responsibilities, I emphasise that, I';ve decided to appoint Mal Brough, the Member for Longman and the current Minister for Employment Services, to the additional post of Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence.  There are many things to be done in the Defence area, particularly in the light of the Kinnaird review of Defence Procurement.  Mr Brough will, of course, have responsibility for Defence Personnel and he will represent the Minister for Defence in the House of Representatives.  Andâ¦ but Danna Vale will continue in the Ministry as the Minister for Veterans'; Affairs.</p>
<p>  And also in addition to his current responsibilities as Minister for Citizenship and Multiculturalism, Gary Hardgrave, will be appointed to the position of Minister Assisting the Prime Minister.  He will carry out general duties in that area and in part, he will relieve Peter Slipper of the acting role that he';s discharged in that area since the departure of Bill Heffernan as Parliamentary Secretary to the Cabinet.  Mr Slipper will continue in his position, full time position as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.</p>
<p>  There are two other changes â I';m going to appoint Ross Cameron, the Member for Parramatta and currently Parliamentary Secretary, to the Minister for Family and Community Services to be the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer to replace Ian Campbell, who';s been promoted to the Ministry.  And the vacancy thereby created in the ranks of Parliamentary Secretaries will be filled by Christopher Pyne from South Australia, who';s the Member for Sturt and who';s been a Member of Parliament since 1993 and he will become the Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister for Family and Community Services.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, it is a major reshuffle.  I think it will make a strong Government even stronger.  I would not anticipate any further major reshuffles of the Ministry between now and the next election, which I repeat is scheduled to be held towards the end of next year.  But membership of the Ministry is always performance driven.  We are not a Government that takes the support of the Australian people for granted.  We have very strong priorities grouped around those three goals of national security, economic strength and social stability and I believe that the changes I have announced will reinforce our capacity to deliver on those goals.  His Excellency has indicated that the swearing in of the new Ministry will take place on Tuesday week, the 7th of October.  Any questions?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, you mentioned national security and economic security as the first two pillars.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>National security and economic strength.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Strengthâ¦ but you didn';t make any changes, any major changes in either of those areas.  Did you consider making changes in those areas?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I would have thought the responsibility to the Attorney General had a lot to do with national security.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But the Treasurer?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, let me make it clear about the Treasurer.  I mean, the Treasurer is an outstanding performer in his role and I couldn';t have a better Treasurer. I mean, it';s always open to a Treasurer and the Deputy Leader to opt for another job but the Treasurer enjoys what he does, he does it very very well and there';s nobody who could come within a bull';s roar of doing the job as well.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, during the relatively short period of time Senator Patterson has spent in the health portfolio, she has faced some industry criticism, did you feel the need to bring in a heavy hitter in the form of Mr Abbott?  Or are you satisfied with the performance of Senator Pattersonâ¦.?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I';m clearly satisfied with her ability, otherwise I wouldn';t be appointing her to the position of Minister for Family and Community Services.  Senator Patterson has a lot of skill, she has a detailed understanding of many of the social portfolios and my continued confidence in her is illustrated by the fact that I';m moving her into what is arguably an even bigger portfolio.  As far as Mr Abbott is concerned, yes Mr Abbott is a, as you describe it, a heavy hitter, but he';s also a highly intelligent person who has a great grasp of detail and has a very deep social conscience.  The idea that Tony Abbott is in some way a one-dimensional political head-kicker couldn';t be more wrongâ¦ I think he';ll be a very effective Minister for Health.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, would you consider Senator Alston for a diplomatic posting down the track?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Iâ¦ we don';t have any understanding about that if that';s what you want to know.  But I would not rule it out.  I mean, I never rule out the idea of appointing people of real ability who';ve had senior ministerial experience to diplomatic positions.  But if you';re asking me have we got some agreement that he goes to Chad or somewhere like that, no.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible].</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I mean, you know.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How long have you been mulling over the changes?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, I';ve been mulling over them for a week or so, a week or more.  But it all sort of crystallised recently.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>â¦ for the next election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think this will make us an even more effective Government, but eight seats is all that stands between us and electoral oblivion.   And I hope people understand that and every opportunity I get I just want to tell Liberal supporters around Australia â don';t imagine that we are some kind of unbeatable or unbackable favourite at the next election, we are not.  Eight seats and we';re out of business.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will Mr Tuckey serve to the next election and, or beyond?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will he stand at the next election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is my understanding that he will, but that is a matter you should canvass with him.  I understand he';s been re-endorsed.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And the crazy letters he wrote had nothing to do withâ¦</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I beg your pardon?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The silly letters he wrote had nothing to do with him beingâ¦?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I have made my comments about his position.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>â¦. On the political agenda now.  How far do you think the four structures of the ADF need to be rebalanced towards long distance expeditionary forces and away from defence of Australia priorities?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Geoffrey, my view is that the broad directions laid down in the White Paper and as brought up to date at the end of last year are valid.  Clearly, in the future, we need to have a niche capability.  But we also to engage in coalition operation, but we also need a strong defence of Australia';s capacity.  And we also, importantly, need a capacity for Solomon Islands type operations. I think there';ll be more of those in the future and we certainly have to make sure that we have a capacity to deal with them.  But I also think we should avoid the development of artificial differences of emphasis in the defence area.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible) Iraq Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I beg your pardon?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible)?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The natural processes of applying ones intellect to an important challenge.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard you were alluding on A Current Affair the other night to some further health measures you were looking at, will Mr Abbott have some major new policies toâ¦?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well obviously as a new Minister with a vigorous mind he will want to have a look at the scene, I mean the first point I make about health is that we remain rock solid in our support of Medicare, we want to strengthen Medicare not weaken it, we want to make Medicare affordable, available to the Australian community.  We also intend though, unlike the Australian Labor Party, to keep the private health insurance rebate.  If ever something were slated for execution and bound for the gallows under a future Labor Government it';s the private health insurance rebate.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did Peter Costello have some input?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I discussed these changes with my three senior colleagues, Mr Anderson, Mr Costello and Senator Hill.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Was there any discussion at all, there was some stories around that Mr Costello might swap with Mr Downer, was that ever a live option?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look Samantha, Mr Costello has the right at any time as Deputy Leader, if he wishes, and he knows that this is my view and I would always accommodate it, to embrace another portfolio, but he has no desire and I can understand it, to leave the Treasury, it';s the most challenging job outside the prime ministership and it';s the most interesting one and it';s one where he continues to make an extremely impressive contribution.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And in terms of the Family and Community Services Portfolio, does that clear the way for any more changes to FTB payments, there';s obviously been a lot of criticism of Senator Vanstoneâ¦</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> These Ministerial changes have not been made in order to better facilitate policy changes.  If there are to be policy changes made in any of these areas they will be made irrespective of who the Minister is.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible) portfolio of immigration draining on the Minister and he needs a bit of a rest?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don';t think becoming the Attorney-General represents having a rest.  Bear in mind that he';s been in that position for seven and half years and I think he';ll be a very good Attorney-General and of course he will have quite prominent role in the ongoing debate of national security.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What are the (inaudible) for Danna Vale?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Danna at present is the Minister for Veterans Affairs'; and I';ll hand out a release as soon as the press conference is over which recapitulates all these changes I';ve announced.  Danna will continue as Minister for Veterans'; Affairs, but Mr Brough will take over the Minister Assisting role and he will as Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence answer questions for the Defence Minister in the Lower House.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>With Daryl Williams (inaudible)?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well the detail of the particular responsibilities I';ve got to work out with Senator Hill.  I don';t intend to name him as the Minister for Defence procurement but he could well have a significant role in Assisting Senator Hill or carrying out particular functions in that area.  I spoke to Senator Hill this morning about this and he and I will discuss the matter when Senator Hill returns from overseas.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On the Solomon Islands, would it be your expectation that the bulk of the military forces would be home by Christmas?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I';m not going to put a time on it, they will do their job and they';ve done a great job up to date and we will just see how things develop.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>With respect to the defence capability review, Prime Minister, do you rule out the prospect of substantive cuts to the major defence platforms that are already planned to be purchased?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, I';m not going to get into that area, Mark.  We have a Cabinet meeting coming up to discuss these issues and I';m going to keep my counsel until then.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>One of the last things that Senator Alston, as it turns out, wanted to do in office was to revise the digital television regime and introduce multi-channelling â are you more sympathetic to that now than you were a year or two ago?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh that';s a matter the Government will discuss, I';m not going to speculate about different views.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Would you expect Daryl Williams to have a kinder and gentler relationship with the ABC than the outgoing Senator?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that';s a matter, I guess, for time to tell.  Look, I think there';ll always be a certain amount of tooing and froing between the Government and the ABC.  It';s an independent broadcaster and I respect its independence and I don';t always agree with the balance of some of the programmes and I make my views known when that occurs, but look, he will work out his own relationship with these organisations subject of course to Cabinet views and the policies of the Government.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Any consideration of a homeland security ministry?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don';t believe there';s any necessity to create a new portfolio.  The more I look at the administrative arrangements that exist in these country, in these areas compared with those in the United States and the United Kingdom I am satisfied that the arrangements are as good if not superior to those that operate in America.  I don';t think the creation of a homeland security department has simplified the areas of responsibility or clarify the lines of communications.  I think our whole of Government approach in areas of national security is quite effective.  Two more questions and then I';ll go.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>   Oh look, I never go into that. He';s very happy with the new arrangement, but that doesn';t mean for a moment he didn';t like doing the job that he had before which he did, of course, with consummate skill and effect.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, is it a coincidence that Government advertising is increasing at pace with the political cycle?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I read that.  Now that I';ve got this out of the way, I';ll have a careful look at some of the claims in that article?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you surprised that Megawati snubbed the Opposition leader, Mr Howard?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well obviously these are matters for the President and for Mr Crean';s office.  But let me say that from Australia';s point of view it';s important that the leader of the Opposition sees the President of Indonesia and it would not be my desire from any political point of view to see Mr Crean';s arrangements interrupted.  I saw President Soeharto when I was in Opposition and the President of Indonesia has always been available to Opposition leaders and Opposition figures and I hope that it might prove possible for Mr Crean to reinstate those arrangements, I';m not wishing him any adversity in that area. Thank you.  Can I just say one other thing, I would like to take the opportunity to congratulating cardinal-designate George Pell on his appointment as cardinal, it';s a great tribute to him as a person and it';s also a great recognition of the signficance of the catholic community to the life and the experience of Australia.  I have a very high personal regard for George Pell, I think he';s a great intellect and he';s a person of great determination and strength.   I wish him well and I take the opportunity as he prepares to assume the most senior position in the catholic community in Australia of remarking upon that community';s great contribution to our nation.</p>
