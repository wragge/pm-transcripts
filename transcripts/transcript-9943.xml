TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MPD<br />
ARTS POLICY LAUNCH, PLAYHOUSE VICTORIAN ARTS CENTRE,<br />
MELBOURNE, 17 FEBRUARY 1996<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Thank you indeed. One has always got to think laterally. There arb cures!!<br />
You know, through that dreadful experience of the 1993 election -mpaign<br />
when the Huns and Visigoths were out there before us nothing so brightened<br />
me up or cheered me up as the support you gave me and us in 1993 and<br />
I think you have done it again. I can't tell you how moved I was by your<br />
reception of Annita and me and the things that Wendy ( Harmer) and<br />
Jacki ( Weaver) and Hugo ( Weaving) have said about the Labor Party and<br />
also about me and my colleagues. Fred Astaire once said if I had a tear<br />
drop, I could just cry'. But, I could have done one better than Fred, I could<br />
have cried without one.<br />
At any rate we are all here, I think, celebrating the same thing. This is not so<br />
much a celebration of 13 years of Labor and what it has done for the arts, but<br />
as much a celebration of what the arts mean to everyone of us. To all of you,<br />
who are part of the arts in this country or who support them, to me, to my<br />
colleagues, to all of us who know just how important it is.<br />
I think, that it was one of the things that Wendy said that, I think, I was very<br />
happy to hear and that is that now in this country people appreciate the arts<br />
as though they are entirely central to our life. Entirely central to our national<br />
life, not just some thing off on a tangent on the side, but a manifestation of<br />
the way we are. And that they are not just something the government gives<br />
grants to or has bodies for or supports companies of, but that they are, of<br />
their essence, central to the way we are. Because, I think, all of us feel that it<br />
is only in a free society, it is only in a truly democratic one that has got good<br />
values in that space and intellectual freedom does the richness bubble to the<br />
top and we get the distilled essence of ourselves and the celebration of what<br />
we are and what we have become.<br />
Those words that Jefferson once used and wrote in that great American<br />
document about human happiness life, liberty and human happiness<br />
human happiness is the core and central objective of government. There can<br />
be no manifestation of human happiness if our mood is crestfallen, if we are<br />
downcast, if we are subjugated, if we are intimidated, if our creativity and our<br />
expression is not allowed to move, we will never see the manifestation in<br />
what we call the arts.<br />
So, when we see a country that has vitality and vibrance in the arts we know<br />
that we are truly making it as a society. That we have got that happiness<br />
there and that we have got that creativity and that space that a deep<br />
democracy does give everybody. I think that is what we are really<br />
celebrating. We are celebrating all of that and we are celebrating the<br />
manifestation of it in celebrating the arts. </p>
<p>I<br />
My opponents say of me " you only want to give things back to the arts, you<br />
only want to pay back the arts." I say too right I do, and I will never repay<br />
them. I will never repay them. When I say ' I I mean it in the plural. We will<br />
never repay them because you can't recompense, in monetary terms,<br />
something which is central to the spirit of the nation and it is about a<br />
celebration of the spirit and the understanding of the spiritualism of the arts is<br />
the reason we will never repay them. We will try and we may do some things<br />
better than others, but we will never repay them because of their essence<br />
that richness and spirituality is something that comes from people, from<br />
institutions, it comes from their up spiritedness, their good naturedness, it<br />
doesn't come because of a government cheque. I am an indefatigable<br />
warrior for the arts and I always will be. And we will resist our opponents<br />
when they attack us.<br />
But I think the proof of the importance of the arts is there with our Aboriginal<br />
people who were here before all of us. For against the ravages of 40,000<br />
years dance and music and history and religion and story telling kept them<br />
together as a civilisation, as a community and even withstood the ravages of<br />
the rest of us. That is where I think our lesson is and if we can do, as a<br />
society, as they have done with that sense of belief in themselves, in<br />
ourselves and pride in ourselves as they have then our arts in this country<br />
will have succeeded.<br />
I don't know of any country that has been so singularly blessed as we have.<br />
To think that just four times our life time ago there was this large continent<br />
inhabited by this old people who have now bequeathed us, shared this with<br />
us, is one of the great perhaps accidents of history, one of the great<br />
benefactions of history. We are now appreciating, I think, what a great<br />
benefaction is as population growth and the pressures of modern life change<br />
the way people live in the world we just the 18 million of us have inherited<br />
this vast continent. We have got a chance to do something with it, we have<br />
taken the great change in the post war years, the greatest risk but the<br />
greatest reward of our time here and that was the post war migration policy<br />
and as a consequence we now celebrate our diversity, our strength, we<br />
rejoice in the vitality it has given us. It has made us new. This diverse<br />
nation, this vibrant group on this continent with this old society, in this old<br />
place, in this country we love has a chance to make us, as a nation state,<br />
unique in the world.<br />
Now for the first time in our history, we are living with other peoples around<br />
us as we have never lived before. I often, when you look at the Liberals and<br />
their subliminal messages about the good old days of the 1950s and 1960s,<br />
the days of the monoculture, the days when all around us, when the sun<br />
might have been shining on Australia and on Britain, maybe, and on the<br />
United States and on Canada but there wasn't much sun shining on Burma or<br />
on Indonesia or on Indochina, on Vietnam or on China itself. I mean these<br />
were dark days with the Burmese in their utter subjugation. The Indonesians<br />
and their desperate poverty. The Vietnamese fighting back the yoke of<br />
colonialism and the Chinese trying to organise themselves into a nation with<br />
some bounty. Now we look around us and we find their freedom emerging, </p>
<p>their income growth rising, their pride in themselves, the celebration of their<br />
cultures and their invitation to us to join them. For the first time in our life<br />
time, the sun is really shining brightly on the whole world, not just on a couple<br />
of places. That is what is on offer to us. To be part of that because what is<br />
happening around us in east Asia is a phenomenon without precedence in<br />
human history.<br />
I said the other day at the Policy Launch, you just might recall that the<br />
industrial revolution created so much wealth in Britain the British built abbeys<br />
to themselves across the English countryside and it came from somewhere<br />
between 10 and 20 million people. In the United States when the Fricks and<br />
the Carnegies and the Rockefellers put their fortunes together and built the<br />
great businesses of America and the railroads opened up the country and the<br />
mines created the wealth and the mansions were built all along Fifth Avenue<br />
and in Baltimore and in Pennsylvania, right through the United States, it was<br />
done of a population of somewhere between 40 and 70 million. Just imagine<br />
what is going to happen with 2.5 billion people, with economies growing at<br />
8 and 10 per cent a year. The revolution, the production of wealth, the flux<br />
that is going to come from that will have no precedence in human history.<br />
The emergence of China into the world economy all 1.2 billion of them<br />
knows no historic precedence and we are right in the middle of it. Right in<br />
the centre and we have got a gilt edged invitation to come to the party, to be<br />
part of the life of this.<br />
But, imagine going there without a strategy. Imagine going there without a<br />
sense of yourself. Imagine having the great inheritance of this continent and<br />
this people and going there uncertainly. Going there almost as though you<br />
shouldn't be there. That is why it is entirely central, it is fundamental to our<br />
future both economically, socially, culturally that we know who we are and<br />
that we celebrate who we are and we express ourselves and why it is<br />
important that we define ourselves and why the arts do these things for us.<br />
Why it is important to have an Australian as our head of state, because we<br />
can't go as some derivative society with the head of state the monarch of<br />
another country and present ourselves as a unique people.<br />
Yet, the Liberal Party says that the republic is a distraction. They say that<br />
I use it only to get away from the big issues. But when I say hang on we said<br />
we would produce 500,000 jobs and we have produced 713, 000. We said<br />
we would make the economy again, we have grown faster than any other<br />
western world economy, we have done it with three per cent inflation. What<br />
do you think I am distracting from?<br />
The other day when I said we would put a plebiscite to the Australian people<br />
to ask them the question: do they want an Australian as the Australian head<br />
of state? John Howard, quick as a flash, came out and said it was cheap<br />
populism. To ask each Australian what their opinion is he says is cheap, but<br />
to have 300 people boxed up in a room appointed by him in some convention<br />
is democratic. So, they attacked the notion that we should know who we are<br />
and that we could only proceed if we are completely certain of our identity </p>
<p>and our strength and that we celebrate ourselves and that we take something<br />
to this great change in the world and that we are part of it.<br />
The arts is not just something for our quiet enjoyment. It is not just something<br />
that governments do because it is the right thing to do. It is entirely<br />
meaningful about the sort of country we are, the kind of democracy we have,<br />
why we should invest in our creativity because without it, we will wander<br />
around as waifs in a world of opportunity when it is really ours to claim.<br />
We are now back, again, talking about these things. We are talking about<br />
the importance of these things. The importance of the arts, its importance to<br />
the country and what the Government has done for them.<br />
I know three years ago that people thought that the arts were gravely<br />
threatened. We had Fightback, we had John Hewson. They thought in the<br />
deprivation of the economy, with a recession and high unemployment we<br />
were dead meat and so instead of being subtle, they were unsubtle. They<br />
said how about this, a Goods and Services Tax, we will rip up Medicare, we<br />
will cut $ 10 billion out of the social wage, we will knock around the ABC, we<br />
will gut the arts, what do you reckon about that? People gave them the<br />
answer at the end. A lot of artists, I think, thought the game is really up for<br />
grabs here. We are going to have to tuck in and defend the things we<br />
believe in. But, in some respects, there was a boyish naivety shall we say<br />
about John Hewson. You know, rushing in there with a document seeking a<br />
mandate, in many respects quite an honourable thing to do. Seeking support<br />
for the model he believed in.<br />
But, in some respects, this election is far more dangerous for the people who<br />
have belief in this country, who have faith in it. Because now you have a<br />
campaign organised by cynics. You know, the warped intellect of Staley, that<br />
absolute canister of cynicism in Robb their Federal Secretary and a Federal<br />
Leader in John Howard who just wants to be himself and they won't let him.<br />
He said ' look, I want to do the things I I want to cut wages.' No, no you<br />
can't, no, no, John you can't do that. ' But that Medicare, I want to rip it up'.<br />
And they say ' no, not yet John, not yet, not yet.' He went out there and they<br />
put him in the forest and he said ' I thought we got rid of all of these'. They<br />
have made him into another person and he is unhappy about it. He is waiting<br />
to break out. He is waiting to break out. But when he does, all of their<br />
cynicism about Australia, their belief in other places really, the fact that they<br />
don't have much faith in us they have always seen us as some sort of<br />
derivative place that they can get a quid from, make a buck from, live the<br />
comfortable life from, perched in some good suburb, or on some harbour<br />
foreshore and taking the occasional trips back to the places that they really<br />
have their commitments to.<br />
This is the sort of thing they will try and do and yet we say, look, for years we<br />
have been saying these things: universal health is good, trees are good,<br />
wages are good, the Arbitration Commission is good, the arts are good and<br />
they don't believe us. They don't believe us. </p>
<p>And here he is like Indiana Jones in some exotic place, in places he has<br />
never trod Medicare, industrial relations, forests, the environment<br />
discovering it all for the first time and we are supposed to be grateful, say, we<br />
have humanised them, we are grateful.<br />
I am sure when I came on here today I thought this was the set from<br />
' Future Directions', you remember that thing which was published. But that is<br />
them, isn't it? I mean that is them. In a sense, they define the rest of us by<br />
being around. We don't mind them being around, we only mind them being in<br />
charge. I mean Peter Costello said this when we launched the first ever Cultural<br />
Policy for the country in Creative Nation he said, ' It has got to be' I mean<br />
he is such a berk isn't he ' It has got to be a contradiction in terms, hasn't it?<br />
I mean a Government arts policy. It has got to be a bit of a joke, doesn't it, to<br />
run around and say at a time when everybody says you should be reducing<br />
your expenditure. Here is another $ 250 million, some of it for people who are<br />
quite wealthy or getting these artist grants.'<br />
You see it is so perceptive, isn't it? It is so perceptive. And then, of course,<br />
Mr Downer our little curly headed mate he said when he was the Leader,<br />
when he was a Shadow Arts Minister, ' That a Coalition Government would<br />
have the power to veto Australia Council grants'. Well there we are, cop that<br />
one. And the Council be reduced to an advisory body, advising people like<br />
Alexander Downer and Peter Costello and Tim Fischer and John Howard.<br />
And Howard, back in the 1980s, when he was actually leading the Liberal<br />
Party on that occasion, he then announced plans to abolish the Department<br />
of the Arts, Heritage and the Environment and with it the Australian Film<br />
Commission. I mean they are such a sweet little group, aren't they?<br />
But now he is a convert. He says he is going to agree. He has ticked<br />
Creative Nation, $ 250 million, he will have that. He said he is going to kick in<br />
more money $ 21 million of it actually from that funded by the Government's<br />
Budget last year and these sorts of things.<br />
Well we really know about them and I suppose reciting their form gives us a<br />
bit of fun, but not much joy. But let's recite some of the things, I think, we<br />
have done and tried to do with you and for you.<br />
We have put the Arts into Cabinet and Michael Lee, our Minister, is with us<br />
today. We have also joined it up with the Department of Communications.<br />
So it is Arts and Communications because we know how central this matter is<br />
communications, the growth of communications and how it can never be<br />
untwined from the arts.<br />
We have bolstered the Australia Council and we have extended its brief to<br />
Hillary Macphee and Michael Lynch who are bravely turning it into the<br />
responsive and innovative organisation it should be and, I think, they are<br />
doing well. </p>
<p>We have set up a whole new set of important cultural institutions the<br />
National Academy of Music, the Foundation for Culture and Humanities here<br />
in Melbourne, and there is a lot of money around in this country now a lot of<br />
bread. You can see with that change we are going to make to the tax system<br />
on trusts. I mean how mean-spirited they are, some of these characters.<br />
If they just gave any of that sort of money to the Foundation for Culture and<br />
Humanities, the arts would get a gigantic kick along.<br />
The National Indigenous Performing Arts Academy in Brisbane, the Gallery of<br />
Aboriginal Australia in Canberra, the National Museum of Australia, the<br />
Production Fund in Melbourne for the mini-series and the telemovies, and we<br />
have got some other things to say and I would just like to mention a few of<br />
those. We are setting up an Independent Music Development Corporation to<br />
encourage independent production of contemporary music and develop a<br />
touring circuit for bands. Now we should do this.<br />
We are investing another $ 12.8 million in new regional cultural facilities, or in<br />
the refurbishment of existing buildings and we will establish a series of<br />
fellowships for outstanding regional arts groups, or companies, and provide<br />
funding to promote regional artists and bring them into the national audience.<br />
We will extend copyright protection for artists working to life, plus 70 years.<br />
So it is life, plus 70 years. We will set up an Australian Copyright Office and<br />
implement arrangements for performers copyright and indigenous copyright.<br />
And here in Melbourne beyond the changes we have made already with the<br />
Production Fund and the National Academy of Music on the site of<br />
Essendon Airport, we will establish a National Film and Multimedia Centre, a<br />
world-class precinct comprising film, television and multimedia development<br />
studios; contemporary music video production facilities; operating officers for<br />
local and international writers and publisher, creators and producers; and<br />
laboratories and support facilities.<br />
Now this is a mighty site that has been reserved to us by just the<br />
development of airports in this city. It is about 340 hectares and it is<br />
kilometres from the city and it offers a great opportunity and I am very<br />
pleased to announce today that Mr Jack Smorgon has agreed to Chair the<br />
new Essendon Centre Development Authority which will oversee the<br />
development. We are giving $ 4 million to establish a Youth Programming Unit in the ABC in<br />
Melbourne. We will provide another $ 1.6 million through the Australia<br />
Council to establish a National Theatre of Cultural Diversity in Melbourne.<br />
And we are going to build a home for the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra in<br />
Hobart. </p>
<p>And as we have been one of the prime movers in establishing APEC, which is<br />
now the primary piece of political architecture in the Asia-Pacific, we are<br />
going to invite the 17 other members of APEC to participate in an inaugural<br />
festival of the Asia-Pacific in Brisbane in 1997.<br />
I think these things will tend to round out what we have been doing, what we<br />
have been able to accomplish, and we will of course be, as implied they are<br />
not only maintaining our financial commitments to the arts in general, but<br />
improving them.<br />
But I am very pleased about those initiatives and especially with the last one,<br />
inviting the APEC countries to come here because that gets back to the point<br />
we have got a gilt edged invitation and we will be, I think, carried along by<br />
the excitement and the growth of this region. And the opportunities we will<br />
have to enjoy their culture and they ours because we have got so much to<br />
give and we want to show people what we have got to give and as we have<br />
been pretty much the architects of this, we can be the architects of an<br />
international cultural festival of this kind and, I think, this is going to be<br />
important to us.<br />
Could I just say that, you know, the dear old French we have been fighting<br />
them for years over various things. But we do some good things with them<br />
too. They have been letting off nuclear weapons in the Pacific for years and<br />
we set up the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty and they are now<br />
going to sign it.<br />
We have been arguing with them about agriculture in Europe, in the<br />
Uruguay Round, for years and we basically had a victory over them there.<br />
But they are capable of some very good things as we all know. In fact, some<br />
of us rather like them. And a couple have come to my mind. One is, that<br />
when Michel Rocard first became Prime Minister, it was really a funny day.<br />
Don Russell and I Don is with me today, you can't miss him when he comes<br />
into a crowd Don and I were in Paris and we had this appointment to see<br />
Michel Rocard. He had been Prime Minister for six weeks, no Australian<br />
Minister had met a French Premier for, I think, ten or twelve years to this<br />
point.<br />
And I said to Don, we have got an hour and a half and we may as well knock<br />
over the shops around the Rue de Bac and those places. And I dragged Don<br />
in and out of all these places and I said we have got a quarter of an hour to<br />
get there, we had better go.<br />
We got in the car and we are heading for the Hotel Matignon and down the<br />
street, I can't recall its name now, the Rue de Lauren I think it is, there was a<br />
traffic jam and the time was passing, and the appointed time had arrived and<br />
I said, we are going to have to hot-foot-it. So out of the car we got, down the<br />
street we got, and we walked in the gate of the Hotel Matignon and the guard<br />
said, ' No, no, you can't pass. Who are you?' I said, well I am the Australian<br />
Finance Minister and this is my Adviser and after some trouble we got past<br />
them to a waiting Michel Rocard at the door and we sat down and we talked </p>
<p>about the Matignon Accords in French Polynesia and then he said to me,<br />
' You know, the President and I want to do something for the bicentenary of<br />
the Revolution next year.' And he said, ' We thought about setting up an<br />
environmental protection agency, an international one.' And I said, well that<br />
is a noble idea, Michel, but you and I will be very old people before that ever<br />
happens. And he said, ' Well you are a fraternal party, what about thinking of something<br />
we can do together'. And I said, well I have got an idea for you, but I am in a<br />
minority of two in my Cabinet and that is to turn Antarctica into a wilderness<br />
park. And five days later they, the French, were to sign after ten years of<br />
negotiation, the Minerals Convention in Antarctica, which would have seen all<br />
the big powers ripping it apart, mining for oil, looking for minerals, and we<br />
stopped them and we signed it as it turned out and we put Antarctica away for<br />
years until we understand more about it. That is one good thing we did<br />
with them.<br />
The other good thing is at the end of this acrimonious Uruguay Round when<br />
our friends, the Americans, put the weights on us from Hollywood, we joined<br />
with the French in refusing the Americans their wish on audio visual. And<br />
having, sort of, thrown off the colonial culture that pervaded so much of the<br />
arts in Australia for so much of our history, having succeeded in that, we were<br />
not to have then laid upon us the culture of the United States, or worse<br />
simply caught up in the global homogenisation of culture. And that is a threat<br />
to us, it is a real threat to us. But you won't meet the threat by shying away<br />
from it, you will only join it by meeting it.<br />
And really, I suppose, in many respects, this is what we are doing. We know<br />
it is coming. But with all of these countries around us, in APEC, in the<br />
Pacific, in Asia, they want their cultures too and we have got in APEC half the<br />
world's population, over half the world's population and 60 per cent of the<br />
world's GDP. And that means we can, basically, keep our cultural freedom if<br />
we are good at it, if we are quick enough. And if we are committed enough to<br />
the things we believe our culture, about the unique quality of it, about its<br />
peculiarly Australian characteristics and how important that is to us as a<br />
country. So many of these institutions that I am speaking of today and the ones we<br />
have created and the ones we are using well already, and whether it is a<br />
celebration of our pigs, or our dance, or whatever it might be, it is ours and<br />
we are out there and we are going to keep it. It is important that we put,<br />
indelibly, our own stamp on the arts and that they are ours and when people<br />
see them they know they represent this unique nation, this country<br />
Australia. Now I have talked for too long, but I want to finish on these points. Never has<br />
there been a time when it has been more important to have belief in<br />
ourselves, to have faith in who we are and what we have created here. And<br />
to be contemplating now, looking back, or trying to embrace a group that do<br />
not want to celebrate it, don't quite understand what it is, and for the </p>
<p>opportunity of the greatest economic phenomenon in history, to say as they<br />
are saying now they don't want to be in it. They really say, we are obsessed<br />
with Asia. ' The Government is obsessive', says Downer about Asia.<br />
They are saying, they want to make relationships stronger with our Western<br />
allies, meaning they really want the drive down Whitehall again and they<br />
want the limo on Pennsylvania Avenue. And we have all done that and that<br />
has its particular joys for the moment. In fact, when Hawkey went around to<br />
see Reagan in a big black limo, I told him it would have been easier to go in a<br />
Yellow Cab and he said, ' That is the thing about you, you have got no<br />
understanding of protocol.'<br />
But, at any rate, this is where our conservative colleagues want to be and we<br />
like these countries, we have cultural affinities with them, we will always keep<br />
them. But our future is here, our future is in this part of the world, and our<br />
heritage is this great old place, and we will only really succeed if we celebrate<br />
it in a way which reflects upon the creativity and the democracy and the<br />
intellectual freedom we have created here and take it and transport it into the<br />
countries around us where it will be received with great joy.<br />
This is really the role of the arts in this country, the defining role and this is<br />
what we are really here celebrating today. Not just 13 years of support by the<br />
Labor Party, but the fact that the Labor Party understands this and that you<br />
understand it and that, together, we are all part of it. Thank you for today.<br />
ends </p>
