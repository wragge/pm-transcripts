TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
AND THE MINISTER FOR EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING,<br />
THE HON KIM BEAZLEY, MP, JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 15 DECEMBER, 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PMV: Well, today I have received the report of the Committee on<br />
Employment Opportunities. This is the first such report of its-kind which any<br />
Government has commissioned since the Second World War. And the<br />
Government established a committee this year requiring it to look at the<br />
causes of Australia's unemployment and the policy options for the future.<br />
I think the first thing to understand is that this is not a Government report. It<br />
is a report to the Government and to the Australian community. And on a<br />
matter such as this, a matter which has had such public discussion in the last<br />
couple of years, last year in particular, there needs to be further public<br />
discussion on how best to remedy the problem as a basis for such a<br />
discussion. And that must occur between now and the deliverery of a white<br />
paper on the subject early next year.<br />
During this process of discussion I think it would help us all to reflect on the<br />
fact that the pros and cons most of us, business people, lobby groups, those<br />
who understand the issue, politicians, will all do that from the comfort station<br />
of having a job. -In other words to -be effective the -process -will require all<br />
Australians to imagine what it is like to be out of work. Now, this was a major<br />
issue in 1992, it was a major issue in the election campaign, and there seems<br />
to me to have been a fairly strong consensus in Australia that high levels of<br />
unemployment and particularly long term unemployment are unacceptable to<br />
us. Unemployment is a problem because it makes the economy inefficient, but<br />
principally of course, it is against our Ideals, egalitarian ideals, of an<br />
opportunity of work for people, it has a devastating effect on individuals and<br />
their families, it debilitates social cohesion, it increases the cost of welfare,<br />
and hence the burden of taxation, it limits the scope of public expenditure on<br />
other things, Including reducing our public debt. And it Is our greatest<br />
contemporary problem. </p>
<p>TEL: 12. Jan. 94 12: 30 No. 006 P. 11<br />
2<br />
Now, the report makes these issues fundamentally clear. It says there's no<br />
single simple solution to unemployment, no single solution, but without<br />
question an essential condition Of success in the fight is a high unsustainable<br />
rate Of economic growth. Now, we have got substantial reason for<br />
confidence, that we can grow the economy at some speed. At the moment<br />
we are growing at around 3.5 per cent, which Compares favourably with our<br />
OECD counterparts, and as you know we have got interest rates low, we<br />
have got inflation low, we have got a high profit share in the economy, and we<br />
are more competitive than we have been in our living memory. So, there is<br />
every reason that we can see Investment pick up and growth continue. The<br />
report makes clear that more change is needed, that we will need to keep up<br />
all the issues of our competitiveness to keep that growth going.<br />
Now, the Government is of the view that we can restore full employment and<br />
that we should be bearing down on unemployment. But the report says we<br />
can only do this provided the Government and all sections of the community<br />
are prepared to develop a new and stronger sense of national purpose and a<br />
consensus that the goal is worth pursuing.<br />
Now, the report details what we are spending now on labour m arket<br />
programs. It talks about the long term unemployed, it makes clear that at the<br />
end of the employment boom there was still 100,000 people unemployed for<br />
12 months or more, and that that equivalent group is now 340,000 people, the<br />
number of long term unemployed has risen. And that the report makes clear<br />
that this has a severe social implications and is a severe impediment to<br />
labour market efficiency, and I think this should be underlined and<br />
understood. It is a severe impediment to labour market efficiency.<br />
So, it Is a most important report, not just for the Government, and not just for<br />
the unemployed, but for the community as a whole. We have not had a thing<br />
like this produced in the past. It raises questions which are fundamental to<br />
the kind of society we have and have had. And I think reminds us of the<br />
issues which need to be addressed in keeping a cohesive society together of<br />
the kind we have had.<br />
So, I do urge all Australians to recognise unemployment is their concern, and<br />
to make full employment their goal, and with that kind of national consensus a<br />
discussion around this paper and the white paper which will follow, I think,<br />
can take us materially down the path of bearing down on unemployment and<br />
attaining that goal of full employment.<br />
Now, before I invite questions I will invite my colleague, Kim Beazley, to<br />
address you with any remarks on the topic from the report that he thinks are<br />
appropriate. KB: If I could just add to underline one of the things that you said, Prime<br />
Minister, and that is this, this is not a work creation sche -me that has been<br />
handed to the Government. It is not about a number of full time jobs being </p>
<p>T1E2L:. Jan. 9412: 30 NO. 006 P. 12<br />
3<br />
created. What it is about is putting the unemployed in a position where they<br />
can be job ready and employable.<br />
It is about ensuring a situation does not develop, which~ unattended will, and<br />
that is by the end of this decade we have still got, no matter what levels of<br />
growth we achieve, around about 7 or 8 per cent unemployed, half of whom<br />
are long term unemployed. Well, the committee points out that if this is<br />
implemented or something like It those numbers will be trending down to<br />
about 5 per cent, with only about I per cent of them long term unemployed.<br />
Long term unemployed left to themselves will stay at about 300,00, picked up<br />
here will go down to 90. So, it is also about growth, efficient labour market is<br />
critical to growth, if we are experiencing bottle necks as we are starting to, I<br />
must say, in Western Australia at 9 per cent levels of unemployment, if we<br />
are starting to experience bottle necks at 7 or 8 per cent unemployment we<br />
will then get inflationary pressures which will damage growth and we are<br />
going to find in subsequent recessions a plateauing of unemployment at<br />
higher and higher levels.<br />
It Is not an acceptable outcome to the Government, it is obviously not<br />
acceptable to the taskforce, and that is the very heart of their<br />
recommendations. J: Prime Minister, the report says that funding -the jobs compact will<br />
require either a reordering of current priorities in the budget or the<br />
raising of revenue. Which is your preferred option?<br />
PM: Well, I don't have preferred options at this stage, it is a matter of<br />
considering what we think we may do from the report and then seeing<br />
where that fits within our priorities, and making judgements about<br />
them. The Commonwealth budget is now over $ 100 billion in size,<br />
there is always a degree of discretion on the part of the Government<br />
about how that $ 100 odd billion ought to be spent, and indeed about<br />
how it is raised. And I think the core matters here are, do we believe<br />
that unemployment should be addressed, and particularly long term<br />
unemployment? If we believe that, how do we most efficiently address<br />
that problem? . And-with what. programs, arnd at what cost, and then<br />
when we get the answers to those questions, we then decide how we<br />
fund it, and not the reverse.<br />
J: Do you think the challenge is sufficient though, or great enough to<br />
warrant thinking about the bottom line, to think about whether or not<br />
you should increase the deficit?<br />
PM: Well, I think the press have got a fascination this week for how this<br />
thing is funded rather than what it is. I mean, this is a very novel<br />
report, and it is one, as Kim has said, which focuses on this question of<br />
the efficiency of the labour market and the long term unemployed.<br />
Now, what the ' 80s showed was despite the fact that we had strong<br />
aggregate employment growth, and we got unemployment down, or be<br />
TEL: </p>
<p>TEL: 4<br />
it In the face of a very high participation rate and a very big lift in<br />
participation, we did not succeed in changing by a large measure that<br />
character of the long term unemployed. It took us a long time to get it<br />
down. Now, that group has now trebled, and that poses problems of<br />
efficiency in the labour market, which the economy shouldn't need to<br />
bear, as Kim said, I mean it is just unacceptable to be thinking about<br />
bottle necks with unemployment of 9 per cent in Western Australia as<br />
an example he gave. So, therefore it is a matter of looking at the<br />
programs and thinking about the problems and how the social security<br />
system should be set up and us making, as we have in the ' 80s on<br />
many issues, another quantum leap in the way the Australian society<br />
functions. And we have done it in health, we have done it in<br />
education, and we have done so much of it in social security with<br />
income support, and we are prone to be doing it again here. I think<br />
that is the story, the story is not how it is to be funded.<br />
J: Prime Minister does the Government's four year deficit reduction<br />
strategy remain intact?<br />
PM; Well you are asking me just another way of putting the same question.<br />
I Before this report was released you said that you were hoping for<br />
some radical and innovative ideas to combat unemployment. Has it<br />
matched your expectations or are there things that you think haven't<br />
been touched on in this report?<br />
PM: I think it is a comprehensive examination of the problem. The problem<br />
Is that a category of people, a large block of Australians, group of<br />
Australians, the long term unemployed would be otherwise<br />
marginalised or sidelined other than in the event that we get them back<br />
into the main stream labour market or to use Kim's expression ' Job<br />
ready". What has happened in countries like Britain for instance, is that<br />
despite the fact of quite a large pool of unemployment, wages growth<br />
continued to move along quite strongly and you would say well, how<br />
does this happen when there Is quite a pool of unemployment? It has<br />
happened because they were marginalised. These people were no<br />
longer part of the employment equation and what happened is the new<br />
entrants to the British labour market were people who came from<br />
school or from universities et cetera or from migration. They did not<br />
come from the pool of long-term unemployed. That is a terrible<br />
efficiency drain on the country, it is a story of multiple personal<br />
tragedies and the despair which comes from the long-term unemployed<br />
and we can, I think, take the opportunity to address that problem. So,<br />
that is what the report is looking at that is, how do we move towards<br />
. I mean do we mean it when we say we believe in the goal of full<br />
employment, or do we take the view which says if you were part of the<br />
adjustment process and you got adjusted out, you are unemployed,<br />

<p>TEL: 12. Jan. 94 12: 30 No. 006 P. 14<br />
bad luck for you, the rest of us are now back on the gravy train and we<br />
are moving on. And now it has pulled out of the station, it has got a<br />
head of steam up again, we are just seeing you disappear into the<br />
landscape, forgetting about you.<br />
The report goes to address those issues.<br />
J: Prime Minister, the employers argue that a more flexible labour market<br />
would create 200,000 new jobs without the necessity of having to look<br />
so closely at the bottom line, you know offer jobs levy or increased<br />
deficit or whatever.<br />
PM; Yes, that on the balance of assessments of whether one looks at the<br />
long-term unemployed or has a reduction in nominal wages it is the<br />
former rather than the latter which is the preferable choice. Because<br />
why should the whole community have a reduction in purchasing<br />
power and earnings to try and induce some more employment, but<br />
even if it does it will not go to these people. That is the key point<br />
even if it did, it doesn't go to these people. It will reduce the aggregate<br />
pool of unemployment, but it will not pick these people up and why<br />
would we do it when the profit share Is already at the late ' 80s levels<br />
beyond any historical experience we have had at that point. What are<br />
we saying are employer groups saying to us-we want a profit share<br />
not only above the late ' 80s experience, but that is way beyond any<br />
historical experience. The whole point of economic policy and<br />
economic growth is economic growth and economic wealth and that<br />
means over time, higher real incomes not lower real incomes. Our<br />
objectives should be higher real incomes not lower real incomes.<br />
J: see your responses to this report it seems to set out some fairly<br />
clear goals for policy, that is faster economic growth and a target of at<br />
least 5 per cent unemployment, that Is drop to 5 per cent<br />
unemployment by the Year 2000. Would you embrace those goals or<br />
would you actually be aiming for a better unemployment outcome by<br />
the turn of the century?<br />
PM:-There is a set of charts in here I think, a couple of bar charts, and what<br />
one shows is that in the ' 82-3 to ' 89-90 period, we experienced GDP<br />
growth on average of 4.3 per cent. What the report argues is that to<br />
reduce unemployment down to around 5 per cent by the Year 2000<br />
instead of 7 per cent we would need to be running at about 4.8 instead<br />
of 4.3. This doesn't seem to be outside the realms of possibility, but it<br />
Is something which the report is proposing. It Is not something which it<br />
is urging the Government to make as a target which is the word you<br />
used. Rather it is, has the changes of the ' 80s, the new business<br />
culture, the more competitive culture, the enterprise flexibility, after we<br />
move through the aggregate reduction in wages versus profits and now<br />
the leavening and flexibility which enterprise bargaining is giving and<br />
which the new federal award variations provisions of legislation carried </p>
<p>TEL:. 12. Jan. 94 12: 30 No. 006<br />
last night gives as these things come through, as businesses are now<br />
more productivity conscious and they are running companies more<br />
flexibly, as the labour market is now far more flexible, in the running of<br />
rates of growth in the 4.5 -5 per cent area would ' we be able to restrain<br />
prices and imports.<br />
In other words, is there enough productivity growth and enough<br />
Investment to keep it there? I should hope there is because if there<br />
isn't it just means we are going to end up with a pool of unemployment<br />
higher for longer and It will mean the gap between the wealth of this<br />
country and the wealth of the countries in our region will get greater as<br />
their growth rates easily exceed ours.<br />
J: The Hawke Government In 1983 set a goal for how many jobs it would<br />
like to see created over its first term. I suppose I'm wondering whether<br />
YOU Would like to once you have considered this report, and the<br />
appropriate responses to it also set a similar jobs target?<br />
PM: We put half a million up in the ' On e Nation' package.<br />
J: It hasn't moved on since then as this report shows..<br />
PM: That and we have also in terms of the discussions we had with the<br />
ACTU we talked about reaching the target of 500,000 jobs I think from<br />
memory, over three years beyond which, that Is, we had to reach there<br />
before we had a chance In the wages policy in that document. Now at<br />
the time there was some misgivings on the part of some commentators<br />
about the prospects of getting there. I think the Treasury Is now<br />
talking about 180,000 jobs for this year which means that 500,000<br />
does look attainable as indeed it was In the ' 83-4 rebound where we<br />
had 500,000 in the first Parliament. In the first Parliament, three years,<br />
we got the 720,000 from memory or 740,000 it might have been.<br />
J: What about the long-term unemployed though?<br />
PM: What about them though?<br />
J: Giving that you are identifying them as a particular group that needs to<br />
be targeted. These figures In the report talk about trying to get the<br />
number down from 290,000 to 90,000. Would you be prepared to<br />
embrace that sort of goal policy?<br />
PM: If we embrace the thrust of the report, if in the analysis, discussion,<br />
public discussion, white paper discussion the Government picks up the<br />
central thrust of this report, hopefully the central thrust of the<br />
conclusions will also be available to us, but there is never a great profit<br />
in Governments setting targets for themselves because people like you<br />
never stop reminding us when we don't meet them. </p>
<p>TEL: 12. Jan. 94 12: 30 No. 006 P. 16<br />
7<br />
J. Prime Minister, on that score what do you make of the Committee's<br />
observation that after four years and the expenditure of something like<br />
$ 1.4-I1.5 billion a year, the best you could do in -terms of permanent,<br />
ongoing jobs for the long-term unemployed is about 50,000. Isn't that<br />
a bit disappointing?<br />
PM: No, not at all. I think there Jim ( Middleton) you have missed the point<br />
of the plot. This is not a job creation thing. It is a labour market<br />
efficiency flexibility thing, it Is principally a social thing. It is a social<br />
thing and it is a labour market flexibility thing, it is a jobs ready thing.<br />
Now, if in the payment of subsidies like Jobstart and the rest you end<br />
up with some additionality in the labour market, in other words jobs that<br />
might not have otherwise been there, which is where your 50,000 is,<br />
good. But they are a by-product. They are not the central proposal.<br />
The central proposal is not job creation, it is about being job ready and<br />
to get the efficiencies of the labour market up.<br />
J: But job ready with no jobs.<br />
PM: No, but the aggregate jobs will be there, it is a matter of getting the<br />
long-term unemployed people to take some of them.<br />
KB: I think the point that has to be made here is if you are not job ready,<br />
in other words, if the labour market is effectively churning and it is only<br />
growth in the end which brings down those total numbers, Ntfh e labour<br />
market is not churning you are getting enormous health problems<br />
coming on stream, enormous social problems coming on stream,<br />
enormous additional expenditures that you might not necessarily have<br />
needed to make otherwise for people on unemployment benefits<br />
because the level is too high and terrible social dislocation. It is a hell<br />
of a lot better to be out of work for six months than forever and in terms<br />
of all the social impacts on you and that is essentially what the<br />
committee here is arguing.<br />
J: Are you as agnostic and open minded about a jobs levy as the Prime<br />
Minister?<br />
KB: I'm always agnostic about things that I'm going to discuss with my<br />
Cabinet colleagues as far as public presentation is concerned. There<br />
are a lot of propositions presented here by the Committee. I think the<br />
surprised tone I get from some of the people I've had a chance to talk<br />
to is that the jobs levy is not such a huge focus of this report when it is<br />
actually taken on balance, it simply happens to be one funding<br />
mechanism which we will bat about and some of us are more or less<br />
agnostic on this, but there are at this stage no atheists or Christians.<br />
