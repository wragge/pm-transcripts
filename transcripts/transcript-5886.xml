IUSTR 4(, L, 1,<br />
PRIMBE MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA MONDAY,-9 AUGUST 1982<br />
LEBANON<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, made the following statement<br />
today on the situation in Lebanon:<br />
" The continued fighiting and destruction in Beirut, costing the<br />
lives and destroying the livelihood of innocent and powerless<br />
Lebanese citizens, is of the gravest concern to the Australian<br />
Government and people.<br />
Australia has always been deeply conscious of the age-long<br />
suffering of the Jewish people and their right to a homeland.<br />
Australia has always supported, and of course continues to support,<br />
Isreal's -fight to exist as a state within secure and<br />
recognised boundaries.<br />
Australia does understand Israel's concern at the repeated terrorist<br />
attacks and the threats made by the PLO. We deplore terrorism<br />
of all kinds.<br />
We deplore the unwillingness of the PLO to recognise the<br />
right of Israel to exist, and its unwillingness to negotiate<br />
sensibly in the cause of a lasting peace.<br />
However, despite the provocations Israel has received, its present actions<br />
in persisting with the use of its formidable military strength in<br />
Beirut, long after achieving its initially declared objective, are<br />
short sighted and foolish.<br />
Lebanon has been caught up in a quarrel of which it has wanted no<br />
part. The PLO forces came to Lebanon to use it as a sanctuary for<br />
attacks on Israel, particularly-its northern settlements. Israel<br />
has responded by actions which have resulted in the destruction of the<br />
Lebanese capital and of significant parts--of the country, and<br />
have caused immense misery to the Lebanese people.<br />
By the continuation of its present actions Israel is serving its<br />
own intesests and the interests of the region very badly indeed.<br />
There can be no solution to this problem by destruction, by ' killing,<br />
by war. Ultimately there has to be a political solution which allows<br />
people to live out their lives. The belief that military victory<br />
alone can achieve solutions-is making it difficult for Israel's<br />
traditional friends to sustain their support-.<br />
There are over two million Palestinians in the Middle East who<br />
have no homeland. Of these many are not accepted as full<br />
citizens by any country in the region. This represents a condenriatic<br />
of all countries in the region and outside it which have allowed<br />
this situation.. to continue for over 30 years. </p>
<p>7/ -3-<br />
The Foreign Minister and I will also seek to discuss wnith the Jewish<br />
community in Australia the Government's concerns. We will seekl to<br />
explain in detail why this statement of policy has been issued,<br />
and we will elicit their support for policies on Israel's part that<br />
are conducive to lasting peace. We will appeal to Jewish communities<br />
around the world to take note of a voice that has been raised in<br />
friendship and support of Israel in a way which has been unequalled<br />
and unchallengeable.<br />
If an Australian Government which has supported Israel so staunchly<br />
believes there needs to be as comprehensive a change in Israel's<br />
mind and approach as is called for in this statement, that surely<br />
is warning enough that world opinion can no longer be Ignored,<br />
and that the very survival of Israel itself may be dependent upon<br />
everyone involved bending their minds and their energies and their<br />
opinions to the search for a lasting peaceful solution.<br />
This will require a corresponding readiness on the part of the PLO<br />
to accept the reality of the state of Israel and to make it possible<br />
for the Lebanese people to regain effective control in their own<br />
country. All those able to bring influence to bear on the PLO to act<br />
in this direction should do so.<br />
Australia does not pretend to have the details of a solution. That<br />
is not for us to propose. We are not party principals to this<br />
dispute. We are not a country with major influence. But we are<br />
concerned, and our support for Israel in the past gives us not only<br />
the right but the responsibility to speak our mind bluntly and<br />
honestly." ( Canberra) </p>
