4IjjA USTYA Li<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS JULY 7, 1976<br />
NATIONAL PRESS CLUB<br />
In-July last year, I addressed the National Press Club.<br />
In that speech I put the view that Australia desperately needed<br />
a new direction in Government policy. The Liberal Party was<br />
' deeply concerned at what was happening to Australia. What<br />
Australia could become was being squandered by incompetence,<br />
inefficiency, and an entirely inappropriate philosophy of<br />
Government. Any country, but especially a small nation like Australia, needs<br />
special qualities to advance and prosper in the kind of world<br />
we live in. It must be a major function of Government policy to<br />
encourage those qualities.<br />
We need to encourage a clear-sighted recognition of" facts as<br />
they are at home and abroad facts which are often unwelcome and<br />
difficult to face. We must not pretend that there is an easy<br />
road t. o security and a better life.<br />
We need to encourage people to achieve the best of which they are<br />
capable'and ensure that they retain the means to express their<br />
talents. We must avoid at all costs forcing people into a mould<br />
of bureaucratically regulated conformity.<br />
We need to encourage imagination and enterprise, not destroy<br />
incentives-and make everyone dependent on the State. Unless we<br />
encourage these qualities everyone will be the poorer and we will<br />
be less able to help ~ effectively those who are in real need of<br />
assistance. To make a start to set a new course for Australia in the last<br />
election, we presented a far ranging programmIe of responsible<br />
Liberal reform to the Australian people.<br />
The principal objectives of this programme can be summarised<br />
briefly.' They were:<br />
* to rein in the rapidly increasing Government spending<br />
and free desperately needed resources to individuals and<br />
business enterprise.<br />
* to provide incentives to investment and job creation. / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
* to begin an effective decentralisation of Government<br />
decision-making through the most radical reforms to the<br />
Federal system since Federation.<br />
* to institute firm protection for individuals against<br />
growing unlegislated claims on their earnings.<br />
* to help those families who had been hurt most by the<br />
Government fueled inflation and other policies of the<br />
* previous three years.-<br />
to expand the protection for individual rights against<br />
an increasingly powerful and intrusive state.<br />
* replace an approach which set one section of the ' Community<br />
against another with one which emphasised consultation<br />
and co-operation in the solution of problems which concerned<br />
*-all Au~ tralians. r<br />
* And finally," of course, to institute-sound and responsible<br />
management of Australia's affairs.<br />
All of these objectives have found expression in specific policy<br />
initiatives many of them path breaking reforms which set a new<br />
course for Australian public policy.<br />
Many people it seems try to fit this Government into some mental<br />
image they carry with them of what they-think is a standard<br />
conservative Government.<br />
The achievements of the first six months of this Governmen t -and<br />
the course we have set should give the lie to that image.<br />
The challenges Australia now faces demand a positive and constructive<br />
thrust-* in policy.<br />
The times are such that a Government must be prepared actively to<br />
seek solutions at times radical solutions in the best sense of<br />
the word'-to the difficult problems we face. We cannot simply hope<br />
that they will go away by themselves.<br />
If we are to advance freedom and concern at home, and security<br />
abroad, we must look otir problems-in the fLace as a nation and<br />
determine to overcome them.<br />
Solving our economic problems is not just a job for the Governiment.<br />
The Government can play a part and has played a part, not only<br />
by reining in its own expenditure by providing incentives to<br />
enterprise, and by pursuing responsible monetary policies, but<br />
also by speaking out responsibly on such issues as the<br />
relationship between excessive wage increases and inflation.<br />
The Government's whole strategy is based on fostering a climate<br />
of national responsibility in which all people will act in a<br />
spirit of national responsibility and recognise their over-riding<br />
common interests in reducing inflation and unemployment. 13 </p>
<p>Taking a stand on the full passing on of C. P. I. increases was, I<br />
believe, essential to the moderation in wage increases which has<br />
taken place.<br />
Full tax indexation and protection for wage earners with large<br />
families near the minimum income have long concerned the trade<br />
union movement.<br />
The stand which the Government has taken on these issues was a<br />
major element in the context in which the Arbitration Court made<br />
-its last decision. This decision improves Australia's capacity<br />
to control inflation. I would also like to givecredit to<br />
Mr Hawke and the'union movement for the stand they took yesterday<br />
in relation to wage restraint.<br />
We said that tax indexation would be introduced over'three years*.<br />
But-due to the economies the Government has made, tax indexation<br />
has already been introduced.<br />
Tax indexation will stop the erosion of-eal wages due to inflation<br />
caused tax increases. It will bring long term benefits as it<br />
is an ongoing commitment. It will make Governments accountable<br />
if they feel strongly about the need to expand functions,<br />
prograrnmes, they will have to legislate for tax increases.<br />
It should contribute to breaking the inflation ary spiral by<br />
making possible wage restraint.<br />
The family allowance scheme has been hailed as the major reform<br />
in the Australian social welfare system since Federation.<br />
It ' removes inequities in past schemes of assistance to families.<br />
It also benefits 300,000 families and 800,000 children many<br />
of whom are below the poverty line the majority of whom did<br />
not benefit from the system of taxation rebates for children.<br />
The only drawback to the scheme was the effect it had on the<br />
self images of some members of the self-styled " party of social<br />
reform." Our federalism reforms are returning power and responsibility to<br />
the States. They will ensure that the States have access to a<br />
flexible and expanding source of revenue and give local government<br />
an assured source of revenue.<br />
Despite the ritualistic complaints of some State Premiers about<br />
the Commonwealth not giving them enough money, the States in<br />
important areas got 16.4%~ more money from the Commonwealth this<br />
year. I believe that most States have reason to be satisfied with the<br />
monies they received. Certainly only those Premiers who(-have<br />
promised more than they responsibily could, have in the , sensegrounds<br />
for complaint.<br />
The reforms to the federal system will make a significant<br />
contribution to the maintenance and expansion of the citizens<br />
ability to influence the decisions that affect his life.<br />
Only if Governments are responsible will they be truly responsive<br />
to their citizens. </p>
<p>The Government believes that there are many features of Australian<br />
society which need reform.<br />
The Government reciognises that some problems need the expenditure<br />
of money. But unwise, unrestricted expenditures exacerbate many<br />
of the problems they seek to solve as Professor Henderson has<br />
so ably pointed out.<br />
One of the Government's major objectives is to create institutions<br />
which are responsible to individual needs, which will not stifle<br />
but foster and develop individual initiative and creativity.<br />
The Government is moving to increase-the effectiveness of<br />
Parliament by establishing a Committee of the House,-of<br />
Representatives to review expenditure. At times that may be<br />
uncomfortable for governments. At times it may be Uncomfortable<br />
for premiers but it is a role Government must fulfil. The<br />
Go-vernmenit has introduced legislation for the establishment<br />
of a Federal Ombudsman into the Parliament. The Government<br />
is . committed to legislate for the protection of privacy.<br />
The Government will act to ensure that citizens have adequate<br />
frigh ' ts to appeal and recourse with respect to the decisions<br />
of Government officers by bringing the Administrative<br />
Appeals Tribimn4-Act into operation in the very near future.<br />
The Government has introduced legislation to secure land rights<br />
for Aboriginals.<br />
I have asked for a report on access to information which will lead<br />
to legislation.<br />
The Government has extensively con sulted with groups concerned<br />
with Government decisions. This is one of the hallmarks of our<br />
approach.<br />
We have for instance had unprecedented wide-ranging discussions<br />
with both unions and business on the current state of the economy.<br />
Unions and business have in turn given the Government their<br />
perceptions of the problems and their solution.<br />
There has been extensive consultation with the trade unions over<br />
the P. J. T. secret ballots for unions and Nedibank.<br />
The Government has modified its position on a number of matters<br />
to take into account the perspectives and concerns of the trade<br />
union movement and of other people.<br />
Dogmatism and an unwillingness to move from fixed positions<br />
has as its consequence bad government and decisions which may not<br />
be entirely appropriate for the circumstances.<br />
Only if a government is willing to consult fully and widely, and<br />
accept reasonable advice can decisions emerge which are in the<br />
best interests of the Australian people.<br />
But a lack of dogmatism, a capacity to be flexible in order to<br />
achieve the best result is not expediency. Taking all factors<br />
into account in the interests of Australia is good Government.<br />
Being undogmatic is not only a necessity for Government but for<br />
powerful groups in the community. </p>
<p>These groups must recognise that the Government elected by the<br />
Australian people is the Government. The Government will not<br />
accept the viewpoints-of powerful pressure groups if these<br />
viewpoints are unreasonable.<br />
There can be no compromise on the best interests of the Australian<br />
people. This is what is at issue in Medibank,<br />
In the election the Government gave a commitment that Medibank<br />
would be maintained and improved. That commitment stands<br />
absolutely.<br />
Our proposals will improve Medibank. Everyone will be included in<br />
comprehensive and high quality medical and health care. Medical<br />
and health cover for all Australians will remain compulsory. Those<br />
on lowest income will make no payment under-the Medibank arrangement.<br />
They are fully protected and fully covered. Medibank cover<br />
includes bulk billing for medical costs. and high quality standard<br />
ward treatment as under the Labor scheme.<br />
Medibank offers and will offer the lowest cost quality health care<br />
for-all Australians. To this point there is no difference in<br />
what we propose and what Labor has enacted. ' This system however,<br />
is certainly capable of improvement and this is the objective of our<br />
proposals.<br />
Medibank was and is a new expensive benefit. Because we want to avoid<br />
the recognised abuse of the U. K. scheme it must not only be paid for<br />
but in our view be seen to be paid for, in a way that will prevent<br />
abuse, gain the willing co-operation of all providers of health<br />
care and counter increasingly rising costs.<br />
That is what we are doing. The the A. C. T. U. agree that<br />
Medibank must be paid for. They have agreed that a special tax<br />
or levy is required. The A. L. P. originally proposed a ceiling on<br />
their levy just as we propose one now.<br />
The difference with the A. C. T. U. is not whether or not Medibank<br />
should be paid for, but how-it should be paid for.<br />
Unlike the Government and the they want a levy with no<br />
ceiling. Contrary to the considered judgement of the two Governments<br />
they are attempting to force an utterly undesirable system on the<br />
Australian people. Their proposal would do nothing for the<br />
lowest income families who pay nothing in any case.<br />
It would damage a large section of two-income families who would<br />
pay twice. With no ceiling many people and many two income<br />
families would pay more than Medibank costs. Because this is<br />
a specific payment for a particular service, we do not believe<br />
that people should pay more than the cost.<br />
Very many of the A. C. T. U.' s own constituents and members would<br />
pay more under the A. C. T. U.' s proposal than under ours. / 6 </p>
<p>Our proposal provides choice. As a result of our very significant<br />
modifications, lMedibank will now offer private insurance in<br />
competition with health funds for intermediate and private ward<br />
treatment.. This will enable you to have your own doctor in<br />
hospital. It will also keep costs down. It will provide more<br />
choice for the 70% of people now covered for intermediate<br />
and private ward treatment.<br />
The ACTU also proposed that Medibank offer intermediate and<br />
private ward cover for an additional charge, but they would not<br />
allow a fun. d to compete fully with it. They would not allow a<br />
fund to offer more than hospital-only cover. This would remove<br />
cost restraints. There are many doctors who want to maintain<br />
a doctor/ patient relationship and many patients who also want<br />
to retain that relationship. They have an incentive to moderate<br />
fees so insurance costs would not go too high.<br />
If they do, more and more people woul~ d move to standard ward<br />
treatment only where salaried doctors, but not the doctor of<br />
your choice, attend to patients. The A. L. P. proposals provided<br />
a $ 60 million subsidy in 1975/ 76 for the chronically ill.<br />
To lessen the taxpayers' burden we are dropping that figure to<br />
million. The with little concern for the<br />
chronically ill1 who must-include many people from their own<br />
membership, demand that that subsidy be abolished altogether.<br />
It is the chronically ill with long stays., in hospital who Qften<br />
take out intermediate insurance to gain greater coverage in hospital.<br />
The A. C. T. U. proposal is quite impracticable and shows great lack<br />
of feeling for the chronically ill. The real difference is that<br />
the A. C. T. U. will not accept a ceiling in the levy; nor will<br />
they accept a subsidy for the chronically ill; nor will they-allow.<br />
people to insure fully with private funds...,.<br />
At this point, it is not possible t6 indicate the-precise costs<br />
of intermediate and private-cover. -It was necessary to-wait for<br />
state decisions about-bed charges. These have now been made and<br />
the experts should have the figures for Medibank ( Private<br />
Insurance) in two weeks. Our proppsals-' have guaranteed the<br />
cooperation of the states and the profession.<br />
The stat~ ks have agreed that joint Commonwealth and State<br />
committe~ es should be established in each state to-oversee the<br />
rising costs of hospitals. ' These joint committees will eliminate<br />
waste and extravagance. Further-the medical profession has<br />
agreed to establish what they call Peer Review Committees in<br />
each state to oversee professional and hospital standards of<br />
medical care. That also should also-counter costs. Under the.<br />
proposal this would. not happen..<br />
The government proposals are designed to achieve a fair distribution<br />
of the-costs of medical and hospital charges across the community,<br />
with those on hig~ her incomes being asked to meet themselves a<br />
higher proportion of their medical costs.-Those who have<br />
Medibank cover through payment of the flull levy are meeting an<br />
average of 18% of the total cost of services. Those who take out<br />
hospital cover Only, will be meeting an average of 14%. Those who<br />
take out full private-cover will be meeting an average 70%~ of<br />
their costs through their premiums. </p>
<p>In addition of course, taxpayers paying an additional $ 1120-<br />
million to subsidise Medibank cover through their general tax<br />
payments. Here the progressive tax system ensures that the<br />
burden will fall progressively on those with higher incomes.<br />
What then is this national strike all about? The A. C. T. U. or<br />
rather * Mr Hawke, has so far made it plain that, despite two<br />
days of discussion, he could give no assurance of industrial<br />
peace until all the A. C. T. U. proposals were accepted. Lack<br />
of capacity to control the left wing militants was indicated<br />
by the damaging-strike in Victoria on the last day on which<br />
we in fact negotiated with Mr Hawke. My g . overnment believes<br />
that what we propose is very much in the interests of all<br />
Australia, that it is fair and equitable and-that it should<br />
not be changed further. The militant left is challenging the<br />
elected government. 200 delegates meeting in Sydney decided<br />
that 2 million should strike not really over Medibank, but<br />
on-a determination of left wing militant power.<br />
The militant left wing unions have beent-looking for an issue<br />
and have been seeking confrontation. They chose this false issue<br />
in a damaging and nationally destructive way. M" r Hawke and<br />
those who were with him know that the A. C. T. U. has had more far<br />
reaching discussions with their government than they ever had<br />
before with any other government. He knows we have been<br />
responsive to their views. It is'a national tragedy that in<br />
this issue, hie has thrown in his lot with the militant left.<br />
On this issue he is their voice. The case is tragic because<br />
our proposals are just, equitable, and fair.,<br />
It is some trade union leaders who have forced this issue in<br />
order to break democratic government in Australia. In all<br />
areas of policy, the government is actively and constructively<br />
pursuing policies which we believe meet the real concerns of<br />
Australia. This is also true of our Foreign Policy.<br />
Yesterday Mr Hawke said he was waiting for someone to ring<br />
him up.* It is Mr Hawke's organisation that has caused the<br />
strike. He knows how to use a telephone. He could easily<br />
have rung me up.<br />
Let me conclude by making a few remarks on foreign policy matters.<br />
In foreign policy we * do not accept the view that Australia should<br />
withdraw into silence or that Australian independence means a<br />
fearful abstention from every foreign policy issue, even where<br />
our interests are involved. Our policies must not be merely<br />
reactive to world events. Australia must not merely go along<br />
with any of the major powers, regardless of Australia's own<br />
interests.<br />
What may have surprised people is that the views Australia is<br />
expressing are at the forefront instead of lagging behind. The<br />
catch-cry in the past has been why hasn't Australia got this<br />
view. Because of assessments of the current situation that have<br />
been made not only by Australia but by the NATO powers and<br />
other authorities the government has not accepted the strategic<br />
assessment prepared for the last administration. These<br />
assessments did not go into many world questions in sufficient<br />
depth to provide an accurate assessment of their impact on<br />
Australia. .18 </p>
<p>Wider questions are now being asked. More information is now<br />
available; the assessments of the past are in our view, not<br />
adequate for the formulation of defence policy today. They<br />
do not represent the present assessments of this government,<br />
which basically accepts the conclusion reached by all the<br />
NATO powers. We have asked for the assessment to be<br />
broadened and we have asked additional questions. At this<br />
stage, my speech of 1 June represents the considered assessment<br />
of the government.<br />
Un both foreign and domestic policy, the government is seeking<br />
actively constructive approaches to major issues . facing Australia.<br />
The problems we face will not be solved easily or quickly.,.<br />
But if we are prepared to deal with them realistically as a<br />
people free from dogmatism there is no doubt that they can<br />
be overcome. This is a time when we have to ask ourselves<br />
fundamental questions about the kind of people we are and the<br />
qualities we will need to -show in surviving and prospering in<br />
an uncertain world. Australians have demonstrated the kind of<br />
qualities needed in building this country. Realism, independence,<br />
imagination, enterprise, concern for others, and a capacity to<br />
work together. These qualities are needed now, more than ever.<br />
We as a government will seek to foster, develop and encourage<br />
the expression of'these qualities. Our policies will be directed<br />
to that end. </p>

ROB CHiLMamS: ( Australianr Press Services):<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, earlier in your speech--you gave credkit to<br />
Mr. Hawke a-nd the A. C. T. U. for the stand they took yesterday on<br />
wage indexation. Are you also congratulating the Left,. _ inZ<br />
militants in the A. C. T. U. for their support 0f wage indexatio~ n<br />
or are you saying t-hat they only control _ 711. Hawke on Medibarnk?<br />
MR. FRLASER: Quite obviously the alignirents, within the uni. on<br />
movement are* different on different issues.<br />
BRUCE IT1ERCHM-TT:<br />
Prime Minister, commr-ents you have made recently both here and in,<br />
China regarding the -site and-priority for a new and -permanent16<br />
Parliament House seem to be ' at odds with some government departments<br />
and authorities. For example, an ( unclear) exists sig,-, hting the<br />
building on Capitol iland a joint Parli-amentary Comittlee hnas<br />
already met four~ tizies to start compiling6 : rateriai -which will be<br />
the basis of a designed brief, and the N'atuional Capital Development<br />
Commission has said that a new Parliament wi;_ ll ta : e up to 15 Years<br />
to build and design. is the Goverment's attitude to a new<br />
Parliament House and what sort of time scale are you consideri-ng<br />
MR. FRASER: The Government's attitude would be that there are<br />
more important financial requirements b-ef ore Australia. </p>
<p>Press Club Luncheon,<br />
7/ 7/ 1976<br />
MR. AL AN REID: The Bulletin:<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, if rolling strikes develop as is indicated<br />
by the resolution of the how can you possibly deal<br />
with that situation in a way that won't bring the con-munity into<br />
discomfiture.<br />
MR. FRASER: I think in that particular kind of contest to say<br />
how you are going to deal with the situation would make those who<br />
want to promote rolling strikes a good deal easier.<br />
ANDREW POTTER: A. B. C.<br />
Prime Minister, this morning Mr. Hawke issued you a-public<br />
challenge, a challenge to debate on the efficiency of the Medibank<br />
scheme. Will you accept that challenge to a debate, a debate that<br />
Mr. Hawke says will show you to be an apologist for the doctors.<br />
MR. FRASER: think what I have said today quite adequately<br />
answers the question in relation to that.<br />
BRIAN TOOHEY: ( The Australian Financial Review):<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, would you please outline in some detail for<br />
us the sorts of conclusions reached by the NATO powers which<br />
differ so apparently from the conclusions as relates to our<br />
strategic situation which was produced by the Offensive Committee,<br />
senior Australian defence personnel last Ioveber?<br />
MR. FRASER: Thank you very much Mr. Toohey for that question.,<br />
At the NATO Ministerial Council Meeting on the 21 May, 1976 they<br />
issued a communique which unfortunately wasn't printed I think in<br />
Australia in any great depth and I could read it if I may, some<br />
parts of it " accordingly Ministers felt that they must once again<br />
voice their concern at the sustained growth in the Warsaw Pact<br />
countries military power on land, at sea, and in the air, beyondlevels<br />
apparently justified for defensive purposes. Should this<br />
trend continue it could lead to an arms race of dangerous<br />
dimensions." The NATO Offence Planning Co= ittee, which is the<br />
meeting of Defence Ministers, the other meeting was the meeting<br />
of Foreign Ministers, had this to say on 11 June, 1976<br />
" Ministers were then given a briefing on recent increases in the<br />
military strength of the Warsaw Pact and voiced their concern<br />
that this continues to grow beyond levels justified for defensive </p>
<p>7/ 7/ 1976<br />
MR. FRASER cont'd:<br />
purposes. They devoted particular attention to the implications<br />
of the increased emphasis on offensive capabilities if I could<br />
read that again they devoted particular attention to the<br />
implications of the increased emphasis on offensive capabilities in<br />
the Pact forces, especially air forces.<br />
The statement by the chairman of the Military Committee followed<br />
on the current state of NATO defences emphasising once again<br />
* the continuing change in the balance of forces -in favour of the<br />
Warsaw Pact. Ministers took note with concern of, the ' substantial<br />
advances in size and effectiveness achieved during recent years<br />
-in every sector of Soviet military capabilities, confirming a clear<br />
potential to use military force-directly or indirectly or the threat<br />
Sof such force world wide<br />
You might like me to read that last sentence again<br />
Well: there are other authorities also but they are the two<br />
authoratitive statements, public communiques, not private<br />
communiques, public communiques, from the Warsaw Pact and I would<br />
I said the Warsaw Pact the NATO Pact and I would think that<br />
the essence of what they are saying is precisely the same as the<br />
e. ssence of what I was saying in that speech of the 1st June.<br />
JOHN LOMBARD: ( Melbourne Sun):<br />
PrimeMinister, will you honour the commitment given by your<br />
predecessor to grant Sir John Kerr a second term as Governor General.<br />
MR. FRASER: That's a very interesting question. ( applause)<br />
JOHNS LOMBARD: It was intended as a question that will be<br />
considered in the proper manner-at the appropriate time<br />
MR. FRASER: I have nothing to add to the answer<br />
STEWART SIMPSON: ( Financial Review):<br />
How do you reconcile Mr. Lynch's May 20 statement that the<br />
Government would use its protection policies in an anti-inflationary<br />
way, with the Government's increasing move for protection of major<br />
industries, for instance the textile, steel and car industries,<br />
and also may I ask, what is your own philosophy towards protection<br />
of Australian industries, given your plea in your foreign policy<br />
statement of June 1 that developed countries give greater access<br />
to imports from the under-developed nations. </p>
<p>' IPress<br />
Club Luncheon:<br />
7/ 7/ 1976<br />
MR. FRASER: Well I ' am afraid this is one of the areas where T.<br />
must differ with the economic writers of the Financial Review.<br />
There are always people who will believe on some hands that there<br />
is too much protection and Others who will believe there is too<br />
much free trade and in the conduct of the nation's business it is<br />
clearly necessary to strike a proper balance. I believe that the<br />
Government is striking that proper balance. The Financial Review<br />
has a perfect right to differ. They would wish. to have a greater<br />
degree of free trade and that would resulL; in the present..<br />
circumstances as we believe in a much greater level of unemployment.<br />
We're not prepared to see that happen.<br />
MAX HA'WK INS: ( Brisbane Telegraph.):<br />
In view of the continuing speculation, even since last Sunday,<br />
that you might re-shuffle your Ministry at some time, and apart<br />
from last Sunday's change, are you dissatisfied with your Ministxy?<br />
MR. FRASER: I am' very satisfied with the way the Ministry worlzs<br />
aS a Ministry, individually and as a whole.<br />
AAI FITZGERALD: ( 2CA):<br />
Prime Minister in your recent statement about foreign policy you<br />
have implicitly read a requiem over detente. You have suggested<br />
that it is a failure, yet the principle articulator or architect<br />
of detente in recent years, Henry Kissinger, has suggested its a<br />
continuing process, that one shouldn't expect it to be other than a<br />
means to an ultimate end. What is the alternative then, in your<br />
opinion, to detente. Do you suggest that only strategic and<br />
military alliances are the answer to what you see as a one-way street.<br />
MR. FRASER: It's the extension of the meaning put to the word<br />
detente that the Government objects to. The use of that word<br />
had led many people to believe that all problems were solved<br />
between the United States and the Soviet Union and that no problems<br />
remained. I think on nearly every occasion in which there has been<br />
criticism of detente it has always been repeated that we support.<br />
strongly the fabric of negotiation just as we support strongly the<br />
development further of bi-lateral relations between the . Soviet Union<br />
and ourselves and many, many other countries. But the view that may<br />
people have of detente, that because of it, and how the word got;<br />
this sort of mystical understanding or meaning is difficult to k: now<br />
perhaps, that therefore there were no problems left, is a false view </p>
<p>Press Club Luncheon:<br />
7/ 7/ 1976<br />
MR. FRASER: and lulled people into a position of complacency.<br />
Its worth noting I think that as late as the 25 June, 1976<br />
Dr. Kissinger himself expressed a view which again expressed scme<br />
concerns, While not mentioning the word detente, he has clearly<br />
made it plain that he believes it necessary to maintain one's<br />
vigilance and maintain one's strength and it was the use of the<br />
word detente which tempted people to think that that wasn't<br />
necessary, that has been so misleading and which my Government has<br />
wished to dispel. I would like to read what Dr. Kissinger said<br />
on the 25 June if I may, this year " Beneath the nuclear<br />
umbrella, the temptation to probe with regional forces or proxy<br />
wars increases. The steady growth of Soviet conventional<br />
military and naval. power and its expanding global reach cannot<br />
be ignored. In the nuclear age, once a change from the geopolitical<br />
balance has become unambiguous it's too late to do anything<br />
about it. However great our strength, it will prove empty<br />
if we do not resist seemingly marginal changes whose cumulative<br />
impact can undermine our security.<br />
Again, I can't think of a better way of expressing that view.<br />
The United States is of course one of the NATO powers and was<br />
obviously a party to the other remarks that I read out earlier.<br />
ALAN BARNES: " The Age":<br />
Prime Minister in your policy speech of last November, and I quote<br />
from page seven, you gave a firm undertaking " in the next budget<br />
we will make the first major move towards adoption of the stock<br />
valuation provisions of the Mathews Report. We will introduce<br />
the report in full over three years." In the interests of the<br />
businessmen who saw you last week, is that firm promise still<br />
operative?<br />
MR. FRASER: I think you might well be interested to know, and<br />
the Treasurer has made an announcement about this that on Thursday<br />
of this week he and I and other senior Ministers will be present<br />
at a meeting with Taxation and Treasury technical officials and<br />
technical experts from the accountancy professions, business, the<br />
outside world, will be discussing the implications of the Mathews<br />
proposals for companies. Now this particular meeting has been<br />
arranged and it might also be of interest to note, which many of<br />
you will not know, that Professor Nathews has come back to<br />
participate in these discussions. </p>
<p>Press Club Luncheon: 6.<br />
7/ 7/ 1976<br />
ALAN BARNES:<br />
Mr. Lynch said that was a technical meeting Prime Minister, he<br />
said it was not a policy matter. I was after a policy undertaking<br />
from you Sir.<br />
MR. FRASER: Well I think that what's been said in relation<br />
to those discussions would obviously not be taking place.<br />
The discussions. wouldn't if we were not serious.<br />
LAURIE O. XES: ( Melbourne<br />
Prime iIinister, do you regard the Soviet Union as posing a<br />
military threat to Australia?<br />
MR. FRASER: I have nothing to say about the Soviet Union<br />
beyond that which I have already said publicly.<br />
PAUL KELLY: ( national Times)<br />
Prime Minister, , in your answer to Mr. Hawkins you said you were<br />
quite happy with your present Ministry. Can you tell us just why<br />
you are happy having as Defence Minister a man who can say that<br />
Australia faces a direct military threat from the Soviet Union and<br />
then changeshis mind three hours later.<br />
MR. FRASER: I am going to adopt one of the practices of one of<br />
my predecessors, a practice that he did not always follow, but<br />
one which he espoused when it was to his advantage to follow.<br />
Its one that I will follow at all occasions, and not comment on<br />
individual Ministers.<br />
IAN MATHEWS:<br />
Prime Minister in the latter part of your speech you mentioned<br />
foreign policy matter's and you said that Australia must not merely<br />
be reactive and that Australia is at the forefront not lagging<br />
behind. In this context what is your Government's intention with<br />
regard to the recognition of the Transkei when it becomes<br />
independent of South Africa in October this year?<br />
MR. FRASER: When I was saying the Government was in the forefront<br />
and not lagging behind I was referring to the international<br />
interpretations as I thin the context should make clear of changes<br />
in the world balance of power in those particular matters. On the<br />
question that you in fact mentioned quite obviously there would<br />
need to be discussions and will be with Andrew Peacock and<br />
Departments appropriately concerned, and also our views on apartheid </p>

TONY WALKER:<br />
Prime Minister, on the Bland appointment Sir Henry Bland as<br />
chairman of the do you think it is the A. B. C. bureaucrats<br />
who should be nervous about the appointment or the A. B. C.<br />
' performers who should be feeling some concern.<br />
MR. FRASER: I wouldn't have thought anyone should be feeling<br />
some concern because Sir Henry Bland is the most vigorous advocate<br />
and defender of anyone who does his job well. ( applause)<br />
KEM RAtDALL: ( Financial Times):.<br />
I would like to go back to some of your remarks on business and<br />
the ones that you made in your address on the processes of<br />
consultation Which you had. You did suggest at one stage that<br />
you saw quite strong objections to the process of 200 union<br />
delegates this week making decisions for 2 million union members.<br />
Several of your Ministers have been enjoining the business community<br />
to stop the fragmented approach that they take to consultation<br />
with government and have formed something rather like the ACTU<br />
a blanket voice for business interests in this country.<br />
Do you think its really do you support those efforts, do you<br />
think it is really practical that there can be for such a diverse<br />
varied private sector as we have, that there can be a unified voice<br />
of those people and if you do support those efforts broadly is<br />
there really an essential-difference in principle between the type<br />
of responsibility, advocacy, which the A. C. T. U. claims and the type<br />
of advocacy which an organisation that would claim?<br />
MR. FRASER: Well I think that there is a significant difference<br />
in quality about the different things that you are talking about.<br />
I think it will be difficult to get business to speak with one<br />
voice in its consultations with government because businesses have<br />
many differing interests at times and this sometimes comes out<br />
quite clearly in the economic consultations that we have. There are<br />
on the other hand some matters in which all business has overriding<br />
and common interests and in many cases its the common interest<br />
that I believe ought to be shared with their own employees but<br />
whether or not they can form one voice in relation to matters<br />
concerning consultation, that's one thing, but a body that uses its </p>
<p>7/ 7/ 1976<br />
MR. FRASER cont'd:<br />
one voice to suggest that 2 million people should go on strike is,<br />
in my view, just as irresponsible as business if they one voice and<br />
suggested that all businesses should establish a lock out and I'd<br />
condemn that with equal vigour or. . greater vigour, so its a-quality<br />
of the act. Being able to consult with one group i 1 relation to<br />
the problems of that group is certainly useful. It's also worth<br />
noting that the Australian Council of Trade Unions is not a<br />
completely or the Trade Union Movment is not completely<br />
monolithic. While the ACTU does represent most, it doesn't<br />
represent quite all.<br />
BRUCE JUDDERY: ( Canberra Times):<br />
Sir, you expressed your ' interest in access to information<br />
government information, and you initiated an inquiry into this.<br />
Will you take the lead, Sir, by making available to the public, and<br />
the Public Service, the reports of the Bland Committee, of the<br />
Administrative Review Committee, so that people will be able to<br />
judge on what criteria various administrative rank has been made<br />
inthe Public Service area and Sir, will you release the individual<br />
departmental ceilings on staff over the next year which you have perhapz<br />
approved on the advice of the i. nter-depart-mental co-r-ittee and tn-us<br />
relieve the serious damage to morale in many parts of the Public<br />
Service following from the decisions you have announced.<br />
MR. FRASER: Well I don't really believe there is that damage to<br />
morale in the Public Service because when the first staff ceilings<br />
were announced many people said, you won't possibly get to those<br />
figures by the 30 June without retrenchments and sackings and all<br />
the rest. The figures were in fact reached with the exceptions<br />
of one or two departments about-two months before that time and by<br />
the 30 June the figure was significantly below the figure that had<br />
in fact been set and by voluntary action resignation and<br />
retirement, and I would have thought that the present staff ceilings<br />
in total are also reasonably based. The Public service Board and<br />
Ministers and statutory authorities have been asked in the firmest<br />
possible terms to advise me if there any particular difficulty in<br />
reaching ceilings, any indication of a decision that would cause<br />
personal hardship in matters of that kind and one or two Ministers<br />
in relation to one or two areas have done that. At one point the<br />
National Capital Development Committee did that if one remembers<br />
back a little while. So I don't think that in view of that total </p>
<p>Press Club Luncheon:<br />
7/ 7/ 1976<br />
MR. FRASER cort'd:<br />
situation there is any need for the concern in the public service<br />
in relation to these particular matters.<br />
So far as the Bland Reports are concerned they were written for<br />
the Government, they were written as Sir Henry Bland obviously was<br />
a past public servant of great distinction, in a manner that was<br />
appropriate for the internal consumption of the government. Many<br />
of the recommendations wereencompassed and over-taken by the<br />
decisions that were made and announced in IMay of last year and any<br />
administrative changes that flow from one department to another as<br />
one particular time but I.-must . rgre t that on this occasion those<br />
particular reports were not written for public consumption and it<br />
w ould be most unfair for many people if they were in fact published.<br />
PETER BOWERS: ( Sydney Morning Herald):<br />
Prime Minister, you have repeatedly expressed your concern . at<br />
the power imbalance in the Indian Ocean in favour of the Soviet<br />
Union's surface naval fleet. When you see President Ford in<br />
Washington later this month, will you be asking him to correct that<br />
imbalance. And switching to the Pacific on the same subject, is it<br />
your understanding that the United States cannot guarantee the<br />
security of the Pacific sea lanes west of Hawaii?<br />
MR. FRASER: I think it would be quite inappropriate to indicate<br />
in advance what matters I was going to discuss with President Ford<br />
as a result of his invitation to me and so far as the latter matter<br />
is concerned I would obviously be in a much better position to<br />
comment if it were appropriate to comment after I had been further<br />
briefed by the Secretary of State for Defence in Washington.<br />
RUSSETLL S T. TN<br />
Prime Minister, does it concern you that Australia's top military<br />
experts gave inadequate advice to the previous government on the<br />
strategic forecast for our region and besides asking for wider<br />
terms of reference to be implemented, will you be taking other<br />
steps to rectify that this inadequate information doesn't occur again?<br />
MR. FRASER: I think in many of these instances its a question of<br />
the questions that governments put. So far as the future is<br />
concerned, well that unfolds by itself. </p>

7/ 7/ 1976<br />
ANDREW POTTIER:<br />
Prime Minister, in view of the governments raising $ 300 million<br />
around $ 500 million from the IM. F, can you now scotch speculation<br />
that the Government is preparing to devalue?<br />
1IR. FRASER: I think that the Treasurer's statement in relation<br />
to that particular matter made it quite plain that it was taking<br />
advantage of short-tern shifts and changes and a right that ,. we<br />
have in relation to the DIF, not related to the long-term situation<br />
at all. I have nothing to add to my own past stateiments and the<br />
Treasurer's past statements and Mr. Anthony's past statements on<br />
these particular subjects, which stand.<br />
BILL D'ARCY:<br />
Prime Minister, in relation to your June 1 speech. To what degree<br />
was that assessment made on deeply held personal beliefs?<br />
In rejecting the advice of the defence chiefs, was it only made<br />
on information that had been provided by NATO or was the<br />
government privy to other information which suggested that they<br />
were wrong? Is this government only going to accept advice that<br />
it wants to hear? And finally Sir, will you give consideration<br />
to using the considerable skills of Mr. Killen in another area?<br />
MR. FRASER: This government will use all the advice available<br />
to. it. It will make objective examination of the advice and the<br />
information contained in it and it will come to an objective<br />
conclusion as a result. It will not be bound in its conclusions<br />
by ideologies which are false and misleading and one of the<br />
assumptions in the question I think, in relation to rejection and<br />
all the rest, carries with it animputation that really ought not<br />
to be there and that's not, I think, the questioners fault,<br />
it was in relation to the circumstances maybe in which past<br />
Governments night well have put questions. But certainly whatever<br />
might have been a deep conviction of mine, whether something was<br />
or not, as part of a government, its the government's view that is<br />
of importance and also having taken into account the full advice<br />
of people from the appropriate departments.<br />
In case anyone believes there was an interesting story in one accourabout<br />
three people who had written that speech. I'm afraid I have<br />
got to say, and I hope I don't offend the author, that it was a<br />
somewhat fantastic story about the way the particular speech was<br />
compiled, as a number of people here in the room at the moment know. </p>
<p>Press C2ub LZuncheon: 11.<br />
7/ 7/ 1976<br />
MR. FRASER cent'd:<br />
It was one that was written through many drafts and consultation<br />
with Foreign Affairs, Andrew Peacock, Defence and my own Department,<br />
with all proper consultation with the people involved and it was on<br />
the basis of that total advice that the speech was made as it was<br />
and accepted by the Cabinet as it was.<br />
MIKE S2ECARTI ( Sydney Morning Herald):<br />
The Premiers, Mr. Hawke, and many economists all agree that your<br />
economic policies will lead to increased unemployment. , Do you<br />
accept that and how will that if ycu do how will that help<br />
fight inflation?<br />
MR. FRASER: There are many other economists who take a<br />
different view and economists I suppose are like lawyers, it<br />
depends where you are trained or what your views are or you can get<br />
people on both sides of the fence. So just because economists have<br />
one particular'view, doesn't necessarily mean. to say that that<br />
particular view is right. Somehow people have to make up their<br />
own minds, having taken again what facts are available to them<br />
into account. The sort of view that I don't think it would<br />
be unfair to him that Mr. Hawke would have been putting, is that<br />
the Government ought to spend more money to pump prime the economy<br />
in the Keynzian sense. Now it is the Government's view, and a<br />
very . strong view that when you have high inflation, high interest<br />
rates, coupled with high employment, you can't buy your way out of<br />
trouble by spending more of other people's money and that there has<br />
to be a transfer of resources to the private sector in a way which<br />
will engender private sector growth. Now if you had a situation<br />
of high unemployment, coupled with very low inflation or low<br />
inflation and low interest rates, then the sort of solution proposed<br />
by Mr. Hawke, the sort of solutions tried and which failed by the<br />
past government, might well have been the appropriate ones, but<br />
they're not the circumstances in which we live and if we try to<br />
spend our way out of trouble I believe Australia is only going to<br />
land in more trouble. And that's not only based on the experience<br />
of Australia over the last two or three years, it is also based on<br />
the experience of other O. E. C. D. countries and the way in which they<br />
in fact have started to improve their economies.<br />
I think there is one, in terms of deficit financing, there is one<br />
factor that is not widely understood. In the United States, for<br />
example, if their administration wishes to deficit finance they are<br />
not allowed to go to their Reserve Bank and print money as people </p>

are allowed to under the various financing arrangements in<br />
Australia and many other countries. In the United States there<br />
is a positive requirement that under those circumstances the<br />
government must go on the open market and compete for the ' funds<br />
that it wants and that ( slight pause in tape)<br />
I believe that potentially the statement that cane from China<br />
in. relation to these matters carried very great signifiance,<br />
not only for South East Asia but for other areas.<br />
MAX DAWKINS:<br />
Prime Ninister could I just ask you a further question.<br />
Yesterday the Papua New Guinea Defence Foreign ILinister, etc.<br />
Sir Naori Kiki was here and he is reported to have said that<br />
* Papua New Guinea expected not simply a sea border between the<br />
tip of Cape York and their country but an. air and apparently<br />
sea line border." .' hen do you expect this matter to be settled?<br />
MR. FRASER: I can't give a time scale on that because I haven't<br />
had a report over the last few days about the processes of<br />
negotiations but it is my understanding that they have been moving<br />
forward reasonably well and with a reasonable degree of understanding<br />
on both sides, but the broad principles of what both countries<br />
would wish to have I think are understood and I think our<br />
negotiators are making progress.<br />
PAUL KELLY ( National Times):<br />
Prime Minister, you talk about returning power and responsibility<br />
to the states. Can you tell us whether you believe there is a<br />
valid argument that the states should accept an increase in direct<br />
financial responsibility for the tertiary education sector?<br />
FRASER: Its a question of the responsibilities that<br />
they have and the capacity to meet the responsibilities in relation<br />
to their financial resources. As part of the federalism policy<br />
we will'later this year be examining those areas which the<br />
Commonwealth now finances which we might regard as being<br />
appropriate for absorption in the general purpose grants thus<br />
increasing those general purpose grants and the base which goes<br />
to the states so that they could carry out the responsibilities<br />
for themselves. That's the general proposition. I don't want<br />
anyone to assume from that that the Conmmonwealth will cease to </p>

MR. HAWK INS:<br />
Prime Minister, we are running cut of time and I think if we<br />
could close it, we have three or four more questions. If I could<br />
just call Laurie Oakes first and there's about three others.<br />
, LAURIE OAKES:<br />
Prime Minister, in the interests of reducing waste and-extravagance<br />
I would like to ask two ouestions at once. The fi'st one is,<br />
if you are not worried about giving offe0se to people, why wont you<br />
tell us if the Soviet Union in, your view is a military threat<br />
to Australia and my second question is this the Remunerations<br />
STribunal has recommended increases in salaries and allowances for<br />
Ministers. Has Cabinet considered this. If so,<br />
with what result. If not, when will Cabinet consider the question,<br />
and what's your personal. view? Do you thin. k that in the present<br />
climate you should get a pay rise?<br />
MR. FR. SER: I had thought Oakes that you could read<br />
-I've said that I have said on June 1 that I'd stated attitude to<br />
the Soviet Union, that I had nothing to add to it, and I thought<br />
that's plain enough. No. It's on the record. And it was<br />
quite a long speech And secondly, in relation to the Tribunal,<br />
that has not been considered by Cabinet. I don't have personal<br />
views in relation to these matters. I have Government views when<br />
the Government has formed its views.<br />
ALANT FITZGERALD: ( 2CA):<br />
Prime Minister, there seems to be some doubt about your<br />
Government's intentions to implement its promise to introduce<br />
self government to the Australian Capital Territory. After all,<br />
this year you are visiting the United States where part of the<br />
justification for that revolution was the cry of no taxation<br />
without representation' Here in Canberra residents have been<br />
subjected to some fairly savage imposts and rate increases at<br />
a local level in the implementation of a national strategy.<br />
Now we have no control, our local government has no executive<br />
responsibilities. Do you intend to grant some executive<br />
responsiblity in local government in the A. C. T. or are we to<br />
continue with a situation where the national government can impose </p>
<p>7/ 7/ 1976<br />
ALAN FiTZGERALD cont'd:<br />
its taxes without due process of representation?<br />
MR. FRASER: There are moves that are being undertaken which I<br />
think you would be well aware of, examining these particular<br />
matters and there is however one difference between the situation<br />
in relation to the A. C. T. and the Northern Territory for example<br />
which I think has to be recognise( The fact that the national<br />
capital is in the A. C. T. does alter the relationship to the form<br />
of local government that develops in the A. C. T. compared to that<br />
to the Northern Territory and I think that that wol. d have to be<br />
recognised but the Minister is pursuing this matteo, there are<br />
examinations under way and moves will be made. I've got no doubt<br />
that this one of the areas where those actively involved in pressing,<br />
such as yourself, would want us to hasten quicker, well I take note<br />
of what you say.<br />
MICHAEL FOSTER' ( Canberra Times):<br />
You define participants in talks up coming as being quite definite<br />
and others as being from the outside world. Would you mind<br />
defining so that those of us who are in or out, or vica versa,<br />
would you mind defining the outside world.<br />
MR. FRASER: Look, could you repeat the question please?<br />
MICHAEL FOSTER: I would have thought you could hear sir.<br />
In an earlier answer you defined participants in particular talks<br />
which are up ccr. ig as being quite specific and otherwise from the<br />
outside world. So that those of us who are in or out know exactly<br />
where we are at, could you define the outside world?<br />
MR. FRASER: Look I am still I'm afraid at a loss. I apparently<br />
don't understand and maybe I am at one with Mr. Oakes in relation<br />
to these matters his fault is in one direction, my fault is in<br />
another If you would like to have a go at rephrasing the question<br />
I'll see if I can understand it properly so I can answer it.<br />
MICHAEL FOSTER: I decline Sir, and accept your apology.<br />
MAX HAh,' KI'. TS: Well we have got three questions. I couldn't see<br />
under the lights I'm sorry, but you know you should advise me<br />
about these things there's a questio under the lights, I still<br />
can't see who wants it. </p>
<p>7/ 7/ 1976<br />
QUESTION Primne iMinister you said today that you'd like perhaps you<br />
invited Mr. Hlawke. to get on. the telephone and have a chat to you.<br />
Are you suggesting that you mi. ght be willing to rmake some<br />
compromise before next Nonday and do you accept that if a<br />
compromise is worked out, I mean, that it has to be compromise<br />
not just a solution? And to add to that question I would just<br />
like to quote from a statement issued by you yesterday in which<br />
you say. " If Mr. Hawke had been able to begotiate and had had<br />
the power to say to us that if a change is made and. there will<br />
be no strike then the discussions with him could have been real.<br />
You do seem to be suggesting there that if the A. C. T. U. had been<br />
willing Ito give a'bit, you would have been willing to give a bit too.<br />
MR. FRASER: Well I don't believe that the proposals we have,<br />
and. I think I made this plain earlier today, can in fact be<br />
changed, but there is never any harm in talking with people.<br />
It is Mr. Hawke's organisation that has called the strike. It<br />
has been reported that he was sitting at the end of a telephone<br />
waiting for a call but you know, he is capable of lifting up<br />
the receiver as well, and dialling, if that's what he wants, and<br />
I'd be delighted to talk with him at any time. I believe that<br />
the kind of change that we have in fact made is the most<br />
significant change that we could make and probably the only real<br />
one of substance and that is to allow Medibank to insure and<br />
compete with the private funds for intermediate and private ward<br />
treatment. One of the problems was in the discussions that it<br />
was said time and time again that it just wasn't possible to<br />
give any guarantee of what the outcome would be unless the totality<br />
of the ACTU demands were met and-the Government believed that that<br />
. would not be in the best interests of health care for Australians<br />
and that it ought not to be a demand that should be acceded to.<br />
QUESTIONER: If I might take one more point Mr. Prime Minister,<br />
what did you mean then in that statement yesterday when you said<br />
that if-a change, and I presumre you mean a change to Medibank,<br />
is made, if Mr. Hawke had been able to have the power to say to us,<br />
that if a change is ad ( ralf. ILCth e ndoiissceu) ssion would have been real.<br />
MR. FRASER: Oh there are very great differences in a situation<br />
in which there are initial discussions an'd discussions under<br />
threat of a national strike. </p>

MAX HTAWKINS: Finally Rob Chalmers and then Brian Toohey.<br />
ROB CHkAT-LERS: ( Australi1 Press Services):<br />
Sir, do you agree with the Melbourne Agc that one of the more<br />
disastrous aspects of your visit to Peking is that you and<br />
apparently your Foreign Affairs advisers assumed that the break<br />
between Moscow and Peking was permanent. Did you consider<br />
the possibility of a rapprochement between Moscow and Peking,<br />
perhaps following the death of Mao or perhaps following a. change<br />
in style in the Kremlin. If the axis should be re-established<br />
where would we now stand?<br />
IR. FRASER: Well of course the question is based on an<br />
assumption, and I think it is based on an article that-might<br />
have been written while we were still4-n Peking if I'm wrong<br />
about that I'd apologise to its author but while we were still<br />
there, obviously the people who were writing were not having the<br />
full background of what had in fact taken place, what was taking<br />
place and permanency in international relations is something that<br />
is most unlikely. Permanency in any particular relationship was<br />
not assumed in any sense, shape or form, but it is worth noting<br />
T think that there have been certain drives about the policy of<br />
some major powers and the Soviet Union included, that are historical,<br />
that have continued for a long time, that haven't vastly changed<br />
when the regime radically changed somewhat earlier this century.<br />
RAli TOOHEI ( Fi--ncial Review):<br />
Mr. ' raser, in answer to one question on tariff protection policy<br />
you said that you differed from the point of view of some economic<br />
commentators and you had to strike a balance and in this case you<br />
