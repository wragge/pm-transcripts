<p>Well thank you very much Air Marshal Titheridge, to Air Marshal McCormack,</p>
<p> to Mrs Bronwyn Bishop the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and</p>
<p> Personnel, to Warren Entsch the Federal Member for Leichhardt, other</p>
<p> distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>I would particularly like to express my gratitude for the very kind</p>
<p> and warm remarks of Thelma Coconut. I was impressed by the depth of</p>
<p> the feeling expressed and the generosity and the spirit of the welcome</p>
<p> extended to me when I arrived on the tarmac and also here this morning.</p>
<p> She commands our respect and our gratitude and her recollection that</p>
<p> what led the owners of Peppan to agree that the base be built here</p>
<p> was the story of how scared of the planes overhead the elders who</p>
<p> were then growing up on the mission were reminds all of us of the</p>
<p> important sacrifices of Australians of all origins that have been</p>
<p> made in the years that have gone by. We are grateful for those sacrifices</p>
<p> of whoever made them and in whatever form for the defence and the</p>
<p> protection of our nation. And I certainly share firmly your hope that</p>
<p> the base will not need to be used in war.</p>
<p>Can I say how delighted I am to share this occasion with you. It is</p>
<p> always for me a particular pleasure to share a special occasion with</p>
<p> the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. I want on behalf</p>
<p> of the Government to express our unending gratitude for the tremendous</p>
<p> work that you do in maintaining the defence preparedness of Australia.</p>
<p> It is not always an easy life, it is not always a life that sits happily</p>
<p> and comfortably with the needs and demands of family responsibilities.</p>
<p> And in thanking the men and women of the defence forces I also thank</p>
<p> the wives and husbands and children of the joint sacrifice they make</p>
<p> as part of service life. All of us were, I am sure, moved and filled</p>
<p> with tremendous pride for the work that was done by the ADF contingent</p>
<p> in Papua New Guinea over the last couple of weeks following the terrible</p>
<p> tidal wave disaster. And those images of those men and women at work</p>
<p> relieving the suffering of humanity in a close neighbour and amongst</p>
<p> friends of Australia who have rendered great assistance to Australian</p>
<p> diggers in the past was a reminder to all of us of the diverse role</p>
<p> and the diverse skills and the great capability of the personnel of</p>
<p> the Australian Defence Force.</p>
<p>This base is very aptly named. Air Chief Marshal Sir Frederick Scherger</p>
<p> was, of course, one of Australia's finest airmen and military</p>
<p> officers. And he was one of the earliest advocates for a chain of</p>
<p> airfields to protect Australians more than air and sea approaches.</p>
<p> And no Australian can possibly be unmindful of the vastness of our</p>
<p> nation and the need, particularly in the north of Australia, to have</p>
<p> a chain of defence and of strategic installations which give some</p>
<p> degree of security and some degree of reassurance. And it's a</p>
<p> timely reminder for those Australians who have lived most of their</p>
<p> lives in the heavily populated areas of Melbourne and Sydney and the</p>
<p> south east corner of Australia. It's a very timely reminder to</p>
<p> come to a place like Weipa and to be reminded of the shared inheritance</p>
<p> we have with the indigenous people but also to be reminded of the</p>
<p> exposure of this country and the need for us always to remain and</p>
<p> retain a sense of vigilance.</p>
<p>When we came to Government in 1996 the Coalition said that we would</p>
<p> quarantine the Australian Defence Forces from any of the budget cuts</p>
<p> that we then believed necessary to put Australia back in the black</p>
<p> and I am very pleased to say that that commitment has been honoured</p>
<p> in full. I remain personally very committed to maintaining the provision</p>
<p> of all the resources that are feasible and practicable consistent</p>
<p> with our other obligations to the Australian Defence Forces. Our Defence</p>
<p> Efficiency Review is restructuring defence to eliminate waste and</p>
<p> duplication. We have achieved a one-off saving of $500 million and</p>
<p> annual savings of $1 billion which will go to the front-end helping</p>
<p> improve operational readiness.</p>
<p>Australian defence, of course, is not just about building barriers</p>
<p> and strong defences, it is also about a contribution to regional stability</p>
<p> and not just in the immediate deployment sense but also in the sense</p>
<p> of the contacts that exist between the Australian Defence Forces and</p>
<p> the defence personnel of our neighbouring countries. Nobody can overestimate</p>
<p> the importance, for example, of the links between the Australian Defence</p>
<p> Forces and the Defence Forces of Indonesia, our nearest neighbour.</p>
<p> And the network of those links that have been built up over the years</p>
<p> were very important to us a few months ago and they remain important.</p>
<p> And the confidence that is reposed by the Defence Forces of those</p>
<p> countries and the personnel that comprise the leadership of our Defence</p>
<p> Forces remains extremely important.</p>
<p>The Defence of Australia, of course, goes beyond our coastline. As</p>
<p> Ian McLachlan has said, our aim must be a secure country in a secure</p>
<p> region. Australia's geography means that we must focus on operations</p>
<p> to defend our maritime approaches before potential enemies reach our</p>
<p> shores. We therefore need to have an effective capability for control</p>
<p> and surveillance of the sea-air gap and for interdiction within it.</p>
<p> And Scherger will certainly help support that capacity. The Government's</p>
<p> strategic review in 1997 supported the development of an airfield</p>
<p> infrastructure in Northern Australia capable of operating modern aircraft.</p>
<p> And Scherger, as you all know, is one of six bases across the north</p>
<p> of Australia. Three of them are the active bases at Darwin, Tindal</p>
<p> and Townsville. Scherger is the third of the so-called bear bases</p>
<p> including Learmonth and Curtin which are capable of being activated</p>
<p> at short notice. And I had in the moments before coming here an opportunity</p>
<p> of seeing in action the capacity of the defence personnel to provide</p>
<p> that activation. This exercise, Northern Awakening, taking place around</p>
<p> us today, underlies that preparedness. This base's capabilities</p>
<p> will be further tested during a major exercise, Exercise Crocodile,</p>
<p> which replaces the Kangaroo series due to take place next year.</p>
<p>Today marks not only the start of operational activity but also an</p>
<p> end to construction and the construction route was begun in March</p>
<p> of 1993. The $137 million project is now complete, on time and under</p>
<p> budget. And I congratulate the 17 Construction Squadron. I congratulate</p>
<p> John Holland and Hansen Yuncken. And I would also like to congratulate</p>
<p> the Napranum Aboriginal Corporation who completed a major contract</p>
<p> for the base also on time and within budget. The contract involved</p>
<p> the manufacture of 120,000 specialised concrete blocks for the construction</p>
<p> of blast walls around the aircraft dispersal area. And this is one</p>
<p> of the largest contracts ever awarded to an Aboriginal community business</p>
<p> enterprise and it is a source of great satisfaction to all of us that</p>
<p> along with the other components of the construction of the base, it</p>
<p> also was completed under budget and on time. And it's a very</p>
<p> good illustration of the practical outcomes that can be achieved through</p>
<p> cooperation with different sections of our community. The contractors</p>
<p> can be justifiably proud of their achievements and the partnership</p>
<p> with the local people that is developed. And the Department of Defence</p>
<p> is a wonderful example to the rest of the community. The rights and</p>
<p> the interests of the local people have been respected in the street</p>
<p> names and in the cooperation. And, indeed, there has also been a very</p>
<p> deep respect for the natural heritage aspects of surrounds. I was</p>
<p> reminded as I drove around the base of the need for environmentally</p>
<p> friendly approaches even during military exercises. And every effort</p>
<p> has been made to ensure that the importance of the environment is</p>
<p> at all times respected and understood.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, this opening today is an opportunity to reaffirm</p>
<p> a number of things. It's an opportunity for the Government to</p>
<p> say thank you to the men and women of the Australian Defence Forces.</p>
<p> It's an opportunity for me on behalf of the Government and the</p>
<p> people of Australia to record our gratitude and our respect to those</p>
<p> men and women for the great service that they render to our country.</p>
<p> It's an opportunity to salute the sense of cooperation and partnership</p>
<p> that exists between the Royal Australian Air Force and the local indigenous</p>
<p> people. To thank the Peppan people. To thank particularly Thelma Coconut</p>
<p> as their representative who greeted us here today, for the spirit</p>
<p> of good will and commitment to our common land Australia which has</p>
<p> characterised their approach to the construction of this base.</p>
<p>The opening of this base completes a very, very important element</p>
<p> of an urban defence structure. And I know it is, to all those Australians</p>
<p> committed to and interested in the defence of Australia, a very important</p>
<p> day. It's a proud day for the Royal Australian Air Force. A group</p>
<p> of men and women that have served this country over long years and</p>
<p> have made a tremendous contribution to preserving and defending the</p>
<p> cause of liberty and the cause of democracy in many theatres of war</p>
<p> around the world. I thank them. I wish all who come to and operate</p>
<p> out of this base the very best of good fortune. It is the united prayer</p>
<p> of all of us that this base will never need to be used in wartime.</p>
<p> But as history has taught us, that united prayer can only be delivered</p>
<p> if we are willing to commit ourselves to a level of defence preparedness.</p>
<p> And if we are ready to, and have the capacity to, deploy military</p>
<p> capability and to deploy defence capacity in order to deter those</p>
<p> who might deny us the realisation of that joint prayer.</p>
<p>I therefore have tremendous pleasure in declaring open RAAF Base Scherger.</p>
<p> It honours a great Australian, a great airman, and a great person</p>
<p> who gave his life to his profession and gave his life to the defence</p>
<p> of his country.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p> [ENDS]</p>
