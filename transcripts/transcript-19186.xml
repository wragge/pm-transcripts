<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard today joined Member for Perth Stephen Smith and WA Senator Glenn Sterle to officially open a new section of the Great Eastern Highway between Kooyong Road and the Tonkin Highway.</p>
<p>This $280 million project has opened to traffic nine months early, increasing the capacity of the Great Eastern Highway in the section from 50,000 to 85,000 vehicles per day.</p>
<p>The Gillard Labor Government contributed $224 million to the Great Eastern Highway upgrade, with the Western Australian Government putting in $56 million.</p>
<p>Our governments together are making it safer, quicker and easier to move in and around Perth.</p>
<p>In addition the landmark $1 billion Gateway WA project commenced last month and will alleviate congestion and improve access to the airport and surrounding industrial areas.</p>
<p>The Gillard Labor Government has invested an unprecedented $3.6 billion in Western Australia through the Nation Building Program to renew and rebuild road, rail and public transport infrastructure across the State. </p>
