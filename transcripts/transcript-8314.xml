PRIME MINISTER uzW<br />
FOR MEDIA 4 JULY 1991<br />
I announce the retirement of a distinguished public servant,<br />
Mr Fred Argy, OBE, who has been the Director of the Office<br />
of the Economic Planning Advisory Council since 1986.<br />
Fred Argy has made an invaluable contribution to the<br />
Australian Public Service. His Public Service career has<br />
spanned some 27 years, which included appointments as Chief<br />
Economist at the Australian Industry Development<br />
Corporation, First Assistant Secretary in the Department of<br />
Housing and the Treasury, Secretary to the Committee of<br />
Inquiry into the Australian Financial System ( the Campbell<br />
Committee), Australian Ambassador to the OECD in Paris and<br />
Deputy Secretary in the Department of Employment and<br />
Industrial Relations.<br />
The Economic Planning Advisory Council has focussed on<br />
identifying ways of improving Australia's medium term<br />
potential for economic growth while maintaining a socially<br />
just distribution of economic benefits. With Mr Argy as<br />
Director its research program has emphasised issues covering<br />
productivity, competitiveness, competition policy, the<br />
saving-investment imbalance and national debt.<br />
I have personally valued Fred's intellectual integrity and<br />
ability to combine human values with rigorous analysis of<br />
economic issues. Under his stewardship, the Office of EPAC<br />
has established an enviable reputation for quality research<br />
and analysis that has been both well communicated and very<br />
relevant to the Australian community.<br />
Fred's energy and enthusiasm, as well as his charm and<br />
diplomacy, have helped to secure the continued commitment of<br />
members of the Economic Planning Advisory Council to the<br />
processes of consultation. He has had a key role in<br />
building public understanding of economic policy and<br />
encouraging informed debate on economic issues.<br />
The current high standing of the Council owes much to Fred's<br />
work. I am sure that members of the Council, past and<br />
present, will echo my appreciation of his work, my regret<br />
that he is leaving and my heartiest good wishes for a busy<br />
and happy retirement. </p>
