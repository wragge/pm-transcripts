OFFICIAL OPENING OF GOODWJIN HOMS<br />
CANBERRA, 22ND JULY, 1961<br />
Speech by the Prime MinisterI the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
Mr. Freeth, Your Excellencies and ladies and gentlemen:<br />
This is, I think, a very remarkable community effort. There<br />
is a lot of self-help fi this matter; and there is some help by the<br />
Government. Now that is as it should be. W~ e must marry these two<br />
elements together. I ought to tell you, as I have told other people<br />
on similar occasions, how this practice arose of the Government<br />
subsidising such enterprises first œ E for and later on for œ 1.<br />
We were approaching a Budget Session of the Cabinet, quite a<br />
few years ago, and my wife had a very cold look in the eye at the<br />
dinner table which is not unusual for wives but this time it had<br />
a particular sort of frigidity about it. She was looking at me as<br />
much as to say, " Well I can't ask you what you are doing about the<br />
Budget, but I would like to say something". Understanding this I said,<br />
" Now what have you got on your mind?" She said, " Do you know the<br />
greatest problem, socially, that you have?" She paused for an answer.<br />
I wasn't game to make one. Then she said, " The greatest problem is<br />
the problem of housing people who are now old, who ought to be looked<br />
after in circumstances that make them feel that they are living in a<br />
home of their own". This was, I thought, a magnificent sugagestion. It<br />
was translated into cold, financial terms; and so the Act was<br />
introduced and the scheme has gone on. As you know the contribution<br />
by the Government has been doubled.<br />
What I like about it is this: when I was a schoolboy in<br />
Ballarat I lived with an old and rather dour Scots grandmother, in a<br />
house in which the only two books available for my consumption, apart<br />
from such as I might smuggle in at the ripe age of about 13 or 14+, were<br />
the Bible and Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. Not a bad library if I may<br />
say so, not at all bad. On the other side of the road, enclosed in a<br />
corrugated iron fence, and housed in the most gloomy horrible looking<br />
building was what was then called " the Benevolent Asylum". Even as a<br />
boy it gave me the horrors. It was so " institutional" as we now say;<br />
ihad a rusty look, and a rusty flavour about it. There were old<br />
men, elderly men, and old women or elderly women who sort of sat around.<br />
Such a condescension on the part of the communityl<br />
Those days, I am delighted to know, have gone. All of a<br />
sudden we have discovered that after all it isn't a crime to reach the<br />
age of 65 I'm $ 6 myself and Iregard that as the smallest of my<br />
crimes. But it is not given to everybody to be able to live in the<br />
old family home, to live with the family in normal circumstances.<br />
This is not easy. To be able to go, not into a sort of conglomerate<br />
mass in which everybody feels organised, but to go into a place which<br />
is one's own home there it is, the bedroom, the little sitting room,<br />
the kitchenette, the garden outside this is of the essence of human<br />
dignity. And I believe that one of the great things that our<br />
generation has done and it has done dome pretty silly things in one<br />
way or another has been to realise that you have to produce<br />
circumstances in which people feel that they are living in their own<br />
home, under their " own vine and fig-tree", in the old phrase, able to<br />
live to themselves when they want to, able to move around and entertain,<br />
or be entertained by their friends when they want to be. This, I<br />
think, is magnificent. I have no doubt that in another 50 years time<br />
what is being done in places like this will have been far excelled in a<br />
thousand places all around Australia.<br />
It is a very, very happy occasion for my wife who, as I say,<br />
gave the initial -the word is " nudge" the initial nudge on this<br />
matter some time ago. It is a * great pleasure for us to go around and<br />
see places that strike one as not being the least that can be done, but<br />
as the best that can b~ e done. There is such a difference, isn't there,<br />
of atmosphere in all this? Not something done grudgingly, but<br />
something done with a full understanding of human beings, and of human<br />
values, </p>
<p>Nov the last thing I want to say to you is this. References<br />
have been made to the Department of the Interior which has done<br />
magnificent work, and the Department of Works, to my expensive friend<br />
Mr. Overall, the Chairman of the Commission Oh, by the way I wilil<br />
interrupt myself. I must tell you something about Mr. Overall, do you<br />
mind? Occasionally if you say to a Minister, or to a Department, * Yes,<br />
we'll approve of that", nothing much happens for a month or two. But<br />
when Mr. Overall has some proposal up, and it is usually a very<br />
expensive one, before the Government and he knows it has been considered<br />
in Cabinet that day, he will ring up the secretary to the Cabinet before<br />
midnight and say, " How did my proposal get oh?" If the answer is " It<br />
was approved", he has the bulldozers on the site at 8 o'clock next<br />
morning. ( Applause) This dynamic drive has meant a great deal to<br />
Canberra, and I am sure has meant a great deal to you.<br />
But you may talk about the Department of the Interior you<br />
may talk about Government policy, you may talk about the Capital<br />
Commission, but there is no Government Department that administers<br />
humanity. There is no DepartW nt of Humanity. There can't be. You<br />
can't deal with kindness and goodwill and human understanding by<br />
regulations or rules, or by a Department. Wihat you need to convert to<br />
a place like this from being a collection of bricks and mortar, into<br />
being a collection of individual homes is human understanding. And it<br />
is on that side that those for whom Mr. Sautelle speaks matter so much:<br />
people who have maintained their interest. I see a dozen of them here<br />
this afternoon who as I know, have devoted a lot of their time and a<br />
lot of their atteniion to this matter. This is where humanity comes<br />
in, and escapes through the red tape , escapes through the specifications<br />
escapes through the Statutes or regulations, and converts the whole<br />
place into your home, somebody' else's home, the home of your friend,<br />
in which you are not ordered about, but are assisted to live your own<br />
lives in the happiest possible fashion.<br />
Sir, it is because of all these things that I have the<br />
greatest pleasure in the world in declaring the building Open. </p>
