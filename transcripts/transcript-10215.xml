23 January 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
RADIO INTERVIEW WITH ALAN JONES RADIO 2 UE<br />
E &amp; OE<br />
JONES: Prime Minister, good morning.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Good morning Alan,<br />
JONES:<br />
Happy new year to you.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
And to you too.<br />
JONES: It's going to be a tough year, isn't it?<br />
PRIE MINISThR:<br />
Yes but that's what's involved in this Kind ofjob and this native title issue is one of tile<br />
most difficult any government is likely to face. There are many groups in the<br />
community, the Aborigines, the farmers and the miners and the broader Australian<br />
community who have all got legitimate concerns and interests and it's not an issue that<br />
is going to be solved by any party grandstanding or any individuals in the community<br />
Fafrri23/ 01/ 97 11: 52 Pg: 1 </p>
<p>Fax from who are not affected and who don't have any authority to take decisions giving sort of<br />
unctuous moral lectures about what ought to happen.<br />
JONES: Who has been doing that?<br />
PRIME MNISTER:<br />
I think there's a tendency for some in the community to sort of say to the Government,<br />
well, you know, if you do this the world will come to an end. Let me make it very<br />
clear that we have taken no decision on this. I consulted the State governments<br />
yesterday. I will1 consult and negotiate with the Aboriginal leaders and also with the<br />
farming and mining leaders and after that process has been finished, the Government<br />
will then examine what it is going to do and..<br />
JONES: How long will that process last, do you think?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I hope it will only be a matter of a few weeks. People want certainty...<br />
JONES: I was just going to ask you that.<br />
PRIME NMNISTER:<br />
Can I say your introductory remark put the finger right on it-We have this problem<br />
because the former Government legislated on the basis that the grant of a pastoral lease<br />
extinguished native title. The recital to the Nativ Title Act contained that clear,<br />
unambiguous statement, Now that's the reason we've got a problem and that's why<br />
the option of doing nothing is simply not available.<br />
JONES:<br />
What then do you say in simple language to Australians today who know that your<br />
predecessor, and I am sure in all sincerity in order to secure " certainty" said validated,<br />
freehold grants, residential, commercial and pastoral or agricultural leases will<br />
extinguish native title. Won't they expect that to be honoured?<br />
PRIM MINISTER:<br />
I would understand if people did want that honoured and let me answer it another way,<br />
the fact that that has now been thrown into doubt, or not only thrown into doubt,<br />
futher than that, in fact has been in part repudiated by the High Court in the Wik<br />
decision, it does create an entirely new situation. Not a new situation in the sense of<br />
Farxom 23/ 01/ 97 11: 52 Pg: 3 </p>
<p>Fax from us revising the original High Court decision which abolished the doctrine of Terra<br />
Nullu. I do accept and my Government accepts that there is such a thing as native<br />
title and we respect that but what we are concerned about and what we must address is<br />
that native title is now a different thing, a bigger thing, a potentially more expansive<br />
thing than the Australian people were told it was by the then Prime Minister in 1993.<br />
JONES: And that's because we have a bigger problem than even the one you've outlined, don't<br />
we. The public are wondering who runs the country, the Government or the Hfigh<br />
Court.<br />
PRIMKE MMNSTER:<br />
Well the answer to that is very simple. The Government runs the country, or let me<br />
say, the people through the Government run the country. I don't run... the Australian<br />
people elect me. I am beholden to them. I am not a law unto myself. The Hfigh Court<br />
of Australia has a responsibility of interpreting the law, We have the responsibility to<br />
make it and if the interpretation, the current interpretation of the law is believed by the<br />
Government of the day to be contrary to the public interest, then in accordance with<br />
the Constitution, that Government has a perfect right indeed an obligation to change<br />
that law.<br />
JONES: Many decisions would have been made, wouldn't they, on the basis of the categorical<br />
assurance that Prime Minister Keating gave the Australian nation?<br />
PVIE MINISTER:<br />
Oh yes, oh yes.<br />
JONES: Now let me put it another way. What Prime Minister...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Many, many, many leases...<br />
JONES: I beg your pardon?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
including many leases which have been granted since the first of January 1994.<br />
Farxom 23/ 01/ 97 11: 52 PS: 4 </p>
<p>Fax from JONES: So isn't it then encumbered upon you to honour your predecessor's assurance in<br />
legislation? PRIM MINISTER:<br />
Well Alan I don't want to because I haven't finally decided what I am going to do and<br />
the Government hasn't addressed it as a Government, I don't want to sort of make<br />
firm, clear definitive statements until I have talked to everybody. I would be accused<br />
by some people of bad faith if I..<br />
JONES: Sure, I understand that. Well let me put it to you another way...<br />
PIME MINISTER:<br />
what the Aboriginal community has got to say. They are entitled to be heard. They<br />
indeed, some of them are entitled to say that the Native Title Act so far hasn't worked<br />
to help them very much.<br />
JONES: Sure. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
There's only been one claim determined. There are hundreds outstanding and the Act<br />
has been in existence now for over three years.<br />
JONES: Yes and indeed, we had a native title grant, a native title decision in relation to a<br />
property in New South Wales...<br />
IPRIME MINISTER:<br />
accused by some people of bad faith,<br />
JONES: Right, sure I understand that. Let me put it to you another way.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I do want to hear what the Aboriginal community has got to say. They are entitled to<br />
be heard. They indeed, some of them are entitled to say that the Native Title Act so far<br />
hasn't worked to help them... Faoxm 23/ 81/ 97 11: 52 Pg: </p>
<p>Fax from JONES:<br />
Yeah, sure.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
There's only been one claim determined. There are hundreds outstanding and the Act<br />
has been in existence now for over three years.<br />
JONES: Yes, and indeed we had a native title grant, a native title decision, in relation to a<br />
property in New South Wales at Crescent Head.<br />
PRIME MINSTER:<br />
That's right.<br />
JONES: When that native title decision was made and title was granted by the courts we then<br />
found that that was actually sold. So they'd established that they bad an inalienable<br />
right to the land but that right actually could be bought by the Government if you paid<br />
the right price. Does this raise some suspicions as to whether we're in it for spiritual<br />
reasons or for money?<br />
PRIM1E MINISTER:<br />
Oh, well I don't want to make a broad, rash judgement. I suppose it depends upon the<br />
individual. There would be some people who would be concerned entirely about the<br />
economics of it, there'd be people who'd be concerned about the economics of<br />
something else, but I suppose in that sense they're no different from other sections of<br />
the Australian community...<br />
JONES: As I said to you before...<br />
PRIME NMISTER:<br />
that land as an economic asset as well as giving them some kind of security. Now<br />
that applies to all of us I guess.<br />
JONES: But as I said to you before, you see, there are many Australians who are going to die<br />
with never having had title to anything because on $ 350 a week they can't afford a<br />
house and they can't afford a car. Faoxm 23/ 01/ 97 11: 52 Pg: 6 </p>
<p>fa fram 23/ 01/ 97 11: 52 Pg: 7<br />
PIME MINISTER:<br />
That's right.<br />
JONES: They get public transport and they rent. They now find though that some people can,<br />
in fact, be awarded native tidle and then sell it for $ 800,000. Now a caller to the<br />
programme early this morning said ' aren't these sorts of developments fostering a kind<br />
of sense of discrimination that we're trying to remove?'<br />
PREIE MINISTER:<br />
Well, Alan, I can understand people having all sorts of feelings because of the<br />
confusion that has been created in this whole area. I mean, native title itself was a very<br />
unusual concept because for almost 200 years we'd operated on the basis that there<br />
was no such thing as native title and in good faith people had been granted leasehold<br />
estates. We were told that they were unaffected, we are now told that leaseholders<br />
who acquired leases in good faith, perhaps their grandparents in the last century<br />
acquire leasehold estates in good faith, now find that they may have to do co-exist on<br />
those leasehold estates with other people. It is a very confusing situation.-.<br />
JONES: Can I just, can we just...<br />
PR3M MINSTER:<br />
What I'm trying to do is calmly..<br />
JONES: Yes. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
and with justice to all parties reach an understanding and determine the direction in<br />
which I'm going to take.<br />
JONES: Yeah, and the tone of your remarks this morning, might I say, confirms that. Could I<br />
just end this then, Pimie Mnister, in another way perhaps because what Prime<br />
Ministers say to the nation is virtually a prospectus. It sets out in the public's mind the<br />
truth about a given issue. Now if a company misleads or erroneously States or<br />
deceives or distorts the truth they're taken to the cleaners, directors can be jailed.<br />
Now I come back to the point, and you've answered this in one way but I'd just like<br />
you to make a final comment about it in all sincerity Mr Keating sought the passage of </p>
<p>Fax from 23/ 01/ 97 11: 52 Pg: 8<br />
the Mabo Legislation by issuing is prospectus to the nation and it contained the<br />
assurance that pastoral leases extinguished native title. Can there be any resiling from<br />
that position?<br />
PRIE MINISTER:<br />
Well I'll answer that in another way, as I did before, the Australian people having now<br />
been told that that representation is wrong and having been told that by the High Court<br />
of Australia, they are entitled to say to their Government ' will you go back to the<br />
drawing board and sort this out and give us a set of laws which are fair to everybody<br />
but deliver us certainty'. In other words, our responsibility now is to look at this thing<br />
afresh recognising, as I said a moment ago, that there is an element in our law now<br />
called native title, we're not going back on that but it's the extent of that native title<br />
and the aptitude of that native title which is now at issue. We did believe that a<br />
pastoral lease superseded it. Everything you said about the prospectus is right. That<br />
was the whole basis of the Keating legislation. We now find that is not the case and<br />
we owe it to the Australian people...<br />
JONES: And you'll try to resolve it in some weeks?<br />
PRI[ ME MINISTER:<br />
In a way that is fair to the Aboriginal people, but also in a way that is fair to the<br />
farmers and miners and is also, by delivering economic certainty and therefore the<br />
potential for creating jobs, fair to all of the Australian people.<br />
JONES: Good. One final thing, nothing to do with Mabo. HMAS Voyager was cut in two<br />
after a collision with the aircraft carrier Melbourne and that was way back in 1964 82<br />
were killed. Governments paid damages to all survivors on board the Voyager. It was<br />
our worst peace time, maritime disaster. We've got a 57-year-old William Maclean<br />
has throat cancer that he attributes to excessive drinking and smoking to overcome the<br />
post-traumatic stress of the Voyager disaster. He actually was awarded after a trial, a<br />
six week trial, $ 1.7 million in damages. Your Government is appealing the damages<br />
and have forced a retrial. Is that the compassionate thing to be doing?<br />
PRIE MINISTER:<br />
It is a matter before the courts. Let me say two things, I think the appeal was actually<br />
commenced before the change of Government, I'm not saying that in any critical<br />
fashion, I may be wrong about that but I think it possibly was. I will be examining that<br />
matter. I don't...<br />
JONES: He's got a tracheostomny, he can't even speak. </p>
<p>Fax from : 23/ 01/ 97 11: 52 Pg: 9<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Alan, Alan, I will be examining the matter. I can't say any more than that.<br />
JONES: Okay.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
For reasons I hope you'll understand.<br />
JONES: I do.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Okay. JONES: I hope you're not out to kill him.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I will be examining the matter Aan.<br />
JONES: Okay, get back to you. Thank you for your time.<br />
PRJME MINISTER:<br />
Thank you, bye.<br />
