CHECK AGAINST DELITVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVRY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCH OF AUSTRALIAN FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE<br />
CANBERRA 29 AUGUST 1ggo<br />
I want to extend my sincere thanks to you, Professor Craig, and<br />
to the Academy, for the honour you have done me today.<br />
Australia's international image as a modern and sophisticated<br />
society and not just our image, but our caaity to be a<br />
modern and sophisticated society is profoundly influenced by<br />
the standing and achievements of our scientists and our<br />
scientific institutions.<br />
As Australia's national scientific Academy, you play a vital<br />
role in maintaining and enhancing that image and that capacity<br />
by establishing and maintaining standards of scientific<br />
endeavour and achievement, by recognising outstanding<br />
contributions to the advancement of science, and by maintaining<br />
open channels with your peers abroad.<br />
Election to the Academy recognises that an Australian<br />
researcher is of the highest international standard. The fact<br />
that a disproportionately high number of your Fellows have also<br />
been elected to the Royal Society of London and to the US<br />
National Academy of Sciences is a valid measure of the quality<br />
and standing of Australian science.<br />
So to have received this honour from you is something I truly<br />
value. I accept it not as a personal tribute but as a vote of<br />
confidence by the scientific community in the thrust of the<br />
decisions my Government has taken in recent years.<br />
We have endeavoured to promote the emergence in this country of<br />
a culture in which science and technology are vital elements.<br />
While it is heartening to know you appreciate the Government's<br />
role in that endeavour, let me acknowledge that the effort has<br />
truly been a collective one, reliant on the broader scientific<br />
community for its success. To that extent this medal also<br />
belongs to those many people in the scientific community<br />
including many here today who have offered us their advice,<br />
wisdom and support.<br />
Ever since the First Fleet Lieutenant, William Dawes, began<br />
setting up his astronomical observatory at Port Jackson,<br />
Australia has been a fertile and productive soil for basic<br />
scientific inquiry. </p>
<p>From Lt Dawes' telescope through to the giant radioastronomy<br />
dishes that scan the skies from western New South Wales, and in<br />
every other field of research, it has been the public sector at<br />
the forefront of the nation's scientific effort the public<br />
sector, as a proud and committed sponsor of Australian science.<br />
Even so, the increased pressure on Government budgets, the<br />
proliferation of exciting and important fields of research,<br />
and, I believe, an increasing and legitimate demand by society<br />
for the products of relevant research have all meant that<br />
science has had to struggle for fair recognition of its role<br />
and importance.<br />
I don't think I would find any argument about that here!.<br />
So it was all the more significant then, that the recent<br />
election saw for the first time the discussion of science as an<br />
issue in its own right.<br />
You recall I said during the election campaign that Australians<br />
can be content no longer to be the lucky country we need also<br />
to become the clever country.<br />
To that end, we had allocated before the election<br />
$ 1 billion for a package of science and technology measures and<br />
we have moved since the election to implement my election<br />
promise to create a network of Cooperative Research Centres.<br />
It's not my intention to outline these measures in detail<br />
today. Let me remind you instead why we have allocated such<br />
considerable sums of public money to science why, for<br />
instance, we consider it important to keep young Australian<br />
researchers in Australia and give them the support and<br />
recognition their work deserves.<br />
The answer of course is that if we are to maintain our place in<br />
the first rank of the developed nations we must embrace, and<br />
embrace enthusiastically, a culture in which science and<br />
technology play central roles.<br />
We are, after all, in the region of the world which is growing<br />
fastest and which counts among its member countries some of<br />
those at the forefront of scientific effort.<br />
To maintain and improve living standards for all Australians we<br />
must increasingly add value to our natural endowments. We must<br />
develop a wide range of goods and services which will be world<br />
competitive because their competitiveness has been enhanced<br />
through the application of Australian cleverness.<br />
Thirty years ago, C. P. Snow bemoaned the chasm between the ' two<br />
cultures' of liberal and scientific research. Today, the<br />
challenge is more urgent. We need to build a bridge over the<br />
gulf that has kept science and scientists too isolated from the<br />
broader social imperative of creating and enhancing prosperity. </p>
<p>3.<br />
I don't dispute that a clever country is one in which basic<br />
scientific research can take place unfettered by the demands to<br />
make it turn a dollar. But at the same time, a clever country<br />
is one in which the best scientific minds of the country are<br />
alive to the questions posed by that other science the dismal<br />
science, economics: how to lift prosperity, enhance economic<br />
competitiveness, boost productivity.<br />
In a clever country, " Made in Australia" must become synonymous<br />
with high quality content and performance. It must be a symbol<br />
of skill, not just good fortune.<br />
That is ultimately why reforms such as the Prime Minister's<br />
Science Council and the Cooperative Research Centres are<br />
critically important initiatives.<br />
Let me say too how pleased I am with the way in which both<br />
these initiatives are progressing.<br />
The new policy machinery for science and technology has three<br />
elements: the Chief Scientist, Professor Ralph Slatyer; the<br />
Prime Minister's Science Council; and the Coordination<br />
Committee on Science and Technology. Together with ASTEC, they<br />
provide the Government as a whole, and me in particular, with a<br />
breadth and depth of policy advice never previously available<br />
to a Commonwealth Governiemt.<br />
The Science Council has already attracted widespread attention.<br />
It is a high level forum at which science and technology issues<br />
of national importance can be discussed with me and my senior<br />
Ministerial colleagues, in the presence of leading<br />
representatives from the business, research and government<br />
communities. I am pleased to note that you, Professor Craig,<br />
and your predecessor, have participated in each of the meetings<br />
already held and made valuable contributions to them.<br />
This Council has established a forum comparable in<br />
effectiveness to that in other leading countries namely, a<br />
forum that reports directly to the Head of Government. This<br />
arrangement was strongly supported by the Academy for the very<br />
good reason that issues of science and technology now pervade<br />
the Commonwealth bureaucracy. In order to provide an overview<br />
of science and technology, it is essential that the advisory<br />
mechanisms focus on the Head of Government.<br />
This machinery is being strengthened by the progressive<br />
establishment of a network of science advisors, at a very<br />
senior level, in those Departments with major responsibilities<br />
for performing or funding science.<br />
Turning to the Cooperative Research Centres Program, I am<br />
delighted with the enormous support it has received from the<br />
scientific community, from industry groups and from State and<br />
Commonwealth bodies.<br />
The Centres stand for excellence, relevance and cooperation:<br />
excellence of research, and relevance and applicability of<br />
research results, achieved through cooperation betweeen<br />
researchers and research users. </p>
<p>It is a formula for good science a formula, we believe, for<br />
successfully making the clever country a reality.<br />
I am conscious that the establishment of the program has<br />
resulted in people from a wide variety of institutions talking<br />
to one another and establishing cooperative arrangements, to a<br />
degree which has never happened before.<br />
In a very real sense this important process is as important as<br />
the Centres which finally emerge and I hope that, even for<br />
those proposals which may fail to obtain funding, enduring<br />
cooperation arrangements will become established.<br />
I take this opportunity of placing on record again the<br />
critically important role played by Ralph Slatyer in the<br />
preparation and development of this concept.<br />
Professor Craig,<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
It is deeply appropriate that we should today be marking the<br />
establishment by the Academy of the Australian Foundation for<br />
Science. This is a very welcome initiative.<br />
The Academy already has a strong record of achievement in<br />
raising the quality of scientific education and improving<br />
public awareness of science.<br />
The text books produced by the Academy have served generations<br />
of Australian school children well. The Academy's Science and<br />
Industry Forum has been instrumental in bringing together<br />
leaders of industry, science and government.<br />
This new initiative of yours can build on these activities. It:<br />
can draw research organisations, business and government<br />
together to promote science and in turn show how that science<br />
can be used for the benefit of the nation. I am particularly<br />
pleased to see ANZAAS, Australia's oldest organisation for the<br />
promotion of science, and the Australian Science Teachers'<br />
Association, have both decided to join the Foundation.<br />
I congratulate the Academy on proposing this way to meet the<br />
challenges ahead and congratulate the Fellows on backing it so<br />
strongly with their own resources. I hope the venture gains<br />
similar from support the whole scientific community, industry<br />
and the community generally. We all have much to gain from a<br />
broader acceptance of the value of science and technology to<br />
our society.<br />
In thanking you again for the award you have given me, it is<br />
now my pleasure to launch the Australian Foundation for<br />
Science. </p>
