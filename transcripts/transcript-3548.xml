PRIME MINISTER'S INTERVIEW WITH SRI LANKA BROADCASTING<br />
CORPORATION 15 DECEMBER 1974<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S VISIT: INTERVIEW WITH SRI LANKA<br />
BROADCASTING CORPORATION,<br />
FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S INTERVIEW<br />
WITH SRI LANKA BROADCASTING CORPORATION HELD IN COLOMBO<br />
AT 0815 HOURS SUNDAY 15 DECEMBER 1974.<br />
1. QUESTION: MR PRIME MINISTER, SRI LANKA HAS CLOSE LINKS<br />
WITH AUSTRALIA.<br />
WHAT ARE THE MEASURES THAT BOTH NATIONS COULD TAKE TO<br />
FURTHER STRENGTHEN THESE TIES PARTICULARLY IN THE FIELD OF<br />
ECONOMIC CO-OPERATON?<br />
ANSWER: I LOOK FOR14ARD TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE LONGSTANDING<br />
TIES BETWEEN SRI LANKA AND AUSTRALIA.<br />
APART FROM OUR CONTINUING CO-OPERATION IN INTERNATIONAL<br />
FORUMS LIKE THE COMMONWEALTH AND THE UNITED NATIONS, I<br />
WOULD HOPE THAT-OUR TIES WILL BE FURTHER CONSOLIDATED<br />
THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF TRADE, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND<br />
THE GROWING NETWORK OF CULTURAL AND OTHER CONTACTS.<br />
2. QUESTION: WHAT ARE THE PRINCIPAL EFFECTS OF THE<br />
ENLARGEMENT OF T-HE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY ON THE<br />
AUJSTRALIAN ECONOMY? AND WHAT STEPS IS AUSTRALIA TAKING TO<br />
COPE WITH ANY PROBLEMS ARISING IN THIS CONTEXT?<br />
ANSWER: THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE COMMUNITY HAS NOT HAD MUCH<br />
EFFECT ON THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY IN TOTAL.<br />
IT HAS MEANT SOME RE-DIRECTION OF AUSTRALIAN EXPORT TRADE IN<br />
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS AWAY FROM EUROPE TO OTHER, AND<br />
PRINCIPALLY ASIAN, MARKETS.<br />
THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD HAS BEEN MADE EASIER FOR 0 MNON, </p>
<p>AUSTRALIA BY THE STRONG WORLD DEMAND FOR FOODSTUFFS<br />
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. s<br />
A NOTABLE EXCEPTION TO ALL THIS HAS BEEN MEAT MORE<br />
ESPECIALLY BEEF.<br />
BRITAIN WAS ONCE A VALVED MARKET FOR AUSTRALIAN BEEF, BUT<br />
WITH THE CLOSING OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY MARKET<br />
TO IMPORTS OF BEEF, THE BRITISH MARKET HAS OF COURSE ALSO<br />
BEENJ CLOSED TO AUSTRALIA..<br />
AT THE SAME TIME, THE JAPANESE HAVE CLOSED OFF THEIR-MEAT<br />
IMPORTS.<br />
SO WE HAVE SOME VERY GREAT PROBLEMS WITH BEEF.<br />
I SHALL TAKE THIS UP IN BRUSSELS AND THE OTHER E. E. C.<br />
CAPITALS IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.<br />
ON THE OTHER HAND, BRITAIN HAS SOUGHT TO CONTINUE<br />
TO IMPORT SUGAR FROM AUSTRALIA AS IN THE PAST.<br />
THr EEC RULES WILL NOT PERMIT THIS.<br />
BUT IN THE CASE OF SUGAR, THE BRITISH HOUSEWIfVES ARE THE<br />
LOSERS AS AUSTRALIA HAS NO DIFFICULTY IN FINDING ALTERNATE<br />
LONG-TERM MARKETS FOR SUGAR.<br />
IN GENERAL, AUSTRALIA WELCOMES THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE<br />
EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY, AND APART FROM THE EVIDENT<br />
POLIT ICAL BENEFITS WHICH WILL FLOW FROM PROGRESSIVE MOVES<br />
TOW.' ARDS GREATER POLITICAL UNION IN EUROPE, AUSTRALIA SEES<br />
THE EMERGENCE OF AN ECONOMICALLY STRONG EUROPE AS ADVANTAGEOUS'<br />
TO AUSTRALIA'S LONG-TERM TRADE INTERESTS.<br />
NO DOUBT PROBLEMS WJILL ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME AND WE HOPE<br />
TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO SIT DOWN WITH THE EUROPEANS TO<br />
TALK THEM THROUGH, AS WE HAVE FOR SOME YEARSo AND THIS<br />
I'LL BE DOING IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.<br />
3. QUESTION: ON THE SUBJECT OF THE INDIAN OCEAN PEACE ZONE<br />
PROPOSAL, WHAT ROLE DOES AUSTRALIA EXPECT TO PLAY IN-ITS<br />
IMPLEMENJTAT ION?<br />
ANSWER: AUSTRALIA WANTS TO HELP REDUCE TENSIONS IN THE ASIAN<br />
REGION. SHORTLY AFTER MY GOVERNMENT CAME TO POWER IT ANNOUNCED THAT<br />
AUSTRALIA WOULD SUPPORT SRI LANKA'S INITIATIVE FOR A ZONE<br />
OF PEACE IN THE INDIAN OCEAN.<br />
WE SHALL CONTINUE TO CO-OPERATE IN THE UNITED NATIONS WITH<br />
so N </p>
<p>-2-<br />
SRI LANKA AND THE INDIAN OCEAN LITTORAL STATES ON ! HIS QUE: STION.<br />
WE HAVE MADE REPRESENTATIONS TO THE GREAT POWERS BOTH THE<br />
UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION URGING ON THEM MUTUAL<br />
RESTRAINT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR MILITARY PRESENCE IN<br />
THE INDIAN OCEAN.<br />
WE SHALL CONTINUE TO TAKE WHAT STEPS WE CAN TO REDUCE-THE<br />
PROSPECTS OF GREAT POWER CONFRONTATION IN THE INDIAN OCEAN.<br />
4. QUESTION: WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THE VIEW THAT THE<br />
PROSPECTS FOR WORLD PEACE ARE BETTER NOW THAN THEY HAVE EVER<br />
BEEN SINCE THE LAST WORLD WAR?<br />
ANSWER: YES, I WOULD. I DON'T DENY THAT THERE CAN BE AN<br />
OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES IN INDIVIDUAL REGIONS.<br />
I THINK IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THEY WILL SPREAD ROUND THE WORLD.<br />
PEACE DOES NOT COME SIMPLY BECAUSE WE WANT IT.<br />
IT HAS TO BE CONSOLIDATED PATIENTLY THROUGH CONTACTS<br />
BETWEEN LEADERS, ACCOMMODATIONS AND THE RECONCILIATION<br />
OF CONFLICTING INTERESTS.<br />
DETENTE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION MUST<br />
BE MADE TO WORK AND THE MIDDLE AND SMALLER POWERS OR THE POWERS<br />
WHICH ARE STRATEGICALLY LOCATED COUNTRIES LIKE AUSTRALIA<br />
AND SRI LANKA MUST CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE THE LARGER<br />
COUNTRIES TO GRASP THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR BUILDING AN<br />
INTERNATIONAL STRUCTURE OF PEACE AND THIS STRUCTURE , I<br />
BELIEVE, IS BETTER NOW THAN IT HAS BEEN SINCE THE SECOND<br />
WORLD 9AR.<br />
QUESTION: ONE FINAL QUESTION. HOW DO YOU ENVISAGE<br />
AUSTRALIA'S FUTURE ROLE IN ASIA AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF<br />
ASIA ASIAN COUNTRIES?<br />
AN SWER:<br />
THIS IS A VAST SUBJECT OF COURSE. BRIEFLY, AUSTRALIA<br />
SEEKS TO ESTABLISH HER OWN IDENTITY IN ASIA.<br />
OUR HISTORY AND OUR GEOGRAPHY HAVE AFFORDED US AN OPPORTUNITY<br />
TO BUILD LASTING FRIENDSHIP WITH THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES*<br />
OF ASIA AND THE PACIFIC NOTWITHSTANDING OUR ETHNIC, CULTURAL<br />
AND HISTORICAL DIFFERENCES.<br />
ONE MEDIUM FOR DOING THIS OF COURSE IS THE COMMONWEALTH OF<br />
NAT IONS.<br />
MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF NATIONS LIE " N<br />
.2~ K N </p>
<p>AROUND OR IN THE INDIAN OCEAN AND THE SOUTH PACIFIC.<br />
MY GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED THAT AUSTRALIA SHALL PLAY A<br />
CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN DEVELOPING REGIONAL CO-OPERATION IN ASIA<br />
AND IN STRENGTHENING OUR TIES BILATERALLY WITH THE COUNTRIES<br />
OF THE REGION.<br />
WE ALSO HOPE TO PLAY A ROLE IN PROMOTING DEVELOPMENT THROUGH<br />
MUTUALLY ADVANTAGEOUS TRADING ARRANGEMENTS AND THROUGH OUR<br />
AID PROGRAMS.<br />
I'VE ANNOUNCED WHILE I'VE BEEN IN SRI LANKA THAT WE ARE<br />
MAKING A GRANT OF 30,000 TONNES OF WHEAT.<br />
WE DON'T WISH TO BE REGARDED AS SOME TRANSPLANTED EUROPEAN<br />
OUTPOST. RATHER WE W'ANT TO BE ACCEPTED AS A HELPFUL AND CO-OPERATIVE<br />
MEMBER OF AN ASIAN REGION WHICH IS GROWING IN ECONOMIC<br />
STthE,* GTH AND STABILITY.<br />
INTERVIEWER:' WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR THIS INTERVIE. </p>
