SUNDAY, 7 OCTOBER 197* 9<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The rough and tumble of debate in the Parliament is an<br />
accepted part of the democratic way of life. It has been<br />
a feature of Parliamentary life in Australia since Federation.<br />
This country has seen great Parliamentarians, on both sides<br />
of the House, adept at scoring political points but<br />
without stooping to personal smear to make their points.<br />
Peripheral politics unfortunately appears to be a trademark<br />
of Labor's current leadership. It is a leadership so devoid<br />
of constructive alternative policies that it believes it has<br />
no other way to grab a headline, to make an impact.<br />
Mr. Hayden's main Parliamentary tactic seems to be the<br />
vilification of individual members of the Government. He<br />
seizes on opportunities for personal attack in a way which<br />
smacks of desperation. He chases headlines at any price.<br />
He showed clearly what he thought of the investigation into<br />
Ian Sinclair's family companies by refusing to regard the<br />
matter as in any sub-judice. What came to hand he used in<br />
the Parliament without weighing the cost to the credibility<br />
of Parliament or the implications for justice to an individual.<br />
The results of the N. S. W. Government, and of Mr. Hayden's<br />
handling of this particular affair, have gone a long way to<br />
creating the circumstances where it could be very difficult<br />
indeed to get a fair trial for Ian Sinclair. And in this<br />
country, every person deserves a fair trial.<br />
This week, Mr. Hayden attempted to smear Kevin Newman, the<br />
Minister for National Development, basing his allegation<br />
on nothing more than a Sunday newspaper gossip column.<br />
The report was quickly demonstrated to be so inaccurate and<br />
misleading as to be ludicrous. It was a false report.<br />
Yet, within hours of its publication, Mr. Hayden had put out<br />
a press statement describing this item of inaccurate gossip<br />
as " the latest outrage". The Sunday paper gossip was repudiated<br />
by the Minister, by the Deputy Leader of the Party, Phillip Lynch,<br />
by myself, and also by a senior journalist who was in a<br />
position to know the facts. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Mr. Hayden is using these tactics because the policies of the<br />
Labor Party are still the old, tired and failed policies of<br />
the Whitlam years; policies that wrecked Australia once<br />
and would do it again.<br />
We have only to look at the most recent Federal conference<br />
of the Labor Party in Adelaide the supreme policy-making<br />
body of the Labor Party which binds all its members.<br />
The most damning indictment of the Labor Party's lack of<br />
policies came when Mr. Hayden did a lunchtime deal with the<br />
left on the critical question of economic policy. Quite<br />
simply, there is no mention of inflation and the critical<br />
importance of combatting inflation in the Labor Party's<br />
economic policy and platform.<br />
Let me read it to you and see if you can understand it:<br />
" With the understanding and co-operation of the trade union<br />
movement, development of economic policy-which would encompass<br />
wages, incomes, non-wages incomes, the social wage, taxation<br />
reform and elimination of tax avoidance, and which will achieve<br />
a more equitable distribution of our national wealth and income<br />
with the commitment to the maintenance of real wages by<br />
quarterly adjustments and the passing on of the benefits<br />
of the-increases in productivity". That is the end of the<br />
quote and it is also the end of the policy.<br />
That is the Labor Party's economic policy. Mr.. Wran called<br />
it a " hotch potch", and Mr. Hawke, always a little plainer<br />
in what he says, called it " a gutless sell-out to the Left".<br />
It is a meaningless policy. It is a non-policy. It would<br />
be a disaster.<br />
Where does Mr. Hayden get this policy advice? The great<br />
" moderate" Victorian Labor man, Bill Hartely, let the secret<br />
: drop. he said Mr. Hayden's chief economic adviser is<br />
Mr. Jim Roulston, a powerful and influential figure with the<br />
left-wing controlled Amalgamated Metal Workers and Ship Wrights<br />
Union. The Adelaide Conference also made it plain that, given the<br />
chance, Labor would abolish every law that would place any<br />
restraint on any trade union. Simply, under Labor, trade<br />
unions would be above the law. They would be able to do<br />
anything in the name of industrial action.<br />
That Adelaide conference also showed Labor to be anti-investment<br />
and anti-development, and consequently anti-jobs. They would<br />
reneg on uranium contracts. They would have a resource tax<br />
and make enterprises unprofitable. They would destroy<br />
thousands of jobs in the process. Isn't it an old familiar<br />
Labor story? They destroyed development and investment when<br />
in office. They have the same policies. They would do it again.<br />
./ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
They would strike against international organisations. They<br />
have said they would establish a body which would, in effect,<br />
do little more than spy on those organisations. What would<br />
they do with the information? They would give it to the<br />
domestic and international trade unions. Under these<br />
circumstances, how much foreign investment would we attract?<br />
How many of our great resource projects would go ahead.<br />
They would stop development dead in its tracks. They would not<br />
only destroy development, but they would continue with<br />
their policy of destroying the Senate the State's house.<br />
They still have a policy of reducing the Senate's power so that<br />
it could never protect the States particularly the smaller States.<br />
Under Labor, Victoria and New South Wales alone would carry<br />
referendum. On top of that, Labor would tear up the patiently negotiated<br />
agreement with all States Liberal, National Party and Labor<br />
that resolved finally the vexed question of territorial seas<br />
and submerged lands. This question had bedevilled<br />
Commonwealth-States relations for years. With the aid of<br />
patient, cool work by the Attorney-General, Peter Durack, this<br />
Government resolved it to the benefit and satisfaction of everyone.<br />
What would Labor do? They would assert total Commonwealth<br />
supremacy off-shore, upsetting all the agreements with all the<br />
States, and moving to total Canberra control. It is all<br />
Mr. Whitlam all over again.<br />
These are just some of the policies Labor is bound to the<br />
so-called alternative policies as Australia moves into a<br />
new decade. They show that Mr. Hayden is an increasing<br />
captive of the Left. Is it any wonder that Mr. Hayden plays<br />
the man and not the ball. Is it any wonder that he feels at<br />
home smearing and vilifying and jumping on the Sunday newspapec<br />
gossip column bandwagon.<br />
It is a sad and sorry day for Australia when the Opposition<br />
Leader has to rely on the gossip columns of Sunday newspapers<br />
to try and assert his<br />
I believe Australians are sick and tired of gutter politics.<br />
They are s ick and tired of politics of innuendo and slander.<br />
It should be put aside and we should-concentrate on policies.<br />
