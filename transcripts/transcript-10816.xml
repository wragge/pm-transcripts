  I have decided to broaden the role of the Special Minister of State,</p>
<p> Senator Nick Minchin, as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>  At present, Senator Minchin assists me in relation to native title</p>
<p> issues and matters concerning the Constitutional Convention.</p>
<p>  Now that the bulk of his work regarding the Convention has been completed,</p>
<p> it is possible to expand his role as Minister assisting me across</p>
<p> the range of all of my responsibilities.</p>
<p>  I am sure that Senator Minchin will discharge his new responsibilities</p>
<p> very effectively.</p>
<p>  1 March 1998</p>
