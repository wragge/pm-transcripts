    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government is planning for the future health workforce needs of New South Wales.</p>
<p>The Government is providing up to $13.6 million to support additional clinical training places for university students in a range of services from metropolitan rehabilitation services to rural and remote health services. </p>
<p>Broken Hill, Newcastle, Shoalhaven, Ryde and Western Sydney are just some of the locations throughout New South Wales where students will now have additional high-quality clinical training opportunities.</p>
<p>The students will be able to experience the private, public and not for profit health sectors in New South Wales.</p>
<p>The University of Sydney, University of Western Sydney, The University of Newcastle, University of Wollongong and Ramsay Health Care are amongst the recipients of up to $13.6 million injection into training.</p>
<p>This will support approximately 1,744 additional clinical training placements for students currently enrolled in medicine, nursing, psychology, physiotherapy, pharmacy, podiatry and a number of other disciplines. </p>
<p>This announcement is in addition to the Rudd Government's recent announcement of $632 million to train an additional 6,000 GPs and specialists over the next decade.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government is building a health workforce to meet the needs of all Australians, now and into the future.</p>
<p>Under the National Health and Hospitals plan, the Rudd Government will shoulder the majority of the funding burden - 60 per cent of all public hospital services - meaning more money is available to meet rising health costs. The Government will also fund 60% of teaching and research as part of this plan.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government's plan will see health services funded nationally and run locally through local hospital networks to deliver better health for local communities.</p>
