    <content><![CDATA[<p>As part of Australia's new five-year development partnership with Indonesia, the Australian Government will provide up to $50 million to assist Aceh to build a prosperous and peaceful future after the dual impact of the tsunami and 30 years of civil conflict left it as one of Indonesia's poorest provinces.</p>
<p>These funds will be used to:</p>
<p>     * improve the quality of education for Acehnese children;</p>
<p>     * assist governments to deliver better services;</p>
<p>     * help community members, including women, to participate in decision-making and democratic processes; and</p>
<p>     * rebuild livelihoods and foster economic development.</p>
<p>This marks the transition from Australia's highly successful rehabilitation work in Aceh to an ongoing commitment to the province's longer-term development.</p>
<p>Since the tsunami we have rebuilt health and education facilities and village halls at the heart of communities, supported housing reconstruction through land mapping, and strengthened democratic processes and government service delivery.</p>
<p>Today I inaugurated the Ulee Lheue Primary School, one of more than 2000 being built across Indonesia to improve opportunities for children, including more girls, and provide a better quality education.</p>
<p>Education is fundamental for economic development and we will build on our successful program with funding for Aceh of $8.5 million over three years.</p>
<p>We will continue to help local governments in Aceh to deliver better services and help citizens participate in decision-making and democratic processes.</p>
<p>To support peace efforts and long-term stability, we will focus on getting people into paid employment, including women who have traditionally been excluded from the workforce.</p>
<p>Today the Governor of Aceh and I opened Aceh's peak aquaculture prawn and fish hatchery and training centre, a centrepiece of efforts to increase economic opportunities and livelihoods for Acehnese people.</p>
<p>Australia's substantial longer-term commitment to Aceh is an integral part of our development partnership with Indonesia, which focuses on the 100 million people across Indonesia who live in poverty on less than US$2 a day.</p>
<p>We will build on the close bonds between Australians and Acehnese forged since the tsunami and assist Aceh to achieve a sustainable and prosperous economic future, peace and stability.</p>
