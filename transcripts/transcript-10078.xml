21 August 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
THE JOHN LAWS PROGRAMME<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
LAWS:<br />
Well the strategy worked didn't it. John Howard and his team got the bad news out of the<br />
way before the budget night very cleverly. So today the media is focussing on what's new<br />
and what's new is good news, that's what's new. Tax breaks for families, rebates for<br />
private health insurance, capital gains tax reduced for small businesses. All very, very,<br />
very, very, very good stuff. And as I say it's a very clever strategy, it's a very clever<br />
budget. Of course there's new bad news as well but we already knew about the cuts to<br />
tertiary education, cuts to public service, cuts to Aboriginal funding, cuts to the ABC.<br />
Some consider some of those bad, but those who'll suffer by the new bad news are the<br />
well off people so they're hardly in a position to be able to complain too much. There'll<br />
be a Medicare hike for high income earners who don't have private health insurance for<br />
people who earn over fifty grand a year. And the doubling of tax on employer funding<br />
superannuation, but only for people earning over $ 85,000 a year. The tax increase<br />
actually kicks in when you're on about seventy I think. So it's clever, see what I mean.<br />
Print media has fallen into line, their editorials are mostly glowing, we'll give you a run<br />
down on those a bit later. And who mentioned the word broken promises, who said that?<br />
There are two classes of promises it seems now with this government, core promises<br />
which are kept and then those other not so important promises, the ones we really didn't<br />
mean kind of promises, surely you knew we were joking kind of promises I guess. Any<br />
way we'll talk about them, you know the ones, remember how they were going to keep<br />
the regional development programme, pretty important to the busbies, it's going to be<br />
scraped. Universities weren't going to be touched, they're the important ones to me.<br />
We'll talk to the Prime Minister in a moment or two and discuss these and more.<br />
Prime Minister John Howard good morning and welcome. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Good morning John, very nice to be with you again.<br />
LAWS: It's good to have you there John and I guess you're happy the way the budget has been<br />
accepted, because it's been accepted well in the main hasn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes I'm very pleased. We worked hard. We tried to get the balance right, we tried to get<br />
the economics right, we obviously tried to get the politics right, we tried to spread the<br />
burdens around, we certainly were determined to keep the core commitments we made<br />
and we have in fuill. The family tax package, about which we spoke during the election, I<br />
think both of us remember that interview.<br />
LAWS: Yes. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The private health insurance rebate, the commitments to capital gains tax, the maintenance<br />
of the social security safety net, a whole raft of promises and let me just take this promises<br />
thing head on. I think on the scale of keeping promises this has been a gold medal<br />
performance. Now I acknowledge there are some areas where that hasn't occurred. I<br />
know some have been deferred, but I think when you take into account the promises<br />
which really, people really voted on in the election it's very, very difficult to find any of<br />
those that haven't been honoured in their substance or in their entirety. Now I know there<br />
was a lot of debate before the election about the state of the books. I found when we got<br />
into power that the situation was somewhat worse than I thought it might be. I did make<br />
all of those promises with the genuine intention of keeping them and not cynically and I<br />
was determined throughout the whole of the budget preparation, I kept reminding my<br />
Ministry that it was incredibly important that the promises that we made to the people and<br />
on which they voted be honoured and I think you'll find when you comb through the<br />
budget we've done very well.<br />
LAWS: Well you've done well. I wouldn't say that you've done very well. And what you said<br />
prior to the election was even if it meant going further into debt you intended to keep the<br />
promises. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we are not going to achieve a surplus for a year later than we'd originally hoped to<br />
do. So in that sense I've done that. The budget will be an underlying balance in year two.<br />
LAWS:<br />
But you did say, the reason that I'm asking the question is that we've had quite a lot of<br />
reaction to it, in fact, I've had a number of faxes and some E-mail that's been interesting, a<br />
fellow Liberal Party Member who says he worked hard to help you win the last election.<br />
I've got the document here.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Sure.<br />
LAWS: And he's now seeking legal advice about suing you for breach of contract, now that's<br />
pretty hot stuff.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I know you have to keep the confidentiality of what he said to you but I'd be interested to<br />
know which branch member that was. I don't mean that in any sense other than that you<br />
do occasionally get people who pose and Liberal Party Branch Members who aren't. I<br />
mean, that has been known, people actually ring up and say you know I voted Labor Mr<br />
Keating but you know I'm not going to vote again because of such and such. I mean it<br />
can happen to us. Now, look, I will leave it to the Australian people over the next few<br />
days to make a judgement as to whether we've, on a scale to ten, how well we've done in<br />
keeping our promises. I mean I'd put myself between seven and eight.<br />
LAWS: You would?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I would. Unqualifiedly. I mean, John, from the last election, I mean, what did Howard<br />
really promise people at the last election? He said he'd do something about families, he'd<br />
do something about small business, he'd keep Medicare and he would do something for<br />
the elderly. I've done all of those. </p>
<p>LAWS: Well the elderly haven't faired to well in some areas.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Really? I mean, they've got the self-funded retirees thing. That's been, that's what I<br />
promised them and they get the benefit of the health insurance rebate.<br />
LAWS:<br />
Yeah, and if they're not on pensions they'll have to buy themselves a place in a nursing<br />
home. That's going to cost you about twenty six grand.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well that happens at the moment if you have to go into a hospital.<br />
LAWS: Yes, we're talking about a nursing home.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, but in many cases you know John, you have co-located hostels and nursing homes<br />
and you have to pay something to go into a hostel.<br />
LAWS:<br />
But elderly people who aren't on pensions. I mean, you have done something as you said<br />
you would and you did say you'd do it to me prior to, the budget, prior to the election for<br />
self-funding retirees as did Peter Costello. But you've given with one and taken away<br />
with the other. I mean twenty six grand is a big slug.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes but John unless we get some more capital into nursing homes they will further<br />
deteriorate, many of them are now dilapidated, and the only way of getting capital into<br />
nursing homes is to allow the charging of entry fees as now occurs with hostels. You can<br />
quite literally have a situation where a hostel and a nursing home can be on the same site.<br />
You can go into a hostel, you may need to go into the nursing home and you get a refund<br />
of the entry fee you've paid to the hostel even though you're then going into the nursing<br />
home. Now the economics of that are unsustainable and this is something that will apply<br />
in the future, it obviously doesn't apply to people who are already there. There will, of<br />
course, be allowance made in the operation of the system for people who have no </p>
<p>resources at all. So it won't be applied without regard to people's capacity to pay. It is<br />
an additional impost..<br />
LAWS: That's it.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
1 accept that. I don't deny that. It's an impost that we think makes very good policy<br />
sense and no government can ever be in a situation of being required never to change<br />
anything. I mean, I don't recall being asked about that in the campaign. I don't recall any<br />
commitments being made in relation..<br />
LAWS:<br />
No well you and I discussed that but we didn't discuss that issue. But the $ 26,000 is a<br />
pretty big slug and it will be the sons and the daughters who are going to suffer. It's not<br />
going to be the elderly people themselves.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it means it will come out of, you know, in reality it's something off their ultimate<br />
inheritance, of course it is.<br />
LAWS: Well if there is an inheritance.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
In some cases there won't but in many cases there will be.<br />
LAWS: But if there isn't and in many cases there won't be that means... John let me finish. That<br />
means that the younger people, the sons and daughters are going to have to come up with<br />
the $ 26,000.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it depends, there will be provision in this for people in really necessitous<br />
circumstances. </p>
<p>LAWS: I've heard you came up with the $ 26,000 figures based on a $ 2,000 fee for 13 years. But<br />
the harsh reality of this is, one in three people entering nursing homes last one month, the<br />
majority only last twelve months. So $ 26,000 is a bit steep if you're basing it on $ 2,000<br />
fees... PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It is the equivalent, the figure was related to the figure that is charged in relation to hostel.<br />
LAWS: Okay, well if it's $ 2,000 a year that's calculated on a 13 year stay in a nursing home and<br />
yet a lot last one month and the majority only last twelve months. Sad though it may be,<br />
fact. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well John the economics of this are important as well as the compassion side of it. And<br />
what we are doing with nursing homes is no different, no harsher, no less fair, no less<br />
reasonable than what we are doing in relation to hostels. And I say again that there's<br />
something strange about somebody going into a hostel, you know, they're distant hope<br />
believes that if they have to go into a nursing home well they can just go from the hostel to<br />
the nursing home which is often next door. You make an entry contribution to the hostel,<br />
but it can't be used in any way in relation to your nursing home bed. And that really<br />
means that a lot of money that would otherwise go into nursing homes to make them<br />
better and to make them more comfortable and to make them more congenial won't and I<br />
think you will find that many of the people on the welfare side of the provision of nursing<br />
homes, that run them, will see this as, while something that nobody wants, a sensible<br />
policy and quite defensible and reasonable.<br />
LAWS: Oh I'm sure that those running the nursing home would be delighted with it.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
John it's not just from a point of view of their own business situation, but many nursing<br />
homes now are quite run down. And they are really quite run down and it is necessary to<br />
get some more capital into them. </p>
<p>LAWS: But as I say I can understand the nursing home people being delighted given the fact that I<br />
gave you that the $ 26,000 estimated on $ 2,000 a year, that's a 13 year stay in a nursing<br />
home which won't happen. So the nursing homes are going to do..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
But many have a non-profit. I think the point I was really trying to make John is that<br />
many of the people who run nursing homes not for profit will also find this a sensible<br />
policy change.<br />
LAWS: Do you think Australians accept your distinction between so called core promises and<br />
those that you have now felt free to, how many promises have you broken?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
On the totality, not a lot.<br />
LAWS: But how many?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look John, I haven't sat down and done a tabulation of that but I can tell you...<br />
LAWS: Isn't it important enough to have a tabulation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No I think what is important is to ask yourself what did the public vote for at the last<br />
election? The public voted for a family tax package, the public voted for private health<br />
insurance rebates, the public voted for a maintenance of the Medicare safety net. The<br />
public voted for relief for small business. The public voted for all of those things. The<br />
public voted for relief for self-funded retirees and I've delivered on all those things. The<br />
public also voted in a Government in the hope that it would do the right thing by the<br />
overall health of the economy. And one of the things we, I mean, Peter Costello made this<br />
point at the weekend that one of the great promises we made was to get the economy<br />
right. John this budget has really put the national accounts in very good shape... </p>
<p>LAWS: Oh yeah, you get no argument from me with that, or with the people.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
And that's what the people voted for, it's part of the assessment that people will make.<br />
This question of this or that type of promise, this question of the aggregate view people<br />
take in relation to the keeping of commitments. I will leave that to the Australian people<br />
to judge, they will remember what I spoke to them about during the election campaign.<br />
LAWS:<br />
Many who have been hurt, or believe they've been hurt. You see, I think that everything<br />
that's been done in the budget is terrific without exception. I think that it all make a whole<br />
lot of sense. I worry about that $ 26,000 thing because that's going to hurt the children of<br />
elderly people and that bothers me. But the rest of it you get total support from me.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Can I just say not all children of elderly people are unable to make a contribution towards<br />
the welfare of their parents.<br />
LAWS: Oh no, certainly not. But $ 26,000 is a fair amount...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Can I just quietly say, I mean, you're talking about the care of your mother or father<br />
who's spent their life looking after you and caring for you when you need it. I think we've<br />
got to keep a sense of balance, because if it doesn't come from there it's got to come out<br />
of the budget and that means higher taxes or fewer benefits.<br />
LAWS: But it is an impost that wasn't there before.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
John I'm not denying that. I'm not denying that. I mean, it's not an impost that we had in<br />
the back of our pocket. It was a proposal for change which came up during the course of<br />
the budget preparations. It was not mentioned in the election campaign because it was not<br />
in contemplation, but it's not something we said we wouldn't do, it is just something that </p>
<p>never came up. During the course of the budget preparation it was one of the options for<br />
policy improvement and expenditure saving.<br />
LAWS: Okay let's move along because otherwise we'll be stuck on the one subject. There was<br />
another appalling riot in Canberra yesterday, I'm sure you agree. I thought that the<br />
behaviour of some of the Aboriginal people there was absolutely abysmal. Young men<br />
deliberately standing in sparring position poking jabs at police. The whole thing was very<br />
ugly and it did have, sadly, a sense of de ja vu about it. Now all this came about because<br />
of their cuts to aboriginal funding again. The majority of Australians would agree exactly<br />
with what you're doing. I think you're trimming a bit under a hundred million a year from<br />
them. But I discovered recently that ATSIC actually underspent its budget over the last<br />
three years by something like $ 61 million. So really they're only losing about $ 30 million<br />
aren't they?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That's right.<br />
LAWS: And they're keeping billions?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, we're talking here over a four year period. Can I say this figure of $ 400 million<br />
that's been flung around is a four yearly figure. It's roughly 100 million a year. So if<br />
you're going to say $ 4 million you've got to say $ 4 million out of over $ 4 billion and that<br />
will put it in perspective and you can't on that basis say that we have decimated Aboriginal<br />
funding or that it's racist...<br />
LAWS: Well particularly as they're underspending about $ 61 million.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well the underspend I am told has averaged about $ 61 million over the last three years.<br />
Now that may not be underspent in the next few years, I hope it's not because the<br />
reductions that we're making which are largely in what I might loosely call the political<br />
and cultural activities of ATSIC. We are actually going to spend more money next year<br />
on health and education and housing for Aborigines. Can I say that again, we're going to<br />
spend more money on health and housing and education for Aboriginal people. </p>
<p>LAWS: You don't have to say it too much because I said it for you yesterday. And it's true.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I mean, they do have to be said again because the nonsense that is being talked about<br />
Aboriginal Affairs by our opponents, by some people leading the Aboriginal community,<br />
not by all of them, and by our political opponents has really got to be nailed. I mean, I am<br />
not against the process of reconciliation. We are not into asking the Aboriginal<br />
community to carry a disproportionate burden, but given the job we've got and given the<br />
hundreds of millions that have gone into this area over the last few years and the feeling in<br />
the community, not all it has given us a big dividend in terms of improved health and<br />
educational achievements. These sort of cuts are defensible, they are fair, they do not<br />
decimate Aboriginal fu~ nding, they do not represent some kind of financial genocide as one<br />
person alleged and I think the whole debate should just simmer down and people should<br />
look at it in perspective. We are about building one nation.<br />
LAWS: What do you do then when you see incidents like we saw yesterday for that performance<br />
outside Old Parliament House with the burning of the Australian flag. I mean, how can we<br />
expect to have unity if there are people within our community who want to burn our own<br />
flag. And it is our flag and that's indigenous peoples flag as well as the rest of Australia's<br />
flag? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I could say two things, and I'll repeat what I said on Monday that this Government<br />
will never ever change a policy because of violence or demonstrations or threats of them.<br />
Any body who thinks that we're going to crumble and change in attitude because of a<br />
display of physical violence has got another thing coming. That is utterly un-Australia I<br />
want to believe, I do believe, that the behaviour of those people is rejected by the great<br />
bulk of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders in this country.<br />
LAWS: Do you think they were incited?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh look, I find it very hard to believe that demonstrations like yesterday and Monday<br />
weren't in some way premeditated. </p>
<p>LAWS: Well apparently the federal police do.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We are invited to believe by Jennie George and Bill Kelty that there were really two<br />
demonstrations on Monday.<br />
LAWS: One a hundred and fifty meters from another.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Exactly and the fact that they were, many of the demonstrators were wearing CFMEU<br />
that's a big union t-shirts and caps, that was purely coincidental, purely coincidental and<br />
the fact that some of the people there sort of came from the first demonstration that's<br />
purely coincidental, and when I met Jennie George and Bill Kelty they, in an unbelievably<br />
disingenuous performance, they tried to pretend to me that they really didn't know very<br />
much about what had happened.<br />
LAWS: Bill Kelty even suggested that that performance on Monday was something that Australia<br />
should have been proud of because it was the biggest demonstration in the history of<br />
Australia and Canberra. I mean, it was hardly the sort of thing of which Australians would<br />
feel proud or should feel proud.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Now, I know that there are many trade unionists who are disgusted about what happened<br />
on Monday and I am prepared to accept that the rank and file of decent trade unionists in<br />
Australia no more believe in political violence then you or I do. I know that and I'm<br />
prepared to accept that there are a lot of people in the Australian Labor Party who would<br />
be upset. I know there are. But when you organise a demonstration like that, you have to<br />
accept some of the responsibility for what happens.<br />
LAWS: Especially when you crank them up with inflammatory comments. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Particularly when, and I don't think, I'm not normally critical of him over things like this<br />
but when Kim Beazley got up and said that this government 1) hates workers 2) hates<br />
students 3) hates women in the workforce and 4) hates Aborigines now they were his<br />
words hate.<br />
LAWS: Pretty inflammatory.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Very inflammatory. It demeans a man, and although he's my political opponent for whom<br />
I have respect, I mean, I don't hate, I don't think I've ever accused my political opponents<br />
in quite such stark terms as that sort of thing. I mean of course we differ on policy but we<br />
have an obligation in the language we use. I mean I am careful in what I say. I get<br />
attacked by my political opponents if I use what they regard as politically incorrect words,<br />
but I must say I will go on using, some politically incorrect words because I believe the<br />
intimidation of political correctness into our language has been absolutely appalling and<br />
one of the things my government is trying to do is to change that because I think we're<br />
again being able to talk to each other in terms that we can all understand and not in some<br />
of this politically sanitised gobbledegook.<br />
LAWS: That's exactly what it is well good on you. Don't be politically correct and you'll remain<br />
popular. Now listen the Budget will see, somebody has to pay. And I mean, what you've<br />
done is terrific and to get all that money in that period of time, somebody's got to suffer.<br />
It's going to see tens of thousands of public servants out of work isn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
There will be fewer people in the public sector, but remember that large numbers of those<br />
people will get jobs elsewhere and also can I make the point that public servants and I'm<br />
not begrudging it to them, let me make that clear. They do have better redundancy<br />
arrangements than people in the private sector. They really do.<br />
LAWS: Oh they certainly do. Why do they? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
They're arrangements that have been negotiated over the years between Governments and<br />
public sector unions.<br />
LAWS:<br />
Why don't you change those?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, some of them I think are fair and reasonable.<br />
LAWS: Why should people in Government have privileges that people who aren't in Government<br />
don't have?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, there are arguments for and against. The traditional argument used to be that they in<br />
the main were not paid as well.<br />
LAWS: Oh PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No no. In some cases. I mean it is true that the top levels of the public service, I mean,<br />
the head of the Treasury or the head of the Prime Minister's department and they have<br />
very responsible managerial positions and very influential positions, they are not paid<br />
anywhere near as well, they would only be paid a fraction of what the managing directors<br />
of large corporations would be paid, so it is fair to say that in some areas there's an<br />
unfavourable comparison. I think if you get fuirther down the pay scale the proportions<br />
alter. People sort of in the middle or below the middle in the public service I think are<br />
probably better looked after than people in the private sector. So it does sort of vary. But<br />
the point I'm making is that yes there will be public service retrenchments but many of<br />
those people will be picked up in the private sector, but there have been retrenchments<br />
going on in the private sector for years. I mean...<br />
LAWS: There have, there have been. But will there be alterations made to the redundancy<br />
arrangements of public servants? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't have any specific changes in mind at the present. As part of the workplace<br />
bargaining process..<br />
LAWS: But that doesn't mean there won't be changes.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, when you have a workplace bargaining system, a public service manager might say<br />
to his workforce, look if you are prepared to get rid of this stupid practice I'm prepared to<br />
increase your salary and the workers themselves may agree to take a higher rate of pay in<br />
return for a lesser redundancy provision. I mean that would be a matter for them to<br />
negotiate. So, I can't say for all time that all of those arrangements are going to remain<br />
but I equally want to say very directly to public servants that we don't have in mind any<br />
blanket proposals for change in that area.<br />
LAWS: So in other words if there are any changes to the redundancy arrangements of public<br />
servants, those changes will not be instigated by your Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well they could be instigated as a result of negotiations between managers and unions but<br />
we don't as a matter of policy have any specific changes at present in mind. And can I just<br />
correct something that..<br />
LAWS: You said?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I said. I think actually you said on this occasion.<br />
LAWS: Nobody passed me a note. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That the entry contribution, it's an average of $ 26 000 a person. 40% of residents are<br />
unlikely to pay any entry contribution and the entry contribution is drawn down at a rate<br />
of 2600 a year and this is important to your point about the one year and the one month<br />
and the balance is repaid to the person or their family when the resident leaves the nursing<br />
home. LAWS: That is important, thank you for that.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That is a very very important thing. So this idea that you get a bonanza if sadly the<br />
resident dies within a month of going there, that's just not correct.<br />
LAWS: So in other words it is really not an upfront fee?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it is a deposit, it is an entry fee and then it is drawn down at a certain rate per year. I<br />
think it is pretty fair.<br />
LAWS: But out of interest what's going to happen to the $ 26 000? Is that going to be in some<br />
kind of trust?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That's going to be held by the nursing home in some kind of..<br />
LAWS: What guarantee have you got you'll get it back?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, you will get it back. You've got my guarantee you'll get it back. </p>
<p>LAWS: Okay. I said a moment ago that I don't believe that people in politics, people in<br />
Government should have any benefits that aren't available to the general public,<br />
particularly in the areas of superannuation. Did all that come as a shock to you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No. You're talking about the parliamentary superannuation.<br />
LAWS:<br />
The extraordinary amount people are taking out after putting in very little by comparison.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Can I just make one point before I launch directly on to that. The increased contributions<br />
tax for high income earners announced last night, that of course will apply to members of<br />
Parliament, I want to make that clear.<br />
LAWS:<br />
Yes but they still will have that extraordinarily high return.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look I have never denied that that particular scheme is generous. I've never denied that.<br />
I would say, to put it into perspective that over the years, one of the reasons that it has<br />
risen in generosity is that particularly for Ministers and people in very senior positions in<br />
politics their remuneration has not really kept pace with the sort of pay that is received by<br />
corporate executives. I mean, leave me out of it, but the Treasurer of Australia gets paid<br />
less than $ 200 000 a year.<br />
LAWS: Yes but I don't understand why the analogy should be drawn between the private sector<br />
and the Government. I mean, you people are in Government by choice, as people are in<br />
the private sector by choice. You've made<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Of course we do, of course we are. I'm just asking you to if you are looking at the<br />
aggregate remuneration of people in politics and the aggregate remuneration of people in<br />
the private sector. I just want you to take the whole lot into account. </p>
<p>LAWS: Yes, well, I do that, but I don't think it warrants comparison, nor do I think that people...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh you don't.<br />
LAWS:<br />
No I don't because...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
But I thought you were drawing a comparison, I misunderstood your question.<br />
LAWS:<br />
No no I'm not trying...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I thought you were saying that people in the public sector shouldn't get things that people<br />
in the private sector get.<br />
LAWS: And that's what I said in relation to anything but in particular in this instance to<br />
superannuation? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
So you think it's fair to make a comparison?<br />
LAWS: I can't put $ 110,000 into a super fund and walk away with 1.2 or 1.7 million.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, but you or somebody in a equivalent position in the private sector can earn<br />
immeasurably more without attracting any public opprobrium or criticism than a senior<br />
politician. </p>
<p>LAWS: But that's right, but I made a conscious decision...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I mean... . John look, I don't object to it.<br />
LAWS:<br />
No, I know you don't.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I believe in people of high skill and ability being properly remunerated and providing they<br />
pay their fair share of tax, good luck to them, God bless them. I believe in that kind of<br />
society. The last thing I want to build is a sense of envy about people who succeed in this<br />
country as one of the curses that sometimes deflects this country.<br />
LAWS: It sure does.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
You need achievers. You need people who are successful and providing a; they pay their<br />
fair share of tax and b-they have a sense of, sort of, philanthropy and are willing to help<br />
and many of our high income earners are very much in that gravity I think they make an<br />
enormous contribution. So I'll be the last person to bucket them.<br />
LAWS: I know you're not bucketing them. But the point I'm making is that I think it's<br />
unreasonable that people who are in Parliament are able to receive that sort of reward at<br />
the end of a parliamentary stint for that sort of investment when it's not available to people<br />
in the private sector. And I don't think that people in government should have privileges<br />
that people in the private sector don't have.<br />
HOWARD: I have to say in defence of the members of Parliament, because of the fishbowl existence<br />
that politics is, it is just in practice, impossible for people carrying the same<br />
responsibilities, the same obligations, the same duties and having the same high level of<br />
skill in politics to ever receive the same level of remuneration in those positions that<br />
people in the private sector receive. </p>
<p>LAWS: That's quite true, but...<br />
HOWARD: And there is no way in the world that the Treasurer of this country could ever be paid a<br />
salary remotely resembling the salary that will be paid to the Chief Executive of the<br />
Westpac Banking Corporation or the chief executive of the major companies in Australia.<br />
Now, I'm not saying the Treasurer should be. I mean, as far as I'm concerned, once you<br />
get to a certain level of income... you know, you've got an adequate living and you can<br />
look after your family... I'm not a particularly materialistic person, but I do think when<br />
you're looking at things like super, which I acknowledge as very generous, I think you<br />
have to bear in mind the fact that when you're comparing like with like to say that so the<br />
Treasurer of Australia doesn't carry the same, indeed he carried more responsibility than<br />
the chief executive's of the major corporations. Yet in remuneration terms he's not within<br />
a bulls roar and never will be.<br />
LAWS: But nobody is saying that. Nobody is saying that he doesn't have that sort of<br />
responsibility, as you say, he has more.<br />
HOWARD: No, I'm just making the observation.<br />
LAWS: But did you ever consider that some of the chief executives in the industry in Australia are<br />
over paid?<br />
HOWARD: Well, that might be right and they lose their jobs some of them. But equally we can lose<br />
our jobs too and that's fair enough, it's part and parcel... because some of them are. Even<br />
if you got rid of the ones that were over paid and even if you reduced some of the more<br />
excessive salaries they'd still be a country mile in front of the Federal Treasurer. I'm not<br />
trying to breed any envy about them. I mean, I think we've got some very good managing<br />
directors. As I say, I'm not an envy man, I'm the last person... </p>
<p>LAWS: I accept that. I know that. You've allowed farmers to keep their diesel fuel rebate. Was<br />
that a difficult decision to make?<br />
HOWARD: In the end no. It was one of those things that was put on the list by the Department of<br />
Finance, which was its job. But the diesel fuel rebate is not a handout. It is an exemption<br />
from a tax which is a tax on road usage. And a great bulk of the diesel used by farmers is<br />
used for off-road usage and it would have hurt the rural sector...<br />
LAWS:<br />
The mining industry gets to keep the diesel fuel rebate too?<br />
HOWARD: Yes. There's some strengthening, some tightening of eligibility and there's a general<br />
crackdown on misuse in both sectors and we expect that with the tightening of eligibility in<br />
mining and the crackdown in abuse across the board, that will save $ 60 million in the first<br />
year and $ 120 million in the second. I think it was the right decision. It did involve a lot<br />
of discussion with the industry and I'm always happy to do that. I think it's always good<br />
policy making to sit down and discuss a problem with an industry. The mining and rural<br />
sectors are the massive contributors to the export earnings of this country.<br />
LAWS: What about the outback tourist operators?<br />
HOWARD: What do you mean?<br />
LAWS: Do they have the availability of the diesel fuel rebate?<br />
HOWARD: I don't think they do. I've never really thought about it.<br />
LAWS: I think they'd like you to. </p>
<p>HOWARD: Yeah, I'm sure. But they get something out of this budget. I mean they get included in<br />
the export market development grant system for the first time, so they'll be very happy<br />
with this budget.<br />
LAWS: I think they'd be happier if they had their diesel fuel rebate because after all they are using<br />
a copious quantity of diesel fuel and they are using it in the outback and they are using it<br />
to promote tourism in Australia. Even though it's a private enterprise, so's mining, if<br />
you're giving it to the miners shouldn't you give it to the tourist operators?<br />
HOWARD: I must say, in all the time I've been working on this budget that is not something I've<br />
focussed on. So in your inevitable style Mr Laws, you've given a ball that I have to let go<br />
through outside the off-stump and not slick, you know, flash at.<br />
LAWS: Can you get the Wally Grant of the Government to ring me later after he's cornered and<br />
tell me?<br />
HOWARD: I'll have a bit of trouble finding Wally, but he's gone to another world. But I'll try Ian<br />
Healy. LAWS: From what I hear you've inherited your own Wally haven't you, in the form of this Mal<br />
Colston. What do you know about Mal Colston?<br />
HOWARD: Well, not a lot. Although I think he was the Senator who replaced Albert Patrick Field.<br />
That has<br />
LAWS:<br />
Familiar... </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
An ironic, has a certain perverse symmetry about it I suppose.<br />
LAWS:<br />
Well, it probably has some enjoyable irony about it.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes well, we were not unhappy that he decided to resign from the Australian Labor Party.<br />
LAWS: Has he talked to you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, I haven't spoken to him. I'm sure he's talked to some of my colleagues in the Senate.<br />
But he put out a statement announcing his resignation in which he said that he accepted<br />
that the Government had an electoral mandate to implement certain things. Now, I<br />
thought that was very encouraging.<br />
LAWS: I think it's very encouraging. It won't be very encouraging to Cheryl Kernot though.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, maybe not. I don't know. It depends how the Democrats vote on certain things.<br />
The Democrats have continued to indicate to me that they are broadly in support of the<br />
industrial relations legislation and I hope that proves to be the case because that is still the<br />
big one as far as I'm concerned.<br />
LAWS: Well, if you've got the Democrats and you got Mal Colston you don't have to worry<br />
about.. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I don't know what Senator Colston's views would be on industrial relations. Senator<br />
Colston's still said that he will be guided by his life long Labor principles as well as a<br />
respect for our mandate and also a concern for Queensland. Now, how that all marries up </p>
<p>when it comes to the IR legislation I don't know, but I'm not talking about IF, perhaps I<br />
will, I haven't yet, but...<br />
LAWS: Gareth Evans reckons you bribed him.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Bribed him? Oh break it down. Bribed him?<br />
LAWS: Yes. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well Gareth Evans is the fellow you know, in 1990 there was we allowed the Labor<br />
Party Senate President to be elected unopposed and then they were going to elect our<br />
nominee for the Deputy Presidency and right at the last minute they decided, they did a<br />
deal with the Democrats and they installed, guess who? Senator Colston as the Deputy<br />
President. So I don't think Gareth can start giving any moral lectures about this. I mean<br />
let's face it...<br />
LAWS: So you haven't done a deal with Senator Colston?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look Senator Colston received our support. He's indicated publicly a disposition about<br />
things for which he believes he's got a mandate. As to how he reacts on particular things<br />
we'll just have to wait and see. But I am encouraged by the fact that he has said he<br />
believes that Governments have a mandate for certain things that they talked about in the<br />
election campaign and that obviously includes Telstra and I hope he also sees it including<br />
industrial relations. Now, he said that publicly and there's you know I think a clear hope<br />
on our part that he will give some effect to that, but that's a matter for him. He's been<br />
elected Deputy President....<br />
LAWS: And not bribed.. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No definitely not..<br />
LAWS: And won't wind up with a plum job in London. Oh that's Alexander's isn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
John you are being he is doing an excellent job as Foreign Minister.<br />
LAWS: Okay, well I hope it all goes very well, because it's very important to Australia that it does<br />
go well. Where do you expect that you are going to have problems apart from KR and<br />
there shouldn't be a problem there and I don't think.., you ought to sit down with Jennie<br />
George and have a yarn to her because I talked to her yesterday. I don't believe she<br />
understands it fully.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, she doesn't. And she keeps running around saying that we've broken our<br />
commitment about people not being worse off. I mean what I said and I repeat it, I'm<br />
sure I said it on your programme, that if a person goes from an award to workplace<br />
agreement, the take-home pay under the workplace agreement must be not less than the<br />
take-home pay that would have been received under the award. That was the rock solid<br />
guarantee I made..<br />
LAWS: And you did make it on this programme.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I did.<br />
LAWS: You made it prior to the last election.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I did, and she has grabbed hold of that and said, what Howard has promised is that no<br />
worker will be worse off under a Howard Government. Well I hope no worker is worse </p>
<p>off under a Howard Government but if a person should lose their job or take a salary<br />
reduction for whatever circumstances there are beyond my control, that surely doesn't<br />
represent a breach of my commitment but what would represent a breach would be if I<br />
passed a law which allowed an employer to force somebody on a workplace agreement to<br />
take less than what that person would have received if that person had stayed under his<br />
award and that won't be allowed.<br />
LAWS: Yes well...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
She can't seem to, I don't think she wants to accept it because it suits their political<br />
purposes to vilify this legislation. This legislation is hated by Jennie George because for<br />
the first time in Australia's almost one hundred year history, it will give people a genuine<br />
choice as to whether they want a union or don't want a union.<br />
LAWS: Well, you can understand that, not liking that about it, that's human nature.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
But that is what it is all about...<br />
LAWS: I understand that but it is a pity that she doesn't have a better understanding of it because<br />
when I talked to her yesterday she was very controlled, she was conciliatory even, but I<br />
think doesn't have an understanding of areas like part time work which seems to be<br />
another area in which she feels that people are going to be done. Anyway, it will certainly<br />
be watched, if it goes through, and it needs to go through because of the unfair dismissal<br />
laws which are nonsense...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh absolutely unfair.<br />
LAWS: It's going to be watched very closely. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Very very closely indeed.<br />
LAWS: Now Kim Beazley says that the Budget doesn't solve one of our biggest problems,<br />
unemployment and in fact he says it's going to make it worse.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, Kim Beazley could help unemployment come down by passing the industrial<br />
relations law, because if you can get that unfair dismissal law through you will immediately<br />
take away from small business all around Australia a real constraint on employing new<br />
staff. And I still meet men and women in small business who say if it weren't for that<br />
unfair dismissal law I'd take a punt.<br />
LAWS:<br />
And I'm one of them.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
And why should somebody in small business take on a person with the threat that if it<br />
doesn't work out that person will take them to the cleaners if they want to let them go,<br />
and that is happening. I have seen it happen first hand, I've talked to people, I have had<br />
people who are running small businesses say look I am not going to take on any more<br />
young people, I'm not going to do a damn thing until you get rid of that stupid law. So<br />
that stupid law, or the repeal of it...<br />
LAWS:<br />
Will help...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Will help. So Kim, please, get rid of it. I mean, still to this day I don't know whether the<br />
Labor Party is going to support a change in that. I don't think they will, but I hope if the<br />
Democrats come to the party in the Senate and I do hope they do, and I'll talk to all of the<br />
other independents again. I've spoken to the Greens, I've spoken to Senator Harradine.<br />
I'll be happy to talk to Senator Colston. </p>
<p>LAWS: It must be aggravating for you to have to, when you know that Australia wants it to<br />
happen, and they do want it to happen, when you know it is important and you know it is<br />
legitimate and you know that the stupid thing was brought in the first instance because<br />
they did a deal.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
About which we were not told before the 1993 election.<br />
LAWS:<br />
Well of course not.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I mean, Laurie Brereton and Paul Keating said nothing before the 1993 election about the<br />
unfair dismissal law.<br />
LAWS:<br />
It was a deal but I think they might go your way because the trade union movement at the<br />
moment is not much use to them is it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I hope they do but I don't mind, I mean, I'm perfectly happy to talk...<br />
LAWS: How do you feel about having to sit down with Bob Brown for example, who got .7 of a<br />
percent of nothing and discuss with him how it would be important to the country for him<br />
to do something. I mean why is this man standing in the way of important things?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I suppose that's a question he's got to answer, but John, my job is to get the<br />
Government's program through.<br />
LAWS: But is it annoying to have to do that? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, if I found all the things I had to do in politics too annoying I'd get out.<br />
LAWS: But that's one of the more annoying things?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look I don't want to I don't want to personalise it. We actually had an amiable<br />
discussion. Mind you, our views on most things are fairly wide apart.<br />
LAWS: I think it would be pretty easy to have an amiable discussion with Bob Brown if he talked<br />
about trees or sky. I mean, is this man a mental giant who can be obstructive to the<br />
introduction of bills.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, he's got a vote.<br />
LAWS: Well, so have we.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I know but he's got the vote where it counts at the moment. You don't get another vote<br />
for three years mate.<br />
LAWS: Thanks. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Neither do I. It's terrible isn't it.<br />
LAWS: It's tough. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'm in no hurry to have an election.<br />
LAWS: I imagine you are not, you seem to be having a pretty good time there.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think we are handling it pretty well.<br />
LAWS:<br />
Well, I hope the majority of this goes smoothly. It's important it happens quickly.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think it is. If we can get this Budget through quickly that will give a big surge to<br />
confidence and people will say right that's out of the way, they've done the job, we can<br />
now get on with doing something. We know where we stand, we know they are not going<br />
to you know do this or that, but they have done something else, we can handle that and<br />
then we can get on with our lives and people will start investing and spending again. I<br />
mean this is a real consumer confidence budget.<br />
LAWS: That's right and we've got to get it through in order to generate it.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Exactly and the momentum has got to be maintained.<br />
LAWS: I'm with you. I mean there are bits and pieces in there that people aren't going to like but<br />
you've got to swallow a bit of a bitter pill.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, you do and we've spread the pain around. </p>
<p>LAWS: Fairly. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
And the people who've got a quid they're making a bit of contribution too, and that's only<br />
fair. LAWS: Absolutely, I don't think anybody would argue with that. Well, I hope that everything is<br />
well with you and your family and I thank you very much for your time John. Good to<br />
talk to you.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Very nice to talk to you John. </p>
