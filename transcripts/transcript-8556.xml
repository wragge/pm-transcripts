PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. PJ. KEATING, MP<br />
AUSI'RALIA'S SECOND REPORT TO THE UNITED NATIONS<br />
COMMITTEE ON THE ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST<br />
WOMEN ( CEDAW)<br />
This morning I had great pleasure in formally presenting Australia's second<br />
CEDAW Report to Her Excellency Mrs Mervat Tallawy, the chairperson of the<br />
United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women.<br />
Present at the ceremony in the Prime Minister's sitting room were the Hon. Wendy<br />
Fatin MP, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women; the Hon.<br />
Justice Elizabeth Evatt, President, the Law Reform Commission and former member<br />
and Chair of the CEDAW Committee; Quentin Bryce AO, Sex Discrimination<br />
Commissioner, Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission; Kaye Loder,<br />
chair, National Women's Consultative Council; and Helen L'Orange, First Assistant<br />
Secretary, Office of the Status of Women.<br />
Australia is obliged to report every four years to the United Nations as part of our<br />
responsibilities as signatories to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of<br />
Discrimination Against Women, a convention the government ratified within<br />
months of taking office in 1983. By ratifying CEDAW we committed ourselves to<br />
developing policies and programs to improve the status of women in Australia. Thie<br />
Government quickly responded to this responsibility by using CEDAW as one of<br />
the constitutional underpinnings for the Sex Discrimination Act which was passed<br />
by the Parliament in 1984. Ratification of CEDAW also obliges us to report<br />
periodically on our progress in improving the status of women, and the Report I<br />
presented this morning is Australia's second such report. The Report was prepared<br />
and coordinated by the Office of the Status of Women ( OSW) in my department,<br />
with input from all departments of the Federal Government, the State governments<br />
of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, Western Australia and<br />
Tasmania, and the Governments of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital<br />
Territory. Non-government organisations' views were also formally canvassed for </p>
<p>the first time. The National Women's Consultative Council ( NWCC) held a<br />
consultation between key NGOs and members of the federal bureaucracy to explore<br />
views on Australia's progress in implementing the Convention.<br />
Australia's achievements in the course of nearly a decade of implementing the<br />
CEDAW Convention have won us international acclaim. My government is very<br />
proud that Australia is now considered a major player in international forums<br />
concerned with status of women issues, and we are committed to continuing the<br />
process of implementing the Convention and other measures to improve the status of<br />
women. Australia's First Report, considered by the CEDAW Committee in 1988, was<br />
commended for its scope and frankness. Our Second Report to CEDAW continues<br />
this tradition of openness about what remains to be done to fully implement the<br />
Convention. The period since our first Report has been one in which a number of<br />
important achievements have occurred.<br />
Those achievements include the following:<br />
Establishment of 30,000 new child care places under the 1988-92 Child<br />
Care Strategy<br />
Child care fee relief increased and indexed<br />
Fee relief for child care places extended to commercial centres<br />
Child Support Agency established<br />
National Agenda for Women launched<br />
Sole parent rebate and dependent spouse rebate substantially boosted and<br />
indexed All family payments for children ( Family Allowance, Family Allowance<br />
Supplement, Child Disability Allowance, Mothers Guardian Allowance)<br />
indexed to maintain real value<br />
National Committee on Violence Against Women established<br />
National Program for Early Detection of Breast Cancer established<br />
Early Detection of Cervical Cancer Program established<br />
Ratification of JiO Convention 156 on Workers with Family<br />
Responsibilities </p>
<p>Work and Family Unit established in Department of Industrial Relations<br />
Equal Pay Unit established in the Department of Industrial Relations<br />
Introduction of the Jobs, Education and Training ( JET) program for sole<br />
parents<br />
Our Government was the first in the world to issue a comprehensive policy<br />
document for raising the status of women when it released the National Agenda for<br />
Women in 1988. Each year the annual implementation reports on the National<br />
Agenda have provided a public measure of our progress, as have the annual reports<br />
under the Australian Women's Employment Strategy and the National Policy for the<br />
Education of Girls in Australian Schools. The second phase of the National Agenda<br />
is presently being designed and a renewed document will be released later this year.<br />
Similarly, Australia was among the first countries in the world to set in place a<br />
mechanism to evaluate the impact of Federal Budget decisions on women. The<br />
Women's Budget Statement has been tabled in Federal Parliament as a Budgetrelated<br />
paper every year since 1984.<br />
One of the most important elements of Australia's response to CEDAW has been the<br />
establishment of a specialised bureaucratic machinery in Federal, State, and<br />
Territory government departments to monitor, evaluate and advise on government<br />
policies and programs as they affect women. OSW in my department is part of this<br />
machinery.<br />
Australia has also been in the forefront in the range of government-funded services<br />
for women. Many are run by women, for women. For instance, Women's<br />
Information and Referral Services operate in all metropolitan and some regional<br />
centres as an access point to government services for women. A national network<br />
of 313 services exists for women escaping domestic violence. Under our National<br />
Women's Health Policy, a wide range of special early detection and preventative<br />
health services are provided for women, including Alternative Birthing Services, the<br />
Program for Early Detection of Breast Cancer and the Cervical Cancer Screening<br />
Program. Labour market reform and the processes of award restructuring have improved<br />
women's position in the paid workforce; the gender gap in wages has narrowed with<br />
the ratio of women's to men's earnings having reached 84 per cent. By international<br />
standards this figure is high, though the government remains committed to the goal<br />
of equal pay.<br />
Women's participation in the workforce continues to grow, especially that of<br />
women with children. 61 per cent of Australian women with children aged 5-12<br />
are in the workforce as are 45 per cent of all mothers of children aged 0-4, so the<br />
government is especially proud of its achievement in ensuring the continued growth<br />
in child-care places. When Labor came to office in 1983 there were 46,000 </p>
<p>community-based child-care places; there are now more than 134,600 and I have<br />
committed the governmnrt to providing 250,000 places by 1995. In just the past<br />
two years the number of families receiving fee relief for long day care has increased<br />
from 44,500 to 135,800 and the average weekly fee relief payments have increased<br />
per cent from $ 22 to $ 35 per week. Sole parents participating in the Jobs,<br />
Education and Training ( JET) Program have been major beneficiaries of the<br />
expansion in child care. Participation of sole parents in the workforce has increased<br />
from 36% in 1983 to 45% in 1992.<br />
The government has placed particular emphasis on consolidating and improving<br />
payments to families. We have indexed all family payments and, as of January<br />
1993, all will be payable to the parent most responsible for the care of the children,<br />
usually the mother.<br />
The ratification in 1991 of the International Labour Organisation Convention 156 on<br />
Workers with Family Responsibilities was another landmark for women. It<br />
committed the Government to develop policies and programs to minimise the<br />
pressures on people with jobs and families, and in particular address the double load<br />
carried by working women with domestic responsibilities.<br />
In the legal arena, the Sex Discrimination Act has been amended to improve and<br />
extend coverage, and the effectiveness of the Affirmative Action ( Equal<br />
Employment Opportunity for Women) Act 1986 has recently been reviewed<br />
through a process of community consultations which revealed a high level of<br />
acceptance by business and the community for these measures which aim to<br />
increase women's job opportunities<br />
The government recognises that to achieve our ultimate goal of full equality for<br />
women all levels of government still have a long way to go but the presentation of<br />
the CEDAW Report provides an opportunity to restate our commitment to that goal,<br />
and to say we welcome the comment and advice of the highly respected CEDAW<br />
Committee in its consideration of Australia's Second Report.<br />
