TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ KEATING MP,<br />
AND THE MINISTER FOR PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY, THE<br />
HON SIMON CREAN MPo PRESS CONFERENCE, 2 FEBRUARY 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: I've got a Cabinet meeting on which we've broken in thc course of the day<br />
and it's to reassemble at 3.3Opm, so we're going to be reasonably brief with<br />
you. The point of our press confercnce is to indicate that the Cabinet has<br />
adopted a reform package for the Queensl and ' sugar industry, which has<br />
been negotiated by my colleague Simon Crean, and is an interim reform<br />
package which dovetails in with the Queensland Government's reform<br />
program which mcets its next point of change in 1995-96. Thc sugar<br />
industry has bcen an industry which has been substantially regulated under<br />
laws of the State of Queensland. In a sense the Commonwealth plays, in<br />
this industry, a more peripheral role than it does in many others because the<br />
regulation and management of the industry has been by the industry itself<br />
and under arrangcemcnts constructed over a lon&amp; period of timc under<br />
Queensland law.<br />
We've made decisions today in consolation with thc industry. I visited<br />
Bundaberg with Brian Courtice, the Member for Hinkler, and members of<br />
t Takcotcs ggowers in November to get a first hand view of<br />
the problems and to try to understand bctter the industry. Simon has had a<br />
number of visits to the region to meet members of the industry,<br />
representatives of the Taskforcc, the Queensland Government, and we've<br />
developed between us a package.<br />
Part of the Commonwealth's responsibility in this is to make decisions in an<br />
area whcre we can, this is in relation to tariffs, which is for us the key to </p>
<p>unlocking a larger reform of the industry, and the larger reform goes to al<br />
those questions which deal with assignment, which deal with single desk<br />
selling, which deal with water articulation, which deal with the poolings, the<br />
two pools and the price differentials, these are the key issues in reform.<br />
So we have used the leverage the Commonwealth has, I think, sensibly to<br />
bring togcther a reform package which will, as most of the Governments'<br />
reforms have, over a period of time have been affccted on a phased basis<br />
which will be the case here. But I take this opportunity to congratulate<br />
Simon on getting this together. This has been a most contractible problem<br />
because it has been peculiarly a State problem and certainly on the part of<br />
Coalition Governments in Queensland in the past, no willingness to improve<br />
the flexibility of the industry over time. This has changed of course with the<br />
Goss Government and the Government there is working cooperatively with<br />
the Commonwealth Government. So I'd leave my introductory remarks at<br />
that and now invite Simon to add to them.<br />
SC: Well the detail is there, I suppose there are just two points that are important<br />
to make. Firstly, so far as the sugar industry is concerned the issue is not<br />
just about tariff, that I believe is a mistake that the Coalitions Parties have<br />
made. Tariff, as important as it is as a price support mechanism, is only<br />
worth $ 32 million to an industry which is now in excess of $ 1200 million<br />
dollars. But it is an important price support mechanism in the context of a<br />
corrupted world trading environment.<br />
I have always resisted throughout these negotiations, and for the purpose of<br />
setting up the task force, just treating tariff in isolation. If you look at the<br />
Industry Commission Rcport it identificd a number of impediments that had<br />
to be addressed but acknowledged that the only thing the Commonwealth<br />
could do was really phase clown tariff.<br />
In essence, what we have done is to use the leverage of what we can<br />
influence to affect change in other areas that the IC Report acknowledgcd<br />
we had no influence over, And that is what has been achieved. So whilst<br />
the tariff has been held, and as a result of holding tariff, if you are going to<br />
deliver it you have got to retain acquisition. The two important<br />
impediments to growth are the assignments systern, the means by which you<br />
open up thc land, and we now have an arrangement whereby that can be<br />
negotiated at the local level.<br />
The other important issue has been thepp rce pooi aI~ f ectswheb<br />
not only has a differential existed between that which is in the number one </p>
<p>pool, vis a vis the number two pool, it has also meant invariably that<br />
growers in the number two pool who arc the new entrants get less than<br />
world price. Now that is just a crazy signal to be sending out to ant industry<br />
that you want to expand, that you can't even get world price. Really what<br />
this agreement does without compensation, because the task force<br />
recommended a compensation package for the phasing out of the price<br />
pooling differentials, what we have achieved is a phase down by agreement<br />
with the cane growers and the Queensland Government so that we can get<br />
clearer market signals to the new entrants, because it is the new entrants<br />
which are going to undertake the expansion.<br />
So not only is this a strategy to deal with the tariff issue, because that's been<br />
the big political issue, but it's also a strategy for growth and expansion in the<br />
sugar industry. And most importantly, it's been a strategy developed with<br />
all of the stake-holders, and esscntially all of those stake-holders support<br />
the thrust of this agreement. It's been a very fulfilling exercise and<br />
demonstrates yet again our approach to industry dcvelopment compared to<br />
that of our components.<br />
J1: Prime Minister, is this decision to hold $ 55 a tonne tariff good politics but<br />
bad economics?<br />
PM: Simon answered the question for you. The good economics is that it is<br />
basically one of the keys to constructing a reform package which would not<br />
otherwise be capable of reconstruction or construction. That is, the reform<br />
of the Queensland sugar industry is largely a State matter because all the<br />
things that matter, such as the pricing, the pools, the price signals, the<br />
assignments, aill of the other issues, the infrastructure, are. State issues. The<br />
. Commonwealtk's role in this is, as I said, a marginal one, but one which<br />
we've successfully been ablc to use to change yet another industry.<br />
J: Haven't you backed off using the stick that you had of the tariffs to get faster<br />
reform?<br />
PM: Put it this way, without having the leverage the Commonwealth enjoys in<br />
tarrif, we'd have no rcform here. Simon has been ahle to construct this with<br />
the Queensland government and the growers, something which probably<br />
three months ago people would have thought was incapable of happening.<br />
So getting the phase down, thc price differential between the two pools,<br />
modifying the land assignment system, these issues are key to the sugar<br />
industry becoming a more flexible, productive, competitive industry.. </p>
<p>SC: But we have used the stick of tariff to affect the real reform. Understand<br />
that in terms of tariffs we halved tho level of tariff support in a value sense<br />
it's come down from $ 110 to $ 55 in the space of 18 months. What we are<br />
doing now in response to an Industry Commission report and in consultation<br />
with the industry is saying there are more important issues that at the<br />
moment need to be tackled and we have used the impact that we have been<br />
able to have over tariffs to achieve that pace of reform.<br />
3: How do you see this decision impacting on the clothing and footwear<br />
industry, are you prepared to consider tariff pauses i n -thosc industrie . s?<br />
PM: That has got a different impact. Thcre is hardly any sugar imported, this is<br />
not thc case with those industries. This is largely a domestic price support<br />
mechanism and therefore the parallels arc not there. But again, the clothing,<br />
textile and footwear has been subject to a phased reduction in tarr if over<br />
time as has been the case with motor vehicles et cetera, which we undertook<br />
in 1988 and reviewed in 1991. In this case wc've had a reduction from $ 110<br />
to $ 55, we are reviewing it in 1995-96, but along the way as a rcsult we've<br />
opened up a much morc substantial rcform.<br />
J: Would you rule out any wider tariff pause?<br />
PM: This is a one industry specific matter. This is a complex industry, very<br />
much patterned upon State industry structures and State regulations.<br />
3: So you wouldn't rule out that<br />
PM: But the implication of the question is, Michelle ( Grattan), there are linikages<br />
here. There are not. It is as simple as that.<br />
1: Forgetting the linkages, would you take this occasion to rule out a tariff<br />
pause?<br />
PM: I've just said to you, yes. If you want simplc answers to simple questions<br />
yes.<br />
J1: At $ 55 a tonne there arc some that the tariff costs in domestic industry<br />
something like $ 51 million inflates the price of sugar by 23 per cent to the<br />
domestic market. Hlow is this sort of action going to enhance the value<br />
adding side of our domestic industry and makc them more competitive? </p>
<p>SC: Because there can be an exemption from the tariff impact if the companies<br />
using the input re-export. Direct incentive to export industries, that has<br />
always been the case I might add, but the other thing that convinced me in<br />
looking at these figures is that whilst that figure is dubious of the $ 51<br />
million because it is worth $ 32 million, it's a return of $ 32 million, if you<br />
like, to the sugar growers. The fact of the matter is it is a minuscule<br />
component of total input costs for the food processing industry in total<br />
costs. It is an important aspect and I'm not trying to pretend that in itself it's<br />
not an impediment, but it's not going to be the thing that makes or breaks<br />
that industry. What is going to make or break the sugar industry is its<br />
ability to expand and its ability to do that through proper price signals and<br />
you've got understand really, that the sugar industry itself is in excess of $ 1<br />
billion. It is a huge industry in terms of our natural resource base. What<br />
we've got to do is to secure it and at the same time insure that those input<br />
costs arc properly identified, property addressed, and they will be over time.<br />
J-In today's announcment, has the industry effectively been given some time<br />
to restructure itself andl to become more competitive and efficient and that<br />
when you do come around to review tariffs in 1995-96 you would be<br />
hoping to cut tariff rates further then?<br />
PM: This review dovetails in with the Qucensland rcvicw in 1995-96. Simon<br />
made the point to you earlier, I'm not sure whether everyone here is familiar<br />
with this industry, but all the new growers or old growers producing<br />
marginal tonnages are paid [ 12 per cent] less than the world price. How can<br />
you have an industry continuing on that basis? That is the key thing, if you<br />
want the sugar industry to grow and prosper, that's one of the things that has<br />
to be changed thc right to send your sugar to diffcrent mills. To change<br />
the assignment system is another such thing. They are the key things,<br />
compared to the tariff issue, the tariff issue is an infinitesimal issue<br />
compared with those. That's what is being affccted here today.<br />
J: but giving them time to adjust those reforms in the industry.<br />
PM: Yes, that's right.<br />
SC: You are giving them time to adjust in ccrtain aspects, but what you're<br />
driving is a faster pace of reform than would have been the case. Before<br />
this package there would have been no change to the differential between<br />
number two and number one til 1996. We're getting it immediately. It is<br />
important in terms of the question that Michiclle ( Grattan) asked. Just<br />
because wc've held tarrif doesn't mean we've held the pace of reform. But </p>
<p>6<br />
what you have Sot to understand is that tariff is not the only mechanism for<br />
reform. It is not the only dimension of micro reform, there are other aspects<br />
of micro reform. But what we've been trying to demonstrate is, areas of<br />
micro reform are not all within the purview of the Commonwealth and<br />
therefore what the Commonwealth has got to do if it's smart about these<br />
things is use the leverage of its position to drive the pace of reform in the<br />
other areas. That's why we've got the conditions to the development<br />
allowance, that's why we've used this strategy to get the pace of reform in<br />
sugar and in dairy, that's why we used the pace of reform, the approach that<br />
we adopted there to also push the States. That's a sensible national<br />
approach.<br />
PM: It's the same thing that we are doing with electricity. Commonwe alth-State<br />
co-operation, in this case with one State, in the case of electricity with three<br />
States.<br />
J: Given the benchmark nature of this agreement, I take it you will be urging<br />
Dr Hewson to adopt it.<br />
PM: Dr Hewson is going to do what he likes. I urge him to adopt some things,<br />
but it's up to him to make his own judgements about this. They take the<br />
view, they are the zero tariff outfit. they think that there should be no<br />
protection in this country for any industry at any level. That's never been<br />
the Government's position. The Government is a low tariff party, it's not the<br />
zero tariff party. We made that clear in 1988 and we made that clear in<br />
1991.<br />
J: What are the political implications here though? Will you be able to pick up<br />
votes in Queensland marginal seats?<br />
PM: Whatever they are you've got about a minute to get them out of me.<br />
J: Will you be able to pick tip certain Queensland marginal seats with this<br />
decision do you think?<br />
PM: This is a genuine issue in reform. It's like every other industry left by the<br />
Coalition for years sclerotic, nothing happening. The same as electricity,<br />
the same as ports and wharves, thc same as airlines, the same as<br />
telecommunications, the list goes on, diary now sugar. We move through<br />
these industries and this has come up in a natural sequence of events, rcports<br />
et cetera. I I </p>
<p>J: Prime Minister, should Leo McLeay give the $ 65,000 back?<br />
PM: The Speaker has rang me to say he's going to rclcase the statement later<br />
today about his position.<br />
1: potential for expansion?<br />
SC: Yes, the potential for expansion is identified as going from somewhere<br />
around about the 4 million tonnes of raw sugar to close to 5 1/ 2 million<br />
tonnes. Big expansion and obviously the extent to which you get the<br />
assignments and the freeing up in land that opens up the commitments to<br />
investment in milling as well as refining capacity.<br />
J: Are you confident that local arrangements will achieve this?<br />
PM: Yes, I am because what I was very keen to insure in terms of the wording<br />
associated with assignments was not just satisfactory to the cane growers,<br />
but that it was satisfactory importantly to the people who have to make the<br />
investment decision in the private sector and they believe it will provide that<br />
important freeing up. They see significant advantage in both the<br />
assignments dimension of this package as well as the price pooling<br />
arrangements.<br />
J: How many years do you think it will take for that expansion to<br />
SC: I don't know, I think the assessment is somewhere between three and ive<br />
years.<br />
ends. </p>
