<p>The Australian Government will provide tax deductible status to relief funds established to help Australians affected by bushfires in the Coonabarabran region of NSW.</p>
<p>Acting Assistant Treasurer, Senator Penny Wong, has today declared the January 2013 Coonabarabran bushfires a disaster for the purposes of establishing Australian disaster relief funds.</p>
<p>This declaration ensures that new funds and qualifying existing funds established for the relief of people in communities affected by these bushfires can receive tax deductible donations.</p>
<p>While funds still need to apply for formal endorsement, the Tax Office has established a fast track process to approved applications as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>These events have caused devastation to the community around Coonabarabran, and have resulted in widespread damage to property and the environment.</p>
<p>As communities in the Coonabarabran region begin to count the cost of these bushfires, Australians from around the country have already begun to offer their support.</p>
<p>Donations to Australian disaster relief funds which are established to provide relief in the aftermath of the bushfires will be tax deductible for a period of two years from the date of this declaration. </p>
<p>These donations can be used to provide money or direct assistance for relief, recovery and community reconstruction work to assist affected individuals and communities. </p>
<p>Further information on establishing an Australian disaster relief fund is available at <a href="http://www.ato.gov.au">www.ato.gov.au</a>.</p>
