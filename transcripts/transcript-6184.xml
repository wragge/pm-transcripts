1j, AL'r KA L [ A f<br />
PRIME MINISTER 22 August 1983<br />
The Prime Minister today sent the following letter to the<br />
Tasmanian Premier, Mr Gray. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER CANBERRA<br />
22 August 1983<br />
The Hon. Robin Gray, MHA<br />
Premier of Tasmania<br />
HOBART TAS 7000<br />
My dear Premier<br />
I am writing to advise you of a number of further decisions<br />
the Commonwealth has taken regarding assistance to Tasmania<br />
consequent on cessation of work on the Gordon-below-Franklin<br />
scheme. You will recall that in his discussions with you in Hobart<br />
on 11 August, Senator Grimes mentioned the development of<br />
tourist facilities in the South-West, and the Queenstown<br />
sewerage proj-ct, as two areas in which the Commonwealth<br />
would be willing to provide assistance to * your Government.<br />
I understand that you indicated that such proposals would<br />
be acceptable to your Government. In respect of tourist<br />
facilities, the Commonwealth is prepared to offer to<br />
provide funds of up to $ 2 million in 19S3/ 84 and a further<br />
$ 3 million in 1984/ 85, on the basis that the State<br />
undertakes to provide at least 110 man-years of employment.<br />
The initiative in proposing particular projects would of<br />
course be primarily a matter for the State, with<br />
individual projects subject to Commonwealth involvement<br />
to the minimum compatible with its responsibilities.<br />
For the Heritage Area itself it is clearly most important<br />
that we should press ahead with the development of<br />
appropriate arrangements, including the preparation of a<br />
management plan, and the Minister for Home Affairs and<br />
Environment, the Hon. Barry Cohen, will shortly be<br />
bringing proposals to Cabinet for this purpose. There<br />
are a number of ways, however, in which tourist<br />
facilities in the region, particularly outside the<br />
Heritage Area, could be developed quickly. Such<br />
facilities could include construction of new visitor<br />
information centres, campgrounds, picnic and toilet<br />
facilities, jetties and wharves, and it is for such<br />
proposals that the Commonwealth is now offering assistance.<br />
For the Queenstowri sewerage project, the Commionwealth<br />
offers to provide up to S1.7 million to Tasmania subject<br />
to the State undertaking to provide at least 30 man-years or<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>employment. This project has been suggested to us as a<br />
means of providing some early employment opportunities<br />
in the South-West, given that plans have already been<br />
ccmpleted. We would normally have taken the view that<br />
the Commonwealth should not be involved in such a<br />
proposal, since it is essentially one for State and<br />
local government consideration. Having regard to all<br />
the circumstances, however, we believe that it is<br />
appropriate for tne Commonwealth to offer assistance in<br />
this particular case.<br />
In respect of both these matters the appropriate course<br />
would presumably now be for your Government to put forward<br />
detailed proposals which would provide the basis for formal<br />
agreement between our Governments.<br />
As a further Commonwealthi initiative to provide employment<br />
opportunities, we have decided that tenders should be<br />
called immediately for strengthening aircraft pavements<br />
for unrestricted B727-200 operations at Hobart Airport,<br />
at a cost of S3 million. You will be aware that these<br />
works had been deferred on the recommendation of the<br />
Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. I<br />
am advised that the runway pavements are still satisfactory<br />
in terms of aircraft operations, although they are now<br />
showing some signs of stress.<br />
In terms of overall priorities in the aviation field and<br />
the need to exercise the firmest restraint in public<br />
expenditures, the Commonwealth seriously considered<br />
further deferral of these works. In the circumstances<br />
flowing from the High Court decision, however, we have<br />
taken the view that it is an appropriate project to<br />
bring forward at this time.<br />
We have also given careful thought to the various<br />
proposals for the upgrading of Wynyard Airport, having<br />
regard particularly to such factors as passenger traffic<br />
trends and the availability of airport facilities in<br />
Northern Tasmania generally, as well as to the potential<br />
of the project for employing resources formerly engaged<br />
on the Gordon-below-Franklin project. The overall<br />
position we have reached is that the major expenditures<br />
involved in the development proposals for Wynyard Airport<br />
cannot be justified at this time. The matter will, of<br />
course, be kept under review.<br />
We will continue to give consideration to the possibility<br />
of other Commonwealth initiatives. It would seem,<br />
however, that when the proposals I have outlined above<br />
are added to those that have already been agreed between<br />
us, and taking into account other proposals being developed<br />
by the State, we are well on the way to providing for<br />
all. the job opportunities that are required in 1983/ 84. / 3 </p>
<p>3.<br />
As to the funding of other works to be undertaken by = he<br />
State, T advised you in my letter of 29 July that the<br />
Commonwealth was considering the provision of a quantum<br />
of funds ( block fundino) that could be-applied to projects<br />
of the State's choosing. We have given this matter furtner<br />
thought, and as a result have asked Senator Grimes to seek<br />
an early meeting with you to discuss a possible approach.<br />
Yours sincerely<br />
R. J. L. Hawke<br />
