The Academy of Technological Sciences has a fundamental role<br />
to play in the technological innovation process in Australia.<br />
Through its distinguished and broadly based membership, it has<br />
become an important forum for discussion and advice to Government<br />
and the community on technological matters.<br />
The recent and successful Symposium on Energy organised by the<br />
Academy with the co-operation of the then Department of National<br />
Resources is an example of the important role which the Academy<br />
can play in co-ordinating informed discussion of important<br />
technology oriented issues in Australian society.<br />

decisions to provide a framework for encouraging technological<br />
development in Australia.<br />

Australian Science and Technology Council, legislation<br />
