Minister for Environment.<br />
Senator Cavanagh becomes Minister for Police and Customs<br />
instead of Minister for Aboriginal Affairs.<br />
Mr Morrison becomes Minister for Defence instead of<br />
Minister for Science.<br />
Mr Riordan will be appointed minister for Housing and<br />
Construction. The social welfare and rehabilitation activities of<br />
the Government are to be more closely co-ordinated and<br />
managed under the new arrangements. One Minister, Senator<br />
Wheeldon, will now be responsible for both the Departments<br />
of Social Security and Re. ha-ilitatinn and Compensation.<br />
In addition to this significant change, the Social<br />
Welfare Commission will, under later legislation, be<br />
abolished and the work of the Commission will be carried<br />
out by a bureau within the Department of Social Security.<br />
Senator Wheeldon will also take over from the<br />
Special Minister of State the co-ordination of the<br />
rehabilitation functions and the National Advisory Council<br />
for the Handicapped. For the present, Mr Hayden will have responsibility<br />
for the continuing negotiations with the States over Medibank<br />
and will have access to the Department of Social Security<br />
about policy matters affecting Medibank.<br />
In other moves to rationalise and co-ordinate<br />
administrative functions, Mr Whitlam said the Department<br />
of Northern Development and the Department of the Northe-rn<br />
Territory would become the Department of Northern Australia<br />
under Dr Patterson. The Government's industrial relations policies in<br />
the private and public sectors will be more closely linked.<br />
by giving responsibility in both areas to one Minister.<br />
Senator J. McClelland as well as being Minister for Labor<br />
and Immigration will also assist the Prime Minister on<br />
Public Service matters.<br />
The acquisition, leasing and disposal of land and<br />
buildings in'Australia on behalf of the Australian Government<br />
are important activities in the pursuit of the Government's<br />
urban and regional development policies. It therefore has<br />
been decided to transfer these functions to the Department<br />
of Urban and Regional Development. The Department of<br />
Services and Property continues to retain the control and<br />
management functions of the property. / 3 </p>

will become responsible for the Australian Housing Corporation<br />

legislation, the Cities Commission will be abolished, its<br />
functions to be carried out by the Department of Urban and<br />
Regional Development. The Australian Industry Development Corporation<br />
Act now administered by the Treasury will be transferred<br />
to the administration of the Minister for Manufacturing<br />
Industry. The Department of Science will now be the<br />
Department of Science and Consumer Affairs.<br />

Commission on Advanced Education will be merged under<br />
legislation to be introduced.<br />
In other changes the Department of Services and<br />
Property will take over the Government purchasing function<br />
now exercised by the Department of Special Minister of<br />
State. The Postmaster-General will be responsible for<br />
the administration of the Telecommunications Commission<br />
and the Postal Commission. The Australian Film Commission<br />
to be established under legislation recently passed by the<br />
