FOR MEDIA 22 MARCH 1989<br />
It was with deep regret that I learned of the death of<br />
Nelson Lemmon.<br />
Mr Lemmon served in the House of Representatives as the<br />
Member for Forrest from 1943-49 and as the Member for St<br />
George from 1954-55. He was Minister for Works and Housing<br />
1946-49 in the Chifley Government and was the last surviving<br />
Minister of that Government.<br />
Mr Lemmon, as Minister for Works and Housing, played a major<br />
role in Australia's reconstruction after the War.<br />
He supervised the start of the great Snowy Mountains<br />
hydro-electric scheme, and did so with due regard for<br />
environmental concerns.<br />
In recognition of Mr Lemmon's distinguished contribution to<br />
Australia and as a mark of respect, the Government will<br />
accord him a State Funeral.<br />
The service will be held at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church,<br />
Port Macquarie, New South Wales, on Thursday 23 March at<br />
9.00 am, followed by a cremation at the Port Macquarie<br />
Crematorium.<br />
As a further mark of respect, the Australian National Flag<br />
will be flown at half mast in New South Wales, Western<br />
Australia and the Australian Capital Territory tomorrow. </p>
