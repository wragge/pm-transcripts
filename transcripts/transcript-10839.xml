    <content><![CDATA[<p>Kim Beazley's unconditional offer to write off $150 million of</p>
<p> Tasmanian State Government debt should be seen for what it is -- a</p>
<p> desperate backflip in an attempt to win votes.</p>
<p>Less than a day after pouring scorn on the Government's offer,</p>
<p> he has done a complete reversal for completely short-term partisan</p>
<p> political reasons and without offering Tasmanians the prospect of</p>
<p> a reform package that would provide long-term benefits.</p>
<p>The Beazley offer is unfair to other Australians. Such a large offer</p>
<p> as $150 million to Tasmania should only be made on the basis of Tasmanians</p>
<p> doing something themselves to get rid of the State's debt. That</p>
<p> is why the Government's offer was made conditional on the sale</p>
<p> of the Hydro.</p>
<p>Tasmanian Premier, Mr Rundle recognises that the sale of the HEC is</p>
<p> essential to guaranteeing a future for Tasmanians, especially young</p>
<p> people.</p>
<p> 21 August 1998</p>
