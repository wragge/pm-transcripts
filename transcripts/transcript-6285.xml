PRIME MINISTER'S EPAC PRESS STATEMENT<br />
The Economic Planning Advisory Council held its<br />
third meeting today.<br />
The Prime Minister said that he had been heartened<br />
by the spirit of co-operation in which today's discussions<br />
had been held. He also emphasised the role of EPAC in<br />
bringing views to the Government.<br />
In this spirit, he had invited the non-Commonwealth<br />
members of the Council to bring forth at the next meeting<br />
papers or ideas on desirable medium to long-term paths to<br />
greater economic growth.<br />
A range of issues was discussed.<br />
The Treasurer outlined the nature and the rationale<br />
of the new foreign exchange system announced last Friday.<br />
The Treasurer also outlined the improved economic<br />
prospects evident since the Budget was brought down. In<br />
ccnsequence, it now appears that the Budget forecasts for<br />
activity, employment and unemployment were somewhat too<br />
ccnservative. Other members of EPAC contributed information based<br />
upon their areas of special knowledge, and in general also<br />
stated that in their view the current economic position had<br />
improved since the last EPAC meeting in October.<br />
Council discussed a paper on " Supply Side"<br />
approaches to unemployment prepared as a background document<br />
by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations.<br />
Members found the information contained in the paper to be<br />
useful, and indicated that they would bring forward<br />
considered reactions in their papers for the next meeting.<br />
Council also discussed another background paper,<br />
prepared by Treasury, on the structure of taxation in<br />
Australia. The Government considered it valuable to have<br />
icIeas expressed to it about the structure of the tax base<br />
within the context of existing revenue needs, and EPAC<br />
members agreed to develop their thoughts further in this<br />
area in their submissions for the next meeting. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Matters pertaining to the Prices Surveillance<br />
Authority and wages were discussed briefly, out it was<br />
agreed that there -were other meetings being held this week<br />
at which these issues could ap~ propriately be discussed more<br />
f ul ly. The meeting considered the status of papers<br />
prepared for EPAC.<br />
It was agreed that all papers be treated on an ' In<br />
Confidence' basis prior to their consideration by Council.<br />
It was also agreed that there be a general<br />
presum-Dtion in favour of declassifying and releasing papers<br />
after the Council had considered them, though the wishes of<br />
those individuals and organisations who had prepared papers<br />
should be respected.<br />
Minutes of EPAC meetings wil. be made available<br />
publicly, normally before the next meeting of Council but<br />
after mnembers had had an opportunity individually to check<br />
their accuracy. Projections prepared for the second EPAC meeting by<br />
both the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and the<br />
Department of Employment and Industrial Relations,' as well<br />
as the Director's Report on the Technical Committee's<br />
discussion of these projections have now been declassified.<br />
The Prime Minister stressed that the documents<br />
contained projections of alternative senarios rather than<br />
concret~ e forecasts of the future.<br />
He also noted the Technical Committee's concurrence<br />
with this view, and the range of c-ialifications within that<br />
Committ~ ee on particular numbers in the Various projections.<br />
The backg; round papers on " Supply Side" approaches<br />
to uneniployment and the structure of taxation referred to<br />
above have also teen declassified.'<br />
