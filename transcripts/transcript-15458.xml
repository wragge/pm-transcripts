    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce today the Australian Government will be assisting with the upgrade of the north-south road corridor from Darlington south of Adelaide to the CBD and the Port of Adelaide.</p>
<p>To achieve this we will include South Road, south of Sir Donald Bradman Drive in the national road network and will commit some $1 billion to be matched by the South Australian Government between now and the estimated completion of the project by 2020.  The project will include the upgrading of the overpasses at Grand Junction Road and at Cormack Road. </p>
<p>The Government is committed to delivering the transport network Adelaide and South Australia needs and deserves. For too long the State Labor Government has ignored road and rail infrastructure in South Australia.</p>
<p>I also announce today the Australian Government will provide $100 million towards the duplication of the Southern Expressway in Adelaide subject to the South Australian Government committing to provide the balance.</p>
<p>I understand the Southern Expressway is the world's longest reversible one-way freeway.  </p>
<p>Today's announcement builds on the work already being done by the Australian Government to improve South Australia's major connectors, including the Northern Expressway and upgrades to the state's major interstate highway connections.</p>
<p>Between 2004 and 2009 the Australian Government is providing $434 million to South Australia for construction upgrades on the AusLink national road and rail network.  During the period 2009 to 2014 we will more than double the allocation to around $1 billion with further projects to be announced in due course.</p>
<p>Additionally as part of the Australian Government commitment to South Australia's roads there will be increased funds for maintenance on the National Network, Roads to Recovery, Black Spots, Financial Assistance Grants identified for roads and supplementary local road funding specifically for this State.<br />
I call on the South Australian Government to join with my Government to deliver these major upgrades.  </p>
