PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS: PRIME MINISTER CALLS FOR HARD LOOK AT FO3EIGN,<br />
DEFENCE ALTERNATIVES<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon.<br />
William McMahon,<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr NcMahon, said today that of all<br />
the issues facing the Australian people at this election, the<br />
defence and foreign policies of the major Parties were undoubtedly<br />
the most critical.<br />
" The other issues, important as they are, will count for<br />
nothing if we are unable to quarantee our people freedom and<br />
security for the future," he said.<br />
" The one single factor in this election which should concern<br />
the Australian people above all others, is the future security of<br />
our country", Mr 1-cMahon said.<br />
" We must not throw away our safeguards. It would be more<br />
than foolhardy to do so it would be the most dangerous risk that<br />
any political leader ever contemplated," he said.<br />
" Put simply, Labor's policies call for the abandonment of<br />
our military treaties and regional agreements, and the withdrawal<br />
of our troops from South-East Asia to what would be a 7garrison<br />
Australia'". " Labor has also declared that it would scrap the National<br />
Service programme which would cut the effectiveness of our Army by<br />
about half," he said.<br />
" And, furthermore, the anti-Aunerican left wing would see to<br />
it that by imposing unacceptable conditions on the United Stat: s,<br />
they would force them to remove their communications installations<br />
from Australia. " And, aaain, Mr Whitlam has said that he would establish<br />
diplomatic relations immediately with the People's Republic of<br />
China, throwing Taiwan to the wolves, and that he would set up an<br />
Australian Embassy in Peking in the New Year. </p>
<p>" That is Labor's attitud. but it could never be a<br />
substitute for a foreign policy," e M-x McMahon said.<br />
" The effects of these policies would be felt by our people<br />
for many years to come. You cannot rebuild treaties and<br />
friendships overnight.<br />
" Labor's external policies would be disastrous for Australia<br />
and quite certainly irreversible", Mr Mcmahon said.<br />
" It is important to consider what changes of this character<br />
would do to our standing with our South-East Asian friends and<br />
allies, and the effect that such changes would have on the various<br />
countries in our own region," he said.<br />
" To cut our ties in this region and to jump in hastily,<br />
in sycophantic fashion, to close relations with the People's<br />
Re-nublic Of China, would bring about an equally quick reappraisal<br />
oft us by our Asian neighbours.<br />
" Certainly the stability and cohesion of the region would<br />
be shaken. " If we were to show such scant regard for the security of<br />
our own area, could we expect the United States and Britain and<br />
New Zealand to accept the extra responsibility that was curs and<br />
be prepared to shoulder our burden?" He said.<br />
" of course we could not.<br />
" if we were not prepared to~ play our part, all of our<br />
treaties would go by the board. The big powers would not stay in<br />
the region if we were to pull out, There can be no doubt about<br />
that. " This would leave a powiz r vacuum in our north, and a power<br />
of another kind would flow into that vacuum. The political<br />
leaders of South-East Asia know -that they have said so publicly<br />
and that is what they fear.<br />
" It is for these reasons that I urge the Australian people<br />
to take a long hard look at our foreign policies and those of the<br />
Australian Labor Party," he said.<br />
" Labor's policies are left-wing madness.<br />
" Far from being progressive olicies, they are, a positive<br />
danger to the future safety of our people.<br />
" You cannot defend Australia with policies of isolationism<br />
and pacifism," Mr McMahon said.<br />
" The pro-communist wing of the Labor Party has done its job<br />
well. It has written into Labor's platform a formula that would<br />
make Australia completely powerless and isolated.<br />
" The Australian people must recognise that policies of this<br />
kind can only jeopardise our present nosition and imperil the<br />
security of future generations of Australians", Mir McMahon said.<br />
