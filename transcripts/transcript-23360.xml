    <content><![CDATA[<p>To ensure the highest level of oversight and accountability, I will Chair a National Infrastructure Committee of Federal Cabinet.</p>
<p>Members will include the Deputy Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and the relevant departmental Secretaries.</p>
<p>It will provide recommendations to Cabinet on infrastructure projects and policy.</p>
<p>Importantly, the Committee will be charged with driving and assessing the progress of major projects and will act as the direct line of accountability for Commonwealth infrastructure delivery.</p>
<p>Under State and Federal Labor Governments, infrastructure delivery has been mired in bureaucracy, delays, uncertainty and opaque lines of accountability.</p>
<p>Taxpayers are tired of grandiose but unmet commitments from Labor governments. They want governments to get on with building the roads, ports and freight networks our nation needs.</p>
<p>The National Infrastructure Committee will ensure Commonwealth supported infrastructure projects are given the highest level of oversight, coordination and accountability.</p>
<p>Better infrastructure will be the hallmark of the Coalition Government.</p>
<p>The Government has made significant infrastructure commitments across Australia including WestConnex in Sydney, the East West Link in Melbourne, the Brisbane Gateway Motorway, the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing, North-South Road corridor in Adelaide, the Gateway and Swan Valley Bypass in Perth, the Midland Highway in Tasmania, completing the duplication of the Pacific Highway and multi-billion dollar upgrades to the Bruce Highway.</p>
<p>The Government has also introduced legislation to make Infrastructure Australia more effective and independent – changes that are necessary to deliver an effective long-term plan for Australia’s infrastructure needs.</p>
<p>We are working to ensure that the infrastructure of the 21st century that Australia needs is built more quickly.</p>
