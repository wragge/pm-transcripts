N EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY JAUSrRAL1A<br />
TEXT OF ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER AT THE VICTORIAN<br />
STATE COUNCIL<br />
The Liberal Party's victory in the Federal election last<br />
December and now in Victoria should make us all very conscious<br />
of the enormous responsibility which falls on us. It is not a<br />
responsibility to be taken ' lightly. We not only have an<br />
obligation to provide Australia and Victoria with good government<br />
but the Federal and State Liberal Parties have been entrusted<br />
by the people with the vital task of bringing inflation under<br />
control and once more providing , the conditions in which there are<br />
jobs for all who want to work. That is our pre-eminent<br />
responsiblity at the present time.<br />
The basic strategy of the Federal Government in this task is to<br />
transfer resources from the Federal Government back to individuals<br />
and private enterprise, where these resources will ease the<br />
pressure for higher wages and create more jobs. Excessive Government<br />
spending under Labor led to ever higher taxes on both individuals<br />
and private enterprise. Alongside other policies these taxes<br />
pushed people to ask for higher wages. These taxes drained away<br />
from both large and small businesses the money needed to create<br />
jobs.<br />
The first step towards prosperity is for Government to take a<br />
responsible attitude to its own spending. On that basis people<br />
can once more have the confidence to spend and Australia can<br />
start moving forward to real economic growth again.<br />
I have said that this is going to be a tough budget. In the past,<br />
when other Governments have said they were going to have a tough<br />
budget, what they have meant is more taxes more money for the<br />
government, and less money for people. Our budget is not going<br />
to be that kind of budget. For a change, it is going to be a<br />
tough budget for the Government. The Government will for the<br />
first time in three years show responsibility in its own spending.<br />
We are absolutely determined to have a budget which will give<br />
people the confidence to spend and business the confidence to<br />
invest a budget which will put money back in the hands of people.<br />
Economic recovery jobs and prosperity will only be complete<br />
if consumers and producers have confidence. * Only a budget that<br />
requires the Government to take a tough-line with its own spending,<br />
that takes hard decisions about the limits on Government resources<br />
will enable the measures to be introduced which will give people<br />
this confidence. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Only a budget which forces the Government to take a tough line<br />
on its own spending will give the private sector room to expand.<br />
That is the way to get investment, jobs and an increase in<br />
Australia's real wealth.<br />
The Government's budgetary decisions will be based on the<br />
realistic view that Government should not keep taking money from<br />
individuals and private enterprise in order to promise the things<br />
that the Labor Party extravagantly and irresponsibly offered.<br />
The Government's restraint of its own expenditure will give<br />
business room to expand and make jobs available for all those who<br />
want to work. The Government's restraint will provide the<br />
opportunities for individuals and business that have been denied<br />
to them by Labor's policies of high taxes and lavish uncontrolled<br />
spending. Fro the polnt of view of the people this Will be a good budget,<br />
that will put the heart back into business and consumer confidence.<br />
The Government will do its part. Every other section of the<br />
Australian community must do its part. People must be willing to<br />
invest in productive enterprises. Businesses must be willing to<br />
take development decisions. Consumers must overcome their unfounded<br />
reservations about the future when a family buys a washing machine<br />
or new car'it is providing jobs. When a'family postpones<br />
expenditure it would normally make and when every family in<br />
Australia does the same thing, unemployment must result.<br />
Our job is to give people confidence in the future so that through<br />
their renewed spending new jobs can be created once more. In<br />
this way we will increase Australia's real wealth and prosperity.<br />
The room for growth that our Government's restraint will allow,<br />
extends beyond budgetary matters. We are going to stop Government<br />
bureaucracy stifling individual initiative and business enterprise<br />
by over-regulation regulation that is in no-one's interests<br />
except the regulators. We are having an inquiry into trade practice.<br />
regulations and we will remove unreasonable and unnecessary<br />
. restrictions. There must and will be, protection for the consumer<br />
but the rules must actually protect the consumer. Restrictiong,<br />
regulationsi are not for this Government, ends in themselves.<br />
Those regulations that are not in the public interest will be<br />
removed. For example, companies have gone into liquidation<br />
because the laws, as they now stand, have prevented them merging<br />
with another. viable enterprise. Productive capacity and jobs have<br />
been lost through unwise regulations<br />
Restrictions which are contrary to the national interest, which<br />
serve neither consumer or producer, will be discarded. Industry<br />
needs to-be allowed to breathe to expapd, to grow. Under Labor,<br />
regulation was getting out of hand. No wonder there was no<br />
investment and major unemployment. Only if real economic growth<br />
can be got under way can the position of the disadvantaged and<br />
weaker sections bf the community be improved.. This must be<br />
realised and explained to the general community if people are going<br />
to fully understand what the Liberal Party stands for, and what<br />
it can achieve.<br />
Since its overwhelming rejection by. the Australian people the Labor<br />
Party and its apologists have attempted to build up the myth that<br />
Labor was a reforming social democratic Government, full of concern<br />
for the disadvantaged and those in real need. People should be<br />
aware that the real record of the Whitlam Government is far from<br />
this. The truth of this is that the Labor Party has done great<br />
damage to the disadvantaged and weaker sections of the community by<br />
its policies over the last three years. 1. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
It was -far less concerned for the disadvantaged that it was for<br />
its dream of centralising all political power in Canberra.<br />
Labor's record as it affected the poor was examined in the report<br />
of the Inquiry into Poverty. The Report of the Inquiry into<br />
Poverty st~ ated quite plainly that inflation contributed to<br />
poverty in Australia. " No country with a continuing inflation<br />
rate of over 10% has been able to prevent this causing grave<br />
harship to important groups of poor people". The Report emphasised<br />
the danger of governments: " falling into the inflationary trap of<br />
attempting to carry out so many social reforms or other public<br />
expenditures at once that they accelerate an inflationary spiral<br />
that does more damage to poor people than the assistance provided<br />
by the reforms". This has happened in Australia in the last<br />
three years. As a result of the inflation caused by Labor's<br />
policies, the position of the weaker sections of the community has<br />
got worse. That is why the report on poverty concluded that:<br />
" 1one element essential in any programme to reduce poverty in<br />
Australia is that the rate of inflation be brought under control"<br />
I have stated before that the Liberal-National Country Party<br />
Government has an absolute determination to bring inflation in<br />
Australia down. This is not only because inflation is essential<br />
to get Australia moving forward again, but it is also because it<br />
is absolutely essential as part of our determination to assist<br />
the disadvantaged and those in real need, in ways which really do<br />
improve their position, and not by cosmetic programmes which leave<br />
the real problem untouched.<br />
Nor is inflation the only way in which the Labor Party has harmed<br />
the weaker sections of the community. The worst unemployment<br />
since the depression caused mainly by labor's irresponsible<br />
policies has harmed most of all the wak, the migrant and the<br />
poor last on, first off sections of the community. The school<br />
leavers looking for work who still can't get jobs have Labor to<br />
thank for the lack of job opportunities. The revival of job<br />
opportunities is one of the principal objectives of our programme<br />
to get Australia moving to prosperity.<br />
There is yet a further way in which Labor's policies failed to<br />
help the disadvantaged. Labor's approach to social welfare<br />
as in so many other areas was to throw money around and hope<br />
that the disadvantaged would be able to pick some of it up.<br />
The result has been and here I quote from the Report on Poverty<br />
again that: " very large sums are being spent by Governments<br />
on the pretext that they are helping poor people when in fact the<br />
great bulk'of the money goes to the middle class and poor people<br />
get little." We have made it plain that our approach in<br />
welfare is going to be quite different. We will be taking steps to<br />
ensure that money spent on welfare is directed much more accurately<br />
to those who are in need of assistance. In conditions of limited<br />
resources much &amp; an be done to improve opportunities for the<br />
disadvantaged provided that resources are not spread too thinly<br />
across many who are not in need of assistance. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
We are a Government committed to providing conditions in which<br />
all Australians can live lives of dignity and self-respect.<br />
We are equally a Government deeply opposed to programmes which<br />
increase the dependence of everyone on what politicians and<br />
civil servants choose to provide and which reduce the independent<br />
capacity of people to decide how their own incomes will be spent.<br />
our approach in social welfare will be to concentrate support on<br />
the disadvantaged, to adopt general policies which will add<br />
greatly to the security of the weaker sections of the community,<br />
and to minimise the role of Government in reallocating funds to<br />
those sections of the community which are well able to provide for<br />
themselves. This will free vital resources to invidivuals and<br />
private enterprise. This government aims to make an imaginative<br />
and major step towards improving social security in Australia.<br />
We will show that this can only be done effectively as part of an<br />
overall programme designed to encourage creativity, enterprise,<br />
and achievement.<br />
Last year, Australia actually produced less than the year before.<br />
We are literally poorer as a people as a result of Labor's.<br />
misgovernment. If some well organised sections of the community<br />
actually succeed in making themselves better off by higher wages<br />
this must be at the expense of other sections of the community.<br />
These higher wages and salaries are paid out of money that should<br />
be used to create jobs for those out of work. They are paid<br />
through inflation out of the earnings of those on fixed incomes<br />
and out of the hard earned savings of pensions and all retired<br />
people. What kind of people are we if we cannot work together<br />
as a community to get on top of our problems? I believe that<br />
the great majority of the Australian people realise that unless<br />
we get off the inflationary spiral of higher wages and salaries,<br />
followed inexorably by higher prices, we are throwing away our<br />
future. Australia will never be the great country we want it<br />
to be unless we act firmly, and work together as a people instead<br />
of scrambling for what's left after Labor's ravages.<br />
As evidence of our concern in this matter, we took the tough<br />
decision of deciding to oppose the full 6.4% increase in the<br />
last wage hearing. When we considered all the facts, we believed<br />
that we had no alternative. It was, and remains, the view of the<br />
Government that tax indexation *( and its accompanying tax reforms)<br />
is a far more effective way of protecting people's earnings than<br />
higher money wages which are soon eroded by price increases<br />
and higher taxes. Tax indexation was a major plank in our policy<br />
at the Federal election.. We not only stand by our pledge to<br />
introduce tax indexation. We will be looking to take the largestpossible<br />
step towards its introduction this year. Tax indexation<br />
will ensure that people will keep more of what they earn and will<br />
not add to inflation.<br />
Of course, we will have inflation, and more inflation, if wages and<br />
salaries increase at 15% or 20% a year. Increases of this magnitude<br />
are economic madness which benefit nobody and do great damage to<br />
many Australians. </p>
<p>In bringing Australia back to economic sanity the Arbitartion<br />
Commission has a crucial role to play. The Government has<br />
no direct power over wages and salaries. It only has a power<br />
to establish a body which can conciliate and arbitrate<br />
industrial disputes. The Arbitration Commission established<br />
under this power clearly has a responsibility to consider in<br />
the course of resolving a dispute the economic consequences<br />
and social justice of its decision. The Government considers<br />
that we in turn, have an obligation to put arguments on the<br />
economic consequences of decisions to the Commission. The<br />
Commission would not seek to deny this. It is clearly the<br />
duty of the Commission as an independent body to listen to<br />
the Governments arguments, those of trade unions and employers. </p>
