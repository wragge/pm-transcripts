TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH WARWICK TEECE, RADIO 2HD,<br />
NEWCASTLE, 15 AUGUST 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
TEECE: Mr Hawke, good morning.<br />
PM: Good morning, Warwick.<br />
TEECE: OK. The first thing as everybody has been asking me<br />
this morning on the air, why? Why didn't we get it?<br />
PM: The answer, unfortunately, is very simple and straight<br />
forward. Let me preface it by saying it's done on the basis<br />
of what was told to me as being the proper basis when I had<br />
in the Cabinet room here in Canberra a delegation headed by<br />
Premier Nick Greiner and with Bob Carr there and with<br />
representatives from Newcastle. I put to them that<br />
obviously we would have to take econonimc considerations<br />
into account and they agreed with that. They said well<br />
there were some other sorts of things that I shouldn't leave<br />
out like regional considerations about Newcastle. I said<br />
yes well I'd take that into account. I said directly to<br />
Premier Nick Greiner well what's the sort of differential<br />
that discount for both factors in price. In other<br />
words, if it was 10%, more expensive to go there, what<br />
do you think? His answer was In other words you could<br />
go to Newcastle, you could go to Newcastle if it was 2% more<br />
expensive. Now in fact, in fact 10%, $ 350m more for the AWS<br />
tender. Now let me make it clear to you that this process<br />
has been a long, thorough and objective evaluation of the<br />
two tenders. We've had these sorts of people involved,<br />
there's a Defence Source Definition Committee of some 15 or<br />
more people, from Navy, the other Defence elements as well<br />
as the civilian elements of Defence, representatives from<br />
other relevant departments and New Zealand more than<br />
people on that. There's some 6 people on the Chief of Naval<br />
Staff Advisory Committee and they are making recommendations<br />
up to the Defence Force Development Committee with 5 people<br />
on it. In other words, about 30 people involved in the<br />
recommendation and final selection decision.<br />
TEECE: Alright, well<br />
PM: Now look, I'm making the point. They were unanimous,<br />
they were unanimous that the decision had to be for AMECON. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
TEECE: Well, we political decision, it wasn't, right?<br />
It was done on a price differential, but as Bob Carr just<br />
said to me, and he said you could ask the Prime Minister, if<br />
we had a look, looking at say the spread over 15 years and<br />
what value did the Cabinet put on the benefits Through-Life<br />
Support which was given or would be given by the Dutch Navy<br />
towards Newcastle?<br />
PM: But these considerations are also taken into account in<br />
regard to both of them and this was raised in the Cabinet.<br />
In the discussion we had the Chief of Staff and their Naval<br />
Chief of Staff in there and in respect of this question of<br />
Through-Life Support, no difference. In other words, on the<br />
question of which one they went for it wasn't simply a<br />
matter of price, although that was overwhelmingly<br />
overwhelming. In regard to the differences between the two<br />
ships, the AWS M Class design and the AMECON MEKO design,<br />
the Navy said in regard to the actual ship design and<br />
performance, a marginal preference for the AWS one, but they<br />
said that that was more than offset by the preference they<br />
had in the areas of management, financial arrangements,<br />
logistic support and the industry package. All of those<br />
outweighed that and they were all unanimous, unanimous, some<br />
people unanimous in saying this is what the decision had<br />
to be. Now do you really believe that I'd be entitled to<br />
respect around Australia, including in Newcastle, if being<br />
confronted with that position, I for political reasons<br />
because I was frightened of a bit of backlash, no well I'll<br />
ignore the unanimous advice of the experts, 30 of them, I'll<br />
ignore that and go for Newcastle. I remind you it's the<br />
same Premier Greiner who is now being so damned hypocritical<br />
about this, who said to me when I had to make another tough<br />
political decision about Badgery's Creek or the third runway<br />
at Kingsford Smith, he said don't make the political<br />
decision that you were frightened about some seats around<br />
the airport. You've got to make the economically<br />
responsible decision. Now he changes his tune, but he's the<br />
same Premier Greiner who said to me in front of everyone in<br />
the Cabinet room that a 2% differential was a maximum that<br />
could be tolerated on economic differential grounds. It's<br />
TEECE: I mean you're talking about recommendations of<br />
management or whatever, we get reports about the<br />
Victoria, we hear they've had industrial problems. We have<br />
the combined efforts of the unions here as you know, you're<br />
fully aware and then we, what I'm getting on the air and how<br />
I feel is feeling that we're always second best up<br />
here. PM: Well, it's not a right decision. If you're second<br />
best, how do you explain that under the decision that we've<br />
taken there's going to be $ 700m invested in Newcastle on the<br />
project and 1,200 jobs created and that those jobs are going<br />
to be in the area, not just of traditional steel fabrication<br />
work, but also in engineering, electrical, electronic, pipe<br />
work, mechanical assembly, outfitting, commissioning and </p>
<p>testing. That under the proposal if we get to the 12 ship<br />
build, that under that 12 ship build, that 58 hull sections<br />
will be assembled in Newcastle and that 5 of the 12 ships if<br />
it's a 12 ship build will be launched at Newcastle. I mean,<br />
once you know those facts how can you say what you do, that<br />
Newcastle is second best?<br />
TEECE: Well because we feel we should have won it.<br />
I mean<br />
PM: Why do you feel you should have won it if in fact the<br />
Government is told unanimously by some 30 experts that the<br />
interests of Australia demand that the AMECON bid be I<br />
mean, how do you run a country? On that basis then, I<br />
should have, in regard to the decision in Sydney on the<br />
Kingsford Smith, I should have shied away from the third<br />
runway there because it was the politically tough thing to<br />
do. I should have said no, there's three or four seats at<br />
risk here, but I'll run this country on the basis of not<br />
taking any political risks. Now<br />
TEECE: Why we ask the question is whether that $ 350m over<br />
years really is going to be, you know, will that happen?<br />
Will there be a saving, that's the question?<br />
PM: Well, what you're saying is that you know better, you<br />
know better, than all the experts. You're saying that the<br />
Chief of the Naval Staff, that Admiral Hudson and all the<br />
people under him are a bunch of crooks. They're either<br />
crooks or incompetents and that you know better.<br />
TEECE: Well what we're really saying is that, you know, we<br />
feel that behind this whole area that the $ 350m over the<br />
years, it's a question which was asked by several people on<br />
the line and I've got to ask the question of you for them<br />
too, is that is this going to really happen? Will there be<br />
a saving of $ 350m and if there wasn't would<br />
PM: Of course there will be. I mean the question is a<br />
foolish question unless, unless you are saying that Admiral<br />
Hudson, all the people in our Defence Forces concerned with<br />
this, are a bunch of incompetents or crooks. I mean what<br />
you're saying really is that we shouldn't have had the<br />
evaluation process with all these experts on it. We<br />
shouldn't have had it, we just simply said well, obviously<br />
going to be better to have it at Newcastle, it'll be<br />
politically more convenient, we won't have an evaluation<br />
program, we won't have a costing, we won't do any of those<br />
things. We'll just work out where it's politically more<br />
convenient. Now you can't run a Government like that.<br />
You've got to have the evaluation program and when they come<br />
up with their detailed figuring, and it's not their<br />
figuring, let me say, I mean the actual the figures that<br />
were put up, the costs, are the figure that was tendered by </p>
<p>-4-<br />
AWS and the figure that was tendered by AMiECON. I mean,<br />
Admiral Hudson and his people didn't create the figures.<br />
This is the tender price. They tendered $ 350m more. Now do<br />
they mean their figure or don't they?<br />
TEECE: Right, now look on this 40% that comes to New South<br />
Wales, how much of that comes to Newcastle<br />
PM: Well, what we can say, what we know definitely as a<br />
minimum at this stage is $ 700m of investment and 1,200 jobs.<br />
But what I have done is to say now I, because I do have a<br />
feeling for that region, I mean, when we came to office I<br />
was faced with a situation where Newcastle and Wollongong, I<br />
might say, were going to be wiped out because, under the<br />
Conservatives, they allowed the steel industry to run down.<br />
Now you know we brought in the steel industry plan to save<br />
Newcastle and Wollongong. I've proved my bona fides in<br />
regard to the region. Now, in the same sense, I said<br />
yesterday, well now look I want to ensure that now having<br />
made this decision we're going to, consistent with the<br />
contracts, we're going to get every possible piece of work<br />
that we can for Newcastle because I want that to be done.<br />
Now just having said that I've set up a Cabinet Sub<br />
Committee which will have Peter Morris from the Newcastle<br />
area, Peter Morris, Kim Beazley and John Button. I want the<br />
Newcastle people to set up a panel up there of industry and<br />
unions and so on so that we can just monitor this and see<br />
that we can get as much of the work as possible up there<br />
consistent with the decision that's been taken.<br />
TEECE: Do the Germans use the MEKO frigate in their own<br />
Navy? PM: No, I was asked that earlier, there seems to be some<br />
uncertainty. They are not using it at this stage, I'm told.<br />
But, you know, so what? I mean, you know, what is the point<br />
of that? Here is a vessel which has been analysed and<br />
tested by the experts, it's in fact used by four NATO<br />
nations. It's used by four NATO nations. I don't know<br />
whether I'm allowed to use the opposition but Mickie de<br />
Stoop asked me this just a while ago up there and at that<br />
stage I didn't have that information definitely. I thought<br />
is was either used or going to be used. The fact is it's<br />
being used by four NATO nations. Now, the Navy, our naval<br />
experts here, in making the judgement, were able therefore<br />
to take into account that this was an operational vessel, as<br />
was the other one. I mean, the thing is that they're both<br />
good vessels, but when you're making a decision about<br />
vessels you've got to take account, not merely the vessel<br />
itself but, as I say, of the considerations of how is the<br />
project going to be managed, what are the financial<br />
arrangements about it, the question of logistic support and </p>
<p>the total industry package. The fact is that while the<br />
difference is $ 350m it is a minimum of $ 350m difference<br />
because if the options on sensors and logistic support are<br />
taken up in the contract, the difference will be even more<br />
than $ 350m.<br />
TEECE: The thing that's coming through all the time, and I<br />
feel it because I'm right here in the Hunter Valley is the<br />
feeling that there's going to be a backlash. Bob Carr said<br />
to me this morning, he thinks there will be.<br />
PM: Well, thank you Bob Carr. Thank you very much Bob<br />
Carr. Bob Carr was here in the Cabinet room and if Bob<br />
Carr's going to say that let's have it right on the table.<br />
Bob Carr was there in the Cabinet room and did not<br />
dissociate himself from Premier Greiner who said that the<br />
maximum differential that you can allow in price in favour<br />
of Newcastle was In other words, only could you go that<br />
far of accepting a more expensiv by contract for<br />
Newcastle. Now that's what Premier Greiner said. Bob Carr<br />
was sitting there and did not disagree. Now it's all very<br />
well for these politicians, after the event, to sing another<br />
tune. It's a damn pity that they couldn't take out of the<br />
Cabinet room the honesty and integrity which they showed<br />
there, because they were honest there. I put the question<br />
to them, I said look don't you accept that as Prime Minister<br />
and as a Government I have to be economically responsible<br />
about this? Yes, they all said it, Carr, Greiner, and all<br />
the representatives. They all said it, yes you have to be<br />
economically responsible. So I put the question to them.<br />
This is not after the event, Warwick, this was beforehand.<br />
I said to them, OK what margin do you think I should have to<br />
favour Newcastle? How much more expensive? 2% was the<br />
figure used by Premier Greiner and Bob Carr did not<br />
disagree. TEECE: But do you think there will be a backlash?<br />
PM: Well, I think there might be at this stage but, look, I<br />
just happen to have more faith in the people of Newcastle<br />
than some others seem to have. I don't think the people of<br />
Newcastle are going to say, particularly when Carr and<br />
Greiner have said what they have about the differential, I<br />
don't think they're going to say, well Bob Hawke should have<br />
ignored and overridden the advice of some 30 experts who<br />
were unanimous in saying that Australia, I mean, after all<br />
the people from Newcastle and the Hunter region are<br />
Australians, they're not just Novacastrians and Hunter<br />
region people, they are Australians. I don't think that in<br />
the end they would say we want our Australian Prime Minister<br />
to overrule and override the unanimous recommendations of<br />
the Navy, of everyone concerned with this, some 30 people.<br />
I don't think they'd respect me if that's what I did. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
TEECE: Out of the Cabinet vote, do we know, I mean can we<br />
know the numbers which way it went, was it unanimous?<br />
PM: Well, we don't have votes in Cabinet. That's the way I<br />
run it. We have the discussions and it goes on and, in the<br />
end, there was an acceptance of the decision.<br />
TEECE: In March this year when you were up here, we were<br />
talking about the decision and a local independent I<br />
remember putting a question to you, who was arguing the<br />
decision had already been made, there'd been a sweetheart<br />
deal and you said there'd be no way in the world. That's<br />
coming up again<br />
PM: Well all I can say is that if he says that, I'd like<br />
him to say it publicly in respect of the people involved in<br />
this because they would take him to the cleaners for<br />
defamation. I mean, what you are simply saying is that<br />
Admiral Hudson, the Chief of the Naval Staff, all these<br />
senior people in our Defence forces, the men dedicated, have<br />
given their life to the defence of this country that they<br />
are crooks. All I can say is that that reflects upon the<br />
people who make those accusations. This has been as clean<br />
as a whistle. I mean the fact that there's a $ 350m<br />
difference in the contract is proof positive of that fact.<br />
TEECE: we've put everything into this particular<br />
campaign PM: And you're going to get a lot out of it. I mean I pay<br />
credit to the people of the region for the intensity of<br />
their campaign. I mean, as a result, what are you getting?<br />
You're arguing as though you've lost all. The fact is that<br />
Newcastle is going to get a minimum of $ 700m new investment,<br />
1,200 new jobs.<br />
TEECE: What if Newcastle tender for the work<br />
tenders are again too high? Will we get the work, because<br />
we've obviously got to tender back again?<br />
PM: No, but already as a result of the contracts of the<br />
tenders that have been submitted they have been submitted on<br />
the basis of work that's been done by the consortium in<br />
terms of making their decisions about who's going to do the<br />
work for them. They already know, they already know what<br />
tender prices there would be in a broad sense to be able to<br />
make, in broad terms, the tender price that they've offered.<br />
On the basis of what they've already put up we know these<br />
figures of $ 700m investment and 1,200 new jobs. Let me make<br />
the point that if in fact New Zealand were to not go ahead,<br />
then as a result of that the work that would have been done<br />
in New Zealand, much more of that will go to Newcastle. You<br />
have the situation that you would get then in New South<br />
Wales, some 50% of the work. If it's a 12 ship launch, that<br />
is 8 here and 4 from New Zealand, then remember that 58 hull </p>
<p>-7-<br />
sections will be built and assembled, 58 hull sections will<br />
be built in Newcastle and there'd be an assembly and launch<br />
of 5 of the 12 ships out of Newcastle.<br />
TEECE: The other question that's been asked of me this<br />
morning is that the next Federal election hinges on Victoria<br />
compared to 4 seats here.<br />
PM: No, well look that gets down, in the end, to a<br />
attack upon Admiral Hudson and the integrity of Defence<br />
forces. I mean, Newcastle people are better than that. I<br />
don't think that they really believe that Admiral Hudson and<br />
all these dedicated people in our Defence services whose<br />
life is committed to the defence and integrity of Australia<br />
that they are going to be party to some sleazy political<br />
trick, because in the end that's what it means. Remember<br />
all these people were unanimous in their recommendation.<br />
Now if you want to say that Admiral Hudson and these people<br />
are a bunch of political crooks, then say it, but you know<br />
who that reflects upon. It doesn't reflect upon Hudson and<br />
the rest of them, it reflects upon any person who's low<br />
enough to make that accusation.<br />
TEECE: Mr Hawke, thank you very much.<br />
