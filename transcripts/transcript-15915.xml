    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Rudd Labor Government will immediately provide $10 million to kick start urgent planning on the Gateway Motorway's two missing links.</p>
<p>The construction of the missing links will mean that Queensland motorists will have a first class arterial road linking the Pacific Motorway to the Bruce Highway.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government made this commitment in the Federal Budget to reduce the traffic congestion on this busy highway once and for all.</p>
<p>For 12 long years the Liberal Government refused to commit to building the two missing links  -  leaving Queenslanders with a road that was half built.</p>
<p>The $10 million investment  -  to be matched by $10 million from the Bligh Government  -  will allow planning work to start on:</p>
<p>     * the 12.5km section from Nudgee Road to the Bruce Highway; and</p>
<p>     * the 4.5km from Mount Gravatt-Capalaba Road to the Pacific Motorway.</p>
<p>The investment will fund critical pre-construction activities, such as community consultation, geotechnical surveys, design, environmental assessments and land acquisition.</p>
<p>From 2009-10, an additional $195 million will be invested in pre-construction funding for these links under the AusLink 2 Investment Program.</p>
<p>Kick starting this critical planning work means that the construction of the missing links could be ready to begin as soon as 2011  -  instead of being on the never-never list of the former Liberal government.</p>
<p>The Queensland Government is currently investing $1.9 billion to upgrade the Gateway  -  the only north-south bypass of Brisbane  -  to six and eight lanes.</p>
<p>But if the missing links remain only four-lanes, motorists will be stuck in traffic jams when connecting to the Bruce Highway and the Pacific Motorway.</p>
<p>Already up to 70,000 motorists use these sections of road every day and if we do nothing, by 2012 over 94,000 commuters will be sitting in daily traffic jams.</p>
<p>Without an upgraded link to the Bruce Highway and Pacific Motorway, truckies from the port and airport  -  the fastest growing industry and trade precinct in Australia  -  will struggle to meet their schedules, pushing up costs for consumers.</p>
<p>Roads and rail lines are the arteries of the economy, and infrastructure bottlenecks push up the costs of doing business and add to inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>Under a âdo-nothing' scenario, urban congestion will cost families and businesses in Brisbane $3 billion a year by 2020, with many working parents spending more time in their cars and less time at home with their kids.</p>
<p>That's why we're planning for the future with commitments such as the one we've made to the Gateway Missing Links, and taken the decision to establish the $20 billion Building Australia Fund to upgrade the nation's ageing infrastructure.</p>
