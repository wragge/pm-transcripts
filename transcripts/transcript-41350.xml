    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government strongly condemns the appalling and barbaric terrorist attack on worshippers during Friday prayers at a mosque in North Sinai, Egypt.</p>
<p>Our thoughts are with the families of those affected by this cowardly attack which has left over 230 innocent people killed and many injured.</p>
<p>It underscores that the threat of violent extremism, driven by religious hatred continues to fuel frightful aggression.</p>
<p>The Australian Embassy in Cairo has been advised by Egyptian authorities that at this stage no Australians are known to have been affected by the attack.</p>
<p>We continue to advise Australians not to travel to all parts of North Sinai due to the high threat of terrorist attacks and risks posed by violent criminals.</p>
