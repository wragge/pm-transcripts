    <content><![CDATA[<p>Mr President, it's a delight to welcome you to Parliament House. This is the first ever visit of a serving French President to Australia.</p>
<p>It's a real honour to be the Australian Prime Minister who receives the first ever French President here in Australia.</p>
<p>Our ties are long-standing and deep, they're warm and yes, they began in the fires of war, but they are new and fresh and modern as well.</p>
<p>It's a strong trade relationship; it's a strong security relationship.</p>
<p>We are in fact neighbours in the Pacific through New Caledonia and I believe that this visit is going to be an important part of renewing, extending and expanding the long-standing bonds between Australia and France.</p>
