1PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 17 May 1976<br />
Lue 4i11i2<br />
There are some important matters that I want to discuss<br />
with you tonight.<br />
I think we all know that when we came of office late last<br />
year, there were somte major problems in front of Australiaproblems<br />
of rising costs, rising prices and a very great<br />
level of inflation running much higher than that in our<br />
major trading partners. This had led to a high and<br />
unacceptable level of unemployment. Much of this had been<br />
caused by Government spending that was much too great and<br />
put real pressure, unreasonable pressure, on the economy.<br />
My-Government was, and is, pledged to overcome these<br />
problems. After the election last year, we immediately<br />
began a review of Government activity. As a result of<br />
that we were able to achieve savings in the last part of<br />
this financial year that would run at an annual rate of<br />
$ 1,000 million. And one of the things we have got to<br />
understand is that when politicians promise things, they<br />
are not promising anything of their own because they have<br />
nothing of their own to give. They are promising something<br />
of yours and the more politicians promise, the less there is<br />
for you to meet your own needs or your family's needs,<br />
and the less there is for industry, for investment and to create<br />
the jobs that are needed to improve the real wealth of Australia<br />
and to provide the opportunities that are wanted right<br />
around the country.<br />
W,, e need to understand that there cannot be a real increase in<br />
ybur income, your standard of living, in Australia's standard<br />
of living, unless there is a real increase in production<br />
throughout Australia. In recent times Australia's total<br />
production has in fact been falling.<br />
Over thepast year or two the view had begun to develop that<br />
we could have it all without really having to pay for it.<br />
Now people are coming to understand that that is not so;<br />
that there is a cost and the cost has been in terms of Inflation<br />
that has often hit the weaker sections of the community much<br />
harder than others. It has hit those who are unable to defend<br />
themselves. It has resulted in unemployment. This has hit the<br />
unskilled and migrants who have recently come to our shore, more<br />
than other sections of the Australian community. / 2 </p>
<p>There has been a great cost a cost in terms of human<br />
hardship and thiS now is understood.<br />
Despite the savings that we were able to achieve running at<br />
the rate of $ 1,000 million a year, when oe looked at the<br />
forward estimates for next financial year, we found there was<br />
another prospective deficit approaching $ 5,000 million. That<br />
is nearly $ 1,000 for every taxpayer. This was not basically<br />
as a result of any programmes of ours but as a result of the<br />
continuation of programmes of the previous administration.<br />
Quite plainly, it was an unacceptable situation, so as a result,<br />
with the Treasurer, I cormmissioned an exaaugtive examination<br />
of. allprogrammes of the Government. This has involved<br />
senior public servants, senior Ministers, the Cabinet and<br />
the full Ministry, over recent days and weeks. As a result<br />
of all this work we have been able to make decisions that<br />
will involve much more substantial savings in the next<br />
financial year than anything that was achieved in the last<br />
six months of this financial year.<br />
Many of the decisions that we have had to make have been hard<br />
ones. They have been difficult ones. Programimes will be<br />
reduced. That is not always pleasant because there is often<br />
an intrinsic worth in a particular programme. But the plain<br />
fact is that the programmes in which the Commonwealth Government<br />
had been involved were beyond the capacity of Australia's<br />
taxpayers to afford at the present time. We have to learn to<br />
Live within our means. We know we have ' got to do this as<br />
individuals. We have to learn to do it as a nation.<br />
This does not mean-to say that we have not been able to protect<br />
the weak and the poorer scctions of the community. It-does not mean<br />
that we are not able to protect pensions because we have and<br />
we will. In the measures we are undertaking special concern<br />
is being shown to disadvantaged in the Australian community<br />
and in other important areas where opportunity needs to be<br />
provided by Australians we will be able to uLanage some real<br />
growth and expenditures. Education is such an area.<br />
Another important element of the decisions we have taken in<br />
recent times concerns the nature of programmes and benefits<br />
and the way they ought to be financed.<br />
Medibank is such a programme. There has been a Medibank Review<br />
Committee looking at every aspect of this scheme. Now it is<br />
not a question of whether Medibank will be retained or not<br />
because it certainly will we are committed to that. The<br />
question before us is how should Medibank be paid foi-?<br />
High quality health care for all Australians is plainly very<br />
expensive. It ' is our belief that it shouldI be paid for to<br />
a significant degree separately, and in a way that can be seen.<br />
This is important because of its great expense and because it<br />
is a universal scheme that covers everyone. But in paying<br />
for Medibank we will make sure that the poorest people in the<br />
community do not have to make any additional payment. Those<br />
further up the income scale will still have very heavily<br />
subsidised cover under Medibank. Those who are better off still<br />
will be paying much more nearly the full cost of' what Medibank<br />
provides. .13 </p>
<p>3.<br />
We. are also seeking to introduce an element of choice for<br />
as many people as possible and the details of this will be<br />
announced on Thursday by the Treasurer and by the Minister<br />
concerned. I want to emphasise very plainly that the<br />
essential elements of Medibank are being retained. The<br />
cover is universal and no means test is involved.<br />
As. a result of the changes we will be announcing, as a result<br />
of the very substantial savings in expenditures, we are<br />
able to introduce other important reforms. Wie are able to<br />
do this in a way which is completely compatible with a<br />
responsible budget in* August because that has been quite<br />
constantly in our minds.<br />
The first of the reforms I would like to mention is tax<br />
indexation. We are involved in this for two reasons. Through<br />
the process of inflation, people have been pushed into higher<br />
and higher tax paying brackets. This has generated further pressure<br />
for more wages. So it has been a merry go round. It has<br />
been part of the inflationary process, the way the tax system<br />
has interacted with wages over recent times. With tax indexation<br />
this will cease, It will give us an opportunity to relieve<br />
the pressure on wages. Secondly, tax indexation will keep<br />
Governments honest, because it means that if they want more<br />
of your income if we want more of your income we will.<br />
. have to legislate quite specifically for it. Under those<br />
circumstances we will have to argue the case and say what programmes<br />
we'want to finance, and you will be able to make a judgement<br />
between that and the way you would have used the money had it<br />
been left in your hands. So there are two strong and powerful<br />
reasons for our decisions relating to tax indexation. I<br />
believ6 that these particular matters will be very much welcomed<br />
by the total Australian community. I would also like to<br />
add that the decisions that will be announced by the Treasurer<br />
on Thursday relating to tax indexation will be much more<br />
substantial I believe, than any observers had in fact predicted.<br />
The second major reform concerns a revised system of family<br />
allowances and support for families.<br />
There are about 300,000 families in the Australian community which<br />
pay little-9, r no tax. Over 800,000 children are involved with these<br />
families. They are amongst the poor and the very poor in the<br />
Ai~ stralian community. Australia does not do enough for<br />
families in these categoires at the present time. Therefore<br />
we are going to revise the means of support for families<br />
and we are going to make substantial changes in this area.<br />
I would like to emphasise that the changes we will be making<br />
willnot involve any means test. It will involve direct help<br />
to the families concerned.<br />
The approaches we are adopting to tax indexation and to revise<br />
the system of family allowances will make it possible for us<br />
to achieve a much better approach to wages a vital and<br />
vexed question that affects us all. / 4 </p>
<p>We now all understand that if wages go up too much, that<br />
does add to inflation, and leads to unemployment.<br />
Surely this is a hard and harsh lesson that we have<br />
learnt over the last two or three years.<br />
Indexation and family allowances taken together, with other<br />
policies of the Government give us as a nation, an unparalleled<br />
opportunity to overcome inflation, to ease inflationary<br />
pressures and to ease the extravagant demands for more and<br />
more wages. I beleive it achieves this because these two<br />
proposals protect the real incomes of people and at the same<br />
time do much to help the poor in the Australian community<br />
As a result of these two policy measures I have asked<br />
the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr<br />
Street, to hold discussions with the Australian Council of<br />
Trade Unions and leading employer organisations. The purpose<br />
of those-discussions will be to see if the Australian Council<br />
of Trade Unions wouldi be prepared in the light of our policy<br />
announcements to modify its attitude towards wages policy.<br />
But whatever the outcome of that, we will be pressing forward<br />
because we believe these changes give Australia the chance to break<br />
inflation. They certainly give us an opportunity to support<br />
the Aribtration Commission in the high responsibilities placed<br />
upon it.<br />
We also-believe that the decisions that will be outlined in<br />
detail this week will give great confidence to all Australians.<br />
Coifidence to consumers they will be able to plan ahead, plan<br />
their future and know that Governments won't make irrational,<br />
unreasoned decisions that will upset their own individuals plans.<br />
Confidence amongst investors and I-firmly beleive, the<br />
Governm~ ent believes that those who make investment decisions<br />
now, will be the ones to reap the reward that will come from<br />
a revitalised and expanding Australia. This is certainly<br />
necessary to create the jobs and opportunities that<br />
Australians want.<br />
The measures that are being announced and which I have outlined<br />
make it plain that the Government acts for all Australians<br />
no matter where they live, who they are and what they do.<br />
My Government is a Government for all Australia.<br />
The Government accepts the great responsibility which it must bear<br />
in overcoming the problems that now confront us as a nation.<br />
But in addition, I want to say there is a responsibility on all<br />
of us for what happens to Australia. There is a responsibility<br />
on employers to exercise restraint. There is a responsibility<br />
on employees to exercise restraint. There is a responsibility<br />
on both to act with good will towards each other. The Government<br />
as I have indicated, acts for all Australians and the measures<br />
that are being introduced demonstrate that. Now let each person,<br />
each group, organisation, company and union resolve to work<br />
together for each other and for Australia.<br />
Let us all ; now resolve to make Australia an example of what<br />
a free people can achieve. </p>
