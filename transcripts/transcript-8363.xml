PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA6 DECEMBER 1991<br />
After discussions with Mr Kerin this morning, he and I have<br />
agreed on the need for a reallocation of Ministerial<br />
portfolios. As recommended by me to the Governor-General, Mr Kerin will<br />
become Minister for Transport and Communications. Mr Ralph<br />
Willis will become Treasurer and Mr Kim Beazley will become<br />
Minister for Finance.<br />
I pay tribute to John's policy contribution to the<br />
Government and to his understanding of, and agreement with,<br />
the changes I have determined.<br />
The Governor-General will swear in Ministers to their new<br />
portfolios at 8.45am on Monday. 3685<br />
