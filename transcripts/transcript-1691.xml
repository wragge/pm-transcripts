    <content><![CDATA[<p>STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />THE RT. HON. HAROLD HOLT IN THE<br />HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />19TH OCTOBEIR, 1967<br />APPOINTMENTS OF NATIONAL LIBRAIAN<br />AND PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARIAN<br />From 1st January, 1968, the two positions of National<br />Librarian and Parliamentary Librarian, which to date have been<br />vested in the one office, will be separated in recognition of<br />the development of the two libraries and the completion of the<br />new National Library building next year.<br />Mr. H. L. White, C. B. i3., who has performed the dual<br />functions since 1947, will occupy the newly created statutory<br />office of National Librarian and, by virtue of this appointment,<br />will vacate the office of Parliamentary Librarian.<br />On the recommendation of the presiding officers of<br />the Parliament, Mr. A. P. Fleming, Special Commercial<br />Adviser, Department of Trade and Industry, who is at present<br />stationed in London, will be promoted as Parliamentary Librarian<br />with the particular responsibility of developing the recently<br />established Legislative Research Service for the Parliament.<br />The appointment of Mr. WVhite and the promotion of<br />Mr. Fleming follow an amendment to the National Library Act<br />earlier this year. This will assist the separation of the<br />functions of the two libraries. NVhile it might be somewhat<br />overstating it to describe this separation as something of a<br />milestone in Parliamentary and national history, there is no<br />doubt it is of great importance because it marks a point in<br />our development where we have found two separate institutions<br />to be necessary. Perhaps the House would allow me to mention briefly<br />the Mr. White, who will assume the post of National Librarian,<br />has since 1947 held with distinction both that post and the<br />post of Parliamentary Librarian. He has actually been in the<br />service of the Parliament for 45 years a longer period, I<br />understand, than anyone else. We wish him success in his new<br />and important office.</p>
<p>ALLAN P. FLEMING,<br />PARLIAME2NTARY LIBRARIAN ELECT<br />Mr. Fleming is aged 55 and is a Bachelor of Arts of<br />Melbourne University. Before and immediately after the war he was a<br />journalist with the Argus and the Courier Mail. Mr. Fleming<br />served in the rising from Private in 1939 to the rank<br />of Lt. Colonel in 1943. He held several appointments, the last<br />being General Staff Officer I ( Operations, Land Headquarters).<br />He was awarded the O. B. E. and twice mentioned in Despatches.<br />His work with the Commonwealth Public Service since<br />the war has been widely varied. It has included the planning<br />and conduct of research as the first Director of the Joint<br />Intelligence Bureau and later Controller of Joint Service<br />organisations within the Department of Defence until 1958.<br />It has also covered since substantial negotiation<br />and conference for the Department of Trade first as Trade<br />Commissioner in Paris and London, then as First Assistant<br />Secretary in charge of the International Trade Relations<br />Division, and since 1966 as Special Commercial Adviser in<br />London. Mr. Fleming has been a member or leader of delegations<br />to G. A. T. T. and United Nations conferences on trade<br />and development.</p>
