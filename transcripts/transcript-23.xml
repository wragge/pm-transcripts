AUGUST I<br />
we are saw talwa in year after -year<br />
200,00. lmmlgranta from the OlN World<br />
w@ ic;, after aln, U. it mne may veahze'<br />
on a praportion si=. Just as if You were<br />
undertaking now to bring tM Vith your<br />
vest Population the better part of four<br />
millions ev-9 yer. TWo hundred thou-.<br />
sand imnmrnts coming Into 6 cornmunlty<br />
of 8,000. OOO. Aft that presents<br />
of cors. with tremendous problems.<br />
But we have accepted these problems<br />
because We believe that the time in overdue<br />
when mU of IUe countries that love<br />
freedom should detamins to develop<br />
their strength and not to hs" alogA and.<br />
roil. to develop their strength. But we<br />
shall have no prome strength for so great<br />
a-problem umti we have a creat vopulauion<br />
* The second thing that we are endav-<br />
. orlng to do goes hand In hand. with % hat;<br />
You cannot hairn a free world as It ought<br />
to be unlen you encaurage aflaround Is<br />
an expanding economy. We must have<br />
A expanding economy In Austalia; We<br />
must, as you have done In you time.<br />
set out. and we are Indeed now setting<br />
out on It. we must met out on a new eam<br />
of development. Here Is a great conti.<br />
nent like Australia that needs -wawe.<br />
The water falls. but 1t zuns away. It<br />
needs storage: It needs irrigation; It<br />
needs mare induastria horsepower; It<br />
needs more lmad cleared; It needs a<br />
greater production of the wealth from<br />
thie soil: It needs these things, anld it<br />
needs them quickly. I Went to taul you<br />
that so far as my own Government is<br />
onrcerned we are determined to exercise<br />
every ounce of encegy that we have to<br />
bring to to Australia In the next 10<br />
years such an amount of development.<br />
such a amount of new wmultil such a<br />
basic for new Industry. such a high liv-<br />
Ing standard for now and = epnding populations<br />
that we sthall In due course be<br />
able to look at all our triends woeund,<br />
all the world and say* " Rot only are we<br />
Your friends, but we have power to erve<br />
you and to serve ourselves, and to serve<br />
with you" [ pplause)<br />
The thir thin, Wr Speaker. and<br />
Perhaps these arm merely Ilutrative. but<br />
Yam tsaling about myr o000y-the<br />
third thing to which we are devoting our<br />
atlention is the preparation of manpower<br />
not only for industry but for the<br />
* defes of the eauntry. not only for the<br />
' defense of the aountry,~ but for the dofonse<br />
of freedom wherever freedom Is<br />
chalened. We this YeAr-I cannot go<br />
boa too far because at the moment we<br />
are a 6 or 1 months' Oovernmeavt-we<br />
are this year Introducing for the flrst<br />
tUme in pDoce in Australia a complete<br />
mean of nationl service tranng calculated<br />
to uroduce yeau by yezr under<br />
a draft system a substantial number of<br />
trained men and to build a substantial<br />
reserve over the years to come. [ AVNow.<br />
sir. I shall elaborate an those<br />
inatemu I do not want to elaborate on<br />
them. Whenever a polt~ cia speaks out<br />
of his own bailiwick. somebody Is bound<br />
to tink that he is criticising somebodY<br />
in the other bailiwick. and I do not want,<br />
to do that. All want to do ato express<br />
mty own falth and the ftith of my<br />
own cuntr7 that we all have laid on us today tMe duty to be prepared, to be<br />
' Strawg, not with the strength of a bully<br />
but with thle strenmt Of a deliverer.<br />
' The world needs the United States of<br />
America: the worid aseds the British<br />
people of the world; the world needs<br />
every sa of democratic suuwnth that<br />
can be found In it, because nobody, however<br />
optimistio nee underestimate the<br />
zmesum or the character of the dazwer<br />
tha~ t always Confronts Is. It Is not<br />
mnerely our privilege to be skrong; It Is<br />
' w duty to be ktroO&amp;<br />
Sfr, we in Australia occupy a vast conainent<br />
as big as the United Btes bt<br />
with a population, as I have mid.. no<br />
greater than yours was in the early days<br />
of the nineteenth century. But What<br />
of It? -The powr and thn eiawAn<br />
of Mhe United. stin are not the creaton<br />

growth of centuries. The spirit of<br />
America was not breathed Into you dav<br />
