PRIME MINISTER<br />
UNSCRnP* OF DOORSTOP, PALATAS RECEPTION CMWR.,<br />
wJn; en 23 FEBRARY 1990<br />
3 a 0 PR0P ONLY<br />
PM! Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a press<br />
conference, it's not for questions. But I want to take<br />
this opportunity of immediately clarifying the<br />
misrepresentation which has occurred in regard to the NCA<br />
situation. You will recall yesterday when I spoke about<br />
this matter, my remarks were directed to protecting the<br />
integrity of Lionel Bowen. Just let me refer quickly to<br />
what I had to say. I must say that I an terribly annoyed<br />
at the implication against the integrity of one of the<br />
finest men in Australian politics and I refer of course<br />
to Liohnel Boven. And I indicated then that in terms of<br />
protecting the slur on the integrity of Lionel Boven that<br />
I would make arrangements with Lionel Bowen that Mr<br />
Peacoc= k would be able to talk to Mr Boven and see the<br />
documents on the basis of Mr Boven's actions. And of<br />
course, what Mr Peacock is now suqgesting is that he<br />
should have access to all the NCA documents. Nov Mr<br />
Bovwen himself, as Attorney-oGeneral, does not have access<br />
to all those documents. All that I, of course, was<br />
referring to is the fact that if there was a<br />
Communication from the NCA to Mr Bowen asking for a<br />
reference and then a decision by Mr Boven that those<br />
documents should be available to Mr Peacock so that he<br />
could see that Lionel Bowen had acted according to the<br />
proper processes in this matter. Of course, no<br />
suggestion that Mr Peacock could have access to NCA<br />
documents but the Attorney-General himself doesn't have<br />
access to. So I hope that clears the matter once and for<br />
all. Thank you.<br />
