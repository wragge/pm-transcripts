PRIME MINISTER 3 DECEMBER 1974<br />
MT GRAVATT HOSPITAL<br />
The Prime Minister said in Canberra tonight<br />
that consideration was being given to the possibility<br />
of moving the proposed Mt Gravatt Hospital to a site<br />
at Cooper's Plains.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the Joint Hospitals<br />
Works Council for Queensland had discussed this matter<br />
at its last meeting on 19 November.<br />
This followed the Queensland Premier's rejection<br />
of a proposal that the Australian Government take over<br />
responsibility for the Mt Gravatt Hospital project to speed<br />
up its construction. . Mr Whitlam said that the Under Secretary of<br />
the Queensland Department of Health had agreed to inspect<br />
the Cooper's Plains site with a view to making a<br />
recommendation to the Queensland Minister for Health<br />
on the suitability and feasibility of that site for the<br />
proposed hospital. Mr Whitlam said consideration was also being<br />
given to a Queensland proposal to rebuild the Mater<br />
Hospital on its present site in South Brisbane. He said<br />
that discussions were currently taking place between<br />
the Queensland Health Department, the Board of the Mater<br />
Hospital and the Hospitals and Health Services Commission.<br />
They would assess the possibility of splitting available<br />
funds to finance some limited rebuilding on the Site at<br />
South Brisbane as well as the construction of a new<br />
150-200 bed hospital at Inala.<br />
