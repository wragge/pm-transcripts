SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING SESSION OF THE<br />
76TH NATIONAL CONGRESS OF THE RSL<br />
. CANBERRA, 2 SEPTEMBER 1991<br />
Your Excellency the Governor-General,<br />
Brigadier Alf Garland, RSL President,<br />
Dr Hewson,<br />
Distinguished Guests,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
The extraordinary pace of change in the international arena<br />
in recent years reaching a remarkable climax over the past<br />
two weeks will I know make many people wonder whether we<br />
need to rethink our defence policy.<br />
I want to address that issue today, because defence is one<br />
of the fundamentals of our national life, and in periods of'<br />
rapid change; it is more than ever important to make sure we<br />
have got the: fundamentals right. Perhaps the best way to<br />
refresh our sense of those fundamentals is to look back a<br />
bit. In the midst of all this great unfolding of history,<br />
literally before our eyes, it would be easy to lose sight of<br />
the past. But in a very real sense, the extraordinary<br />
events since: 1989 are the culmination of events which began<br />
more than haLlf a century ago events in which this nation<br />
of ours, and your members in particular, played a direct and<br />
memorable part.<br />
We have had some important anniversaries recently, and we<br />
will soon see many more. Next month sees the fiftieth<br />
anniversary of the decision of the Australian Parliament to<br />
hand over responsibility for wartime administration and the<br />
defence of Australia to the Australian Labor Party under the<br />
leadership of John Curtin a responsibility which was<br />
magnificentl~ y discharged. </p>
<p>This year the RSL has participated in the very successful<br />
commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the battles of<br />
Greece and Crete. Over the next few months we will mark the<br />
fiftieth anniversary of the start of the Pacific War, and<br />
remember the terrible events of late 1941 and 1942. 1 know<br />
commemorative events have been planned for Darwin, Singapore<br />
and the Coral Sea, and I am sure there will be others. I<br />
wish them well.<br />
These commemorations will recall, not just for you, but for<br />
younger generations of Australians, the most dangerous days<br />
of Australia's history, when we faced imminent threat of an<br />
invasion which we seemed powerless to resist.<br />
Remembering the Pacific War brings us back to the bedrock of<br />
our national life to the survival of that national life<br />
itself, and to the fundamental purpose of that struggle and<br />
that sacrifice the survival of Australian democracy. It<br />
reminds us what defence policy should be all about that we<br />
should never again find ourselves in the position we were in<br />
between December 1941 and May 1942.<br />
For that reason, my Governent's defence policy is based on<br />
a principle of great simplicity; that the first priority of<br />
the Australian Defence Force must be the defence of<br />
Australia. Our aim is to build a defence force which can<br />
defend Australia without assistance from the combat forces<br />
of other nations. We call that policy self-reliance.<br />
But focusing our defence policy on the defence of Australia<br />
is not only the logical reflection of our historical<br />
experience and national priorities. It also provides the<br />
basis for a practical, workable, efficient defence<br />
structure, and it defines an enduring goal that gives<br />
stability to defence planning. Those points are worth<br />
explaining in a little detail.<br />
First, the priority we give in developing the ADF to the<br />
defence of Australia provides a firm basis to the rest of<br />
our defence planning. Because we know exactly what we are<br />
trying to do, it is easier to work out how to do it.<br />
Having determined that the priority task of the ADF is the<br />
defence of Australia, the Government has developed and<br />
articulated a military strategy of layered defence which<br />
sets out how that job is to be done.<br />
Next, we have set down in detail the defence capabilities we<br />
need to make that military strategy work. By defining a<br />
concrete goal, our defence policy has gone beyond the usual<br />
strategic platitudes. It has defined exactly the<br />
capabilities we need to do the job. </p>
<p>And then we have set about the long job of building those<br />
capabilities. The contracts have been signed and the work<br />
is now being done on the largest defence investment program<br />
in Australia's peacetime history. New ships and submarines;<br />
new airbases and radars; new helicopters and armoured<br />
vehicles. The key to all these decisions is setting priorities. There<br />
will never be enough money to acquire every capability that<br />
might be useful. We need to focus our efforts on the<br />
capabilities which are really critical. And to do that we<br />
need to know exactly what we are trying to achieve; we need<br />
a clear goal. That goal is the defence of Australia.<br />
Third, our defence policy focus on the defence of Australia<br />
is an enduring principle which gives that policy its<br />
stability and durability. The decision to give priority to<br />
the defence of Australia is not the product of a passing<br />
trend. It reflects the fundamental reality that whatever is<br />
happening elsewhere in the world, and however rapidly that<br />
change might take place, the one job the Australian Defence<br />
Force must be able to do is to defend Australia.<br />
This durability is very important. Building a defence force<br />
is a slow business. Our major equipment programs often take<br />
ten years to complete. The equipment itself may last for<br />
thirty years. So the defence structure decisions we make<br />
today will determine the shape of Australia's defence forces<br />
forty years from now. We have a great responsibility to<br />
make sure that our decisions today will suit not just the<br />
world of next year, or even of the year 2000, but of 2030<br />
and beyond.<br />
But having now, I hope, made clear how the principle of the<br />
defence of Australia permeates our defence planning, I want<br />
also to explain the limits of that principle. Because those<br />
limits are also important.<br />
As I have explained, our policy is to build a defence force<br />
to defend Australia, because that is the ADF's principal<br />
role. But that does not mean that we believe the ADF has no<br />
other role. There still lingers in our defence debate the<br />
echos of the old debate between forward defence and fortress<br />
Australia. But that dichotomy has been left far behind by<br />
the development of defence technology, and of the ADF<br />
itself. It might once have been the case that Australian defence<br />
policy had to make a stark choice between defending<br />
Australia and playing a role in Australia's wider region.<br />
That is no longer the case. The capabilities which the<br />
Australian Defence Force has developed and is acquiring for<br />
the defence of Australia also provide powerful capabilities<br />
to play a role in our region of broad strategic interest and<br />
beyond. </p>
<p>This ability to use the capabilities we develop for the<br />
defence of Australia to perform other tasks further afield<br />
has always been part of our defence policy, and was set out<br />
explicitly in the White Paper of 1987. And it is an aspect<br />
of our policy which we have vigorously put into practice.<br />
With the exception of the United States, no country makes<br />
more regular or more substantial military deployments to<br />
South East Asia and the South West Pacific than Australia.<br />
And beyond our own region, no country has been more willing<br />
and more able to respond quickly and appropriately to events<br />
further afield when we believed that Australia's interests<br />
have required it.<br />
I do not need to remind you that this year we accepted the<br />
awesome responsibility of committing Australian forces to<br />
combat for the first time since Vietnam. The RSL knows<br />
better than any group in Australia just what that can mean.<br />
We were proud that the Australian Defence Force had the<br />
capability to make such a rapid, sustained and effective<br />
contribution to the international effort in the Gulf.<br />
We deployed ADF units again to northern Iraq for<br />
humanitarian relief of Kurdish refugees in the aftermath of<br />
the war, and we expect soon to send our men and women to the<br />
Western Sahara in support of the UN settlement of a longstanding<br />
dispute there.<br />
And with last week's successful meeting of the Cambodian<br />
factions in Thailand, we hope that the UN-sponsored<br />
comprehensive settlement in Cambodia, which we have worked<br />
towards for so long, will soon be implemented. Australia<br />
stands ready to contribute a major ADF contingent to help<br />
make that settlement work.<br />
So do not let anyone tell you that a defence force designed<br />
for the defence of Australia is useless for anything else;<br />
that it is just some kind of glorified coast guard. The<br />
facts of recent history simply do not sustain such nonsense.<br />
Our defence policy of self-reliance within a framework of<br />
alliances and regional associations also provides a durable<br />
basis for maintaining and developing our alliance with the<br />
United States formalised in the ANZUS Treaty which was<br />
signed forty years ago yesterday in the new conditions of<br />
the post-Cold War world. I have explained in detail<br />
recently how we see our alliances and regional associations<br />
developing as we work to build regional security, and how we<br />
see the contribution which the ADF can make to that process.<br />
For all these reasons, I believe that precisely because of<br />
the enormous uncertainty in the world today, Australia's<br />
defence policy must continue to focus rigourously on the<br />
defence of Australia as the principal task of the ADF. </p>
<p>But that does not mean that defence policy can stand still..<br />
While we must have a clear and steady goal for our defence<br />
planning, wit must be as flexible as possible about how we<br />
approach it. We must relentlessly seek the most efficient<br />
way of achieving the results we need. We must not fall int~ o<br />
the trap of assuming that the way things have been done in<br />
the past must always be the best way to do them in the<br />
future. Our aim must be to get the most defence we can for<br />
our dollar.<br />
Earlier this year, my Defence Minister Robert Ray announced<br />
the most comprehensive reforms to the management of<br />
Australia's defence forces for many years. The ADF itself<br />
has played at central role in developing these reforms; I<br />
congratulate the CDF, General Gration, and his colleagues<br />
for their far-sighted work.<br />
We said at the time that these reforms have not been<br />
undertaken to find ways to cut the defence budget. They<br />
have been undertaken to find ways of spending the defence<br />
budget better. And we have proved that in last month's<br />
budget, in which defence spending has been maintained in<br />
real terms.<br />
Nor have our reform efforts been limited to the defence<br />
portfolio. Under my very able and genial Minister Ben<br />
Humnphreys, we have been working hard to improve the services<br />
we provide to Australia's veterans. Our key initiative has<br />
been integration, which we believe will give veterans a<br />
better deal. I am pleased that your largest branch, the NSW<br />
branch, has indicated qualified support for integration, and<br />
is looking to the Commonwealth and NSW Governments to<br />
finalise arrangements. We will be delighted to continue to<br />
talk about the issue with other branches, and we hope that<br />
they too can come to see the undoubted advantages of the<br />
steps we are proposing.<br />
Finally I want to close by saying specifically to the<br />
Vietnam Veterans, who have come in recent years to be<br />
remembered properly in this country, how glad we are to see<br />
Long Tan Day becoming increasingly accepted as a day of<br />
remembrance of the Vietnam War, and how much we welcome the<br />
commencement of the Vietnam Memorial when Ben Humnphreys<br />
turns the first sod on Friday.<br />
Mr Chairman, returning to my opening theme, we have the<br />
privilege and challenge of living in the time of the most<br />
momentous change in recent history. We must all be ready to<br />
accept that challenge. I look forward to the opportunity of<br />
working with you as we do precisely that. I wish your<br />
conference well.-</p>
