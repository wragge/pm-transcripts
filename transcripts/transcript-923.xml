CONFERRING OF THE HONORARY DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF<br />
LETTERS UPON THE PRIME MINISTER. SIR ROBERT<br />
GORDON MENZIES, KT, CH. QC, MPP AT WINTHROP HALL,<br />
UNIVERSITY OF VjSqRPN USTRALA<br />
29TH APRIL, 1964+<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Mr. Chancellor, Mr. Pro-Chancellor, Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
Never in my life have I permitted myself to<br />
make a speech with my hat on and, therefore, in breach of<br />
all the rules, I take it off,<br />
I have been having a most fascinating time<br />
tonight. My mind went back to the several occasions when I<br />
got a Degree myself that I had earned; all my others are the<br />
unearned increment, I don't know what the position is today,<br />
but in my day the Bachelor of Laws had a hood with,... what<br />
do they call b. at fur? Vermin or something ( Laughter) around<br />
the edge of it. It cost you three guineas to hire it. The<br />
Master's Degree was exactly the same but it had no fur trimming<br />
and it cost you five guineas to hire it. ( Laughter)<br />
As all these distinguished graduates came up<br />
tonight, I wondered whether they were still exposed to these<br />
raids on the privy purse on such a celebrated occasion in their<br />
lives, but I had another thought as thay came up. You know,<br />
I'm getting along in years now and I begin to think thiat all<br />
the graduates are young and all the policemen are young. I<br />
suppose that's true enough, but when tonight I watched them<br />
come up Bachelors or Arts and then came along dentists.<br />
They all looked so young. ( Laughter) It was hard for me to<br />
believe that as soon as practicable, they will be saying to<br />
poor victims in the chair, " Open your mouth a little wider,<br />
please" and then using that superb phrase that all dentists<br />
have invented they don't say " Spit" they ray " Let that cat<br />
please" ( Laughter). I could quite imagine it, It was great<br />
fun, but when a most talented young man came along to be given<br />
the degree of Master of Arts for a thesis: " Personality<br />
Characteristics of Habitual Traffic Offenders",( Lauaghter) well,<br />
I thought for a moment I had better speak to my colleague, the<br />
Minister for Customs and have his thesis banned. ( Laughter)<br />
Then, of course, it is not for me to take on, in<br />
open combat, the Public Orator, except that all of those of<br />
you who have vestigial remains of your Latin in your minds will<br />
not have failed to realise that he is a Professor of the new<br />
pronunciation. Now this is one of the great problems. I say<br />
this to all of my fellow Latinists here tonight, male and<br />
female, this is one of the great problems, how you pronounce it.<br />
Oh dear, I went through most of my life thnking that disjecta<br />
membra was disjecta mzembra but tonight I was reminded that it<br />
is disyecta membra ( Laughter) Don't talk about Julius Caesar<br />
it's Yulius.( Laughter) I was reminded of Julius Caesar tonight<br />
when that charming young woman gave me thie crown, and I remembered<br />
a few scraps from Julius Caesar in ray acknowledgment.<br />
Well, now, this is not the first Public Orator<br />
under whom I have suffered. ( Laughter) It is a very odd ' thing<br />
but when you get to my stage of life and you have been able to<br />
do a little that's all in ' the university field, but you<br />
feel you've done it with great good will. people in the<br />
universities attach importance to it andwhen I look back on<br />
the number of unearned degrees that I have had al~ l over the<br />
a e / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
world, I blush for shame. I know a lot of people in Australia<br />
think that I am not capable of blushing ( Laughter) but I am,<br />
I think that on seventeen occasions these strange unpurchased<br />
fruit have fallen into my lap. Bjut I remember four of them.<br />
I wonder, Mr. Chancellor, I wonder if I might, even at this late<br />
hour, take your time by mentioning very briefly four recollections,<br />
because they are all different.<br />
One is that 7 as you have been told, I was given a<br />
degree at Oxford. Fascinating occasion, highly distinguished<br />
by the fact that one of my co-graduands was Margot Fonteyn who<br />
is now in Australia.( Laughter) She and I have no superficial<br />
resemblance whatever, ( Laughter) She had two great advantages<br />
over me. One was that she is decorative and the second is that<br />
she came late in the list. I had the great misfortune in being<br />
first in the list, only because I happened to be Prime Minister<br />
of Australia. We~ marched up tho High Street, went into the<br />
Divinity School and there, our Master of Ceremonies gave to all<br />
of us pieces of paper which contained on the one side the Latin<br />
of what was to be said about us and on the other side the<br />
English. This man was bilingual whoever did it. He did the<br />
Latin anci he did the English ai least I have always assumed<br />
that, Unfortunately for me all the others had a chance of<br />
sitting down and reading and looking wise, but I was first up,<br />
so I had no chance of looking at my English at all. The<br />
Public. Orator hc did his subject well. He had the new pronunciation<br />
thank aod the Chancellor, at that time Lord Halifax, had<br />
the old pronunciation and between the two of them I arrived<br />
at an average sort of an ide.-as to what was going on.<br />
Well, my luck was in because I stood there you<br />
can't imagine it, any of you who are not utter highbrows, you<br />
can hardly imagine what it meant standing there in the presence<br />
of all the great and learned in this great seat of learning,<br />
with the Public Orator declaiming past your right ear in the<br />
most impeccable Latin Which T knew had to cc-ntain a couple of<br />
jokes because that's he way Public Orators go on. ( Laughter)<br />
I want to tell you and this is the proudest boast<br />
of my life that I listened, I tried to appear intelligent;<br />
there were two jokes and I laughed at each of them at the time.<br />
( Laughter) This I regard os my greatest moment and nfterwards<br />
I spoke to the Plublic Orator and I said, " You know, that was a<br />
great strain on me, but still, I got the points didntt I?"<br />
He said, " Yes, you did. You did very well."' I said, " The<br />
one comfort I had was that when I looked around in the theatre<br />
to see all these immense scholars, none of them saw the joke,<br />
none of them understood a word of what was being said ( Laughter)<br />
and this made me feel that it would not be true to say that a<br />
little Latin is a dangerous thing. It is better to have little<br />
than none," 1 That was a great occasiont<br />
On another occasion, I was given a degree by<br />
the University of Laval in Quebec, a French Canadian University<br />
and L'oval is a most fascina-ting place, quite seventeentheighteenth-<br />
century in its character. As they were giving me<br />
degree, noduta euto oe mistranslation in some<br />
correspondence ( Laughter), I thought that my tinec had conae to<br />
speak sorme of ray reply in a species of French. So I did, about<br />
15r0 words, all with loving care. I walked up and down the night<br />
before and I rehearsed this, you see, and I was delighted at<br />
the result because although nobody present understood a word I<br />
said, they were all with the highest possible courtesy, looking<br />
at each other and saying, 11Tl essa-ie, ii essaio" and I thoughtthat<br />
was rather agreeable. ( Laughter) </p>
<p>-3<br />
Another one that I recall, and I must got bock to<br />
tho Latin, but I won't keep you long is the Royal University of<br />
Malta. My wife and,-I arrived in Malta one day and had a tremendous<br />
day, about foar days in one. We went all over the island we<br />
attended this and that. It was very hot; we got very we through;<br />
we got very tired, but we went on and on and on, and in the long<br />
run, I was driven down, looking as proud as a lord mayor ( if you<br />
know what I mean) ( Laughter) ( Applause) down through the streets,<br />
to receive a degree. The Governor was Lhe Chancellor and somebody<br />
else was the Vice Chancellor. They had given me, just before we<br />
had set out on our driving the oath that I was supposed to take,<br />
an oath, about, I would think, four or five hundred words. I hu-d<br />
to kneel at a faldstool and read out this oath and it was in<br />
Latin, and I had no timie to give it the study that it no doubt<br />
deserved as we were galloping up and down the island.<br />
When I arrived at the University, I said with that<br />
impudence that has served me fairly well in my life, I said to<br />
the Vice Chancellor, " Quickly, quickly, my dear boy, old pronunciation<br />
or new?" ( L. aughter) This is very important. He said,<br />
" Itts all right, nobody will ever know" ( Laughter) " Take my<br />
advice, you mumible" l ( Laughter) So I took his advice and I knelt<br />
there qnd I mumbled. My wife was very annoyed with me. My staff<br />
said, Never heard you mumble like that before". " Wellill I said<br />
" I mumbled on the best possible advice". ( Laughter)<br />
Then on another occasion this is the last one<br />
I1ll quote to you, though it is the earliest in point of time,<br />
in 194+ 1, when Winston Churchill was, of course, at the peak of<br />
his powers, Great Britain and all the rest of us were in the<br />
very throes of a struggle for existence, I was in London and I<br />
went down to Bristol to be given a degree at Bristol of which<br />
Winston Churchill was then Chancellor. A few hours before we<br />
arrived, the place was bombed and the Great Hall at Bristol was<br />
burnt and the whole town was in smoke and fire, It speaks volumes<br />
for the durability of the true university spirit that the ceremony<br />
went on. It went on in the Senate Chamber, a small place the<br />
American Ambassador the President of Harvaird, myself, Winston,<br />
the Chancellor. All the faculty came in with their academic<br />
robes thrown over the battledress, all smoke-stained, with the<br />
fires burning outside, smoke down the street,<br />
This was a memorable, an unforgettable occasion.<br />
And the ceremony went on, and it went though in the normal fashion<br />
and then the old man who, of course added to his tremendous<br />
spirit a lovely sense of the dramatic, said to me, " La. 0t's go<br />
outside and let the people have a look at us" ( Laughter) and he<br />
lit a fresh cigar and we went on to the front steps. I had a<br />
few movies taken of this by some convenient arrangement, There<br />
were the people; there was the smoke; there was the fire, and<br />
they all rose to it because their leader had not cancelled an<br />
arrangement in a great seat of learning but had made it clear<br />
that whereas the struggle must continue, learning must never be<br />
cast down. That, to me, is one of my unforgettable nomories,<br />
And, Sir that duly sunnarises everything that I<br />
would like to Says ft has been my great privilege to do something<br />
about the universities, I go back to the time when Sir Keith<br />
Murray came out to be Chairman of a Committee, and I agree, I had<br />
a great deal to do with that, but from then on what was created<br />
has gone on, I almost bel~ ieve of its own momonum. Once as a<br />
result of his Committee, once we-had established tha,-t the progress<br />
of the universities was something that was vital to the existence<br />
of Australia, that notion itself developed a momentum which I don't<br />
believe anybody, however stupid, could have stopped, We set up<br />
0 Isa .. / 1+ </p>
<p>I the Universities Commission. We have had the most unbelievable<br />
co-operation from the State Governments because never forget<br />
that although the Commonwealth Government, stepping somewhat<br />
outside its constitutional responsibility, has found many millions<br />
for the universities so have the Governments of the States.<br />
This has been a joint enterprise of the most exciting kind, and<br />
I believe that in the result, great things are happening to<br />
Australia and the future of our country is liable to be improved<br />
beyond all our imagining.<br />
Sir, I said something this afternoon about the alleged<br />
conflict between science and the humanities, I don't want to<br />
repeat it, All I want to say is that it is our business in a<br />
university, your business, our business as people who are<br />
concerned to reconcile the study of matter of phaysical or<br />
chemical lorms or elements with the study o1 man both individually<br />
and socially. This is really the great challenge to the world<br />
in the second half of this century, to have people not only<br />
clever in a scientific sense and that's essential7 if the world<br />
is to make material progress, that's essential if we are to do<br />
our duty by the now countries in the world which need growth<br />
and need improvemont, and that also in the doing of all these<br />
things we should never forget that the most important thing on<br />
earth after all is man, woman, the human being who must be<br />
understood, who must be encouraged, who must be, wherever necessary'<br />
catered for, because otherwise science can become an inhuman<br />
monster and without it, human beings can become academically<br />
disposed without purpose, without drive, without ultimate<br />
ambition for the rest of the world, This is a great joint<br />
enterprise and I know of no places in which it can be conducted<br />
half so well as in the universities.<br />
Of course, it is quite possible to be an able scientist<br />
and to be ignorant of a lot of the things that have boen referred<br />
to tonight. It would be a pity, it would be a calamity, but it<br />
is also happily quite possible and increasingly probable to be<br />
a scientist with a clear view of humanity and an acute sense<br />
of social responsibility. Look back on the biochemists. I remember saying to<br />
somebody two or three years ago, in fact I think it might be found<br />
in some essay I wrote, that when people in some of these great<br />
over-populated countries of the world the Chinese continent,<br />
the Asian mainland looked into the sky and saw a sputnik passing<br />
across above the horizon and marvelled at it and sa-id, " Isn't<br />
this tremendous. The people who can do this must be the masters<br />
of the world," a little information to them would have let them<br />
know that half of them would not be looking at it if it were not<br />
for the work of the medical researchers in the Western Hemisphere<br />
the biochemists, the people who produce all the antibiotics, the<br />
enormous discoverers, the oculists in the field of the brain.<br />
Think of all these wonderful things that have been done by the<br />
scientist and the applied scientist and we get a rather better<br />
balanced view of mankind.<br />
Sir, I believe that the course that is open to all of<br />
us is to study and practise the humanities against the background<br />
of a world which expands or contracts as scientific knowledge<br />
grows or fails, This is the great thing that we must remember<br />
and therefore, Sir, living as we do in an era of brilliant<br />
cLvernoss and immeonse manterial achievement, the like of which<br />
our great grandfathers would have regarded as utterly impossible,<br />
living as we do in this era, we still have to face up to it that<br />
whether the close of the twentieth century, our century, will find<br />
us credited by our successes, with a groat contribution to true,<br />
human, spiritual and intellectual devolopment, will be a question,<br />
part of the answer, perhaps m., ore than part of the answer, will have<br />
to be provided by the vision and faith and sense of mission of our<br />
universities. Mr. Chancellor, I thank you. </p>
