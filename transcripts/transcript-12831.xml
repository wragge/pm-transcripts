I am pleased to announce the calling of nominations for the 2002 Prime Minister';s Awards for Excellence in Community Business Partnerships. These awards publicly recognise the partnerships of business and community groups, working in a spirit of social coalition, to tackle problems of disadvantage and to build stronger local communities.<br />
Now in their fourth year, the Awards honour partnerships that have helped to improve the lives of Australians.<br />
State and territory awards will again be presented and winners will be eligible to be judged as a National winner in the small, medium or large business category.<br />
In addition, there are three Special Awards. The Long Term Partnership Special Award will honour longevity in a partnership that has been operating for more than five years. The Impact on Community by a Business Special Award will honour a business with significant community involvement covering a suite of programmes and projects, with one or more partners.<br />
The Special Media Award, a new category introduced this year, will recognise a media organisation that has provided consistent, positive reporting of community business partnerships and corporate social responsibility.<br />
National winners and Special Award winners will each receive $10,000 towards the extension of the community project.<br />
Closing date for nominations is 27 September 2002.<br />
Nomination forms and further information are available at <a href="http://www.partnership.zip.com.au">www.partnership.zip.com.au</a> or Freecall 1800 003 747 </p>
