JjAUSTHALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FMR PRESS 7 AUGUST 1976<br />
ADDRESS AT THE FEDERALISM BANQUET, MELBOURNE<br />
I am pleased to be here tonight to celebrate the 75th anniversary<br />
of the Federal system among so many people whose lives have<br />
been moulded in one way or another by Federalism.<br />
These include Federal parliamentarians, State parliamentarians,<br />
High Court Judges, Constitutional lawyers and Commonwealth and<br />
State public servants and citizens.<br />
Organisers have managed to bring together tonight a representative<br />
group of those people who give life and meaning to our Federal<br />
system. Tonight I would like to talk about the Federal system and particularly<br />
about its relation to current Australian society, about the<br />
Parliament, the Senate and the Crown.<br />
The decision to establish a Federal system in Australia was<br />
based on a number of inescapable features of the Australian<br />
situation. The facts of geography particularly the fact of<br />
distance between the major areas os settlement; the existence<br />
of well-developed administrations in the colonies with their<br />
own ways of handling local problems; the distinctive colonial/<br />
State orientations on major policy issues and the likelihood<br />
that without a Federal. system the densely populated regions<br />
would not pay sufficient attention to the needs of the more<br />
spoarsely settled regions.<br />
AlongSide these features which imposed the need for a<br />
constitutionally guaranteed distribution of power, there were<br />
a number of national interests such as defence, currency,<br />
immigration, posts, inter-colonial trade which would be most<br />
effectively handled by a national government.<br />
Since Federation we have had considerable success in overcoming<br />
the tyranny of distance. Improvements in communication have<br />
helped the formation of nationwide responses on national political<br />
matters. Personal mobility between the capital cities and the<br />
States is much greater. A genuine national economy was<br />
developed on the foundation of free trade between the colonies.<br />
Yet when all this is said, the states remain as vital realities.<br />
Each maintains its own distinctive political tradition. Each<br />
remains,. to a large extent, a genuine regional community, with its<br />
own media, its own industrial interests, its own social life,<br />
its own organisations and associations. </p>
<p>Since Federation there has been a great shift in power towards<br />
the Commonwealth Government. This shift is primarily a<br />
consequence of the fact -that the legal and financial arrangements<br />
of the Australian federation gave the Federal Government<br />
opportunities. Opportunities which political interest and<br />
circumstances encouraged it to seize. Once the trend to<br />
greater Commonwealth power was establi14shed the states in turn<br />
found that it was politically convenient to have the.<br />
Commonwealth raising the money that they spent. In these<br />
circumstances there is almost an, 4nevitability in the further<br />
tendency of the Commonwealth to direct more and more closely<br />
the expenditure of the funds it raised.<br />
These trends did not mean that the basis or the necessity<br />
for an effective and proper Federal system had vanished.<br />
They simply meant that the legal and financial arrangements<br />
of the Federation were becoming increasingly out of<br />
alignment with the real character and needs of Australian society.<br />
The Australian drift towards centralism was not in tune with<br />
developments in other modern democratic federations. Even the<br />
-model of the unitary state Great Britain seemed to be moving<br />
towards a more effective recognition of regions.<br />
The drift towards centralism created its own inefficiencies<br />
particularly in the duplication of administrative agencies<br />
and the growth of a large central bureaucracy. Moreover,<br />
this drift ran completely counter to the kind of society where<br />
a real decentralisation of power is required if people's needs<br />
are to be met in ways most sensitive to those needs.<br />
This is not only because Australia remains a country where the<br />
states largely reflect a genuine regionalism. The need for<br />
devolution of power is all the greater because of increased<br />
education, some of the changes taking place in public attitudes,<br />
and in political skills and awareness. There is a widespread<br />
call these days for all our institutions to be more responsive<br />
for those affected by decision to be able to participate effectively<br />
in the process leading to decision.<br />
A wider distribution of governmental power is surely the<br />
way to respond . to these needs and criticisms. Governments'<br />
capacity to accurately assess problems and to take into account<br />
people's judgement of their own needs is essential to effective<br />
social reform. There are mrany' important_ areas of Government<br />
action where a uniform national approach is the least<br />
appropriate way of meeting needs.<br />
But so long as state and local-government lack an adequate financial<br />
autonomy, there is a standing temptation for Commonwealth<br />
politicians to inappropriately impose their views in areas<br />
where local decisions would be more appropriate.<br />
A reasonable degree of financail autonomy is a guarantee that the<br />
distribution of government power envisaged in the federal model<br />
remains a reality. </p>
<p>one-. of the enormous merits of a properly operating<br />
Federal system is that in the longer run it should contribute<br />
significantly to the quality of Australian government.<br />
It is for these reasons that the present Commonwealth Government<br />
has initiated the most far-reaching reform of the federal<br />
arrangements since Federation. We believe that effective<br />
government requires Commonwealth,. State and local governments to<br />
take decisions appropriate to their own spheres, with matters<br />
properly concerning more than one government being decided by<br />
genuine consulta. tion and cooperation.<br />
The main features of our reforms are readily summarised:<br />
state and local governments will be given a substantial degree<br />
of budgetary independence through access to a percentage of<br />
personal invome tax revenue. We propose that each state will have<br />
the discretion to impose a surcharge or allow a rebate<br />
on the total personal income tax of that state. We<br />
believe that national objectives and reforms can be more fully<br />
achieved with a more selective use of specified purpose grants<br />
and without heavy-handed interference and duplication of<br />
functions.<br />
As a result of the changes we have introduced the states general<br />
revenue grants have been increased in 1976-77 by over 20% it<br />
is for the states to decide their priorities in spending the money.<br />
The choice for instance between an enlarged public service<br />
or welfare housing is in their hands.<br />
To date the implementation of our federalism policy has, of necessity,<br />
emphasised financial arrangements. Other aspects of our<br />
federalism policy include the establishment o-Z: an -Adv;-sory Council<br />
for Inter-government Relations which will bring together<br />
Federal, State and local government representatives and private<br />
citizens to consider common problems and consider the definition<br />
and rationalisation of functions.<br />
The far greater financial autonomy our reforms will give to the<br />
States and local government will make these governments much more<br />
significant as local points for popular demands.<br />
The federalism reforms create the opportunity for more effective<br />
responses at State and local levels. Taking up these new opportunities<br />
depends on the people themselves the extent to which they want,<br />
and are prepared to work towards, the governmental system which<br />
will most effectively meet their needs.<br />
There are a number of people who don't like our Federalism proposals.<br />
They are usually people who think they know what is best for others<br />
and who want to impose conformity on Australia.<br />
Federalism does not provide an attractive way of organising the<br />
power of government for those who think they have all the answers<br />
to the problems of their fellow citizens. </p>
<p>Federalism implicitly rejects the view that there is one<br />
right solution for all circumstances, for all communities.<br />
The belief that a few people know how to solve all our problans<br />
and that they are justified in drastically truncating the<br />
capacities of other individuals and communities to achieve their<br />
goals is a dangerous one.<br />
Our founding fathers recognised this and created an institutional<br />
system in which the diversity required for the effective<br />
development of Australia would be protected. They divided<br />
powers between the Commonwealth and State Governments. They<br />
established a High Court to adjudicate on constitutional issues<br />
brought before it, and they divided the Federal Parliament into<br />
two houses, achieving a deliberate division of power to balance<br />
population and states.<br />
They wanted the Senate to be strong and effective and gave it<br />
equal power with the House of Representatives in all matters<br />
excepting money bills. In the case of money bills they gave the<br />
Senate the power to defer or reject supply. This power was<br />
recognised in'the Constitu~ ton itself by a deliberate act of choicewithout<br />
it, there would have been no Federation.<br />
The late Sir Kenneth Bailey in his introduction to Evatt's<br />
" The King and His Dominion Governors" draws attention to the<br />
significant fact that the relationship between the two houses of<br />
the Commonwealth Parliament have not been left to convention but<br />
" have been defined and expressed in the form of law".<br />
Whatever some may say about the justification for giving the<br />
Senate this power, it is bestowed on the Senate by the Constitution.<br />
Constitutional consequence of either House refusing to pass supply<br />
is identical.<br />
In both cases the Government must go to the people. A Government<br />
that tries to rule without the Senate's approval for its expenditures<br />
is trying to rule without Parliament. To suggest that the<br />
Senate's restrained use of its constitutional power to withhold<br />
supply somehow establishes a convention more powerful than the<br />
provisions of the Constitution is, I believe, nonsense.<br />
The Senate's power exists in the Constitution, and has been<br />
acknowledged by a wide range of authorities. The use of the<br />
Senate's power is not a breach of convention but a demonstration<br />
o f-the seriousness of the circumstances it seeks to remedyv.<br />
It should also be noted that the analogies some have attempted<br />
to draw bet--ween the position of the Senate and that of the House<br />
of Lords are totally without foundation. Great Britain relies<br />
more on convention while Australia has a written Constitution-<br />
Great Britain is a unitary system, Australia is a Federation<br />
in which the States have particular rights and powers. The Members<br />
of the House of Lords are either hereditary or appointed. The<br />
Members of the Senate are democratically elected it too is<br />
a people's house. </p>
<p>To suggest that conventions and practices developed in Britain<br />
can override our own written Constitution is specious and<br />
has no grounding in either law or logic. The Constitution also<br />
imposes great and at times onerous obligations on the Governor<br />
General's office.<br />
With their commitments to the basic concepts of Parliamentary<br />
government, it would have been inconceivable to the founding<br />
fathers that a Government might ignore the cardinal Parliamentary<br />
convention that a government unable to pass supply through the<br />
Parliament must go to an election. The blunt fact is a fact<br />
on which Parliamentary supremacy over the Executive has always<br />
been founded that a government without money cannot rule.<br />
Money is the life blood of government without it, a government<br />
will die.<br />
If governments who cannot secure supply were to attempt to stay<br />
in office, government and Parliament would become unworkable<br />
and the country paralysed. Normally this would not happen.<br />
The Prime Minister of the day would advise the Governor General<br />
-that someone else should be appointed or that an election be called.<br />
If the Prime Minister of the day is not prepared to recommend either<br />
of these courses of action, the Governor General is forced as a<br />
last resort to use his power under the Constitution.<br />
In all normal circumstances the Governor General must accept the<br />
advice of his Prime Minister and Ministers. However, in<br />
exceptional circumstances when either one of the Houses of<br />
Parliament has deferred or rejected supply and when the Prime<br />
Minister despite this tries to stay in office, the Governor General<br />
is forced to act.<br />
In these exceptional circumstances, the. Governor General can<br />
only meet his Constitutional obligations which are there for<br />
the benefit of the people by establishing the conditions<br />
in which an election will be held, and the people's will determined.<br />
The only alternative would be an appropriate constitutional device<br />
which would secure an automatic election if Parliament denied<br />
supply. I hope nobody will support the contention that Parliament ought<br />
not to maintain control over the supply of money to the Executive.<br />
It was an attempt to achieve just this that compelled the Governor<br />
General to act as he did.<br />
We should spare a moment to think'of the difficulty of the decision<br />
which the Governor General was forced to make. It should also be<br />
noted that the Governor General did not put himself in the position.<br />
He was placed in it by his Government. In these circumstances<br />
the Governor General has a right to expect from others<br />
particularly his advisers reasonable and rational discussions of<br />
the constitutional issues, free from all threats or sanction or<br />
dismissal. That as we know, was not the case.<br />
A servant of the Constitution who discharges his constitutional<br />
obligations in a situation fraught with the greatest difficulties<br />
is worthy of the highest regard. </p>
<p>Through the 75 years of our Federation, there have been<br />
some shifts in the balance and division of power. Those of<br />
a Liberal philosophical persuasion believe that there should<br />
be a maximum devolution of power to the public they are<br />
increasingly well educated, critical and concerned with politics.<br />
In achieving devolution and fostering participation we will get<br />
a greater awareness of what Government can or cannot do.<br />
Encouraging the maximumn effective participation by people in the<br />
political process fosters a realistic appreciation of the limits<br />
and possibilities of government action.<br />
Federalism makes possible the most effective devolution of power,<br />
the most effective responses by government to peoples' needs,<br />
and develops the competence and understanding of the citizens<br />
on which democracy always depends. 000oo000 </p>
