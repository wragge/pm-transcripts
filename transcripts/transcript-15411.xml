<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>The internet has transformed the way we communicate and gather information. It's helping us to educate our children and engage with the world.</p>
<p>Like the real world  however there are many things on the internet that our children should not see. Offensive and inappropriate material is often just a few mouse clicks away and not everyone children meet online can be trusted.</p>
<p>To help Australian Families protect their children the Government has today announced a world leading $189 million initiative to protect children from online dangers.</p>
<p>The program combines education, parental support and free online content filters to help protect young people from illegal and offensive material.</p>
<p>The best filtering technology will be provided free of charge to every Australian family and every public library. The filters will block access to websites banned by Australia's internet regulator and allow users to set their own family-value profiles. </p>
<p>We'll also be expanding the Federal Police's online child exploitation team and launching a public education campaign to raise awareness of the risks facing children.</p>
<p>While no single measure alone can protect children from online harm, the Australian Government is committed to doing all it can to limit the risks the internet poses to children and vulnerable young people.</p>
