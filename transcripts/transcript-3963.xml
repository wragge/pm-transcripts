EMBARGO: 6.00 PM<br />
Press Statement No. 590<br />
9 November 1975<br />
THE BUDGET -THE SENATE DELAY<br />
our nation is now entering the fifth week of the<br />
Constitutional crisis caused by the action of the Senate<br />
in blocking the Budget. Amid all the worry and anxiety<br />
caused by the actions of the Senate, the message I wish to<br />
bring tonight is basically one of reassurance. The really<br />
important thing that has happened in Australia over the<br />
last three or four weeks has been the proof of the basic<br />
strength and steadiness of the Australian people, their<br />
political maturity, their Common sense in circumstances<br />
which for all of us are new, challenging and uncharted.<br />
There has been. this paradox: that on an issue<br />
containing the seeds of deep division and disruptin there has<br />
been a display of national unity and common purpose from the<br />
vast majority of ordinary Australians and from all sections<br />
of the community such as we have not had on any issue since<br />
the war. I have drawn great reassurance from it, and I<br />
believe all Australians, whatever their political persuasion<br />
and indeed whatever their opinion on this specific issue may<br />
be, can take reassurance from it confidence about the<br />
fundamental stability and maturity of our country.<br />
Not the least encouraging, not the least remarkable<br />
has been the clear support shown for the principle of<br />
Parliamentary democracy by our fellow Australians, born<br />
overseas. In so many cases they came here from countries<br />
either where there was no genuine Parliamentary democracy or<br />
where irresponsibility and factionalism made the Parliamentary<br />
system unworkable. They are now appalled to find that.<br />
the right of the elected government to govern twice elected<br />
in less than three years is now being challenged in Australia.<br />
The second ground for reas surance is the loyalty<br />
and solidarity already shown by the Public Service throughout<br />
Australia. Clearly the basic business of the nation cannot<br />
continue without their co-operation. For instance, while<br />
money is certainly available to pay all pensions, the actual<br />
delivery of payment requires that officers can continue to.<br />
do their job. It's because of this that the Government is<br />
determined to do all within its Constitutional and legal<br />
power to ensure that pensions are paid, that Public Servants<br />
can do their job and that the Armed Forces can continue at<br />
their posts. / 2 </p>
<p>Public Servants will be paid in the normal way on<br />
13 and 27 November. Thereafter the banks -the private banks<br />
as well as the Commonwealth Bank and the State Government<br />
banks are concerned to ensure that their customers, whose<br />
incomes are threatened, obtain credit during this difficult<br />
time. The Government welcomes the statement by the banks<br />
that they will do all they can to provide credit. We shall<br />
co-operate with them. That is, the very least we could do<br />
for the loyal Public Servants who are sticking by their posts.<br />
The third ground for confidence and reassurance i~ s<br />
the attitude of the industrial movement and increasingly,<br />
as the implications of the Senate's conduct become clearer,<br />
the attitude of the business community. I acknowledge that<br />
before the Budget, most businessmen would have preferred a<br />
change of Government. But it's been very clear for the past<br />
month that what most businessmen now want is for our Budget<br />
to pass and for that Budget to be given a real chance to work.<br />
The Budget spells out the way to economic recovery the sole<br />
but difficult, delicate path to recovery.<br />
We emphasised the need for the restoration of investment<br />
confidence. That's very important. But there's another side<br />
to the coin. We seek co-operation from employees their<br />
unions and associations and we are getting it. That<br />
co-operation is the whole key to the chance of restoring<br />
investment profitability. But how long can we expect it to<br />
last if the Budget is further stalled?<br />
It cannot be repeated too often: the Senate could<br />
not now be doing what it is except for the death of a<br />
Labor Senator, Senator Milliner, and the scandalous<br />
unconstitutional appointment of a non-Labor replacement.<br />
This whole crisis would not be happening in the way that it<br />
is happening except for the death of Senator Milliner and<br />
its shameful aftermath.<br />
The people of Australia are now very properly asking<br />
" where will it end?" It will end as soon as the Senate<br />
stops this nonsense, abides by the Constitution and passes<br />
the Budget and allows the duly elected government to govern.<br />
it will end tomorrow if the Senate stops stalling and does<br />
its Constitutional duty and its duty by Australia.<br />
In a very real sense, this issue will be decided<br />
by the Australian people. If we all refuse to be panicked,<br />
if we all refuse to be blackmailed, if we hold firm together,<br />
I cannot but believe that there are enough men and women in<br />
the Senate who, seeing their duty and responsibility, will<br />
also do their duty.<br />
