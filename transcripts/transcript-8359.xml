PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 2 DECEMBER 1991<br />
The final sectoral reports of the Ecologically Sustainable<br />
Development ( ESD) Working Groups were tabled in Parliament<br />
today. The reports, covering nine major industry sectors, mark the<br />
culmination of a cooperative process initiated by the<br />
Government in August 1990, involving representatives from<br />
a industry, union, conservation, consumer and welfare<br />
organisations, Commonwealth, State and Territory<br />
Governments. The Working Groups have sought to provide recommendations to<br />
Government on ways of moving key industry sectors onto an<br />
ecologically and economically sustainable pathway for the<br />
long term.<br />
Achieving ecologically sustainable development is critical<br />
if governments are to ensure that not only present, but<br />
future, generations of Australians benefit from sustained<br />
improvements in their quality of life in both material and<br />
non-material terms.<br />
Australia's environmental problems will not be immediately<br />
solved by these reports rather, they mark the beginning of<br />
a long term process of transition. They provide an outline<br />
of the current position of our industries, and recommend a<br />
number of actions which can be pursued, in order to make<br />
those industries more sustainable.<br />
The reports will provide a valuable resource for all levels<br />
of Government to draw on in developing strategies to<br />
facilitate the transition to ESD.<br />
It is my hope that by the middle of next year, we will be<br />
well down the track of having developed an initial national<br />
strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development.<br />
I thank the Chairs of the ESD process, Professor Stuart<br />
Harris, Professor David Throsby and Dr Roy Green, for their<br />
work and guidance of the nine groups charged with drafting<br />
the reports. I also extend my thanks to the individual<br />
working group participants, and to the organisations they<br />
represented, who devoted substantial resources and expertise<br />
to this process.<br />

<p>ie Government is considering ways of harnessing the<br />
, operation shown within groups and maintaining the<br />
ivolvement of key interest groups in the process.<br />
he continued cooperation of State, Territory and local<br />
overnments, will be very important in carrying the process<br />
f ESD forward. I am pleased that Premiers and Chief<br />
inisters have agreed to participate in the<br />
ntergovernmental Ecologically Sustainable Development<br />
lorking Group which the Commonwealth proposed to consider<br />
: he outcomes of the ESD process.<br />
Round Table with key interest groups is planned in the<br />
iear future. The meeting will be chaired by a senior<br />
officer of my Department, and will discuss their further<br />
involvement in the ESD process, and wider public<br />
consultation requirements, during the next phase of strategy<br />
development and implementation.<br />
The nine sectoral Working Group reports cover Agriculture,<br />
Energy Production and Distribu': ion, Energy Use, Fisheries,<br />
Forest Use, Manufacturing, Mining, Tourism and Transport.<br />
Two further reports will also be shortly released. They are<br />
the ESD Intersectoral Report prepared by the ESD Chairs,<br />
covering issues common to the key industry sectors ( such as<br />
public health, employment, equity, research and development,<br />
and biodiversity), and a separate report on greenhouse<br />
which, together with the Working Group reports, examines<br />
options to achieve the Government's interim planning targets<br />
for emissions of greenhouse gases, and the most<br />
cost-effective combination of measures needed to achieve<br />
these targets. 3453 </p>
