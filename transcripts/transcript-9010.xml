AGENDA ITE1 3 . IULTILATERAL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS<br />
TRADE NEGOTIATIONS IN THE CONCLUDING PHASE<br />
Heads of Delegation, delegates<br />
Gratified to hear so many speakers expressing strong support for the<br />
urgent completion of the Uruguay Round of Trade Negotiations<br />
trade has always been the basis for economic growth and<br />
development<br />
Earlier this wxeek, the Cairns Group, led by Australia, and including<br />
Malaysia, Canada and New Zealand aVgeed on a strongly-worded<br />
communique which set out parameters for concluding the Round by<br />
December and Ministers led by Senator Cook presented this to key<br />
participants in Europe<br />
Completion of the Uniguay Round negotiations is the single most<br />
important task on the economic agenda for national governments<br />
and the international trading community<br />
No other action could do more to revive the hesitant world<br />
economy.<br />
After seven years, the negotiations face a real deadline by 15 December<br />
only 55 days away<br />
The Uruguay Round is not just a bilateral issue between the world's two<br />
largest trading blocs<br />
The Round outcome will encourage the integration of developing<br />
countries into the international trading and financial systems of the<br />
global economy<br />
Recent World Bank/ OECD study, mentioned by John Major and others<br />
yesterday, demonstrates that all countries have a stake in the Round </p>
<p>potential gains for the world economy of USS213 billion by<br />
2002 ( up to USS190 billion of this from liberalisation of<br />
agricultural trade)<br />
developing countries would obtain a direct share of these gains<br />
over USS70 billion from the agriculture package and a<br />
further USS8 billion from the liberalisation of<br />
manufactures<br />
And these estimates do not take into account the Round outcome on<br />
services, the fastest growing area of wrld trade<br />
These potential benefits for developing countries are at least<br />
equivalent to the amount industrial countries annually transfer as<br />
official aid ( around USS55 billion in 1991)<br />
The Uruguay Round has been the mosl ambitious round of multilateral<br />
trade negotiations it has engaged all 111 contracting parties of the GATT<br />
developing countries have been more involved in the<br />
negotiations than in any previous GATT Round in the hope of<br />
obtaining improved access to markets<br />
The outcome will cover sectors of interest to developing countries<br />
such as agriculture, textiles and tropical products<br />
multilateral liberalisation in the Uruguay Round will also remove<br />
the bias against processed exports fiom developing countries<br />
outcomes on intellectual proper. and investment measures will<br />
ensure new technologies and investments are available to share<br />
The result of the Uruguay Round should be a comprehensive,<br />
balanced and coherent set of trade rules to meet the needs of a more<br />
interdependent Nworld </p>
<p>it should deliver significant cuts in the distortions to trade in<br />
agriculture; reductions in tariff and non-tariff barriers to industrial<br />
products, including textiles; and new agreements on services and<br />
intellectual property, embodied in an overhauled legal and<br />
institutional framework<br />
Failure to conclude the Round risks unleashing protectionism and<br />
unilateralism political will is needed to surmount rising populist protectionist<br />
pressures and resist narrow interest groups in some of the world's<br />
major economies<br />
The Round was commenced covering the full range of interests of all<br />
participants and it must be completed this way<br />
reject suggestions of partial or interim solutions for the benefit of<br />
some<br />
Commonwealth countries have, in the past, expressed their strong support<br />
for the Uruguay Round<br />
it is time for us to say clearly tc the world that the Uruguay Round<br />
must be concluded this year and it must be a balanced outcome.<br />
We have an opportunity to put the Commonwealth's name to a separate<br />
statement calling on all participants in the negotiations to show good<br />
faith and stop using their self-interested concerns as an excuse for delay.<br />
A substantive statement on this subject at this critical time, which had the<br />
full support of this diverse group, could have a positive impact on the<br />
negotiations Know extensive consultations have occurred amongst delegations here<br />
over the past few days on the text of a possible statement<br />
which should be in the strongest possible terms and be conveyed in<br />
the clearest possible way to le2ders of the major countries.<br />
National political expediency for some cannot be allowed to stand in<br />
the way of a global result of benefit to all </p>
