Merry Christmas.</p>
<p>In the Gillard family, Christmas is a time for tradition.</p>
<p>Everyone has the same job on Christmas Day. I always get to peel the potatoes and carrots.</p>
<p>We eat the same food in the same order. Dad tells the same jokes!</p>
<p>We get a little older each year, and the presents for my niece and nephew have changed as the years go by, but not too much else does.Whether that's time in church, or with your family, or at the cricket or on the beach, or helping others, I hope this Christmas is a special one.</p>
<p>Christmas is also a time when we reflect on what's been.</p>
<p>After lunch on Christmas Day, I think many of us have that quiet moment where we look around and think, 'all in all, we're lucky to have each other'.</p>
<p>Certainly, that's how I feel about our country this Christmas.</p>
<p>We are all Australians, all people of this place, and as a people, as a nation, we have got so much to be grateful for.</p>
<p>Through it all, there's nowhere I'd rather be. We are still lucky.</p>
<p>For some I know Christmas this year is a sad time.</p>
<p>We lost a lot of brave Australians this year: from the 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment, from the 2nd Commando Regiment, from the Special Air Service Regiment, from 6 RAR.</p>
<p>They died for us and I know every Australian has a special thought for their partners and children, their families, and their mates, this Christmas. We don't forget.</p>
<p>Just as Christmas reminds us of the good things we have, it can be a tough time for some among us. So if your Christmas is a sadder one this year because of family problems, or illness, or the loss of a loved one, I hope you know that you're never alone.</p>
<p>2010 has been an eventful year in our country's life, but above all else, we shouldn't forget the most wonderful thing that happened this year.</p>
<p>The drought broke in the eastern states at last.</p>
<p>Of course, it's never easy on the land, and I know that now it's flooding which is making life hard in many places even today.</p>
<p>But we're grateful for some of the rain at least.</p>
<p>We think of the farmers still in drought. We wish some of the rain would come your way now too.</p>
<p>I want to say something to Australians who have to work at Christmas to serve and protect us.</p>
<p>Our police and fire fighters, our ambulance officers and nurses, emergency personnel and of course our troops abroad ... so many people sacrifice their Christmas Day to make life better for others.</p>
<p>It's hard to think of a more generous Christmas present than that.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Finally, whether you're going around the corner or across the country please drive safely. Don't make next Christmas a sad anniversary.</p>
<p>For all Australians, my wish is that this Christmas, wherever you are in our country or overseas, you have the chance to do those special things that mean Christmas for you, with people who are special to you.</p>
<p>I wish you the merriest of Christmases and the happiest of New Years.</p>
