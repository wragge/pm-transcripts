STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
ANDREW OLLE<br />
It was with deep regret that I learned tonight of Andrew Olle's death.<br />
For many years he has been among Australia's most distinguished, respected<br />
and admired journalists. The news of his fatal illness came as a terrible<br />
shock not only to those who knew him personally and professionally, but to<br />
those millions of Australians who knew him through radio and television.<br />
His tragically premature death is a great loss to his profession and to<br />
Australian public life.<br />
It is also, of course, a terrible loss to his wife and family and friends and to<br />
them I extend my deepest sympathy.<br />
