PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PIRESSi 8th February, 1978<br />
OPENING OF NEW MERCEDES-BENZ TRUCK PLANT, MULGRAVE<br />
I am very pleased to have been invited here to Mwalgrave today<br />
to open. this new truck assembly plant for Mercedes-Benz.<br />
I understand that a little later 1 shall have the opportunity<br />
to be driven in a new Mercedes-Benz truck, the first off the<br />
new production line.<br />
I am further told that this truck has been especially modified<br />
to suit Australian conditions. I was moost interested to hear<br />
what these necessary modifications are they sound like a<br />
recipe for an Australian politician. The truck is a pri'me<br />
mover designed to withstand a long haul. There is a new cooling<br />
system to combat extreme temperatures, and particular attention<br />
has been paid to improving the quality of the exhaust system.<br />
it is most pleasing that Daimler-Benz, -the World's biggest<br />
diesel truck manufacturer, have demonstrated their confidence<br />
in the future of Australia by proceeding with this plant. i<br />
understand the construction of this plant represents a capital<br />
investment of about<br />
This new plant will enable your company to increase significantly<br />
its use of Australian employment and materials. The completion<br />
of this plant, I understand, brings all major Mercedes-Benz<br />
coimnercial vehicle operations in Australia into one complex,<br />
enabling the development of further models specifically suited.<br />
for Australian conditions.<br />
New investment such as this is vital to the Australian economry.<br />
The Government's objective is to reduce inflation and unemployment,<br />
and secure a full economic recovery. For this to happen, increased<br />
capital investment like this plant is essential. It creates<br />
new jobs, it enables increases in productivity and efficiency, and<br />
it helps to provide greater choice, service and quality of product<br />
for the Australian consumer.<br />
That is why one of the first actions of the Government on comning<br />
to office was to introduce an investment allowance, and to encourage<br />
more actively foreign investment in Australia. That is also why<br />
the Government has been prepared to give these industries that have<br />
set up in Australia, and the Australian workers whose jobs depend<br />
upon therm, the protection they need. </p>
<p>I<br />
The protection we have given, looked at over the totality of<br />
our trade, is reasonable in fact, in many respects, our record<br />
is better than that of the major trading blocs.<br />
While we have protected our secondary industry, we have still<br />
allowed considerable access to our markets by other countries.<br />
For our size, we are a major importer of industrial products.<br />
in 1975, for example, the value of our imports of industrial<br />
products per head of population ( US$ 554) was nearly thiree times<br />
that of E. E. C. ($ 197) and U. S. A. ($ 208) and over six times<br />
that taken by Japan<br />
in 1974 half of our industrial imports entered Australia completely<br />
free of duty. In Japan and U. S. A. by comparison, only 31% and 16%<br />
of imports were in the same category in that year. Less than<br />
9% of Australia'a total imports were subject last year to any<br />
form of quantitative restriction or other emergency restraint.<br />
By contrast, many of our major exports are subjected to such<br />
restrictive measures by one or more of the Japan and<br />
the United States countries with a combined domestic market<br />
of over 580 million people.<br />
E. r. C. import levies effectively exclude all our dairy products,<br />
sugar and soft wheat, and limit beef imports to a negligible<br />
amount. Despite .4000 tonnes of European cheese entering this country<br />
annually, we cannot sell even a kilogram of butter to Europe.<br />
The United States import quotas exclude all but a minimal<br />
quantity of our dairy products, and oar beef is subject to<br />
voluntary restraint arrangements. Japan severely restricts<br />
imports of beef.<br />

<p>-3-<br />
In even pne of our most protected industries, passenger motor<br />
vehicles, 20% of the market is made available to importers of<br />
foreignr vehicles.<br />
Yet the which supplies 90% of its own steel requirementi3,<br />
through its inefficient and highly subsidised domestic industry,<br />
now wants to ill imports of Australian steel.<br />
restrict<br />
In sharp contrast to overseas practice, Australian protection isE<br />
mostly in the form of tariffs. They are applied after an open<br />
public enquiry has been held, a procedure which few other developed<br />
countries have. Unlike quantitative restrictions, tariffs do allow<br />
continued access by imports and some measure of competition.<br />
What is more, our level of tariff protection fell by more than<br />
a quarter between 1968/ 69 and 1974/ 75. Comparing simple averages<br />
of tariff rates, our tariffs on industrial items are only slightly<br />
higher than the the E. E. C. and Japan, all of which use nontariff<br />
measures more widely than Australia, and take a far more<br />
restrictive approach than Australia on agricultural products.<br />
Australia also has a far better record than many other major<br />
industrial countries in our trade with developing countries.<br />
Some 80% of imports from developing counitries now enter Australia<br />
either duty-free or at preferential tariff rates, and we take more<br />
imports of industrial products per capita from developing countries<br />
( US$ 45.3 in 1975) than the United States Canada<br />
the E. E. C. or Japan<br />
Given the way many of our products have been dealt with overseas,<br />
it is perhaps remarkable that our markets are as open as they are<br />
to imports. We do ourselves a disservice when we seek to suggest<br />
to ourselves, and thus to the World, that Aestralian trading<br />
policies are unduly protective of A4ustraliani manufacturing industry.<br />
They are not.<br />
if we were freely allowed to export and sell all the products<br />
which we produce best and cheapest,-then our trading position would<br />
be far stronger. But the restrictions imposed on our exports<br />
by the Japan and, on occasions which we cannot ignore, by<br />
the United States, are such that some of Australia's most efficient<br />
industries by World standards are in a grievous financial position.<br />
The total Australian econo-my is thereby weakened.<br />
Obviously, this has significant employment consequences, and<br />
consequences for the kind of competition we can allow in our<br />
domestic mnarket. The issues of trade and incentives to local<br />
industry affect-us all---the worker on the assembly line every<br />
14tas much as the businessman and the consumer.<br />
The Government this year will be expending much effort and<br />
time in endeavouring to secure access for our ex'ports on terms<br />
as advantageous as the access which we extend to importers to<br />
this country. / 4 </p>

This~ j will of couirse be the prirsicipail concern of the new Minister<br />
for Special Trade Rlepresentations, Vic Garlnd, as well as the<br />
active concern of the Deputy Priinb Minister, the Minister for<br />
rim~ rary Industry, and mnyself.<br />
We are also comrmitted this year to re-intro( 1ucinq an) effective<br />
scheme of export incentives.-;<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, this truck. assembly plant is a elom<br />
development for M'ulgrave, for Victoria, for Australia, and above<br />
all for Mercedes-Benz, and those Aiistralian~ wor): ing-mcn and womnen<br />
