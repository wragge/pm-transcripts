Prime Minister Julia Gillard has extended her deepest sympathies to the United States on behalf of the Australian Government and people, following the terrible loss of life and suffering caused by severe storms that hit southern states this week.</p>
<p>The Government today offered to support the United States in any way possible as severe tornadoes claimed hundreds of lives across the southern part of the country. Australians have watched these tragic events with sheer disbelief, particularly in light of the events we saw in our own backyard over our summer. The magnitude and severity of this disaster has devastated communities and the livelihoods of so many.  States of emergency have been declared in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Virginia. Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd said Australians empathise with the suffering and loss being experienced by hundreds of thousands of Americans. The United States is one of our closest friends and we are always there for each other. If you have concerns for friends or family in this region, you should attempt to contact them directly in the first instance. The DFAT Consular Emergency Centre can be contacted on 1300 555 135 from within Australia or +61 2 6261 3305 from overseas </p>
