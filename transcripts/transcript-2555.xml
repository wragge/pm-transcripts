Statement by the Prime Minister, The Rt Hon. William<br />
McMahon, C. H. M. P.<br />
The Prime Minister said today he welcomed the first formal<br />
meeting of the Australian Environment Council as evidence of a<br />
co-ordinated nationwide approach to the problems of improving and<br />
protecting the environment and the management of pollution throughout<br />
Australia. The Council, which comrrises Commonwealth and State<br />
ministers resonsible for environmental matters, meets in Sydney<br />
tomorrow. Mr. McMahon 3aid that Commonwealth/ State co-operation was<br />
essential to the effective solution of problems associated with the<br />
environment. The Commonwealth wanted to facilitate co-operation and<br />
ensure a common approach which was essential to effective control and<br />
protection measures. He said the Commonwealth had now decided to establish its<br />
own Commonwealth Advisory Committee on the Environment. A~ full<br />
statement covering the function and persohnel of this new advisory<br />
body would soon be made by the Minister for The Environment, Aborigines<br />
and The Arts, Mr. Howson.<br />
The Prime Minister said a major share of the responsibility<br />
for the environment within State boundaries lay with State and local<br />
governments and there were already encouraging signs of success.<br />
The States were already showing their concern and their<br />
capability through the establishment of new ministries and authorities<br />
and the implementing of stronger control measures.<br />
Mr. McMahon also emphasised that Government activities<br />
needed to be supplemented by the work of private organisations and<br />
companies if anti-pollution and environmental protection efforts were<br />
to succeed.<br />
