FOR MEDIA 31 March 1983<br />
In the event that the Tasmanian Government and the H. E. C.<br />
continue to work on the dam in defiance of Commonwealth law,<br />
we will have no alternative but to take, as soon as possible,<br />
the next step in the legal process, which is to seek an<br />
injunction in the High Court to prohibit further work on<br />
the dam.<br />
I note in this respect that Mr Gray has clearly now indicated<br />
that he will abide by any decision of the High Court.<br />
It is certainly not the Commonwealth Government's intention<br />
to take any punitive action under these regulations against<br />
any individual worker.<br />
The regulations, including their penalty provisions, have been<br />
framed to provide the necessary legal basis on which the<br />
Commonwealth can go to the High Court to seek an injunction<br />
to stop the dam should this become necessary.<br />
