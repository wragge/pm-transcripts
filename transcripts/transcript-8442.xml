TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, CANBERRA<br />
6 MARCH 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: What chance do you give the Party in Wills, now that<br />
you have set a date?<br />
PM: Well, the Liberal Party have a 20 point lead in the<br />
polls. I mean for them, they ought to be regarding<br />
this as a shoe-in. So we always knew it would be a<br />
battle : for us, but we'll fight it out.<br />
I<br />
J: How much time will you spend fighting it?<br />
PM: Who got you up this early Laurie ( Oakes)? Early bird<br />
catches the worm.<br />
J: Why are you talking your chances down in Wills?<br />
PM: Well, for the simple reason that the Labor Party's<br />
stocks have been reasonably low in the State of<br />
Victoria, and we have been 20 points behind, that's<br />
why. It is not a matter of talking it down, it's fact.<br />
But again we've got a bit of a margin there. But the<br />
by-election swings have been larger generally than our<br />
margin, notwithstanding the general situation in<br />
Victoria.<br />
J: Will you be there very often yourself?<br />
I<br />
PM: Well, enough Laurie ( Oakes), whatever that turns out to<br />
be.<br />
J: Will you do a Bob Carr and go to the supermarkets?<br />
PM: I don't know whether that is the thing to do, but I<br />
will do what I think is best.<br />
J: How big a threat are independents in Wills? </p>
<p>PM: I don't know. I don't know. But we will fight Wills<br />
hard. We will fight Wills hard. The Labor Party<br />
stands for something. We stand for changing the State<br />
of Victoria. This statement, ' One Nation', will vastly<br />
improve the business base of Victoria, the commerce,<br />
trade, freight, new businesses, a whole new industry<br />
for Victoria and it beats taxing your Weeties and your<br />
Kelloggs at 15 per cent.<br />
J: No tax cuts for low income earners...?<br />
PM: We are not here for open heart surgery Paul,<br />
( Bongiorno).<br />
J: What do you think about the cricket loss last night?<br />
PM: Oh well.<br />
