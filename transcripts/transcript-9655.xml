PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON PJ KEATING MP<br />
JOHN HOWARD'S MEAN SPIRITED POSITION ON ABORIGINAL FLAG<br />
With his mean-spirited position on the flags of the Aboriginal and Torres<br />
Strait Islander peoples John Howard has shown he believes their flags<br />
should have no official recognition.<br />
He has again demonstrated that he cannot tolerate change.<br />
The Government decided on the 20th of June that the flags of the Aboriginal<br />
and Torres Strait Islander peoples would be proclaimed official flags bringing<br />
them into line with at least 22 other flags in Australia.<br />
Flags in this category such as the Civil Air Ensign, the flag of Norfolk Island,<br />
and the Customs flag are all secondary to the National Flag.<br />
The National Flag will still be flown in the pre-eminent position.<br />
This change means that, for example, it will no longer be a breach of protocol<br />
for a young athlete like Cathy Freeman to carry the Aboriginal flag with pride.<br />
Recognition of the flags is an inclusive act. For John Howard to argue that<br />
this move is divisive is to suggest that these flags are somehow less worthy<br />
than other Australian symbols.<br />
Official recognition of the flags is in line with a unanimous recommendation of<br />
the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation in its recent report to the<br />
Government on proposed social justice measures. The coalition is<br />
represented on the council.<br />
The only person seeking to play politics with flags is Mr Howard.<br />
