PRIME MINISTER 111/ 92<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
11cr Majesty The Queen has indicated her view that it is appropriate that Australian<br />
citizens should be recogniscd exclusivcly by the Australian system of honours, of<br />
which she is proud to be thc Sovereign. r<br />
Accordingly I have consulted with the Premiers of all States and we have agreed<br />
that Australian Governments, both State and Commonwealth, will henceforth cease<br />
to miake recommendations for British honours.<br />
Thc change I have announced does not exclude the possibility of TrheQueen, as<br />
Queen of Australia, honouring her Australian subjects with an award within her<br />
own personal Order, the Royal Victorian Order, nor those other honours which arc<br />
wholly within hcr own gift, namely the Orders of the Garter, Thistle and Merit.<br />
