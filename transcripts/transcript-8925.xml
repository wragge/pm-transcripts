SPEECH BlY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
SANDAKAN MEMORIAL SERVICE, RURWOOD PARK<br />
1 AUGUST 1993<br />
The people whose initiative has built this memorial have done their country a great<br />
service. It commemorates the most appalling event in Australia's war history.<br />
Two thousand five hundred Australian and British soldiers were taken to Sandakan,<br />
Only six survived and, because the Japanese authorities covered up the story, it is only<br />
from these six that we know what happened.<br />
Three times more men died at Sandakan and Ranau, and in the jungles betwcen, than died<br />
in those heroic battles at Kokoda in New Guinea,<br />
The Sandakan men did not die in battle they were tortured, massacred or allowed to<br />
perish of disease.<br />
Yet until now Sandakan has been forgotten.<br />
The families of those who died received the most perfu~ nctory of messages they never<br />
knew what happened to their husbands, fathers, sons, brothers, uncles.<br />
Knowing how and why makes a great deal of difference to thosqe who are left behind.<br />
Knowing even when the truth is awful is better than the horror and dread of not<br />
knowing at all.<br />
What is true for the loved ones left behind is also true for the country they never saw<br />
again. It is better to know. :-131<br />

<p>Australians should know the truth about their history.<br />
A nation is stronger for knowledge of its shared experience, and the experience of these<br />
men should be engraved in thie national memory.<br />
With this memorial we remember these Australian and British soldiers who fell victim to<br />
acts of cruelty and sadism as horrifying as any in World War 11.<br />
Sandakan must be known. It must not be forgotten.<br />
I don't say this because one of my own family died there, or because the deaths of these<br />
men are to be regretted more than any others whether they were in Burma, or New<br />
Guinea, or the Middle East or any of the other places where Australians have fought and<br />
died. I say Sandakan must be known because all Australians should recognse that these men<br />
died in the defence of their country they died as prisoners, as slaves, but they were no<br />
less at war with the enemy.<br />
The final victory was as much theirs as anybody elses,<br />
It must be known because it is a reminder of what was at stake in the Pacific War, and<br />
how much we owe all those Australian men and women and their allies who fought and<br />
finally won.<br />
At stake was the democratic civilisation Australians had built in this country and those<br />
ideas of what is fair and just in which they believed.<br />
The land they loved was at stake, the land they believed in.<br />
The events in Sandakan should be known because we should never forget that there have<br />
been generations of men and women prepared to die for Australia.<br />
We owe a debt to them. Every succeeding generation owes them. Their sacrifice helped<br />
Lis survive.<br />
It should also help us believe.<br />
We should remember Sandakan for one reason above all others.<br />
Sandakan was more than a battle between nations. More than a battle between conflicting<br />
ideologies.<br />

<p>3<br />
It was a war between human decency and human depravity.<br />
That is why I think we should remember the men who died there as we remember the<br />
victims of the death camps of Europe as casualties of pure cvil.<br />
There was no glory in this kind of war, and nothing much to comfort those whose loved<br />
ones suffered and died.<br />
With this memorial there will be some consolation in knowing that others know what<br />
happened at Sandakan.<br />
If other Australians can come to know about these things the comfort to those who have<br />
lived with Sandakan for fifty years will be so much greater.<br />
And as a nation, surely, we will be wiser and stronger.<br />
If there was no glory in the way these men died perhaps there can be in their memory.<br />
Perhaps it can inspire in us the feelings for Australia that the men of Sandakan felt.<br />
As Jim said earlier, they were all volunteers.<br />
Men like Keith Botterill who, when recalling his escape from the death march, wrote:<br />
We started at night, the native carried bamboo torches to light the way, until the<br />
moon came up. The next day I was lying down thinking I could not walk another<br />
step, when I looked up and saw an Australian face bending over me. 14e was a big<br />
six footer. He just sat down beside me and cried.<br />
So long as we have some sense of what Keith Bottcrill felt we will have an understanding<br />
of what it means to be Australian.<br />
And so long as we remember the lesson for humanity at Sandakan we will be a better<br />
people and Australia a better place.<br />
I ami very glad and very gratefujl to have had the privilege to speak here today.<br />
Thank you.<br />
