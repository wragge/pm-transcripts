EMBARGO: 9pm<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 9 OCTOBER 1981<br />
ADDRESS TO SYDNEY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE,<br />
MENZIES HOTEL, SYDNEY<br />
Organisations such as the Sydney Chamber of Commerce with<br />
strong traditions of support for the free enterprise system<br />
have a significant role in maintaining the freedom and<br />
prosperity that Australians can so easily take for granted.<br />
I am very pleased to be here tonight and I want to discuss<br />
the Government's economic approach and also take a look at<br />
some wider aspects of the market economy and the free society.<br />
But first, let me emphasise something we must never forget<br />
or take lightly that freedom needs to be defended at home<br />
as well as abroad and that freedom is the only way to secure<br />
prosperity, and the way of life that Australians want.<br />
This is why chann! bers of commerce are so important. Some people<br />
might say that the defence of freedom in commercial life by<br />
chambers of comnerce gives expression to their members'<br />
commercial inter-ests. No doubt it does. But it also plays<br />
an important role in preserving political democracy, for.<br />
I know of no free state which has survived without a significant<br />
measure of freedo.-ti in economic life. There is an important<br />
message here for politicians too, because so many politicians<br />
fall into the trap of th~ inking they know best when in fact the<br />
regulations and restrictions they seek to impose, the boards<br />
and bureaucracy they set up, are often utterly counter-productive.<br />
Excessive regulation has been one of the West's great problems<br />
in recent decades. It shackles trade, and ultimately destroys<br />
freedom and it must never be allowed to regain a grip in<br />
Australia. There have never been many free states in this<br />
world, and there are few enough now. There are fewer still<br />
with the level of economic buoyancy and prospects which<br />
Australia is currently achieving or with the confidence and<br />
dynamism -that are so plain to see in our private sector. So<br />
while we need to be watchful, Australia also has cause to be<br />
proud of its achievements.<br />
Nearly 300,000 new private sector jobs were created in the two<br />
years to June, and the unemployment rate throughout this year, on a<br />
month on month basis, has been the lowest for four years and<br />
this includes the September figure released yesterday. -Let inc<br />
add that there is no doubt whatever that if it was not for the<br />
enormous degree of industrial unrest this year and the absurd<br />
wage claims that are being made, the unemployment position<br />
would be a great deal better than it is. </p>
<p>Australia's inflation rate is continuing below the O. E. C. D.<br />
average and confidence is obvious in the widespread investment:<br />
in the mining and manufacturing industries that is now taking<br />
place. The latest figures show that retail sales were up by 14% in<br />
the year to August and the latest survey indicates that privat~ e<br />
investment in 1981-82 is expected to increase by 32% which will<br />
be a massive increase indeed especially following last year's<br />
comparable increase, which was the highest for 30 years.<br />
The benefits to the whole community from last year's growth are<br />
also worth underlining because the increase in ' average weekly<br />
earnings of more than 4% in real terms during 1980-81 has meant<br />
an aggregate increase in real disposable household income of<br />
$ 2.7 billion after tax.<br />
I want to say two things about this increase. One is that our<br />
policies are aimed precisely at making possible improvements in<br />
the standards of living of Australia's families and while<br />
living standards of some people need direct protection through<br />
the Budget, most Australians should be looking to a healthy.<br />
economy for real improvements.<br />
But at the same time it is crucial that increases in incomes<br />
reflect real i~ provements in productivity; otherwise they will be<br />
short-lived and w-il1I undermine the capacity of the economy to<br />
grow in the future. I don't n~ eed to say to you that economic!<br />
success of the kind Australia has achieved does not come about<br />
by chance, especially in times of sluggish world trade.<br />
Good economic management is a discipline which calls for deliberate<br />
and determined policies. And by the same token, sustainedeconomic<br />
success and prosperity will continue to depend upon<br />
constant attention by the Government to economic management.<br />
Obviously no government policy can be a substitute for the drive<br />
of individual initiative and private enterprise. But a sound<br />
and responsible economic policy, which gives proper weight and<br />
balance to every economic factor, to monetary as well as fiscal<br />
policy, to foreign exchange and the balance of payments, to th e<br />
requirements ofL a strong manufacturing sector as well as the<br />
needs of resource development and thriving primary industries3<br />
a policy which has the full weight and conviction of the government<br />
behind it is indispensible to economic success.<br />
The GovernnL-lent has been in the forefront in attacking the basic<br />
causes of the economic downturn which still plagues so much -of<br />
the industrialised world, and our consistent approach has been<br />
based on the view that sustained prosperity requires lower<br />
inflation, less government spending, less bureaucracy, and a<br />
private sector which can compete efficiently in world markets.<br />
Wie have stuck to the task with urgency and purpose and a landmark in<br />
this year's budget is the virtual elimination of the deficit. The<br />
billion deficit which the Government inherited which would<br />
have been even higher without the expenditure reductions which we<br />
made as soon as we came to office would now be almost $ 7.5 billion<br />
if we had persisted with deficit financing at the previous<br />
government's rate of almost 5 per cent of G. D. P. </p>
<p>The Government has consistently rejected deficit financing<br />
as totally inappropriate for Australia's circumstances through<br />
the 1970' s and into the 1980' s, for these circumstances are<br />
quite different from those which existed in the 1930' s, as<br />
Keynes himself would unquestionably have recognised. Deficit<br />
financing is nothing more than a way of making the future pay<br />
for the spending schemes of the past, either through inflation,<br />
or through higher taxes, or both. Deficit financing encourages<br />
expectations that are unreal and it means dishonesty about the<br />
real level of taxation. With the deficit virtually eliminated<br />
in this year's Budget, we will have greater freedom in future<br />
budgets and obviously an enhanced potential for tax cuts.<br />
The Government has got rid of the massive Labor deficit pa rtly<br />
by an honest approach to taxation and partly by rigorous<br />
restraint on its spending. We have worked at the problem from<br />
both ends.<br />
Our more honest approach to taxation, which has involved lifting<br />
Commonwealth revenue by 2.4 percentage points as a proportion<br />
of Gross Domestic Product, has gone into getting rid of the<br />
deficit. The Government's view has been that our children should<br />
not have to pay the costs of the Government programmes of today.<br />
I reject utterly any claim that this is a high tax approach.<br />
It plainly is not. And if we look at the sales tax increases and<br />
the Government's objectives in connection with them, objectives<br />
of deficit elimination, of reduced pressure on interest rates,<br />
of a better balance in the tax mix, and of enhanced potential<br />
for personal income tax reductions, the Government's overriding<br />
concern with reducing the burden on the community of taxation and<br />
of the high costs of government is again apparent.<br />
But it is expenditure restraint which has been the major ingredient<br />
of this Government's approach to getting rid of the deficit and to<br />
making room for the private sector growth on which the future<br />
prosperity of Australia. so fundamentally depends. In 1975-76,<br />
the CoLmonwealth Government spent over 30 cents of every dollar<br />
that Australia produced. In 1981-82, the Commonwealth Government<br />
will be spending 2 cents less than in 1975-76 of every dollar<br />
produced 4in Australia. This reduction, which would be nearly<br />
3 cents but for the extra payday which comes at twelve year<br />
intervals, means that the Government will be spending<br />
$ 3.7 billion less than if the 1975-76 proportion had, in<br />
fact, continued. If this economy can keep growing<br />
and if alt the same time rea'l growth in budget outlays can<br />
be held down~ the consequences, especially<br />
in terms of an enhanced potential for income tax reductions,<br />
and of further reductions in the cents of each dollar spent<br />
by governments, must be obvious to everyone.<br />
The average real growth in budget outlays between 1975-76 and<br />
1980-81 has in fact been 1.2% and when that is placed against the<br />
demands on the budget of increased defence expenditure, of an<br />
aging population, and of our com-mitment to' increased allocEtions<br />
in priority,, areas of need, our expenditure restraint i impressive<br />
by any standards. </p>
<p>A comparison with the performance of other countries who have!<br />
shared our objective of restraint shows that while Britain<br />
has matched Australia's achievement, the Australian figure<br />
of 1.2% stands in stark contrast to the comparable figures of<br />
nearly 3 per cent for West Germany, about 5 per cent for the<br />
United States of America, and over 10 per cent for Japan.<br />
The Government's steady progress in reducing its expenditure<br />
requirements has resulted from a resolute commitment to the<br />
cause of restraint and more limited government and from<br />
consistency in its basic economic approach.<br />
But while a sound economy requires a consistent policy approach<br />
there is also need for flexibility for flexibility permits<br />
better management of the changes that must inevitably take place<br />
in matters such as interest and exchange rates, in expenditure<br />
priorities, in aspects of taxation and indeed in levels and<br />
forms of protection. We have recognised that change is better<br />
made in small steps as illustrated by our handling of exchange<br />
rates and bett _ er introduced progressively and gradually as<br />
illustrated in our handling of protection.<br />
Australians also need to recognise that we live in an interdependent<br />
world which is a major reason for us to be concerned<br />
about the needs of the developing countries. More than 40% of<br />
the United States trade is with the developing countries, arid<br />
in the case ofE Japan, the figure is more than 50%. Something<br />
like one quarter of the enti're trade of the West is with<br />
developing countries, and this means that hundreds of thousands<br />
of jobs in Western countries would disappear if this trade were<br />
to cease. wnether through instability, or through an inability on<br />
the p~ art of developing countries to continue to import Western<br />
goods. This issue, which was highlighted during the Commonwealth Meeting,<br />
is of vast importCance to Australia. And when we realise that<br />
exports from developed to developing countries increased by over<br />
on average in each of the years between 1973 and 1978, it<br />
is very plain indeed that our continuing trade with these coiintries<br />
must depend on their capacity to build up their economies and<br />
increase their exports and one of the problems is that the<br />
imports of" developed from developing countries have only been<br />
growing by<br />
The worldtmust develop the will to confront problems such as<br />
these head on, just as we in Australia have attempted to tackle<br />
the particular economic problems which we have experienced over<br />
recent years.<br />
But while I have stressed the importance of economic policy-, it<br />
is equally important to realise that economic management is, not<br />
an end in itself. In fact, by providing the preconditions for<br />
so many other individual and community aspirations, economic<br />
success inevitably calls for broader policies covering every<br />
sphere of cqovernmental concern. </p>
<p>And I believe that people have responded with tremendous<br />
enthusiasm to the encouragement and efforts that have been<br />
made to enable all Australians to feel they are a vital part<br />
of a vibrant, diverse and unified society and I think we<br />
are entitled to pride ourselves on the fact that our selfconfidence<br />
as a nation has been so widely noticed by so many<br />
of the distinguished overseas leaders who attended the<br />
Commonwealth meeting.<br />
Pierre Trudeau in fact went so far as to say that some words<br />
of his predecessors, namely that the twentieth century belongs<br />
to Canada, have been translated into " Australian", because,<br />
as Trudeau himself Put it, these words have a real meaning<br />
here in Australia " because this country, with its tremendous<br />
economic potential, with its exciting technological and natural<br />
resources, with its intense and vibrant culture, seems to be<br />
very much part of the definition and formulation of the<br />
twentieth century as it's meant to be".<br />
I have picked out Trudeau's particular words, but lots of other<br />
leaders and journalists said very similar things.<br />
Let me just say that whatever the twentieth century may be for<br />
the rest of th.-e world, this kind of vision of an intense and<br />
vibrant culture, flourishing in a free and prospering society,<br />
is certainly my vision of Australia through the twentieth an~ d<br />
into t'he tL-wenty-, first century. We must look far ahead, because we<br />
have so much going for us in this country, because we have so<br />
much to offer other countries by way of inspiration and examrple<br />
as well as in other ways, and because we owe it to our children<br />
to keen buildina the kind of Australia in which there will be.<br />
opportunities and freedom in a secure and stable environment..<br />
