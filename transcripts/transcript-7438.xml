PARLIAMENTARY STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ON THE JOINT DEFENCE FACILITIES<br />
22 NOVEMBER 1988<br />
I wish-to inform the. House that the Australian and US<br />
Governments have agreed to a number of important changes to<br />
the arrangements under which we cooperate in running our<br />
joint defence facilities at Pine Gap and Nurrungar.<br />
The changes we are making reflect the commitment of both<br />
Governments to maintaining and strengthening our<br />
long-standing partnership in these joint facilities. They<br />
ensure that the facilities continue to operate in ways that<br />
best serve the interests of ourselves and our partners.<br />
These changes also reflect the commitment of this Government<br />
to informing the public as fully as possible about the<br />
facilities. on 6 June 1984 in this place I made the first<br />
detailed public statement about the roles of the facilities.<br />
In making that statement I was convinced that better public<br />
understanding of the roles of the joint facilities could<br />
only increase public support for them. my remarks today,<br />
which will in some respects go beyond that earlier<br />
statement, are made with the same conviction.<br />
Since the joint facilities were established in the 1960s,<br />
the alliance between Australia and the US has evolved and<br />
matured, the technologies involved at Pine Gap and Nurrungar<br />
have developed, and Australians have learned more of the<br />
skills involved in running the facilities.<br />
The new arrangements at Pine Gap and Nurrungar accommodate<br />
these important changes.<br />
At Pine Gap, the number of Australians engaged in the<br />
central-operational . activity is being steadily increased.<br />
Some of these personnel, who are drawn from scientific and<br />
intelligence areas of the Department of Defence, are taking<br />
over functions previously carrie~ d out by US employees.<br />
Whereas only a handful of Australian Government personnel<br />
was directly involved in the central work of the facility in<br />
the 1970s and early 1980s contributing less than<br />
per cent of the staff there the proportion is scheduled<br />
to rise to about 30% over the next two or three years.<br />
But Australians are not only doing more of the operational<br />
work at the facilities. Under the new arrangements we have<br />
agreed, Australians will carry out more of the senior<br />
management functions at both Pine Gap and Nurrungar.<br />
3678 </p>
<p>At Fine Gap, a senior Australian Defence official will be<br />
appointed to a newly created position as Deputy Chief of the<br />
Facility. He will advise and support the US Chief of<br />
Facility in managing the facility and its activities, and he<br />
will share responsibility with him for that work. He will<br />
also continue to be the officer in charge of the prohibited<br />
area, with ultimate responsibility for the physical security<br />
of the facility. Other senior management positions will<br />
also be filled by Australians.<br />
Parallel changes have been agreed to the staffing at<br />
Nurrungar. Australians constitute some 40 per cent of the<br />
staff in the key operational areas, and will now take a role<br />
in management with the appointment of the senior Australian<br />
officer there as Deputy Commander. Like his counterpart at<br />
Pine Gap, he will share re5ponsibility with the Commander<br />
for the management of the station and its physical security.<br />
The integration of Australian personnel in both the<br />
operation and the management of the joint facilities at Pine<br />
Gap and Nurrungar is such that the Australian Government can<br />
be assured of having full knowledge of all, aspects of the<br />
operations at the facilities, and reinforces our confidence<br />
that our interests and sovereignty are respected at all<br />
times. At the same time, Australia will be able to take more direct<br />
advantage of the facilities, capabilities for our own<br />
purposes than has been practicable in the*. past.<br />
Hitherto, by agreement between ourselves and our partners,<br />
we have spoken in public of the capabilities of the two<br />
facilities only in conjunction. Under the new arrangements,<br />
and in pursuit of better understanding and stronger support<br />
for the facilities we have now agreed to specify the<br />
separate roles of Pine Gap and Nurrungar.<br />
Nurrungar is a ground station used for . controlling<br />
satellites in the US Defence Support Program ( DSP). The<br />
satellites provide ballistic missile early warning and other<br />
information related to missile launches, surveillance and<br />
the detonation of nuclear weapons.<br />
Few if any elements of the strategic systems of eithe-r<br />
superpower make such a decisive and-unambiguous contribution<br />
to keeping the peace as the Defense SupotPgrm Asa<br />
essential link in the DSP, Nurrungar plays a quite<br />
fundamental role in preventing nuclear war.<br />
The DSP, through Nurrungar, would give the earliest warning<br />
of an ICBM attack on the US or its allies.<br />
Because the DSP gives longer warning of an attack than other<br />
systems, it reduces the chances that US forces could be<br />
destroyed in a surprise attack, and that makes it extremely<br />
unlikely that anyone would ever try such an attack. </p>
<p>3.<br />
Together with other elements of the US early warning system,<br />
the oSP provides highly reliable warning of attack. It thus<br />
plays a vital role in helping to prevent nuclear war by<br />
accident. Australians can be glad that we help to operate this vital<br />
facility, and that every day, around the clock, Australian<br />
personnel are playing this part in helping to prevent<br />
nuclear war.<br />
I turn now to Pine Gap. Pine Gap is a satellite ground<br />
station, whose function is to'collect intelligence data<br />
which supports the national security of both Australia and<br />
the US.<br />
Intelligence collected at Pine Gap contributes importantly<br />
to the verification of arms control and disarmament r<br />
agreements. The value of that data has become more and more<br />
evident over the last year or two, as disarmament has moved<br />
from being an aspiration to become an emerging reality.<br />
Today, for the first time since the invention of the atom T<br />
bomb, nuclear weapons systems are, under the INF Treaty, a<br />
being destroyed by their owners. The next step is already e<br />
underway, in the START talks the superpowers are seriou sly 0<br />
negotiating to make major cuts in their strategic arsenals. f<br />
Verification is vital to this arms control process.<br />
Verification was the key issue in reaching that IN14k?<br />
agreement last year, and verification will be the key to anys<br />
START agreement in the future, if the START process were to e<br />
fail, despite the efforts of both sides, it would be largely<br />
because of the difficulties with verification. e a<br />
in April this year, nuclear risk reduction centres were<br />
created in Washington and M~ oscow. This new confidence T<br />
building channel is being used to notify the two sides of j<br />
missile launches required by arms control accords and will n<br />
alGo serve to reduce the possibility of nuclear conflict. d<br />
WV<br />
Without Australia's involvement in arms control c<br />
verification, the risk of nuclear war would have been T<br />
directly and significantly incQased. 0<br />
I th ink it is important for those who have urged us over the<br />
years to close Pine Gap and Nurrungar to reflect on the<br />
undoubted fact that, had we done as they urged, the INF<br />
Treaty could not have been signed and the START process<br />
would not have got underway.<br />
with the information now on the public record about the<br />
roles played by these facilities in preventing nuclear war,<br />
I think it is clear that nobody seriously committed to peace<br />
could argue for their closure.<br />
3680 </p>

There are of course limitations on what it would be sensible<br />
for me to reveal publicly about details of the operations<br />
that are conducted at either of these joint defence<br />
facilities, or details of the organisation and manning<br />
arrangements which apply there. It has been the practice of<br />
successive Australian Governments not to comment on<br />
intelligence matters, and this Government will conti ' nue that<br />
policy. Details of our capabilities in the sensitive'a-nd<br />
important area of intelligence collection, or in relation to<br />
systems providing attack warning, are not in our national<br />
interests to divulge and this Government will not do so.<br />
The Government takes the view that the irreplaceable<br />
contribution made by these facilities gives us a special<br />
responsibility to ensure that they can continue to function<br />
in an atmosphere of stability and commitment.<br />
At present both facilities, operate under agreements-which<br />
are terminable at one year's notice by either side, we do<br />
not regard this as satisfactory, both because of the<br />
re continuing importance of their effective operation to global<br />
re peace, and because of the specific benefits to Australia of<br />
d long-term access to their capabilities.<br />
To this end the US and Australia have, as part of the new<br />
arrangements for the operation of the facilities, agreed to<br />
extend the arrangements under which the two facilities<br />
Ly operate for a further ten years in each case. We have<br />
ly further agreed that three years' notice shall be required to<br />
S. terminate the agreement.<br />
Last week the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade,<br />
Senator Evans, and the US Ambassador Mr Bill Lane, signed<br />
any exchanges of notes to formalise this agreement. For the<br />
to information of Honourable Members I now table those<br />
3ely exchanges of notes. Members will note that this exchange<br />
also defines clearly the functions of the two facilities.<br />
These agreements confirm my Government's conviction -that the<br />
f joint defence facilities will continue to serve Australia's<br />
11 national interests; that they will continue to reflect the<br />
depth and substance of our bilateral strategic relationship<br />
with the United States under ANZUS; and that they will<br />
continue to play a vital role in preventing nuclear war.<br />
The Government intends that Honourable members will have an<br />
opportunity to debate this statement.<br />
