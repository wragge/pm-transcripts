I am pleased to announce that the postponed Royal Visit by Her Majesty The Queen and His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh has been rescheduled for February 2002 to coincide with the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Queensland.<br />
The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh will arrive in Adelaide on Wednesday, 27 February and depart from Brisbane on Sunday, 3 March 2002.<br />
Because of commitments relating to The Queen';s Golden Jubilee celebrations in the UK, the Royal couple will undertake a shortened programme in Australia as part of a wider overseas visit to Jamaica and New Zealand.<br />
As proposed previously, in South Australia The Queen will visit the Barossa Valley and open an aged care facility at Tanunda.  The Duke of Edinburgh will inspect seafood industry operations at Ceduna and visit Port Lincoln.<br />
The Royal couple will then proceed to Queensland.  The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh will visit Brisbane and Cairns and The Duke of Edinburgh will visit Roma to open the Big Rig Oil and Gas Museum which marks the birthplace of Australia';s oil and gas industry.<br />
On Saturday, 2 March 2002 The Queen will open the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Coolum.<br />
Although in a shortened form, the programme has been organised so that The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh can meet many Australians in both formal and informal settings, and in regional areas as well as cities.<br />
I know that The Queen and The Duke will be welcomed on their rescheduled visit with the warmth for which Australians are renowned.<br />
Further details of the programme will be released separately by the governments of Queensland and South Australia as they have overall responsibility for the activities occurring within their states.</p>
