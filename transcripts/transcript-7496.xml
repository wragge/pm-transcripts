CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ACT ALP FUNDRAISING DINNER<br />
CANBERRA 17 FEBRUARY 1989<br />
Ros Kelly,<br />
Rosemary Follett,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
During the few weeks of this election campaign, we are<br />
participating in an historic event in the political histor~ y<br />
of Australia.<br />
With the elections for the first ACT Legislative Assembly,<br />
we will see the final act in the great drama of Australian<br />
democracy which began with the evolution of the colonies in<br />
the last century.<br />
Canberra will have joined the ranks of the other States and<br />
Territories as truly self-governing entities of the<br />
Commonwealth of Australia.<br />
It will have come of age.<br />
And the residents of Canberra will have joined their fellow<br />
Australians in the States, the Northern Territory and<br />
Norfolk Island as citizens effectively exercising control<br />
over their own political future people with the power and<br />
the institutions to carry on their own shoulders the<br />
responsibility of government.<br />
Nowhere else in Australia indeed, it would be hard to find<br />
anywhere else in the democratic world is there a place<br />
like Canberra, large in population and sophisticated in<br />
social and economic development but denied the basic<br />
political right of self-government.<br />
Now, with these elections, that anomaly is put right.<br />
one could hardly say that this move is premature.<br />
Canberra last year celebrated its 75th birthday.<br />
All the states of Australia achieved responsible government<br />
as colonies in the last century in less than 75 years in<br />
the cases of Victoria and South Australia, in less than one<br />
third that time. </p>
<p>And some of the then colonies achieved responsible<br />
government with populations considerably smaller than<br />
Canberra's current population.<br />
So when the Federal Government decided that the Australian<br />
Capital Territory should achieve self-government, we did so<br />
with a belief that it was now time for Canberra to take its<br />
rightful place in the affairs of the nation.<br />
The Commonwealth has given the ACT a binding commitment to<br />
maintain its budget at the same real level for three years.<br />
Beyond that there will be another two years during which<br />
transitional arrangements will apply while the ACT moves in<br />
line with the normal financial relationship that exists<br />
between the Commonwealth and the States and local<br />
government.<br />
0 At that point in 1993 the ACT will be standing on its<br />
own financial feet.<br />
We are handing on to the new ACT Administration a budget in<br />
very sound shape for the future. With our three-year<br />
guarantee a responsible Administration will have no<br />
difficulty in bringing down a budget at least in balance.<br />
From all this, two obvious but nevertheless overwhelmingly<br />
important implications can be drawn.<br />
First, the decision that Canberra should take charge of its<br />
own affairs is irreversible.<br />
We will not we must not pretend that Canberra can crawl<br />
back into the womb; that it can somehow turn back the clock<br />
by shirking the responsibilities of self-government.<br />
That would make a mockery of Canberra's stature in the<br />
Onation. And turning our back on self-government in the late<br />
twentieth century would in a real sense make a mockery of<br />
Australia's two hundred year history of steady progress<br />
towards independence, self-reliance and democracy.<br />
So whatever the nay-sayers may pretend, whatever those<br />
unrepresentative candidates opposing self-government may<br />
wish, there will be no turning back.<br />
It is high time Canberra stood as a full member of the<br />
Commonwealth. The second important implication of what I have said so far<br />
is this: when Canberra does assume self-government, it will<br />
need a government capable of governing.<br />
Canberra will need an administration capable of the heavy<br />
task of leadership. </p>
<p>It will require a Legislative Assembly and a leadership team<br />
capable of resolving fairly the issues posed by Canberra's<br />
dual role as National Capital and as home for more than a<br />
quarter of a million Australian people.<br />
It will need an experienced, competent, reliable Chief<br />
Minister who will be capable of administering a $ 1.5 billion<br />
budget, and capable too of mixing it with the other State<br />
and Territory leaders at Premiers' Conferences and so<br />
ensuring that Canberra's claims to Federal funding are<br />
presented fully and forcefully.<br />
I have presided over enough Premiers' Conferences to assure<br />
you with complete confidence that neither Paul Keating nor<br />
myself take kindly to States' or Territories' claims that<br />
are presented with less than complete honesty, diligence or<br />
accuracy. So given all this, I can state categorically tonight that<br />
the only group of candidates in the forthcoming elections<br />
capable of meeting these challenges, equipped to take<br />
Canberra into the exciting opportunities of self-government,<br />
is the team of candidates under the banner of the Australian<br />
Labor Party.<br />
The Australian Labor Party team led by Rosemary Follett,<br />
offers the best blend of experience, commonsense and<br />
awareness of community concerns.<br />
They are committed to defending the real interests of<br />
Canberra, as it is now and as it will grow and develop in<br />
the future.<br />
The ALP has prepared the only comprehensive platform of<br />
policies for Government.<br />
It is more complete of course than the rag-tag collection of<br />
ideas and prejudices assembled by the short-sighted<br />
single-issue candidates and groups.<br />
And it is more complete too than the inadequate patchwork of<br />
self-interested policies presented by our major conservative<br />
opponents. Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
It is with pride and certainty that I make this appeal for<br />
the local ALP candidates.<br />
I do this not just on partisan grounds as a Labor leader.<br />
I do it too on national grounds as Prime Minister who must<br />
be concerned about the welfare of all Australians.<br />
I do it because I have seen at the Federal level and at the<br />
State level the affairs of Government being either managed<br />
with confidence and competence by Labor Parties, or<br />
mismanaged by our divided and ineffective conservative<br />
opponents. </p>
<p>Let me describe the decision facing Canberra in this way.<br />
During the last Federal election campaign in 1987, I asked<br />
the people of Australia two questions central to the future<br />
of Australia.<br />
I asked them:<br />
who could provide Australia with the responsible<br />
economic management it needed; and<br />
who could provide Australia with the united and credible<br />
leadership it deserved.<br />
Today, I repeat those questions to the people of Canberra.<br />
Which party can provide Canberra with the responsible<br />
economic leadership it needs as it enters the mainstream of<br />
Federal-State relations?<br />
And which party can provide Canberra with the united and<br />
credible leadership it deserves as it starts out on the<br />
challenges of self-government?<br />
The answer can only be: the Australian Labor Party.<br />
That was the verdict of the Australian people in 1987; it<br />
was the verdict of the Victorian people in 1988, and it was<br />
the verdict of the West Australians in 1989.<br />
It must be the verdict in Canberra on 4 March.<br />
Because as Canberra enters the 1990s, it is central to its<br />
future well-being that it be able to work closely and<br />
constructively with the Federal Labor Government.<br />
And as Canberra continues to grow in complexity as a city<br />
providing an unparalleled quality of life to its residents,<br />
it is vital that its Government be guided by the commitment<br />
to social justice that is the distinguishing hallmark of the<br />
Australian Labor Party.<br />
As a Territory directly administered by the Federal<br />
Government, Canberra has directly shared in the fruits of<br />
Federal Labor's commitment to social justice.<br />
Let me briefly enumerate those Federal achievements.<br />
Australia under Labor has seen the creation of more than one<br />
and a quarter million new jobs about as many new people in<br />
work as would live in five Canberras.<br />
That is a rate of jobs growth twice as fast as the average<br />
in the Western world.<br />
At the same time, the unemployment rate has fallen from<br />
per cent when we came to office to 7 per cent now. </p>
<p>Three times the number of child care places are being<br />
created under Labor than were in existence in 1983.<br />
Well over half of all children are staying on to complete<br />
secondary school, compared to the 36 per cent who were doing<br />
so when we came to office.<br />
Forty thousand more university places are being made<br />
available. Unprecedented assistance is being given to families in need<br />
through the Family Allowance Supplement.<br />
The extent of superannuation cover is being doubled to<br />
encompass 80 per cent of the Australian workforce.<br />
Aged pensions have been increased by 7.7 per cent in real<br />
terms compared to the 2.5 per cent drop under the previous<br />
Federal Government.<br />
Historic tax reforms have been achieved, making a system of<br />
revenue raising that is fairer and more efficient than ever<br />
before.<br />
And on July i, further tax cuts will be made, targeted<br />
primarily at lower and middle income earners.<br />
In all these ways, we have great and undeniable cause to be<br />
proud of our achievements in ensuring that the national<br />
economy is sounder, and that those who are the least<br />
well-off members of our community are adequately protected.<br />
That is a record which, in its new capacity as a<br />
self-governing territory, Canberra will have the capacity to<br />
support and enhance or under a conservative government<br />
to diminish and erode.<br />
Canberra simply cannot afford to jeopardise its future by<br />
experimenting with conservative priorities or by<br />
pretending, as the minor parties do that, the choice can<br />
somehow be shirked.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Canberra is irreversibly a part of Australia.<br />
It cannot stand alone, outside the mainstream.<br />
It must now start to bear its due share of the challenges of<br />
national life.<br />
And it must also be allowed to reap the fruits, as a fully<br />
self-governing member of the Australian Commonwealth, of<br />
what will be the brighter economic future to which we are<br />
working. </p>
