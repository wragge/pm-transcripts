FILM AND TELEVISION SCHOOL BILL 1973<br />
SECOND READING SPEECH , s 7<br />
BY<br />
THE HONOURABLE EG, WHITLAM, M, P,,<br />
PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO ESTABLISH THE FILM<br />
AND TELEVISION SCHOOL AS A STATUTORY BODY WITH THE STATUS<br />
OF A COLLEGE OF ADVANCED EDUCATION, IT MARKS THE CULMINATION<br />
OF THREE YEARS' EXTENSIVE PLANNING FOR A SCHOOL WHICH HAS<br />
FOUND GENERAL SUPPORT IN THE PARLIAMENT AND FROM ALL SECTORS<br />
OF FILM AND TELEVISION IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
HONOURABLE MEMBERS WILL RECALL THAT AN INTERIM<br />
COUNCIL FOR A NATIONAL FILM AND TELEVISION SCHOOL WAS<br />
APPOINTED AT THE END OF 1969 TO ADVISE THE GOVERNMENT ON THE<br />
STEPS NECESSARY TO BRING THE SCHOOL INTO OPERATION, IT<br />
CARRIED OUT WIDE-RANGING INVESTIGATIONS AND PRODUCED THREE<br />
REPORTS WHICH DOCUMENTED FIRM SUPPORT FOR THE SCHdOL FROM<br />
COMMERCIAL FILM PRODUCERS, THE FEDERATION OF COMMERCIAL<br />
TELEVISION STATIONS, THE AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING COMMISSION,<br />
THE COMMONWEALTH FILM UNIT, GUILDS AND UNIONS, AND EDUCATIONAL<br />
INSTITUTIONS, THE SCHOOL WAS OFFICIALLY INITIATED IN APRIL 1972.<br />
NEGOTIATIONS HAVE TAKEN PLACE WITH THE COUNCIL OF<br />
MACQUARIE UNIVERSITY FOR THE SCHOOL TO HAVE A SITE OF FIVE<br />
ACRES ON THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS, BUT THERE WILL BE NO FORMAL<br />
LINKS WITH THAT INSTITUTION, PROFESSOR JERZY TOE PLITZ,<br />
CURRENTLY VISITING PROFESSOR OF FILM AT LA TROBE UNIVERSITY </p>
<p>-2-<br />
AND FORMER RECTOR OF THE RENOWNED POLISH FILM SCHOOL, HAS<br />
BEEN APPOINTED FOUNDATION DIRECTOR OF THE SCHOOL, HE WILL<br />
TAKE UP FULL-TIME DUTY AT THE SCHOOL IN AUGUST THIS YEAR.<br />
THE INTENTION IS THAT THE SCHOOL WILL PROVIDE, AT<br />
THE HIGHEST LEVELS, A WIDE RANGE OF TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE<br />
FOR PROSPECTIVE CREATIVE WORKERS IN FILM AND TELEVISION, IT<br />
WILL CONDUCT FULL-TIME COURSES IN FILM AND TELEVISION<br />
PRODUCTION, AND IT IS HOPED THAT IT WILL BECOME A CENTRE FOR<br />
OPEN SCHOOL ACTIVITIES, WHICH WILL INCLUDE REFRESHER COURSES,<br />
SEMINARS AND WORKSHOPS FOR PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE FILM AND<br />
TELEVISION INDUSTRY, IN EDUCATION, AND FOR ALL FILM-MAKERS<br />
AND VIDEO SPECIALISTS IN THE DEVELOPING AREAS OF AUDIO-VISUAL<br />
COMMUNICATIONS, THE SCHOOL WILL AIM TO MEET THE GROWING AND CHANGING<br />
NEEDS OF FILM AND TELEVISION IN AUSTRALIA AND ALSO TO HELP<br />
OUR NEIGHBOURS, FOR AS THE SCHOOL BECOMES ESTABLISHED WE MAY<br />
EXPECT IT TO OFFER TRAINING FOR OVERSEAS STUDENTS PARTICULARLY<br />
FROM NEW ZEALAND AND THE PACIFIC AREA.<br />
GRADUATES OF THE SCHOOL MAY EXPECT TO FIND EMPLOYMENT<br />
IN PRIVATE FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION, IN GOVERNMENT<br />
PRODUCTION AGENCIES AND IN OTHER AREAS CONNECTED WITH THE<br />
COMMUNICATIONS MEDIA, I MENTION ONLY UNIVERSITIES, COLLEGES<br />
OF ADVANCED EDUCATION, TEACHERS AND TECHNICAL COLLEGES AS<br />
INSTITUTIONS WHICH ARE INCREASINGLY SEEKING PEOPLE QUALIFIED<br />
IN AREAS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION AND EDUCATION, </p>
<p>-3-<br />
To ENSURE THAT THE SCHOOL GETS THE BEST INSTRUCTORS<br />
THE PROFESSIONALS WHOSE LIVELIHOOD IS IN FILM OR TELEVISION<br />
MANY OF THE SENIOR INSTRUCTING STAFF WILL BE EMPLOYED UNDER<br />
SHORT-TERM CONTRACTS SO THAT THEIR SERVICES MAY BE GAINED BETWEEN<br />
OTHER PROFESSIONAL ENGAGEMENTS.<br />
INITIALLY, THE SCHOOL WILL OFFER COURSES IN THE KEY<br />
AREAS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION FOR DIRECTORS, PRODUCERS,<br />
WRITERS, EDITORS, AND CAMERAMEN. AS IT DEVELOPS, COURS S<br />
MAY BE OFFERED FOR UNIT MANAGERS, DESIGNERS, MEDIA<br />
ECONOMISTS, WRITERS ON GENERAL FILM SUBJECTS, AND COMMUNICATION<br />
THEORISTS AND TECHNOLOGISTS. THE SCHOOL SHOULD EVENTUALLY<br />
DEVELOP FACILITIES FOR POST-GRADUATE STUDY AND OTHER ADVANCED<br />
RESEARCH. TRAINING WILL EMPHASIZE DIRECT PRODUCTION<br />
EXPERIENCE WITH ALL THE PROBLEMS AND DEMANDS THAT ACCOMPANY<br />
PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTIONS.<br />
CENTRAL TO THE SCHOOL WILL BE MODEL FILM AND TELEVISION<br />
STUDIOS, AND THERE WILL BE FULL OPPORTUNITY FOR ON-THE-JOB<br />
TRAINING IN PROFESSIONAL SITUATIONS. MANY SECTORS OF THE<br />
FILM AND TELEVISION INDUSTRY, BOTH GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE, HAVE<br />
INDICATED ALREADY THAT THEY WILL MAKE AVAILABLE FACILITIES FOR<br />
SUCH TRAINING, SUBJECT TO EQUITABLE ARRANGEMENTS BEING WORKED<br />
OUT WITH MANAGEMENTS AND UNIONS.<br />
CLOSE COLLABORATION WILL BE SOUGHT WITH THE INDUSTRY,<br />
AND THE LOCATION OF THE SCHOOL ON SYDNEY'S NORTH SIDE RELATES<br />
TO THE PRESENCE THERE OF A VERY LARGE CONCENTRATION OF PRODUCTION<br />
HOUSES, TELEVISION STATIONS AND LABORATORIES WITH WHICH<br />
THE SCHOOL EXPECTS TO BE IN CONSTANT TOUCH. </p>
<p>THE SCHOOL WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH EDUCATIONAL<br />
AUTHORITIES, THE FILM AND TELEVISION BOARD OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
COUNCIL FOR THE ARTS, THE DEPARTMENT OF THE MEDIA AND<br />
RELATED AGENCIES, AND WITH THE MANY BODIES REPRESENTING<br />
PROFESSIONAL AND COMMUNITY INTERESTS IN FILM AND TELEVISION,<br />
IT WILL ALSO SEEK CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH THE OTHER<br />
ARTS, AND BODIES SUCH AS THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DRAMATIC ART,<br />
AND SCHOOLS OF MUSIC, ART AND DESIGN, I BELIEVE THAT,<br />
IN THIS WAY, THE SCHOOL WILL NOT ONLY TURN OUT COMPETENT<br />
GRADUATES IN THE TECHNIQUES OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION,<br />
BUT ARTISTIC AND IMAGINATIVE PEOPLE WITH A VIGOROUS<br />
APPRECIATION OF THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES,<br />
THE SCHOOL WILL CO-ORDINATE THE GRANTING OF FINANCIAL<br />
ASSISTANCE TO ORGANISATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS CONCERNED WITH<br />
FILM AND TELEVISION TRAINING AND EDUCATION IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
PARTICULAR ENCOURAGEMENT MAY BE GIVEN TO ORGANISATIONS AND<br />
INSTITUTIONS WISHING TO TRY OUT PILOT TRAINING SCHEMES,<br />
WORKSHOPS, AND ACTIVITIES LIKELY TO LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT<br />
OF OTHER SPECIALIST FACILITIES AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR<br />
COMMUNITY GROUPS TO GAIN EXPERIENCE IN USING THE MEDIA,<br />
AS WELL, THE SCHOOL WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE GRANTS-IN-AID TO<br />
PEOPLE WHO MAY BENEFIT THROUGH OVERSEAS EXPERIENCE, STUDY,<br />
OR TRAINING WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THIS COUNTRY,<br />
IT WILL PROVIDE A RESOURCE CENTRE FOR DEVELOPING NEW<br />
IDEAS, TECHNIQUES AND METHODS AND WILL BE READY TO MAKE ITS<br />
STUDIOS AVAILABLE TO PRODUCERS FOR TRAINING, RESEARCH AND </p>
<p>I SPECIAL PRODUCTIONS. IT WILL ALSO COLLABORATE IN COLLATING,<br />
DISSEMINATING AND PUBLISHING DATA LIKELY TO ASSIST THE<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF FILM AND TELEVISION IN AUSTRALIA.<br />
I HOPE TO ANNOUNCE SHORTLY THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO<br />
WILL FORM THE FIRST PERMANENT COUNCIL OF THE FILM AND<br />
TELEVISION SCHOOL. THE-MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL WILL BE<br />
DRAWN FROM ACROSS THE WHOLE SPECTRUM OF FILM AND TELEVISION.<br />
THE BILL PROVIDES THAT WHEN THE SCHOOL IS FULLY OPERATIONAL THE<br />
COUNCIL WILL CONSIST OF FIVE MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE<br />
GOVERNOR-GENERAL, THE DIRECTOR OF THE SCHOOL, TWO MEMBERS<br />
ELECTED BY THE STAFF FROM AMONG THEIR NUMBER, TWO STUDENTS<br />
ELECTED BY THE STUDENT BODY, AND FIVE MEMBERS ELECTED BY<br />
CONVOCATION OF THE SCHOOL, THE CONVOCATION WILL CONSIST OF<br />
GRADUATES OF THE SCHOOL, ALL MEMBERS AND PAST MEMBERS OF THE<br />
STAFF OF THE SCHOOL, ALL PERSONS WHO WERE MEMBERS OF THE<br />
INTERIM COUNCIL, ALL MEMBERS AND PAST MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL,<br />
AND REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL SECTORS OF AUSTRALIAN FILM AND<br />
TELEVISION. I BELIEVE THAT THE SCHOOL WILL PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT<br />
STIMULUS TO FILM AND TELEVISION IN AUSTRALIA AND I COMMEND<br />
THE BILL TO THE HOUSE. </p>
