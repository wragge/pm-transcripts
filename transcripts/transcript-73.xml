FOR PRESS: MR. B, A. SANTAMARIA'S COMMENT<br />
Statement by the Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Trade,<br />
Mr McEweno<br />
Wben asked today to react to a comment by Mr. B. A.<br />
Santamaria, Secretary of the National Catholic Rural Movement, upon<br />
a report of an answer by him on a Melbourne television show on<br />
Sunday night, the Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Trade,<br />
Mr. McEwen, said:-<br />
" I made two points. First that considerations of trade<br />
writh mainland China would definitely not influence the Government's<br />
policy regarding political recognition of the Communist Chinese<br />
Government. I then added that if the present Government of mainland<br />
China remained the Government and it certainly appeared that that<br />
was likely then in due course, at some point of time, the fact would<br />
be recognised by all countries as it has already been recognised by<br />
the United Kingdom and most great powers.<br />
' In reply to a further question, I added that the recent<br />
visit to Australia of officials of the Government Trading Agency of<br />
mainland China had no significance whatever to the question of<br />
politic. reconitjon by Australia. I pointed out that in any<br />
Communist country all trading was necessarily conducted by officials<br />
of govcrnr':. nt agencies,<br />
" Tho recent Chinese buying and selling mission was not the<br />
Wresult of any invitation or suggestion by the Australian Government.<br />
" Mr, San'.-mlaria is quite wrong in suggesting that there has<br />
been any shift of policy by the Australian Government. Considerations<br />
Sof high policy will continue to decide our attitude to political<br />
recognition of inainr. and China."<br />
-Ir Mcvren added that he had forwarded to Mr. Santamaria<br />
a transcription of the actual television interview which is recorded<br />
as a normal practice by the television station and which made the<br />
above quite clear.<br />
