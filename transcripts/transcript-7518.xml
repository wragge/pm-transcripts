TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE WITH TREASURER KEATING,<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 3 MARCH 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: Paul and I decided that we would like to do this<br />
together because as you know it was our joint idea after the<br />
price index figures came out that we should have this<br />
conference and I thought it appropriate that Paul should<br />
join me as we both report on the conference and give you the<br />
opportunity of asking questions that you might direct to us.<br />
Now the first thing I obviously was to say is that it was a<br />
good meeting. A very positive, constructive meeting, the<br />
atmosphere within the meeting was totally constructive,<br />
totally constructive and I think that it's borne out by the<br />
last paragraph of the agreed press release. I just point<br />
out that we all agreed on the obvious, that is that there's<br />
no quick fix to the problems confronting the housing<br />
industry at present. However the constructive and<br />
cooperative approach participants at today's conference<br />
which all have agreed to continue into the future.-We've<br />
laid the ground work for substantial relief to the supply<br />
side constraints effecting the industry and as I said in the<br />
press conference this morning in the lead up to a conference<br />
like this it's inevitable you're going to have some things<br />
said. I express the hope you'll recall this morning prior<br />
to the conference that there would be such a constructive<br />
approach and in the event that's exactly what happened and I<br />
want to pay tribute an unqualified tribute to all the<br />
Premiers and the Chief Minister for the spirit in which they<br />
approached the conference. Without that we wouldn't have<br />
been able to get the positive outcomes that we did.<br />
Let me just briefly without reading it summerise the press<br />
release which has been agreed to by us all. The point is<br />
that we've agreed to cooperate in addressing the problems<br />
confronting the housing industry, particularly on the supply<br />
of suitable land. I've told you of the Commonwealth's<br />
decision to release something like 27,000 blocks over the<br />
next five years, a further 31,000 approximately in the<br />
following five to ten years.<br />
Premiers and the Chief Minister responded favourably to<br />
this. They raised questions as obviously one would expect<br />
about blocks and they thought that other areas may be<br />
more suitable and we've agreed to have discussions with them<br />
about both the areas that we have decided are available and<br />
to discuss with them what they think they might be able to </p>
<p>( PM cont) identify as other or alternative more suitable<br />
blocks. So we'll have now a series of bilateral discussions<br />
with the states on these issues. understandably they also<br />
raised the questions of the need to provide infrastructure<br />
for these further blocks and we agreed that the Premiers<br />
would put forward specific proposals in regard to this and<br />
that we would give serious consideration to them in the<br />
Premiers Conference and the Loan Council meetings later this<br />
year. Specifically also in regard to the proposal from the Premier<br />
of NSW who put up the concept of a joint venture proposal<br />
between the State and the Commonwealth we said we were<br />
prepared to examine that, to get some prima facie interest<br />
for us and under those arrangements as you appreciate the<br />
Commonwealth would receive no proceeds from the land until<br />
the final sales were made and that arrangement will<br />
facilitate the capacity of the states to more rapidly<br />
develop those proposals. Questions were raised in the area<br />
of Defence housing and we've agreed to get quickly into<br />
bilaterals with the states who wish to try and expedite the<br />
handling of that area.<br />
One of the issues that was raised also was the question in<br />
a sense as they see it the maldistribution of migration<br />
intake, a lot of pressures in Sydney in particular. We<br />
reminded the states and they were appreciative of the fact<br />
that under the new immigration program there is a system<br />
of bonus points to those who come from sponsors in nominated<br />
states. In other words if you're coming from Tasmania, the<br />
sponsors who are coming from Tasmania, or South Australia,<br />
parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory, there will<br />
be bonus points in that. An attempt to try and diversify a<br />
bit more than the current situation does the flow of<br />
migrants around the states.<br />
I think that Paul may want to refer in more detail to some<br />
of the discussions with the NSW people about the point they<br />
raised in regard to rental property trusts. As I told you<br />
this morning before the conference we've developed a package<br />
of measures which were directed not only at land supply but<br />
the questions of building regulation, land regulation and<br />
local government approval processes. Now they are rather<br />
complex issues and Senator Button will be releasing a more<br />
detailed paper on it.<br />
Could I just quickly indicate broadly what those specific<br />
measures would involve. It includes a three year program of<br />
work to address inadequacies in the availability of data on<br />
land supply and the composition of demand. That work will<br />
be done through the Indicitive Planning Council and with the<br />
full support of the states.<br />
Secondly, the States and the Northern Territory have agreed<br />
to participate in a joint program under which the financial<br />
and technical assistance would be provided over the next<br />
three years to local government to review the technical<br />
content of residential land development regulations. </p>
<p>( PM cont) Thirdly, we've announced a program to promote<br />
demonstration studies, cooperation research and information<br />
dissemination designed to stimulate improvement in the<br />
administrative aspects of approval processes at the local<br />
government level. We've also endorsed unanimously the<br />
setting up of an expert task force drawn from the<br />
Commonwealth State and Local government to design<br />
professions in the building industry to examine the scope<br />
for significant reforms of technical regulation of building<br />
codes and standards.<br />
Finally within this package of measures resources will be<br />
devoted to create the capacity for the analysis and<br />
development of policy in relation to housing supply within<br />
our Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce.<br />
Now that package of measures, which you will see is<br />
specifically going to detailed issues which can improve the<br />
situation on the supply side to all of the measures welcomed<br />
by the States which they will cooperate and implementation<br />
to some extent in funding, is a package of measures which<br />
will cost us about $ 9 million over the next three years.<br />
So you can see that as well as addressing the question of<br />
the supply of land the conference embraced the concept that<br />
we've advanced of bringing forward these measures which we<br />
hope will provide a clear indication of the capacity of the<br />
three levels of government, Commonwealth, State and Local to<br />
accelerate the supply of land.<br />
Now I just want to go to an area now which I think in the<br />
light of some of the events leading up to the conference is<br />
particularly interesting. The conference reviewed and it<br />
warmly applauded the performance of that concept that we've<br />
been using now for some time. It has the rather grand title<br />
of the Joint Venture for more Affordable Housing. It's also<br />
known as Green Street. And you know what's involved there.<br />
The concept is jointly supported by Commonwealth, State and<br />
Local governments as well as industry and what it's been<br />
about is trying to demonstrate to Local governments and to<br />
the industry and to consumers the wider range of housing<br />
choices that are available and the use of more innovative<br />
building and land development techniques. It's applauded by<br />
all the Premiers as it was in a meeting we had last week<br />
with the industry and local government and it's applauded<br />
for the very simple reason that it has demonstrated the<br />
sorts of savings that are available by not being locked in<br />
simply to traditional concepts and what housing's about. As<br />
we say in the press release here and as was embraced by the<br />
Premiers, the project has achieved savings of up to 24% on<br />
house and land development. we agreed that we will be<br />
working with the States to expand awareness of this concept.<br />
Very significantly I would think in terms particularly of<br />
some of the sort of things that were said about Paul<br />
Keating's observations in this area, the conference also<br />
agreed enthusiastically, unanimously, every Premier and the<br />
Chief Minister picked up very enthusiastically the </p>
<p>( PM cont) proposition that was advanced by Paul and his<br />
exposition in this area that we would give early<br />
consideration to joint Commonwealth/ State demonstration<br />
programs of higher quality medium density housing in the<br />
inner cities, particularly older industrial and commercial<br />
areas. In other words there you had all the State Premiers and the<br />
Chief Minister saying in response to the Treasurer's<br />
suggestion, which is consistent with the Joint Venture for<br />
More Affordable Housing which looks towards the other end of<br />
the market. Here was a proposal to look at the same sort of<br />
concept for higher quality medium density housing in the<br />
inner city areas because there's a recognition of what the<br />
realities are that we musn't in this country when we're<br />
trying to talk about meeting the housing needs of our<br />
citizens be hide-bound by simply the traditional ways of<br />
going about it.<br />
So I repeat, and as Paul implicity it's not to say that<br />
for those who want into the future to have the traditional<br />
approach, the quarter acre block and so on out there, that<br />
that is not going to be available. of course it is but we<br />
ought to recognise that there are other ways of doing it and<br />
that for a lot of the Australian population these<br />
alternatives are what they want. So I think it's very<br />
significant that the Premiers unanimously and<br />
enthusiastically endorse this concept so what we will be<br />
doing in more than one city, we can't say we'll be doing it<br />
in every one, but in more than one city we will undertake a<br />
joint Commonwealth/ State demonstration program of what can<br />
be done in this area. I think that will mark a signifcant<br />
turn in community thinking about this important issue.<br />
Finally let me say that we also talked about the area of the<br />
supply of skilled labour, agreed that we should try and do<br />
all that we could to accelerate the supply of skilled labour<br />
in that area and the States undertook to review legislation<br />
regulations under their control with a view to improving<br />
their systems of land supply and use.<br />
They raised questions about the First Home Owners Scheme,<br />
some of them thought they had some ideas how we might<br />
without necessarily additional outlays but to use the same<br />
amount of dollars effectively said good, any proposals<br />
you've got on that let's have them.<br />
So I think you can see in total colleagues that a) it was a<br />
very very useful positive constructive meeting, that firm<br />
relevant decisions were taken not only on the question of<br />
land supply but we've now made some very important decisions<br />
in regard to the basic questions of the alternative sorts of<br />
developments that are available to meet the question of more<br />
affordable housing.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister when can we expect these<br />
measures to be given..? </p>
<p>PM: Well I had that question this morning. I give the same<br />
answer now. One can't honestly say that it's going to<br />
happen tomorrow or the next day. We said there's no quick<br />
fix. what you've got to do however is two things I think.<br />
You've got to first of all recognise as the Premiers and the<br />
Chief minister did, the reality that the constraints are on<br />
the supply side. I repeat what I said this morning in 1988<br />
house prices increased by 35%, medium house price increase<br />
increase in interest rates so it is on the supply<br />
side, supply of land and associated matters. Now what's<br />
happened today is not simply that we've made arrangements<br />
ourselves to make more land available and the states have<br />
undertaken to accelerate the processes of making land<br />
available and the processes of zoning and so on in<br />
cooperation with local government but also importantly as<br />
I've said and given emphasis to we have agreed that we will<br />
undertake joint programs of looking at higher quality,<br />
medium density housing alternatives. It will actually<br />
undertake joint Commonwealth/ State programs in a number of<br />
cities. Now obviously that won't happen tomorrow. I mean<br />
the program is not coming We've agreed to start on that<br />
and you can see that we're enthusiastically commited to it,<br />
the states are. So we are changing both the capacity to<br />
supply land. Secondly, we are going to together accelerate<br />
the processes of land release, zoning processes and so on.<br />
And thirdly and in probably some sense in the long term<br />
more fundamental sense we are together Commonwealth and<br />
State Governments accepting that there are other ways of<br />
attacking the problem of housing simply than in the<br />
traditional method and that is not merely in the outer areas<br />
whether the joint venture for more affordable housing has<br />
proved successful but now looking at that in terms of higher<br />
quality, medium density housing opportunities in the inner<br />
city areas.<br />
JOURANLIST: On that demonstration project you're talking<br />
about will federal funds be allocated this financial year to<br />
PM: We're now March, we're getting towards the end of the<br />
financial year but quite clearly we'll start work now and<br />
our consideration leading up to our Budget and coming up to<br />
the Premiers Conference, which will be held within a couple<br />
of months, we're commited very seriously to this project and<br />
there won't be any short comings, there won't be any<br />
hesitation on our part in moving to get this going. I mean<br />
we're not looking at financial year considerations, we want<br />
to get this off the ground as quickly as possible. I think<br />
the states do too so we'll have the opportunity in the<br />
period now leading up to the Premiers Conference. a lot<br />
of work to be able to move to implementation of this.<br />
JOURNALIST: Which Premiers raised the question of interest<br />
rates the question of economic settings and what did you<br />
say to them? </p>
<p>TREASURER: Basically the non-Labor Premiers and the reply I<br />
gave was that we couldn't accommodate this level of<br />
investment in equipment, in business investment generally,<br />
in residential construction and non-residential<br />
construction, without something having to give. That was<br />
either it went on to the current account or we reduce<br />
dramatically the call by the public sector upon Australian<br />
savings. That is even more than we have to date or monetary<br />
policy would be employed in moderating that investment. And<br />
of course you wouldn't need to guess what option they<br />
thought was the better of the three of those and that was<br />
that monetary policy should moderate those investments.<br />
That is the 5 percentage point of GDP shift we've had in<br />
investment, in plant and equipment, business investment,<br />
plus residential, plus non-residential construction. it<br />
could only be accommodated if the public sector was<br />
continuing to save to a very large extent. Now every 1% of<br />
GDP is worth $ 30004 so when I pointed out to them that 5% of<br />
GDP would cost $ 15B if they would prefer to ease monetary<br />
policy that way and I think then they perhaps thought maybe<br />
that the current policy settings were probably just about<br />
right. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister is there any for public<br />
housing in the<br />
PM: It wasn't a question at this conference of allocating<br />
funds to the private sector or the public sector. I mean<br />
the question of what we'll do about the level of funding to<br />
public housing is something that comes up in the<br />
consideration that we have as we lead up to our Budget and<br />
it was understood. I mean this was essentially a supply<br />
side conference. Now this doesn't mean that those other<br />
issues don't have a significance but what everyone really<br />
understood is that you don't solve the problems that we were<br />
talking about by throwing more money on the demand side. We<br />
had to deal with a fundamental problem which is reflected in<br />
the statistics I gave you this morning and again this<br />
afternoon 35% increase in medium house price in 1988, the<br />
interest rate 7% increase in that period. They<br />
essentially have got a supply side problem and that's<br />
essentially what the conference was about today.<br />
JOURNALIST: What were the concerns expressed about the<br />
First Home Owners Scheme and how serious are you about<br />
addressing them? Do you for example consider pouring more<br />
money into it?<br />
PM: No, I wanted to make the point clearly Laurie that they<br />
were not putting to us the observation in terms necessarily<br />
of more money. They actually used the phrase that they had<br />
some ideas which they didn't spell out and I'm not saying<br />
that critically but they said they had some ideas about<br />
how for the existing number of dollars you could get more<br />
effective outcomes. So we naturally said if you've got any<br />
such ideas that can make our existing outlays more<br />
effective, sure, let's talk about it. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: On the question of skilled labour, were any<br />
ideas discussed that showed some promise?<br />
PM: The discussion there, you could put it in two parts. A<br />
reporting on our part of what had been done with the Housing<br />
Industry Association in NSW and then the broader discussions<br />
which took place last month to look at what may be able to<br />
be done on the migration side. our colleagues in the States<br />
recognised that and welcomed what we'd done there. Secondly<br />
there was an acceptance that they should be prepared to<br />
perhaps even be more flexible because it's their area<br />
basically, the question of apprenticeship provisions and so<br />
on. Paul will handle this side of it and outline the amount<br />
of money we are putting for instance into craft and<br />
associated schemes. They welcomed that and undertook that<br />
they would from their point of view adopt as flexible an<br />
approach as possible to ensure the maximum throughput of<br />
apprentices and other training forms. There is a<br />
recognition that in some States the builders have levies<br />
upon themselves, in Western Australia for instance they've<br />
got that, and in what we've done in the migration area in<br />
negotiation with the Housing Industry Association in NSW<br />
which had agreement for another 250 skilled people up to<br />
July of next year. There is a reciprocal obligation there<br />
on the part of the industry to undertake training for an<br />
amount. So it wasn't just a question of looking at<br />
migration but lifting the training effort as well.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did any of the Premiers say yes we'll take some<br />
of the land you've offered or is there still really hard<br />
bargaining to be done before any of that gets allocated<br />
PM: They welcomed the decision but quite frankly in respect<br />
of certain parcels they raised questions as to whether that<br />
would be what would be most suitable to them. There were<br />
questions that I indicated in my outline in the beginning as<br />
to the terms under which it will be taken. Some of them<br />
have been a litte bit frightened by figures that they've<br />
seen about valuations which weren't our valuations at all.<br />
They were valuations which had been put upon the parcels by<br />
the Housing Industry Association which were not valuations<br />
for unimproved values but for completed development blocks.<br />
So when they understood that the figures that they'd seen<br />
were not the real ones that allayed their concern somewhat.<br />
But we're not trying to shove down their throat a particular<br />
form of disposal. if there are some areas for instance that<br />
they didn't want developed they understood that we may offer<br />
it to the private sector. But the essential thing is that<br />
we've agreed now to a series of bilateral discussions with<br />
each State with regard to the parcels that have been talked<br />
about and further if they've got ideas about other they<br />
can identify which is more suitable within their planning<br />
programs, we'll do that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Without going to John Cain's suggestion of the<br />
Watsonia army barracks? </p>
<p>PM: I can't speak in regard to watsonia because that's a<br />
judgement that would have to be made by our relevant<br />
minister. Neither Paul nor I can say whether there is any<br />
opportunity or option there at all. But we'll certainly<br />
discuss it with them.<br />
TREASURER: I don't think he raised it.<br />
PM: He did mention Watsonia but let me make the general<br />
point in regard to Melbourne, how it came Up. He was saying<br />
the Albion development which is a very large part of what<br />
we're offering there is in the western suburbs. He said in<br />
that area land supply is, available land is not a major<br />
problem relatively. He said most people want in Melbourne<br />
to live in the south or south east. It was in that context<br />
that he made just a passing reference to Watsonia. But<br />
whether that is available or not is not a decision that Paul<br />
or I could make, it's a question that you'd have to ask,<br />
* that we'll have to ask and discuss with our minister.<br />
JOURNALIST: Isn't it the case though that if you offer land<br />
in areas where in areas where there's plenty of supply<br />
that the impact on overall price is going to be minimised,<br />
that is you're not going to reduce prices that much?<br />
PM: I don't think that's right. Let me make it clear that<br />
not all the land comes into that category. It certainly was<br />
the case in regard to Albion that the Premier of Victoria<br />
made that point, but there was just general acceptance, no<br />
question by anyone that if not only in terms of what we make<br />
more available, but if they speed up their processes as<br />
well, that over time most obviously if you're going to<br />
increase the number of blocks that are available it's got to<br />
have an impact upon price outcome.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Keating, can you explain<br />
TREASURER: At the moment we have a depreciation allowance<br />
for residential property. The NSW government floated a<br />
trust some 18 months ago where the trust was fully<br />
subscribed to about the tune of $ 24 million. We've been<br />
suggesting that perhaps they might try and float another and<br />
they say that they think it would be uncompetitive and<br />
wouldn't be subscribed. But there was some indication to us<br />
that they don't quite understand the provisions of the tax<br />
law in a way which may otherwise let it be subscribed. So<br />
we've agreed to talk about those things so at least they<br />
understand fully what is available under the Tax Act at the<br />
moment before we consider their general request for a higher<br />
depreciation rate.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
TREASURER: It's directed at low income rental property, the<br />
building of low income rental property for low income<br />
tenants. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, how much of a problem is local<br />
government resistance to medium density housing and what<br />
will today's meeting do to overcome that?<br />
PM: Well, I'll just make a couple of observations about<br />
that. Firstly I think there is a tendency to overstate the<br />
problem and why do I say it? I say it because we already<br />
have with the Joint Venture for More Affordable Housing<br />
evidence in a number of States that we can get cooperation<br />
from the relevant local government units when an alternative<br />
to the traditional zoning approach is offered, which gives<br />
you the capacity to house more people in an acceptable way,<br />
in a way they desire, within a given area. So I'm not<br />
therefore being hypothetical about this when I say I think<br />
there's a tendency to overstate in general terms the<br />
opposition would exist on this ground. We have shown that<br />
under the Joint Venture for More Affordable Housing you can<br />
get the cooperation of the local government. The second<br />
point I make is, it's interesting isn't it that across the<br />
political divide in there today all Premiers<br />
enthusiastically embraced the concept of looking at making<br />
changes which will enable medium density housing to go<br />
ahead, not just at the relatively lower end of the income<br />
scale but also at the high quality end. So obviously the<br />
Premiers there are making the judgement as to what is the<br />
desire out there in the community and I think that the local<br />
government area can't be unresponsive to that.<br />
TREASURER: I was just going to add to the Prime Minister's<br />
answer and say that after the announcement of this<br />
conference we've already had the biggest change in the most,<br />
for the largest State, the one where the problem is greatest<br />
and that is in the NSW Government saying that they will give<br />
a right of appeal by developers over metropolitan councils<br />
to the State Government, whereas under the Local Government<br />
Act now there is no right of appeal. I mean if a developer<br />
wants a medium density innovative housing proposal agreed to<br />
now by local government and it is refused, that is it. This<br />
change will mean, that that is the change portended by Mr<br />
Greiner which arose from the debate about this housing<br />
conference, will mean that developers and the major ones<br />
particularly who are likely to take this, can appeal<br />
this to the State planning authorities against local<br />
government. JOURNALIST: What other changes are needed though to achieve<br />
that? TREASURER: The change here look when we've agreed to,<br />
we're going to look at it, joint Commonwealth/ State<br />
demonstration program for higher quality medium density<br />
housing in the inner cities and some of the older industrial<br />
and commercial areas. Now the problem at the moment is, it<br />
is not to say that none of this is occurring. But it occurs<br />
block by block, it's never occurred in a precinct or a<br />
locality and what is envisaged here as we take a precinct,<br />
for instance, the NSW Government has been speaking of late<br />
about the whole Pyrmont area, has been talking about the </p>
<p>( Treasurer cont) Sydney Showground area. Now I'm not<br />
particularly addressing myself to those particular precincts<br />
but it would give us a chance to do something to show that<br />
medium density can be quality development on a precinct<br />
basis and not just a project which sits then alone against<br />
the background of all the other architectural scenery.<br />
Right? So we're only just develop, we're saying we'll look<br />
at it to develop it but if the Commonwealth was to get in<br />
there with the States, and in Melbourne this is also true,<br />
with the industrial area on the other side of the city,<br />
other side of the river, it could be that the Victorian<br />
Government is interested in so demonstrating the same thing<br />
so that commercial developers will then come along and say<br />
look, there is the model.<br />
JOURNALIST: joint venture, and how does that differ<br />
from the Green Street proposal?<br />
PM: Well the Green Street, which is the shorthand way of<br />
referring to the Joint Venture for More Affordable Housing<br />
has been in outer areas and this is extending if you like<br />
the concept to what is relatively a higher quality level of<br />
development but in the inner city area. I just repeat, I<br />
think the interesting thing about it was the enthusiasm and<br />
unanimity with which this idea was picked up.<br />
JOURNALIST: When will the land be publicly identified so<br />
that community groups can react, will it be subject to<br />
environmental and heritage considerations, do you expect a<br />
fuss about any or all of the land?<br />
PM: Taking the first point. The Minister will now be<br />
engaging in a series of bilaterals with the States about it.<br />
There will be, you know, very early the capacity for a<br />
public identification of the areas and there is nothing<br />
secret about it David. Secondly you ask, will there be need<br />
for EISs. Basically, in regard to the areas that have been<br />
nominated by Stewart West, I wouldn't think so. Thirdly,<br />
will there be a fuss? Well, my experience of life in most<br />
areas of Government decisions there's a capacity for a fuss<br />
but I don't think it'll divert the attention of either the<br />
Commonwealth or the States from acting in these areas.<br />
JOURNALIST: Treasurer, these quality medium density style<br />
houses, sounds very yuppie, you know, sandstone Is<br />

TREASURER: It just means that Europe was into yuppiedom<br />
from the turn of the 17th century right through the 18th<br />
century. But maybe you know, we've got a better idea of<br />
yuppie architecture than Europeans had.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, which Premiers expressed concern<br />
about the adequacy of funds for infrastructure developments </p>

PM: The two Premiers that dwelt most on it were the<br />
Premiers of Western Australia, Peter Dowding and South<br />
Australia, John Bannon. I think it would be fair to say<br />
Paul that they all took the point but with those two<br />
emphasising it most.<br />
