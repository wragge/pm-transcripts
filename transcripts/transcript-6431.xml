UNDER EMBARGO 5.3OPM CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF PICASSO EXHIBITION<br />
MELBOURNE 27 JULY 19834<br />
Mr Premier, Ladies and Gentlemen,-<br />
I am very pleased to have been given the opportunity to open<br />
this Exhibition.<br />
This Exhibition provides Australians with a rare<br />
opportunity: an oppportunity to experience in this country<br />
the full range of work of one of the world's mas~ ter artists<br />
the work of a dominating personality who has significantly<br />
influenced the era in which we live.<br />
Picasso has provided images which are at once enduring and,<br />
at the same time, characteristic of his period. He has<br />
determined in some measure for all of us not just for<br />
practising artists our picture of what it is to be human<br />
in the 20th century.<br />
Picasso willingly accepted the dual responsibility of the<br />
artist to be open to his environment and times and to<br />
record them, but also to contribut~ e further by creating,<br />
communicating and influencing.<br />
If I may paraphrase a quote from Picasso " what do you<br />
suppose an artist is? he is a political being<br />
constantly aware of what is going on in the world and<br />
he cannot help being shaped by it". And, I would add,<br />
shaping it. He more than most challenged the society of<br />
which he was a part.<br />
He acknowledged that he was shaped by his era we<br />
acknowledge in turn his power to shape and influence his<br />
contemporaries and successors.<br />
Part of the artist's task of communicating is to encourage<br />
creativity in others. In this way our artists pass on a<br />
living culture. This Exhibition has a particular value in<br />
this regard. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Picasso' s achievement, innovation, genius must be given its<br />
due. In a culturally vital societ~ y it will also encourage<br />
new creativity. Accordingly while his is acknowledged as a<br />
great view, it should be seen as only one view. Others<br />
should be influenced by it, but be prepared to travel in new<br />
directions and present different views to be influenced<br />
and inspired but not overwhelmed.<br />
It is regrettably a fact that for whatever reasons great<br />
numbers of Australians have not had the opportunity and do<br />
not have the inclination to become involved actively in the<br />
arts at any level. We all consume the arts passively at<br />
least, but too few of us are fully informed consumers, or<br />
practitioners. We need to consider why, for so long, so * many Australians<br />
have been overwhelmed even defeated by the encounter;<br />
why so many have earnestly avoided any contact whatever.<br />
Where does the explanation lie?<br />
A society's attitude to the place of art in everyday living<br />
is established over considerable time. If there is<br />
alienation if there have been restrictions on our ability<br />
to fully express ourselves in this area of life it can<br />
only be overcome by some earnest, steady endeavour in the<br />
opposite direction.<br />
The Government' s responsibility is to provide what support<br />
and encouragement it can. The focal point of our arts<br />
policy is the concept of widening access to and<br />
participation in the arts by all sections of the community.<br />
This is firmly established in ALP policy.<br />
The Australia Council, exercising an independent artistic<br />
judgement, has given particular priority, while not<br />
foresaking the more traditional arts, to encouraging more<br />
community involvement in the arts. Its initiatives have<br />
done much to break down the alienation the distance<br />
which may be separating a large number of Australians from<br />
appreciating that the arts experience in an essential<br />
element in a full and rewarding life.<br />
To encourage people to make this effort to actually<br />
realise their potential requires a skilled and<br />
enthusiastic national resource of professional artists.<br />
Artists who can create, influence and communicate who can<br />
at once integrate effectively with the community and, at<br />
the same time, challenge the society of which they are a<br />
part. This interaction can help to erase the unfortunate<br />
impression, still too widely held, that arts workers and I<br />
use the term worker advisedly do not have a vital<br />
contribution to make to our community. </p>
<p>Artists should work to redress this jaundiced view but the<br />
country must also move more vigorously to recognise its<br />
responsibility towards the artist. Quite rightly the<br />
Australia Council, which has carefully researched the issues<br />
involved, has already acted on a number of fronts.<br />
It has earmarked extra funding for the employment of artists<br />
particularly for work in communities and work places. It<br />
is reviewing the level of direct grants 1: o individual<br />
writers, painters and other artists to attempt to bring its<br />
grants more into line with average weekly earnings. It has<br />
employed artists on community projects using CEP funds, as<br />
have other national, State and local arts agencies. The<br />
Council has also adopted guidelines on the equality of<br />
opportunity for women artists. These are, all necessary<br />
steps. In parallel with these actions, the Council has initiated<br />
further exploratory work. It has, for example, appointed an<br />
Arts Employment Committee, chaired by Michael Crosby, who is<br />
National Secretary of Actors' Equity and also a member of<br />
the Council, to review such things as the factors affecting<br />
employment in all art forms, to recommend measures to<br />
increase employment for artists and to assess the impact of<br />
short-term employment schemes.<br />
These and further programs and discussions in train with<br />
both Commonwealth and State agencies are aimed at improving<br />
the employment, remuneration and protection of artists.<br />
I am confident that the time and energy spent in these areas<br />
will bear fruit will lead not only to individual<br />
fulfilment but will also provide an open, culturally<br />
alive, discriminating society., The sort of society we want<br />
and our professional artists need if they are to add their<br />
own views to the world'd artistic heritage.<br />
Picasso must count among the greatest of contributors to<br />
that heritage.<br />
We are particularly privileged to have this Exhibition in<br />
Australia. The thanks of all of us go out to the<br />
contributors, organisers and sponsors to Marina Picasso<br />
and Mr Jan Krugier, Jim Leslie and the International<br />
Cultural Corporation of Australia, and News Corporation and<br />
Qantas, to name but a few of those who have extended<br />
support. I am sure all here this evening will enjoy this unique<br />
opportunity to see at the one time such wideranging examples<br />
of this great master's work. I have no doubt that many<br />
thousands, both here and in Sydney, will share this<br />
experience in the coming months. They, and hence Australia,<br />
will be the richer for it. It is for this reason I have<br />
particular pleasure in declaring the Exhibition open.<br />
