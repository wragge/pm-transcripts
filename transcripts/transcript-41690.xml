    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Turnbull Government has now taken full ownership of Snowy Hydro Limited in a deal that paves the way for the Snowy 2.0 project to proceed to a final investment decision by the independent Snowy board.</p>
<p>The historic agreement is part of our plan for a stronger economy. It will help generate more affordable, reliable electricity, and create new jobs.</p>
<p>The deal will also fund congestion-busting infrastructure, with more than $6 billion in Commonwealth funds flowing to New South Wales and Victoria for productive infrastructure investments.</p>
<p>Snowy Hydro will continue to operate as an independent commercial company and, most importantly, this iconic infrastructure will remain in public ownership.</p>
<p>Snowy Hydro is a critical player within the National Electricity Market (NEM). The company owns and operates 5500 MW of generation capacity including the iconic Snowy Mountains Scheme.</p>
<p>Snowy 2.0 is a proposed expansion of the Snowy Mountains Scheme and will provide an additional generation capacity of 2000 MW, enough to power the equivalent of 500,000 homes at peak demand.</p>
<p>The project will help make renewables reliable, reduce volatility in energy markets and provide other services critical to the security of the NEM.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the Snowy 2.0 feasibility study found that:</p>
<ul><li>the project is technically feasible – it can be built and Snowy Hydro have a base-case design and detailed construction schedule;</li>
<li>the project is financially feasible as it meets Snowy Hydro’s stringent investment hurdles; and</li>
<li>Snowy Hydro can finance the project itself using retained earnings and borrowing.</li>
</ul><p>The Snowy Hydro Board is expected to make a final investment decision on the Snowy 2.0 project later this year.</p>
