    <content><![CDATA[<p>Overnight, tragedy occurred in Victoria's Gippsland and north-east with the death of a man and the destruction of a number of homes in the bushfires. I extend my sympathies to the family and friends of the man who lost his life fighting the fires.</p>
<p> On behalf of all Australians I thank all of the people involved in fighting the fires and those contributing to the relief efforts.</p>
<p>Given the events overnight in Victoria, I have authorised additional Commonwealth support in the form of cash payments to people who have lost their principal place of residence or had it rendered uninhabitable. The cash payments will amount to $1000 for each eligible adult and $400 for each eligible child. Victorians who are entitled to this assistance will now be able to apply immediately to Centrelink on 1802233.</p>
<p>I am also pleased to announce that the Commonwealth will donate a further $50,000 to the Australian Red Cross Bushfires Appeal to be used for the recovery effort in Victoria.</p>
<p>I am having discussions with Premier Bracks about what additional assistance can be provided under the enhanced Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements that I announced yesterday. I expect further announcements on how we will continue to work together to support the relief and recovery effort.</p>
<p>This will be over and above the support which will be given by the Commonwealth to the Victorian Government under the long standing Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements. Through these arrangements, the Commonwealth assists the states with the costs and resourcing of response and recovery in relation to large scale natural disasters.</p>
<p> I reinforce the commitment I made yesterday to extend Commonwealth assistance should other states face similar difficulties. </p>
