TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, CANBERRA, 15 MAY 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: I amt here to advise you that as Senator Richardson<br />
has said somewhat earlier this afternoon to you,<br />
that I have received his report and accepted his<br />
resignation. Naturally, I accept hi. s resignation<br />
with regret, because as a Minister he has made quite<br />
a profound contribution to this country in all of<br />
the portfolios he has held, let alone his greater<br />
contribution to public life. The issues were about<br />
Senator Richardson, his Ministerial style and his<br />
relationship with Mr Symons and the state of his<br />
knowledge of Mr Symnons' business af fairs at the time<br />
he gave him references and introductions. His<br />
relationship with Mr Symons' was for Senator<br />
Richardson, I believe, an unfortunate one but not an<br />
improper one. I think the politics of the issues<br />
were 6uch that there was going to be damage<br />
somewhere, that was either going to be to the<br />
Government's time and its standing, or to Senator<br />
Richardson's position. He took the admirable step<br />
of deciding the matter himself, by tendering his<br />
resignation to me. And in so doing, allows the<br />
public debate again to focus back to the main issues<br />
which will decide the future of the country, its<br />
economy, its society, and of course the next<br />
election. I will be pleased to take questions.<br />
a: Mr Keating it was said on the news today that if he<br />
hadn't resi~ gned you would hee forced his<br />
resignation.<br />
Pm: Well the fact is, he did, he did resign. And I<br />
would have been required to of considered the<br />
report, and -ts ramifications, including its<br />
political ramifications. AS it turns out I didn't,<br />
I wasn't required to, I didn't need to. As I say,<br />

2<br />
Senator Richardson decided the matter himself in an<br />
admirable way.<br />
3; of* Senator Sibraa.<br />
PM: Well my Judgement on Senator Sibraa was very much<br />
the same as the utterances to date from the<br />
Democrats. That was, that he was asked to do<br />
something, which he did, he didn't approach any<br />
foreign Governments he went through the channels of<br />
the Australian bureaucracy abroad, iio further<br />
reference was made to him about the matter.<br />
J. Prime Minister, Attachment 5, this memo, can you<br />
tell us anything more about that?<br />
PM: No, just that it was uncovered in an investigation'<br />
by the Departments at my request, and having<br />
discovered it I thought it was important that<br />
Senator Richardson know that it was in my<br />
possession, and given the fact that he was about to<br />
give me a report, to report upon it.<br />
When did you discover it?<br />
PM: On Friday afternoon.<br />
J: And where was it discovered?<br />
PM: The Department of Foreign Affairs, I understand.<br />
3: Where abouts? Was it the Washington Embassy?<br />
PM; I don't know.<br />
Prime Minister you'll need now to reshuffle the<br />
Cabinet, will you take the opportunity to make a<br />
wide ranging change?<br />
PM: Well I haven't given that matter any thought, at<br />
all, at this stage.<br />
J: What will happen to the package of broadcasting<br />
legislation the Senator was going to take to Cabinet<br />
on Wednesday?<br />
PM: Well it will obviously have to be delayed.<br />
J: When will that reshuffle be made, Mr Keating?<br />
PM: Well I will have to think about it from now on, this<br />
evening and obviously in the course of the week.<br />
J: Having seen Senator Richardson's report do you still<br />
accept that he did not misl. ead the Senate?<br />
FM: Well I think that's in a sense academic. I am sure<br />
the Opposition would say he did. My view was that .002 P. 02/ 07 </p>
<p>TEL: 19. May. 92 9: 12 No. 002 P. 03/ 07<br />

he didn't, but it is about him and his Ministerial<br />
Position in the Senate, a position he has now<br />
resigned.<br />
J: Mr Keating do you think you should have asked<br />
Senator Richardson questions earlier about this<br />
affair?<br />
PM: I asked him the question that mattered. That is I<br />
brought the matter to a head requiring him to<br />
produce a report to me when X first learned that Mr<br />
Symons had a scheme of arrangement with creditors.<br />
That is, the moment I knew that Senator Richardson<br />
may have given a reference to somebody who he may<br />
possibly have known was in this circumstance, I<br />
thought required me to ask of him that such a report<br />
be given. And that's when I did, when I found out.<br />
J; Prime Minister are you now convinced that Senator<br />
Richardson did not know anything about his cousin's<br />
business affairs?<br />
PM; Well as I say, I think that the relationship was,<br />
obviously Senator Richardson believed that with<br />
years of background in this relationship he could<br />
with confidence provide a reference, it turns out to<br />
be confidence misplaced, but as I said I think the<br />
relationship has for him been an unfortunate one,<br />
but not an improper one.<br />
3: Mr Keating, have you ever met Mr SymorVand has he<br />
ever asked you for any favours?<br />
PM: I met Mr Symon3when he was at the Youth Council<br />
Labor Party, twenty odd years ago, X have not met<br />
him since. In fact, I couldn't recall his face<br />
until I saw an early picture of him in the Sydney<br />
Morning Herald.<br />
J: Not a bad scalp for John Hewsori, it it?<br />
Pm: Well the issue is, always the big issues, and Dr<br />
Hewson always talks about distractions and moving<br />
away from the main issues, but it suited the<br />
Opposition to engage in this issue as a distraction<br />
from the main issue. He now knows, as I know, that<br />
selling the Australian electorate on consumption tax<br />
adding 15 per cent to their goods and services is<br />
unpalatable, disruptive, and he will not like us<br />
returning to those issues.<br />
J; ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well that was what I was asked earlier and I gave an<br />
answer.<br />
3: Could you have continued to </p>

PM: well, I mean, I would have considered the report now<br />
much more closely after having read it carefully<br />
this morning, its ramifications, including its<br />
political ramifications, In political, terms this<br />
was always going to be a grey matter and as Senator<br />
Richardson himself said, impossible to be settled in<br />
black and white terms. And that would have been as<br />
Much a matter for me as for him.<br />
J: Prime minister can I just ask you two questions<br />
about Attachment 5. First of all given that it came<br />
from Foreign Affairs and that Gareth Evans had faced<br />
questioning in the Senate about Mr Symons'<br />
activities, particularly in relation to Washington,<br />
shouldn't he have known that Attachment 5 was<br />
residing within his department? And secondly,<br />
Senator Richardson says he was unaware that he had<br />
received this letter, it is unsigned and it seems to<br />
trail off in the middle. Are you convinced it is a<br />
bonafide document?<br />
Pm: I can't comment on the status of the document and I<br />
don't want to be drawing judgement about the<br />
document because Mr Symons himself was in the<br />
invidious position of having to face charges about<br />
other documentation in another place.<br />
Would you like to see Senator Richardson returned to<br />
the front bench at some stage?<br />
PM; Well, Senator Richardson made his position clear, I<br />
think, to the public, to you today, by saying that<br />
he wouldn't be seeking a return to the front bench<br />
in this Parliament. That's all that matters I<br />
think.<br />
3: senator Evans, Prime Minister, should he have known<br />
that this document was In the Department of Foreign<br />
Affairs?<br />
PM: We asked the Department to provide any reference<br />
whatsoever to any associations or dealings with Mr<br />
Symons. That turned up upon that extensive check.<br />
That's obviously taken some time and Senator Evans<br />
couldn't be aware of all these things from the<br />
moment the issue arose. I mean, the Senate has been<br />
up now well over a week.<br />
J: Wasn't Senator Evans cavalier initially though, Mr<br />
Keating, in telling the Senate that he wasn't<br />
prepared to investigate this issue?<br />
PM: I em not aware of every utterance Senator Evans made<br />
upon the subject, but in the initial phases of this<br />
I think his responses have been appropriate. And as<br />
time has gone on we have discovered these documents.<br />
But again, the process was there for the discovery:<br />
a) that Senator Richardson and the Government and I </p>
<p>TEL:<br />
set up the process, that he should report to me.<br />
And this is what has in fact brought these events to<br />
a head. And also it was upon my initiative that<br />
Departments were asked to go back through their<br />
files.<br />
J: Prime Minister you referred to Senator Richardsons'<br />
Ministerial style. Do you think it ha8 always been<br />
an appropriate style?<br />
PM: Well, everyone has a style in public life. I<br />
suppose some people display more reserve, caution,<br />
guile perhaps, in their dealings with people, don't<br />
take them at face value as he has believed he can<br />
take a long-standing personal relationship at face<br />
value. They are very tough Judgements. But I think<br />
it is important for ministers to be always aware of<br />
relationships in relation to the kinds of issues<br />
which Mr Symons has raised with Senator Richardson.<br />
J: Do you regret being so strongly supportive of<br />
Senator Richardson in the initial phases and not<br />
asking him for a full report earlier in the<br />
controversy?<br />
PM: No, because in the House of Representives the<br />
questions were about his call to the Marshall<br />
islands which were about not going to the issue, but<br />
which were about him seeking for Mr Symons a right<br />
to prepare himself a trial.<br />
J: 0.6a meeting with Symnons and Finch on the Marshall<br />
Island Scheme?<br />
PM: First let me deal with this and in that sense,<br />
and his inquiry to Senator Evans, and Senator Evans<br />
specifying the terms of his phone ca~ ll I found to be<br />
no problem.<br />
J: Mr Keating, do you support the practice of Ministers<br />
giving letters of introduction to business friends<br />
or personal friends? Do you do so? And in the<br />
light of what's happened, if you do support it do<br />
you think maybe you might take a different attitude<br />
from now on?<br />
PM: All Members of Parliament, House of Representatives<br />
and Senate are all the time required to provide<br />
references to people. Now some people they know<br />
exceptionally well, others by association. And I<br />
think a reference of that variety always carries<br />
with it, at least the knowledge, certainly in this<br />
country I think, that people in public life are<br />
prevailed upon to provide references.<br />
J: Do you do it? T1EL9:. May. 92 9: 12 No. 002 P. 05/ 07 </p>
<p>T1EL9:. May. 92 9: 12 No. 002 P. 06/ 0?<br />
6<br />
PM: Yea, I do. Have done but not extensively, but I've<br />
done it.<br />
J: Is there a need for guidelines in this area?<br />
PM: I don't know, I think commonsense is the beat<br />
guideline.<br />
J: Senator Richardson said you were surprised by his<br />
decision. Did you try and talk him out of it today?<br />
PM: He was fairly clear about his intentions. He<br />
arrived, he gave me the report, I read it. Upon the<br />
completion he said he intended to resign and he had<br />
the letter of resignation there, and we discussed<br />
the issues and later in the conversation I actually<br />
opened and read the letter itself.<br />
J: Do you see any prospect of Senator Richardson<br />
returning to a senior role in the Government<br />
sometime in the future?<br />
FM: It's not sensible or politic for any of us to<br />
contemplate our positions, unless in the course of<br />
each Parliament. The Government will be seeking its<br />
re-election at an election and then, and only then,<br />
after the public have supported the Government again<br />
in a poll is a question of any persons prerogatives<br />
within the Ministry or within the Caucus open of<br />
discussion. I don't think it's relevant and it's<br />
not open for discussion now, as I think Senator<br />
Richardson himself has indicated.<br />
J: What were your personal feelings about seeing a<br />
close colleague's demise?<br />
PM; As I said, I accepted his resignation with regret.<br />
Graham and I go back now to our youth, in reality,<br />
certainly to our early 20s and he has made a<br />
tremendous contribution. He will be remembered for<br />
his quite milestone performances in the environment<br />
portfolio in this country, for his substantial<br />
stewardship of the Department of Social Security.<br />
And, while less so for his work now because he's<br />
only in the course of doing it in his current<br />
portfolio, but across that period and, need I say,<br />
as a rank and file Senator and member of the Caucus,<br />
his involvement in many issues of substance, good<br />
things for Australia. Good things where he went<br />
through that Caucus with people raising with them<br />
issues to support the Government and~ the Cabinet on<br />
matters of substance which have certainly moved the<br />
debate along. He has been a very positive force for<br />
good Government, good policy, social change in<br />
Australia.<br />
J: Did Senator Richardson do anything wrong Mr Keating?<br />
TEL: </p>
<p>TEL 7<br />
PM: Senator Richardson, 88 I said, decid~ ed the issue<br />
himself. He decided, as he said I think to you,<br />
that there would be a protracted debate about his<br />
role, that the Opposition were not prone to believe<br />
him saying that he provided this reference free of<br />
any knowledge that the person who he was providing<br />
the reference for was subject to a scheme of credit<br />
arrangements et cetera and that there would be a<br />
protracted debate, and that there would be damage to<br />
either himself and the Government or both. So in a<br />
sense he did decide the issue.<br />
J; Mr Keati~ ng to you believe that this issue has done<br />
long term damage to the Government?<br />
PM. I don't thInk so. I agree with his assessment of<br />
the damage. These issues have come and gone over<br />
the years. In the Fraser ministry, this was the<br />
fate of very many Ministers and yet that Government<br />
won successive elections.<br />
J: Mr Keating would you expect pay TV to be considered<br />
now?<br />
PM: I don't know, but obviously it will not be managed<br />
under the stewardship of Senator Richardson<br />
therefore which ever Minister is managing it will<br />
have to immerse themselves in the issue and be in a<br />
position to competently take the matter forward to<br />
Cabinet. That's obviously not nlow.<br />
J: When will you plan to start considering<br />
replacements?<br />
PM: Well I will from now on.<br />
J; Prime Minister, are you disposed to keeping the<br />
reshuffle relatively minimal?<br />
PM: Well I'll consider the issue myself for the moment.<br />
If you've got any tips Glenn ( Milne), you can ring<br />
me down or leave them on a note and Mark ( Ryan) will<br />
bring them into me, but in the meantime I'll just<br />
think about them myself. Thank you very much.<br />
