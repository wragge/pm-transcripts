PRIME MINISTER<br />
" THIS WEEK"<br />
Television Interview given by the Prime Minister,<br />
T e Rt. Hon. William McMahon, for HSV7.<br />
MELBOURNE<br />
Interviewers John Boland<br />
Max Grant JUNE 1972<br />
Introduction Good Evening and welcome to " This Week" this week.<br />
Much of our programme this evening is devoted to the first in-depth<br />
interview the Prime Minister, ' r McMahon, has given since he returned<br />
from his trip to South-East Asia.<br />
Now to question the Prime Minister tonight, John Boland,<br />
and Maxwell Grant of the " Herald".<br />
Q. Prime ? inister, if there is criticism of you as Prime<br />
Minister, there certainly was never any of you as Federal<br />
Treasurer. And I have heard it said that you were probably one<br />
of the most forthright and best Treasurers we have had in<br />
Australia, and it is that area that I would like to deal with<br />
first. With Britain letting the pound sterling float, most<br />
financial experts believe that starling will be devalued when<br />
foreign exchanges open tomorrow and the British Exchange opens,<br />
I think, on the following Tuesday. Now if this happens, is it<br />
possible that Australia's dollar would dvalue?<br />
PM: I don't think so, and I think it would be highly improbable.<br />
That's the clear answer I can give. I think that is the only<br />
answer I can give in fact.<br />
Q. Well, the devaluation of the oound sterling could affect<br />
Australia's farm industries, and say bring a flood of speculative<br />
money here, far more than has been potring into Australia<br />
in recent months. Is this concerning you, and do you see some<br />
vital areas of concern here<br />
PM: The foreign exchanges will be closed at least tomorrow.<br />
The British exchanges have closed and sp, too, have the Japanese,<br />
so we have a little time to think. But what is important is<br />
that the British Government through the Chancellor of the<br />
Exchequer, has made it clear that there are no objective facts<br />
on which Britain should expect a revaluation or devaluation<br />
downwards, if you like. And I think that is probably true, / 2 </p>
<p>PM: so that what has happened in recent days has been speculative.<br />
cont'd. But even if there were some depreciation of the United Kingdom<br />
pound, it would not necessarily have a severe effect on us.<br />
As you know, when we were looking at this problem in December,<br />
we decided tLLo detach ourselves from the pound sterling, and to<br />
associate our Australian dollar with the United States dollar.<br />
Consequently, for the two reasons that I have just given, we<br />
doubt whether this will have a very big impact upon us and that<br />
includes the primary industries as wall.<br />
Q. The floating of the storling pound, though, would in fact,<br />
tend to make our exports to Britain dearer<br />
PM: That is true, yes. But we don't know yet to what extent<br />
it might occur.<br />
Q. But it will occur to some extent You wouldn't argue<br />
with that<br />
PM: I wouldn't argue about that, but I wouldn't speculate.<br />
Consequently I would not speculate to the extent to which it<br />
would affect Australia's primary industries. I do notthink<br />
it could be very substantial.<br />
Q. Has the Government considered floating the dollar, as<br />
some Sydney and Melbourne university economists have suggested?<br />
PM: No, we haven't because we believe and I think most other<br />
countries believe in having a fairly stable exchange rate.<br />
And we do like some areas within which the exchange rate can<br />
vary, but we want the band to be not too big. And we want the<br />
United Kingdom Government and I know it's the view of the<br />
United Kingdom Government that it get back back to a parity<br />
of exchange and it fixes the band within which fluctuations<br />
can occur, as quickly as it can. It knows that is in the<br />
interest of world trade and worlddevelooment, and so do we.<br />
Q. You were Federal Treasurer, I thin when the late Harold<br />
Hoitwas Prime Minister...<br />
PM: Yes, that is true.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, you took a very strong stand on the pound<br />
sterling crisis then, and you did have trouble with the Country<br />
Party at that stage. Sir John McEwen, I think, was Deputy<br />
Prime Minister then. Now, do you expect pressures...<br />
obviously primary industry will be affected... you would<br />
expect pressures from the Count-ry Party again in this area.';<br />
PM: It is much too early to speculate and dangerous to do so<br />
because we will -not get the kind of fluctuations in the<br />
exchanges that we had previously. And, in my own view, looking<br />
at it as I do at the moment, I don't expect any trouble about<br />
this problem.<br />
Q. You p robably could.... would you be prepared to say there<br />
is certainly no prospect at the moment of a revaluation of<br />
the Australian dollar </p>
<p>PM: I would not speculate about this at all. I would be fairly<br />
certain of this, that we will not change our parity with gold<br />
or with the United States dollar, but that doesn't mean to say<br />
that there might not be some fluctuation in relationship to<br />
sterling, if it does devalue that is, move downwards.<br />
Q. You think it is pcssible that the Australian dollar could<br />
move downwards<br />
PM:-The Australian dollar<br />
Q. Yes.<br />
PM: If I have created that impression, no, I do not. The<br />
Australian dollar is strong and there is no reason why it should<br />
do anything else than stay where it is, at least fcrthe time<br />
being.<br />
Q. Before Mr Anthony left for overseas, he told the Press he<br />
was gravely concerned at the flood of investment and sp eculation<br />
money pouring into Australia. He said he wanted decisive,<br />
quick and realistic action on foreign investment. Prime Minister,<br />
have you heeded those words How do you feel about that<br />
PM: Well, Iwis the one who initiated probably the most farreaching<br />
and in-depth~ enquiry into the Australian exchange rates,<br />
and also the flood of money that is occurring into * Australia<br />
from the international markets. Everyone who is really<br />
interested in this problem should try and understand the analysis<br />
that was made by the ~' easury. I have examined it, and my<br />
officials have examined it in great depth, and we have decided<br />
to present five papers to the Federal Ca) Anet dealing with the<br />
problems that may emerge as, -for example, whethcr there should<br />
be some regulation, or control of the flow of capital into<br />
Australia, and whether we want better guidelines for borrowing,<br />
whether we should do something about interest rates, whether<br />
we should give greater flexibility for Australian corporations<br />
to invest overseas and for overseas corporations to be able<br />
to borrow money from us. Now, before anyone can come to a<br />
precise conclusion which he knows will be for the benefit of<br />
this country, he must have those papers from Treasury, and the<br />
Government inust make up its mind what it will do. That doesn't<br />
mean to say wee are not interested in them. We are vitally<br />
interested in them, but wee want to be certain that when we make<br />
a decision we do it in the best intcerests of this country.<br />
Q. If you had to devalue, do you see this as being a sort of<br />
political storm that could affect your electoral chances<br />
PM: There is no prospect of Australia devaluing.<br />
Q. Well, that is pretty final, Prime Minister.<br />
Q. Before the next election<br />
PM: I wil. Tive no other answer than tha-4t. There is no prospect<br />
of us devaluing. ./ 4 </p>
<p>0. Prime Minister, I " would like to turn to defence and foreign<br />
affairs. What is the future of the Five Power Agreement,<br />
particularly if Labor won the Federal election, and the recent<br />
controversy which you have had on your South-East Asian tour?<br />
It would seem there is some sort of uncertainty as to where this<br />
Five Power Agreement is going. i know you have underlined and<br />
said in the second part, yes, we are definitely going to continue<br />
with it. But Labor has said, well, if we win, we are not going<br />
to worry much about it.<br />
PM: There is no uncertainty so far as the Liberal Party is<br />
concerned, nor so far as the Coalition Government is concerned.<br />
And I can state our position precisely. We have Five Power<br />
Arrangements with Malaysia and Singapore. We will keep them in<br />
full and they will not be changed. We have no intention of<br />
changing them. We have troops stationed in Singapore and<br />
Malaysia and we have no intntion of withdrawing or reducing<br />
them. In other words, on both scores, as to the Agreements<br />
themselves, or the Arrangements temselves, as they are<br />
properly called, and as to the stationing of troops, we are<br />
firm on what we do. And I believe, too, well, I know<br />
it's not a question of belief, it's a question of knowledge<br />
the Singaporeans and the Malaysians want us to keep thcm there<br />
and they don't want any reduction. And I think that even in<br />
recent days, not only when I was there, but probably subsequently,<br />
that is the view of the Singaporcan Government. And it is the<br />
view of Tun Razak, who most recently said that these Arrangements<br />
provide an umbrella for them and that they are probably in the<br />
enlightened interests not only of Singapore and Malaysia but of<br />
Australia as well, I wouldn't substantially differ from that<br />
view. It is to the advantaqc of the three of us that the<br />
Arrangements are maintained, and we will do so. As for Labor,<br />
nobody can tell you exactly what they mean, but we do % now<br />
what their long-term intentions are. Tha-is to get out as<br />
quickly as they can. This sets the dividing line . betwen<br />
the Government and the Opposition.<br />
0. Prime Minister, on this issue of the Five Power Arrangements<br />
and keeping a battalion there, the thing that seems strange to<br />
me is that Tun Razak has nowhere actually denied the statement<br />
of his official in the background briefing of the journalists,<br />
who subsequently after you raised the issue of a clarifying<br />
statement and this most recent June 19 statement you referred<br />
to about it being needed as an umbrella, he has nowhere dcnied<br />
the public servant's ztatment. Do you find it strange?<br />
Pm. No I don't. I do don't. I do not find it strange. I<br />
believe that the statement issued at his request by the Foreign<br />
Office itself was a complete enough cxplanation and I could not<br />
have asked for anything more. When it was supported by the<br />
communique, I believe that our position was clearly stated by<br />
both him as Prime Minister of Malaysia, and myself as Prime<br />
Minister of Australia. Mr. Sulong is an able man and I would<br />
make no commontary about him. NH is a civil servant, and I do<br />
not think it would be proper for me or, for that matter, for<br />
anyone else in a position such as mine, to enter into any<br />
controversy what relates to a civil servant. I am satisfied with<br />
which the Prime K. inister, represanting the Government of Malaysia<br />
has said, and what Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, the Prime Minister </p>
<p>representing the Government of Singapore has said, and I don't<br />
want to enter into any controversy which relates to a civil<br />
servant.<br />
Q. The ANZUS Treaty, Prime ! Ninister, is one which Australians<br />
have grown up with now, and have looked on with great respect,<br />
yet Senator McGovern who is a Presidential candidate, and I<br />
believe has a reasonable chance of winning the Democratic<br />
Presidential nomination, if not the Presidential election, says<br />
that he is going to pull out of ANZUS if ho becomes President.<br />
Where docs that Wcave us?<br />
Pm. First of all you have said he might have a reasonable chance.<br />
There could be disagreements of opinion with you on that score,<br />
but I don't again want to raise the question of United States<br />
politics in Australia. That is their business. And while we are<br />
interested in it, I doubt whether it is a proper matter for me to<br />
be discussing here tonight. This is a Treaty, and treaties in<br />
the United Statcs are part of the suprema law of the l and. We<br />
regard ANZUS as crucially important to use, and I know the<br />
United States Government, as it excists, regards it as crucially<br />
important, too, and I have had assurances from Senator Fulbright,<br />
the Chairman of the Foreign Ro. lations Committee that ho and I<br />
take it he means his Committce, too regard that as a Treaty,<br />
that they will maintain and I have no doubt that they will. So<br />
I cant go any further than that. It is crucially important to<br />
us, respected by the Government of the United States, respected<br />
by at least the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of<br />
the United States.<br />
Q. I am wondering, though, whether it is crucially important to<br />
them and I agree with you about our knowledge of American<br />
politics because we ara not in a position to say who will win the<br />
next Presidential elections, But nevertheless these are<br />
possibilities and I am wondering whcther the Americans generally<br />
are treating the ANZUS pact as strongly as we dc?.<br />
PM. I think you are raising a political problom that is so<br />
hypothetical. that it cannot be poeci~ ely answered. I can say<br />
no more than I have already said that so far as the g~ overnments<br />
of the two countries are concerned, ANTUS will be sustained. We<br />
regard it as crucially important as you know the Labor Party<br />
is backing and filling about it, and nobody really knows where<br />
they stand on the AN7US Treaty.<br />
Q. Prime minister, getting bac! to Malaysia for a moment. How<br />
do you feel about Tun Razak's greater emphasis these days on<br />
greater indepcndence of nations in that area and ASEAN nations?<br />
Pm. I respect his views about noutralisation of the ASEAN theatre,<br />
yes, that is true. But as he has made it clear, and as I have<br />
made it clear, there is no inconsistency between the long-term<br />
objectives of Malaysia and the objectives that we all share in<br />
trying to onsure the peaca, freedom and the independence of<br />
the South-East Asian theatre of Australia and of the other<br />
ASEAN countries. But this question of neutralisation is a long,<br />
long-term project. </p>
<p>Q. Well perhaps five or ten years..... 2<br />
PM: If I could just put it to you.. The idea is to get ten<br />
nations into ASEAN. At present thereare only five, and when<br />
that is done, they have to get guarantees from the three great<br />
powers, and probably back-up from people like ourselves and the<br />
New Zealanders and other countries. In other words, we wouldn't<br />
be conceived of as a recinient of guarantees. We would be<br />
looked at as giving some kind of support like the guarantor<br />
countries.<br />
Q. So you see Australian troops remaining even if this ASEAN<br />
commnunity was expanded<br />
PM: Well, if you use the word " expanded", that is a different<br />
matter. I think thley would probably stay. But if you asked<br />
me to go on for a period of say, five or six years hence, and<br />
this is the time period we are thinking about, it is far too<br />
long to try and speculate about it.<br />
Q. SEATO gets under way on Tuesday in fact I believe you<br />
are opening the SEATO Conference in Canberra?<br />
PM: Yes, I am.<br />
Q. Tgis is confusing these days to Australians. It seems to<br />
be the poor relation to the ANZUS Treaty. Now, what future has<br />
SEATO got, and why do we need the two, Prime Minister<br />
PM: Wbll, you are using emotive words. In the case of ANZUS,<br />
it is only between the United States, New Zealand and ourselves,<br />
and virtually guarantees our inde ' pendence. That is why it is<br />
crucially important to us. The SEATO Treaty relates primarily<br />
to South Vietnam and to Thailand. These are the countries<br />
covered by the Treaty, and it is a treaty that concerns the United<br />
States. The President hims, 2lf has stated that the United States<br />
will keep its treaty obligations, and we would be a peculiar<br />
people if we distrusted the President of the United States at a<br />
time when they have given such unbelievably strong support to<br />
South Vietnam. . and shown their desire that South Vietnam should<br />
remain free and that the neople of that country should have the<br />
right to determine their future. SEATO, I believe has some<br />
value, and while we know it has some 7al I think it is<br />
in the best interest of Australia that it be sustained. I can't<br />
understand those who, recognising that it has some value, would<br />
want to have it destroyed.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, recently a symposium in Me-lbourne, I think<br />
three weeks ago, which was opened by the Foreign Minister, Mr<br />
Bowen, and attended by exports on China, China-watchers and<br />
academics, completely threw out the concept of the y ellow-peril<br />
. and expansionist theories of China, Now, from Mr Bowen's<br />
observation, is the Government changing its views slightly<br />
towards China and that has existed in the past<br />
PM: I think I must put this in two different.., from two<br />
different sx~ ect. to you. First of all, we do want to<br />
normalise our relationships, our diplomatic relationships with<br />
the People's Republic of . i'ina, but we do not want to do that<br />
at the expense of Taiwan. in other words, if we can get an </p>
<p>Pi. accommodation with them which will recognise the present<br />
( cont'dlrelationships between us, we would want to have recognition<br />
with the People's Republic. That is our present position.<br />
Two, we want the People's Republic to become part and parcel<br />
of the world community, and we did take a fairly strong role<br />
at the United Nations, not only to ensure that the People's<br />
Republic became a member of the General Assembly, but that she<br />
also had her seat in the Security Council. That was done,<br />
we voted for them, we wanted them to be there. But that<br />
doesn't mean to say that we are prepared to give up Taiwan<br />
as theprice of getting recognition. Now, we have also in<br />
recent Tonths if I can use words pretty close to those<br />
used by 14x Bowen proceded in a normal way towards trying<br />
to get a better accommodation and to improve the dialogue<br />
hetween the two countries. Un to the moment, we haven't been<br />
successful, but we will cantinu-with our efforts. And we will<br />
do so in a way that we know is to the manifest advantage of<br />
Australia, and we won't pay too big a price in order to<br />
get the kind of accommodation that might otherwise be available.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, what do you mean actually by " accommodation"<br />
and " dialogue"? These are fairly vague terms. Are we actually<br />
talking to representatives of the Peorle's Republic at this<br />
moment or at this time?<br />
PM. We have been talking in various capital cities and once at<br />
the United Nations. We have been talking, yes.<br />
Q. In Paris also?<br />
PM. I don't want to mention which places we have been talking<br />
in, but we have been talking in certain places<br />
Q. Certainly in New York at the United Nations<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
Q. How are we going then Are we progressing more<br />
PM: We are not getting ahead very fast, no. But the People's<br />
Republic, the Gvernment of the People's Republic, knows our<br />
position and they know just how clearly we are expressing<br />
ourselves. In my view, and this applies under current circumstances,<br />
I think you could take it that the ball is now in<br />
their court.<br />
Q. There has been no invitation to an Australian Minister<br />
or no fresh invitation to an Australian Minister<br />
PM: If there ever was one, there was no official invitaion<br />
from the Gvernment itself. It came through sources in Hong<br />
Xong that we could not have regarded as official. Rut since<br />
we have not had any renewed invitation for an Australian inister<br />
to go to Peking.<br />
Q. Or a trade mission<br />
PM: Or a trade mission. </p>
<p>Q. Prime Minister, during your overseas tour it may have<br />
been a little overshadowed, but you made some negotiations,<br />
did you not, with the Government in Djakarta about the pos. 4ibility<br />
of Australianbanks setting up there<br />
PM: Not negotiations no that is not precisely the right<br />
word. I did make enquiries about why there were no Australian<br />
banks having branch associations there. And I was informed that<br />
it was now too late. They would only let twonty-once branches<br />
come in, or figurps of thatI--kind, anyhow. So I then looked at<br />
what could be done. Could we have representative banks and<br />
they said, yes, we could. Our groat hope is that we can<br />
establish representative banks there. They won't be able to carry<br />
out normal banking business, but they will be able to represent<br />
their clients. And I want this to be done because undoubtedly<br />
Indonesia is a country of great natural resourc e. Undoubtedly<br />
its trade prospects will increase, and as they increase so, too,<br />
will ours. So I want to be in the business as soon as we can get<br />
there, and I would like representative banks, even branch banks,<br />
to be established.<br />
Q, Prime Minister, tur:. ing to unemployment and the local<br />
economy now. The unemployment figure for last month must have<br />
been a disappointment to you, particularly when it didn't drop<br />
but it rose. Now what is the answer if this trend continues?<br />
PM. Well, normally in the month that you are talking about it<br />
does rise slightly, and it rose a little more than we wanted<br />
it to or expected it to. As you know, we ever since Mr.<br />
Menzies first established the Government in 1949, have not only<br />
believed in but we have made a reality of the doctrine of full<br />
employment. We have been remarkably successful. But we were<br />
proceeding from a position where we had ovc-rfull employment and<br />
measures had to be taken to control them and above all to control<br />
inflationary pressures. Now unemployment has got a little or<br />
somewhat too high for us. But we have taken action wherever<br />
we have thought it has been necessary. As for example, in<br />
September, again in February at the Premiers' Conference, again<br />
at the Premiers' Conference last week, and in between times<br />
as well, we have taken action in order to give a stimulus to<br />
growth. And as growth proceeds, we hope that it will overcome<br />
the difficulties that we now have relating to unemployment.<br />
But if that isn't enough, then I can assure you we will take<br />
further action. In other words, we will keep to the reality<br />
of a full employment policy.<br />
Q. Isn't it time, Prime Minister, to take it now. There are<br />
something like 70,000 excess over job vacancies, and that is<br />
more than twice what it was this time last year, I believe?<br />
Pm. Well, I can't go into the detailed figures with you but<br />
only last week we injected a massive ': tirnulus into the economy.<br />
So I think we have taken the kind of action you suggested ought<br />
to have been taken.<br />
You think the handouts to the States ./ 9 </p>
<p>PM. I wouldn't call them handouts because they are a reality.<br />
We gave them a big increase in what are called general revenue<br />
grants. We gave special assistance to New South Wales, to<br />
Victoria and to Western Australia, and of course, there is a<br />
flow-on of that to what ar: called the claimant States. We<br />
have increased the amount of money that is available for what<br />
we call the quality of life to give better sewerage facilities,<br />
better hospitalsand better education, and by these means we<br />
hope the stimulus will be sufficient. And I think it is fair of<br />
me to say this, too, to you and to everyone who cares to be<br />
viewing, that the technical exnerts themselves believe that there<br />
is a lot in the pipeline from our past actions and that these<br />
should very soon be making themselves apparent, not only in<br />
growth and demand but in employment.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, prices and wages though, are still going up,<br />
and I am just wondering whether you had discussions with Mr.<br />
Marshall, the New Zealand Prime Minister, when he was here in<br />
relation to the wages and price freeze which they have imposed<br />
for five months and apparently is having quite a deal of success?<br />
Phi. No, I did not. They have a unitary system of government, we<br />
have a federal system. They have the power, we do not have the<br />
power. But I think you should understand this and I want<br />
every person in Australia to understand this that our problem<br />
is one mainly associated with wage increases in excess of our<br />
production or productive capacity. And if those wage increases<br />
become excessive, then there is very little that you can do in<br />
order to restrain inflationary influences. As well as that,<br />
with industrial trouble, with the strikes we are having, with the<br />
powerful unions operating outside the arbitration system, of<br />
course this compounds the problem for us. So what we are doing,<br />
whenever we get the chance is to appear before the Commission, or<br />
if we can't appear before the Commission, we do our best to try<br />
and bring it before them and see if we can reduce the industrial<br />
anarchy, if we can try and keep some restraining hand on<br />
excessive wage increases, which are the basis of all our problems.<br />
Q. I am wondering whether our system is right? It is almost<br />
like the dog chasing its tail. Unless you can teg the two<br />
because as soon as you get a wage increase, up goes prices.....<br />
PM. I deny that it is a case of the dog chasing its<br />
tail. Basically, it stems from the fact that there are excessive<br />
wage increases, and I think anyone with an elementary knowledge<br />
of economics knows that once you get wage increases that are<br />
in excess of productivity, you must necessarily have an<br />
inflationary impact, although it might be over a period of time<br />
before it shows itself. So first of all, we have got to get wage<br />
increases, or average earnings increases under control. This<br />
is basic, and I believe that the Commonwealth Government is doing<br />
all in its Constitutional and legal power to try and keep these<br />
increases under restraint.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, I want to talk about the Budget for the moment<br />
and ask whether you are going to loosen the purse strings there.<br />
But on April 7 at a oress briefing in Canberra, you mentioned<br />
fourteen categories of policies. </p>
<p>Q. You said," We believe public opinion will best be served by not<br />
cont. being hesitant in letting the public know what we think and why."<br />
That was after a Liberal Party meeting. The categories were<br />
the economy, development, defence, foreign affairs, quality of<br />
life, urban development, arbitration, the law, national health,<br />
national goals, education, social welfare and rural matters.<br />
Now, have you really hit hard in each of those categories with<br />
the strong policies that you promised to?<br />
Pill. In most of them we have, yes. And you can tell tonight<br />
what I have said about defence as to whether we are precise and<br />
definite and know where we are going. The Lalbor Party doesn't.<br />
Immigration, there is no doubt. Education, we took action<br />
shortly after I made that statement to show what we are prepared<br />
to do, not only for government, but for independent schools as<br />
well. So we are prepared to take action as and when we think it<br />
is necessary and as and when we think it is in the public interest.<br />
And we give our reasons why. And the most recent example, and<br />
the one I think shows just how quickly -we will act, is the way<br />
in which we treated the Premiers at the recent Premiers'<br />
Conference and Loan Council. That shows decisiveness of action.<br />
That shows that we are prepared to do what we think is right,<br />
and as I said a few moments ago, if we think more action is<br />
needed, I can assure you we w~ ill take it.<br />
Q. In the Budget?<br />
PM. Yes, in the Budget or wherever else it happens to be. Before<br />
the Budget if it was necessary.<br />
Q. Perhaps with a decrease in personal income tax?<br />
PM. No, I wouldn't speculate about details of the Budget at all.<br />
In fact, I think any person who did that is, I think, doing a<br />
disservice to the community. I believe it would be improper and<br />
wrong. I certainly won't do it and won't make any forecasts.<br />
Q. The 35-hour week, Prime Minister, is gathering quite a deal<br />
of momentum now. Do you concede that it does have merit in somFe<br />
areas where it could help unemplov~ nent?<br />
I'M. I don't think it will hel unemplovmient. In fact, I believe,<br />
that the 35-hour w.-ck, going over too wide a range of the economy<br />
will create even greater problems for us than we have at the<br />
moment. That applies particularly to inflationary pressures,<br />
and the danger that inflation itself can cost us out of<br />
international markets and create the probabilities or the<br />
Dossibilities of unemployment. This is a point that I want to<br />
keep on making. But I don't want to go too far about the<br />
week at the moment because it is now before the Arbitration<br />
Commission. I think that is the proper place where our arguments<br />
should be put. I finish what I have to say on this, on this note.<br />
I want every woman and every man in this community to know that<br />
if we had a 35-hour week it would undoubtedly reduce production,<br />
it would undoubtedly raise prices to a vcry high level, and would<br />
create very severe problems for us in the future. This is the<br />
biggest difficulty we face at the moment, and we will do all in<br />
our power to try and restrain those inflationary pressures. / 11 </p>
<p>11.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, what is ha-pening to the taxation review?<br />
PM. The taxation review? We have decided upon it. We are now<br />
waiting to get a panel of names from whom we can choose the people<br />
who will make up the Commission.<br />
Q. National superannuation?<br />
PM. National superannuation is a matter that we have been giving<br />
a lot of consideration to, but we have not yet come to any<br />
conclusions about it.<br />
Q. So they are a couple of those policy areas we mentioned<br />
that are still handing.....?<br />
PM. Well one isn't a policy area at all. One is choosing the<br />
personnel, and we haven't had the amount of success we would like<br />
in getting the people we want on it. But the Treasurer, I believe<br />
is getting close to the stage where he can make a decision. On<br />
the other issue of policy, that is a matter that I personally<br />
believe has to be looked at in a wide context of fiscal policy<br />
and what we might think about even in the long term.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, I would like to quickly turn now, because<br />
time is going to be our enemy, to the French nuclear tests.<br />
Australians feel, generally, that they are behind New Zealand in<br />
taking steps here to prevent these French nuclear tests. Now we<br />
were a little bit slow in the United Nations meeting on the<br />
environment in Europe, and I am wondering whether you feel we<br />
couldn't be taking a more positive approach on these tests.<br />
PM. Well, I believe that we came in a little, a very little,<br />
slowly at Stockholm. But I would like to emphasise thiis to you<br />
since 1963, we have been a party to the Partial nuclear Test Ban<br />
Treaty, and we have objected whenever we have had the power to<br />
do so, the opportunity to do so. We have objected to<br />
atmospheric nuclear tests, and we have always strongly objected<br />
to the atmosoheric tests of the French, and we led the way. We<br />
are a party to the non-proliferation treaty the Nuclear Non-<br />
Proliferation Treaty we initialled the agreement. And since I<br />
have been back, I personally have taken a very strong attitude.<br />
We have made representations to the Conference on Disarmament now<br />
sitting in Geneva. I personally took to task the French<br />
Ambassador when he raised this matter at the opening of the<br />
nuclear facility just outside Sydney a few days aco. I believe<br />
that we have taken sensible action, but I am not satisfied because I<br />
do not believe that it is proper or right that France should<br />
explode nuclear devices in the atmosphere in the Pacific theatre.<br />
And we are now considering what more we can do. I have only today,<br />
and yesterday, becn discussing this with the officials and also<br />
with my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. 3ut we<br />
want to act rationally, we want to act sensibly, we want them<br />
stopped, but we want to act simultaneously in the interests of<br />
this country.<br />
Q. What sort of actions have you been considering, Prime Minister? / 12 </p>
<p>12.<br />
PM. I don't think it is right that I should speculate on those<br />
because I don't think it is right to create false expectations,<br />
and I certainly will not do so.<br />
Q. But you intend to take further action with the French<br />
Government?<br />
PM. I have written to President Pompidou asking him to stop<br />
these tests, and he has replied saying that it is impossible, that<br />
he willnot do) so. ' Where we will ao from there I will not<br />
speculate now, but I will certainly be taking up more with my<br />
colleague s.<br />
Q. You have ruled, out, I suppose, the suggestion of a group., f<br />
Ministers that we ought to oput.... .( inaudible)<br />
PM. I have not ruled it out, but I don't regard it as a<br />
prospect that would icad to success. I believe the one real<br />
prospect is to mobilise world opinion, and with the New Zealanders<br />
wie are doing what we can to mobilise world opinion. This is the<br />
best, this is the wisest course to follow and we keep on letting<br />
the French know where we stand and we hope to draw others in with<br />
US.<br />
Q. What do you think of Dr. Cairns wanting to sail in with the<br />
" Esmeralda" into the<br />
PM. That is spectacular but it would have no useful effect.<br />
Q. Can you take any steps or would you, to stop the parachutiestS<br />
who at this time, anyway, are scheduled to fly out tomorrow<br />
morning according to them?<br />
Pm. My latest advice, F-2 this was given to me within the course<br />
of ten minutes prior to the time when I camne here, is that nobody<br />
yet has asked or suggested to us that it should be done, and<br />
certainly no-one has presented to us a fl~ ight plan. Although<br />
we have reason to believe that it Mi ght hapen soon, but until<br />
that happens, again I believe it is speculative. Without<br />
discussion with my colleagues, I couldn't make a statement about it.<br />
Q. Let's turn to~ the Federal elections now, cnming up in<br />
November. Today's Sunday Press says that they are expecting<br />
you to reshuffle your Federal Cabinet before that comes about and<br />
that Mr. Bowen could be going to the High Court and also you will<br />
have to find a Minister to take over in London. Now is this a<br />
possibility, a reshuffle before the elections?<br />
PM. I read the article in a Sydney paper. It is totally false.<br />
I have not considered, and I have no intention of considering<br />
a reshuffle before the next elections. None at all.<br />
Q. Will Mr. Bowen be standing for his seat at the next elections?<br />
PM. I hope so.<br />
Q. Has he talked to you about T-hrcthor he may wish to stand down?<br />
/ 13 </p>
<p>13/<br />
PM. I wouldn't talk about confidential discussions between<br />
any colleague on any subject whatsoever. But I have said,<br />
answering that newspaper article, that I have not contemplated<br />
a reshuffle before the election, and I won't do so.<br />
Q. And Sir Reginald Swartz.....?<br />
PM. Sir Reginald Swartz is like me. He loves the place and<br />
wouldn't leave.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, there has been a call.... I would like to<br />
turn to social services now there has been a call for a Royal<br />
Commission such as New Zealand had into social services and<br />
poverty. What is the possibility of such an enquiry in Australia<br />
at Federal level?<br />
PM. On social services and poverty?<br />
Q. Yes.<br />
PM. My own belief is that on social services and poverty it is<br />
up to the Government to find out what is wrong and when it knows<br />
what is wrong, or when it even regards there are difficulties,<br />
to solve them itself. And that is my attitude and I believe it<br />
is the one we will take. And I think you could take it if you<br />
look at our social services policies, ever since we have been a<br />
Government way back since 1949, you can take it that we have<br />
always been anxious to ensure that there is a continuing increase<br />
in the purchasing power of the pension and we have always<br />
widened the scope of our social service payments. This will<br />
remain our policy. I can say no more about it at the moment,<br />
because this is a Budget matter, one of the matters that has to<br />
be kept for the Budget and I don't want to have it thought that<br />
I am in any way at all compromising the attitude of the Treasurer<br />
or the Minister for Social Services in the presentation.<br />
8, Health and dental... these seem to be two areas that we<br />
don't seem to be making much progress in. These costs are going<br />
up and particularly dental fees are getting completely beyond the<br />
average man in the street now. Is some consideration being given<br />
here, in this area?<br />
PM. Well we established the Kerr Committee, and Mr. Justice<br />
Kerr was superseded by Mr. Justice Mason of the Supreme Court of<br />
New South Wales. And he made recommendations relating to the<br />
common fee in New South Wales; We adooted those. We increased the<br />
Commonwealth contribution to the common fee in all States, and<br />
we did that because we regard the health of the person who is<br />
sick as of paramount importance. They will not have to pay any<br />
additional part of that fee. We will pay it. But what we hope<br />
to ensure is that a much larger percentage of the population will<br />
be covered by the common fee than hitherto. And we have been<br />
talking to the Australian Medical Association, the AMA, in order<br />
to see if we can ensure that they will be the authority throughout<br />
Australia for the fixation of fees. If we can ensure that this<br />
done, I can assure you that we will have much greater prospects<br />
of success with the National Health Scheme, whether of medical or<br />
of hospital benefits. / 14 </p>
<p>A A 14.<br />
Q. Incorporating dental?<br />
PM. No. No, we have not looked at the problem of bringing<br />
the dental services under the medical health scheme.<br />
Q. On a more personal note, Prime Minister, it is about three<br />
months since we last saw you, and you are still lonking fairly<br />
fit. How many hours a day would you work?<br />
PM. Oh, I suppose about ten. I work pretty consistently. I<br />
don't have very much etertainment, but I would imagine it would<br />
be at least ten a day. But you can't tell, you see<br />
Q. What time do you get up, and what time do you normally get<br />
to bed, in an average day?<br />
PM. I get up probably.... I wake up round about six o'clock and<br />
do some personal thinking between say six and seven. I get home<br />
probably anything between half past eleven I am talking now<br />
when I am in Canberra or if I am at home then I would work<br />
until half past eleven, till round about twelve or one, sometimes<br />
a little bit later, but that is probably a normal routine.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, you have denied the Federal reshuffle. I am<br />
wondering if you win the next election you will, of course,<br />
have to form a new Cabinet whether you would consider inviting<br />
Mr. Gorton back into the Ministry?<br />
Pm. Don't tempt me to answer questions that are extremely<br />
difficult to answer and are hypothetical. I wouldn't answer that<br />
sort of a question, but in any event, so far as Mr. Gorton is<br />
concerned, I refuse to discuss him in public because I don't<br />
think it is proper.<br />
Q. 1ow do you feel about the Government's fortunes at the moment?<br />
Are you still glad it is a few months to ge before the next<br />
election?<br />
PM. Yes, I am, but what I can say I can make two comments.<br />
First of all, we are doing all we can, and I believe we are<br />
administering not only the economy, but the Government pretty<br />
effectively under what have been in my view the most difficult set<br />
of circumstances i can remember in all my experience of government.<br />
So with all the difficulties, I think we are doing pretty well.<br />
And I will have no hestitatinn whatsoever in any administrative<br />
theatre, whether it haopens to be, say Papua/ New Guinea, whether<br />
it be medical health and social services, whether it happens to<br />
be the exchange rates, whether it happens to be in urban<br />
development, " or urban renewal. In all these matters, we will<br />
give the closest attention, and pretty devoted attention, too.<br />
And I hope by the time the election comes round, we will be able<br />
to get the approval of the Australian reople, and carry on in the<br />
way we have carried on since R. G. Menzies won power for us<br />
in 1949.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, thark you very much for appearing on<br />
" This Week". </p>
