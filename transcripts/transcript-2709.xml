EMBARGOED UNTIL 6P. M., SUNDAY 5 NOVEMBER<br />
FOR PRESS: PM. No. 94/ 1972<br />
PENSION AGREEMENT WITH ITALY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon.<br />
William McMahon, C. H. MP.<br />
Agreement has been reached between the Australian and Italian<br />
Governments to allow Australian pensioners to continue to receive<br />
their pensions while in Italy.<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr McMahon, announcing this today, said<br />
the agreement applied equally to people born in Australia and those<br />
born overseas, but it was expected to be especially welcomed by<br />
older people who wished to return to or visit their country of birth<br />
after living many years in Australia.<br />
Mr McMahon said the agreement applied to age, invalid and<br />
widows' pensions. In many cases Australian pensions would be paid<br />
after a person had lived in Australia for twenty years. However,<br />
where the person became an invalid or widow pensioner while living<br />
in Australia, this twenty year period would not apply.<br />
Corresponding Italian pensions can already be paid in Australia.<br />
The Prime Minister said the agreement would add to the already<br />
strong relations between Italy and Australia. The two countries<br />
would look at the possibility of extending reciorocity into other<br />
areas of social services in the future.<br />
Mr McMahon also announced that reciprocal agreements on<br />
P~ ension portability also had been reached with the Governments of<br />
Greece, Turkey and Malta.<br />
In each case Australian pensioners would be able to live in<br />
these countries and continue to receive pensions, and pensioners from<br />
these countries coLld continue to receive their homeland pension if<br />
they came to Australia.<br />
