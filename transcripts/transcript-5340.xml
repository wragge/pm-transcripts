EMBARGOED UN4TIL DELIVERY 
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, MAY 4 1980<br />
OPENING OF THE YESHIVA PRIMARY SCHOOL<br />
Thank you for inviting me to share with you the opening of<br />
your new school. I am deeply honoured to be involved in what is a<br />
most important day in the history of this school, the Yeshiva<br />
organisation in particular, and Sydney Jewry in general.<br />
That you have named your school, " Yeshiva" is significant.<br />
For " Yeshiva" carries with it the ancient idea of learning and<br />
the snread of knowledge, so important to the Jewish-community.<br />
And the Yeshiva, by its dedication to the study of the Talmud<br />
and Rabbinic literature, continues directly the academic<br />
traditions of early Palestine and Babylonia.<br />
Because of these strong links with the deeper past, the Yeshiva<br />
is able to ensure the continuing and future strength of the<br />
JeWish community.<br />
A strong Jewish community derives its strength f rom the<br />
value of the fundamental Principles of Judaism. These are<br />
especially important to-young people. They help Promote<br />
individual development and demonstrate to young people the<br />
importance of their family and the wider community of which they<br />
are members. And this community is enriched through the continued<br />
growth of the Jewish tradition,<br />
The influence of that tradition has been felt in Australia since<br />
its foundation. Since then, Jews have participated conspicuously<br />
in the life and development of Australia as a multicultural society.<br />
Some have been renowned for their contribution.<br />
I need only remined you of Sir Isaac Isaacs our first Australian<br />
born Governor-General and the present distinguished occupant of<br />
that office, Sir Zelman Cowen.<br />
Your community and this school play a vital role in the furtherance<br />
of this great tradition within the Australian nation.<br />
Australia has a deep appreciation of the fact that these traditions<br />
have been forged through thousands of years and countless struggles<br />
for independence in the pursuit of values and beliefs. These<br />
struggles regrettably continue today. Jewish people are still<br />
discrimt~ inated against in the Soviet Union, and their rights as<br />
people are suppressed. This only serves to highlight the increasing<br />
imoortCance of Israel as a homeland; a dream achieved; a hope<br />
fulfilled. It also emphasises the importance of countries like<br />
Australia where there is an acceptance and a welcome for all people;<br />
especially those of Jewish faith. who have done so much for Australia. </p>
<p>-2<br />
Be assured that Jewish people, their customs, their traditions,<br />
their religion and their practices will always be welcome in<br />
Australia. We prosper through your contributions to our community<br />
and we enjoy your company as proud Australians.<br />
Your role in-the community, emphasises the -acceptance and<br />
encouragement of diversity in the Australian way of life.<br />
This is -not* a . country. where we, expect everyone to -be the-same-<br />
Wle believe we. are a better, more tolerant and more mature<br />
nation bec~ use ouir -people have come from* ma~ y' lands and from<br />
* many . different backgrounds.<br />
* And. the Jewisb icommunity. playsa proud -part in -the successes<br />
tha't come from our diversity.<br />
For us all.; the decade has opened in an atmosphere of international<br />
concern. The Middle East is the focus of that concern. The<br />
difficlilties involving-and su-rrounding the strength and survival<br />
of the state of Israel; the Soviet invasion of Atghanistan;<br />
the illegal detention of American hostages in Iran; the threat<br />
that all this poses to oil supplies for industrialised countries.;<br />
all these cast shadows of turmoil and unpredictability over the<br />
Middle East.<br />
The minds of world leaders are centred upon these problems,<br />
Our hope is that they will secure practical and peaceful<br />
solutions to these grave and threatening crises.<br />
Against this background, the links between our nations have<br />
stood the test of time. In 1948, Australia was one of the<br />
strong supporters of the creation of the state of Israel.<br />
And we remain absolutely committed to its continuation within<br />
secure and recognised borders.<br />
Within this context, we welcome the Camp David agreements<br />
as providing a constructive framework for progress towards<br />
peace in the Middle East. And I knqw that with these-new<br />
facilities, your school, by educating the children who pass<br />
through it in the long tradition of Yeshiva, will carry on<br />
serving, not only the Jewish community, but also our wider<br />
Australian community.<br />
In this way, education at this school will be an education<br />
enriched with the truths of the past and will be, for its<br />
fortunate students, education for life. Of course, it is ' in the<br />
home that the most formative part of our education begins. It is<br />
the family, to which the young child first looks for love and<br />
approval; for heJlp, encouragement, inspiration and for rules.<br />
I stronglybelieve children need to know, and want to know,<br />
what is permissible and what is not. Families who believe<br />
they can ' raise children in an environment devoid of rules -risk<br />
the moral development of their children and their capacity<br />
to adjust successfully to the demands of an adult world.<br />
There is no doubt that the family model will always be the<br />
basis for a child'Is learning. It is the home,' together with the<br />
school, which provides the basis for a constructive, usef uland fulf illi<br />
life in the world. This is especially so today when many<br />
families lack the expertise and many of the experiences needed<br />
to prepare a child fully for the complex world outside the family<br />
unit. </p>
<p>-3<br />
That is why a school such as this is important. Not only is it<br />
small enough for every child to have the scope and opportunity<br />
to contribute to its life. But also, because schools must<br />
offer young people a stance for life, it is important for<br />
children to absorb at school values and standards which complement<br />
those they lea x~ n at home.<br />
I know this happens here and I commend particularly the efforts<br />
of the staff, some of which are voluntary, all of which provide<br />
a stimulating and enriching environment in which the attitudes<br />
arnd values of those in their care are nurtured and developed.<br />
This occasion is an especially happy one, because this successful<br />
building project has come from past disappointments. Today's<br />
opening serves as a reminder that schools such as this cannot<br />
operate without the support of an active, caring community, and<br />
the very welcome generosity of philanthropists.<br />
Just as the generosity of Mr. and Mrs. Rabinovitch in earlier<br />
years enabled a dream to become a reality, so the generosity<br />
of Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Brender and Mr. Sam Moss now enables<br />
Yeshiva to continue anid to grow. The substantial donations from<br />
Mr. and Mrs. Brender and Mr. Moss, together with the Government's<br />
grant of some $ 200,000 made through the Schools Commission, have<br />
enabled this school to be built.<br />
And it is indeed a tribute to your community that through the<br />
individual and parental involvement of its mnembers, this . I<br />
Yeshiva college is now-a reality. Too often, some members of<br />
our coimmunity expect everything to be provided by governments,<br />
at the taxpayers' exp-ense-. Yet today is proof that it is through<br />
community effort, and through involvement and hard work from<br />
individual people that progress in society is most often achieved<br />
and rewards we gain in life are often the most satisfying.<br />
Of course, here, where commnunity effort has been clearly<br />
demonstrated, the Government has been pleased to help<br />
Yeshiva Primary School to be built. Where government assistance<br />
Promotes diversity, it confirms the Government's commitment to the<br />
concept of choice in education, and to the diversification in range<br />
and type of educational institutions available to the community.<br />
In 1970, the Government initiated Federal involvement in the<br />
funding for non-government schools through the principle of<br />
direct Commonwealth per capita grants. Since that time the<br />
operating costs of Rabinovitch Yeshiva College have been<br />
significantly offset by grants by the Commonwealth Government.<br />
This support has continued and extended through other Commonwealth<br />
programmes administered by the Schools Commission. Rabinovitch<br />
Yeshiva has also benefitted, for example, since 1975 from library<br />
and equipment grants.<br />
The young people who are already enjoying the benefits provided<br />
by this school and its facilities are well placed to face, along<br />
with others of their age, a future of challenge and change.<br />
That is why, in developing a capacity in our young people to<br />
respond adequately to both of these, we need always to keep in<br />
mind what we are seeking to achieve through eduacation., / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Certainly, expertise in science, or maths, or literature,<br />
are valid objectives of our educational prograrmme, but they<br />
are merely rungs on the educational ladder, not the ladder itself.<br />
An educated person is someone who has benefitted from what he<br />
has been taught. He has a knowledge and a sense of a role In<br />
society for all of life, not just of adolescence or vocational<br />
And if modern education is to weather the attacks against<br />
it, its products must be able to demonstrate rationality,<br />
skills, knowledge, attitudes, spiritual strength and principles,<br />
and the ability to put all of these to the right use.<br />
Education then, is not a mass of learning, but an understanding<br />
ofL' the use that can be -made of the learning that takes place<br />
in our schools. Because that is so, we need to replace blind.<br />
t1-rust in any sort of education by a search for the best kind of<br />
education.<br />
This will involve an understanding that our children must encounter<br />
training which will enable them to live in our community; to<br />
recognise their responsibilities; to widen their symnpathies;<br />
and to find out what their duty is towards their neighbour.<br />
This school is uniquely placed to contribute to this process.<br />
I that it is inspired by the principle that a responsible<br />
citlzen is not one who single-mnindedly pursues his own interests<br />
al~ one; but ra t~ rr one who shows a concern for the well-being of<br />
others in his attempts to make the world a better place,<br />
While such values guide what you do at Yeshiva<br />
Sc'-ool, schools of this kind will serve well the community of<br />
the fEuture and help impart to young people the living traditions<br />
of the Jew . ish culture and faith. The traditions are some of<br />
the oldest, warmest and deepest in our society, being based on<br />
the family, on tolerance and on community service.<br />
The preservation of these traditions builds, maintains and<br />
strengthens the legacy of our ancestors. It is all too often<br />
forgotten that our national identity, our drive for a secure<br />
place in the world, lies in the lessons all our peoples have<br />
acauired in their histories.<br />
To ensure our future, we must draw on the experience of all those<br />
how have chosen to make Australia their home. I congratulate<br />
our Jewish schools on their important contribution to the vital<br />
task of the preservation of your heritage.<br />
This school's strong ties with time-tested traditions, coupled<br />
to the support you have from all sections of Sydney's Jewish<br />
community, well enable Yeshiva Primary School to prosper while<br />
meeting the educational challenges of the 80' s and beyond.<br />
It gives me great pleasure to declare Yeshiva Primary School open. </p>
