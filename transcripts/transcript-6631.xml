EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERYZ CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
j. AUSTRALIA , l-<br />
FOR MEDIA 27 MAY 1965<br />
CPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER FOR ALP FUNCTION, REGENT HOTEL,<br />
SYDNEY THANK YOU LIONEL. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, FRIENDS:<br />
IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK HERE IN SYDNEY, AND IT'S GOOD TO BE<br />
ADDRESSING SUCH A FAMILIAR GATHERING. IT'S REFRESHING<br />
AFTER A RIGOROUS SESSION OF PARLIAMENT TO GET OUT IN THE<br />
WORLD AGAIN. THIS IS THE SIXTH OF THESE NEW SOUTH WALES<br />
LABOR PARTY DINNERS THAT I HAVE ADDRESSED SINCE BECOMING<br />
PRIME MINISTER JUST OVER TWO YEARS AGO. IT'S BECOMING<br />
SOMETHING OF A REGULAR EVENT FOR ME.<br />
IT'S AN ESPECIALLY PLEASING FEELING TO ATTEND THESE<br />
FUNCTIONS, IF ONLY BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY OF YOU HERE<br />
TONIGHT WHO ARE NOT NORMALLY -E SORT OF PEOPLE WE WOULD<br />
EXPECT TO SEE AT LABOR PARTY GATHERINGSo I BELIEVE IT<br />
SAYS A LOT ABOUT THE CHARACTER OF OUR GOVERNMENT THAT<br />
ITS POLICIES DO FIND SUPPORT AMONGST PEOPLE liN AREAS<br />
OUTSIDE THOSE TRADITIONALLY CONSIDERED THE DOMAIN OF THE<br />
LABOR PAR'IY.<br />
AND IT SAYS A LOT THAT SO MANY OF YOU ARE INTERESTED<br />
ENOUGH TO TURN OUT FOR US SO REGWl,, ARLYT-;'<br />
ERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR THIS. NOT THE LEAST<br />
OF THEM BELIEVE IS THE BRAND OF OUR ECONOMIC POLIC! ES,<br />
AND THE CONSISTENC'Y WITH WHICH WE HAVE APPLIED THEM OVER<br />
THE LAST TWO YEARS.<br />
WE HAVE ADOPTED POLICIES AND WE HAVE STUCK BY THEM. I<br />
BELIEVE WE HAVE BROUGHT AN ORIGINAL APPROACH TO<br />
GOVERNME NT IN THAI' NOT ONLY HAVE WE APPLIED OUR POLICIES<br />
CONSISTENTLY, BUT THEY HAVE BEEN BASED IN A COHERENT,<br />
LONG-TERM STRATEGY. IHE PLAN SPELT OUT BY THE PRICES<br />
AND INCOMES ACCORD AND ELABORATED BY THE ECONOMIC SUMMIT<br />
IN APRIL 1983, HAS PROVIDED A FRAMEWORK AND A CERTAINTY,<br />
AND A VEHICLE FOR HARNESSING THE CO-OPERATION OF ALL<br />
SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY. </p>
<p>2<br />
WE KNEW WHEN WE CAME TO OFFICE THAT THE ROAD AHEAD WAS<br />
GOING TO BE HARD-WE CAME IN ACCEPTING THAT MAN4Y<br />
UNPOPULAR DECISIONS HAD TO BE MADE. AND WE HAVE MADE<br />
THEM-WE HAVE NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM THE ACTION WE<br />
CONSIDER IS IN THE LONG TERM INTERESTS OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
NO DOUBT THERE ARE MANY MORE DECISIONS AHEAD OF us. BUT<br />
OUR RECORD IN TAKING THE ACTION WE BELIEVE IS IN<br />
AUSTr'ZALIA'S LONGER TERM INTERESTS IS A SIGNIFICANr<br />
REASON WHY WE HAVE ENJOYED AND, I BELIEVE, WE WILL<br />
CONTINUE TO ENJOY, BROAD COMMUNITY SUPPORT FOR OUR<br />
PROGRAMS. I DON'T HAVE TO TEIL YOU THAT GOVERNMENT IS NEVER EASY<br />
SAILING. GOVERNMENT WITH INTEGRITY AND CONSISTENCY,<br />
THOUGH, IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULTWHEN<br />
WE CAME TO OFFICE, WE PROMISED THE PEOPLE OF<br />
AUSTRALIA THREE THINGS RECONCILIATION, RECOVERY, AND<br />
RECONSTRUCTION-WE HAVE RECONCILED AUSTRALIANS.<br />
RECOVERY IS UNDERWAY. AND NOW WE AIRE BEGINNING THE<br />
PHASE OF FUNDAMENTAL, LONG TERM IMPORTANCE OF<br />
RECONSTRUCTION. THESE INVOLVE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES TO<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY.<br />
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE ELECTORAL DANGERS IN MAJOR CHAN4GE<br />
TO AREAS ur: ECONO0MIC AND SOCIAL POLICY-WE WERE TOLD<br />
THERE WERE DANGERS IN THE FLOAT OF THE DOLLAR-WE WERE<br />
TOLD THERE WERE DANGERS ABOUT FREEING UP THE FINANCIAL<br />
SYSTEM. BUT IF YOU TAKE THE N4EXT STEP FROM THAT POINT<br />
OF ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THERE ARE DANGERS IN4 CHANGE AND<br />
THEN SHY AWAY FROM THEM, THEN YOU AIRE DENYING THE PROPER<br />
ROLE AND FUNCTION OF GOVERNMENT.<br />
THE PROPER ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IS TO PERCEIVE WHAT IS<br />
HAPPENING IN4 THE ECONOMY, HOW IT AFFECTS THE ECONOMY,<br />
AND HOW IT AFFECTS SOCIETY: AND IF YOU SEE THAT<br />
SOM;.: TINIG IS OPERATING BADLY AN4D IT NEEDS CHANGE, THEN<br />
IF YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT GOOD GOVERNMENT YOU WORK OUT<br />
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND YOU DO IT-BUT THE ESSENCE OF<br />
REFORM IS NJOT SIMPLY FORCING CHANGETHESE<br />
CHANGES HAVE TO BE ACCEPTED, AND FOR THAT THEY<br />
HAVE TO BE UNDERSTOOD. THEY HAVE TO BE REAL, BUT THEY<br />
CANNOT OVERWHELM. THEY MUST BE GRADUAL AND THEY MUST BE<br />
SEEN TO BE FAIR-FAIRNESS IS ONE REASON WHY I BELIEVE<br />
OUR MAY ECONOMIC STATEMENT WAS SO WELL RECEIVEDGOVERNMENTS<br />
MUST. ACKNOWLEDGE IN THE PROCESS OF CHAN4GE<br />
AND REFORM, IN SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC TERMS THAT THERE NEED<br />
TO BE COMPENSATING MECHAIISMS WHICH PROTECT VULNERABLE<br />
GROUPS-</p>
<p>3<br />
BUT WE REJECT COMPLETELY AND ABSOLUTELY THE PHILOSOPHY<br />
WHICH TOO OFTEN MARKED THE STYLE OF OUR CONSERVATIVE<br />
PREDECESSORS IN GOVERNt1E. IT. THEY WOULD LOOK AT AN ISSUE<br />
AND SAY, " GEE, THERE'IS A DANGER THERE-PUT IT AWAY.<br />
ITS TOO HARD-"<br />
EVERY TIME A PROBLEM ISSUE WOULD ARISE, THE COALITION<br />
PARTIES WOULD WORK THEIR WAY AROUND IT, ONLY TO PUT<br />
ASIDE A LONG TERM SOLUTION IN FAVOUR OF A SOFT OPTION,<br />
BECAUSE THAT WAS THE SAFEST WAY OUT IN THE IMMEDIATE<br />
TERM. THAT IS AS DISHONEST AS IT IS INTELLECTUALLY<br />
BANKRUPT. THE LIBERAI. S HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE PARTY OF<br />
SOFT OPTIONS, MANIPULATED BY THE PROPPED-UP AGRARIAN<br />
FEATHERBEDDERS OF THE 1NATIONAL PARTY.<br />
WE HAVE HEARD A LOT OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS ABOUT THE<br />
NEW WAVE OF " 1DRIES" I SEIZING THE COALITION PARTIES. BUTWE<br />
HEARD THA T YEARS AGO WHEN THEY WERE IN GOVERNMENT.<br />
THEIR ACTION JUST IN THE LAST WEEK ro WATER DOWN OUR<br />
REFORM OF THE DAIRY INDUSTRY IS PROOF THAT THE OLD-TIME,<br />
BLINKERED MCEWENISM STILL CONTROLS THESE PARTIES WHEN IT<br />
COMES TO A CRUN1CH ISSUETHE<br />
FACT IS THAT EVERY GOVERNMENT HAS ITS PROBLEMS. BUT<br />
THE KEY TO GOOD GOVERNMENT IS NOT TO TAKE THE STOP-GAP.,<br />
QUICK-FIX SOLUTIONS. GOVERNMEN'T MUST BE ABOUT FOLLOWING<br />
COHERENT STRATEGIES FOR LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS HC<br />
TRANSCEND MOMENTARY PRESSURESWE<br />
INHERITED GOVERNMENT AT A TIME OF SIGNIFICANT<br />
ECONOMIC INSTABILITY-OUR METHODS IN TACKLING THESE<br />
PROBLEMS OF SPENDING, OF UNEMPLOYMENT, OF INFLATION,<br />
OF THE WORST RECESSION SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION IS<br />
PROBABLY O1NE OF THE REASONS WHY MANY-O. F YOU ARE HERE<br />
TONI GHTOUR<br />
SUCCESSES ARE SELF-EVIDENTIN<br />
TWO SHORT YEARS, OUR INFLATION RATE HAS BEEN<br />
REDUCED SUBSTANTIALLYECONOMIC GROWTH HAS BEEN-. STRONG AND A FIRM BASIS<br />
EXISTS FOR CONTIN4UED GROWTH. AUSTRALIA'S GROWTH<br />
DURING THE FIRST TWO FINANCIAL YEARS OF LABOR WILL<br />
AT LEAST MATCH THAT ACHIEVED DURING THE ENTIRE<br />
SEVEN YEARS OF THE FRASER ADMINISTRATIONBUSINESS<br />
AND, CONSUMER SPENDING ARL EXPANDING.<br />
REAL UNIT LABOUR COSTS HAVE FALLEN TO THE LEVELS OF<br />
THE EARLY ' 70' s A~ ND PROFITS HAVE IMPROVED<br />
DRAMATICALLY. </p>
<p>THE ACCORD HAS BROUGHT INDUSTRIAL DISPUTATION DOWN<br />
TO VERY LOW LEVELSABOVE<br />
ALL, OUR POLICIES HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTWHEN<br />
WE CAME TO OFFICE, THERE WAS A REAL NEED FOR<br />
ECONOMIC STIMULUS TO PULL THE ECONOMY OUT OF KECESSION<br />
INTO THE INITIAL STAGES OF RECOVERY AND TO PRODUCE JOBSBUT<br />
WE ALSO RECOGN SED THE CENTRAL ROLE IN OUR ECONOMY<br />
OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR, AND THAT ANY LASTING AND<br />
SUSTAINABLE RECOVERY HAD TO BE BASED ON PRIVATE SECTOR<br />
GROWTH. WE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT FOLLOWING THE INITIAL<br />
STIMULUS, WE HAD TO PULL BACK BY REDUCING OUR OWN<br />
DEMANDS ON THE CAPITAL MARKET, TO ALLOW ROOM FOR THE<br />
PRIVATE SECTOR TO TAKE OVER. WE HAVE DONE THAT. iHE<br />
PRIVATE SECTOR IS TAKING OVER THE RECOVERYWE<br />
FOLLOWED UP THIS YEAR'S CUT IN THE DEFICIT WITH THE<br />
$ 1.2 BILLION CUTS ANNOUNCED IN OUR MAY 114 ECONOMIC<br />
STATEM'ENT-WE WILL CONTINUE THE PROCESS IN THE BUDGET<br />
IN AUGUST. OUR FISCAL POLICY IS FOLLOWING THE PATH<br />
DESIGNATED FOR IT WHEN WE CAME TO OFFICE-IT IS A<br />
TANGIBLE DEMONSTRATION OF THE CONSISTENCY AND COHERENCE<br />
WHICH HAS MARKED OUR APPROACH TO GOVERNMENT OVER THE<br />
LASI* TWC YEARS-WE HAVE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF THE FACT<br />
THAT WHAT IS REQUIRED TO PRODUCE A SUSTAINABLE LASTING<br />
RECOVERY IS THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR MUST BE ASSURED OF<br />
THIS CONSISTENCY AND COHERENCE IF IT IS TO BE RESTORED<br />
TO ITS TRADITIONAL, MAJOR ROLE IN THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
E CO NOM YTHAT<br />
IS HAPPENING. AN: D THE MAINTENANCE OF TRENDS SUCH<br />
AS TijAT iS THE REASON WHY WE HAVE OUR TRILOGY OF<br />
COMMITMENTS-WE HAVE PLEDGED TO CURTAIL GROWTH liJ<br />
GOVERNMENT SPENDING, TAXATION, AND TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF<br />
THE DEFICIT-THE MAY ECON'OMIC STATEMENT IS A<br />
SIGNIFICANT DOWN PAYMENT ON THE TRILOGY. THE TRILOGY<br />
REPRESENTS IHE MOST RIGOROUS SET OF FISCAL DISCIPLINES<br />
EVER IMPOSED BY AN AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT UPON ITSELF.<br />
THE DISCIPLINES INVOLVED IN THESE COMMITMENTS ARE<br />
NECESSARY IF THE GOVERNMENT IS TO ALLOW THE BUSINESS<br />
COMMUNITY ! HE FREEDOM TO GENERAIE THE PRIVATE SECTOR<br />
RESURGENCE WHICH WILL SET AUSTRALIA ON THE PATH TO<br />
SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTHTHERE<br />
HAS BEENI SOME PROMINENCE GIVEN IN THE MED'IA TODAY<br />
TO AN EXPECTED REVENUE SHORTFALL FOR COLLECT IONS FROM<br />
PROVISIONAL TAX-PAYERS COMPARED WITH THE 19814-85 BUDGET<br />
ESTIMATES. AS THE TREASURER SAID THIS AFTERNOON, THE </p>
<p>PATTERN OF THE DEFICIT AT THIS STAGE IN THE FINANCIAL<br />
YEAR STILL APPEARS TO BE BROADLY CONSISTENT WITH BUDGET<br />
EXPECTAT IONSAND<br />
THE EXPERIENCE WITH PROVISIONAL 1TAX COLLECTIONS THIS<br />
YEAR WILL NOT AFFECT THE GOVERNMENT'S TRILOGY OF BUDGET<br />
COMMITMENTS IN 1985-8G.<br />
BEYOND THE SHORT TO MEDIUM TERM ECONOMIC CYCLE, THE<br />
PROSPERITY OF THE NATION DEPENDS CRITICALLY UPON4<br />
INVESTMENT TAKING PLACE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTS<br />
AND INDUSTRIES MOST LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE LONG TERM<br />
INCREASES I N LOCAL AND I NTERNAT IONAL DEMAND-WE AR~ E A<br />
SMALL AND RESOURCE-RICH NATION, IN THE GEOGRAPHIC<br />
NEIGHBOURHOOD OF WhAT ARE NOW THE WORLD'IS MOST DYNAMIC<br />
ECONOMIES. OUR CHALLENGE AS A NATION IS TO CAPITALISE<br />
ON THE OPPORTUNITIES WHICH OUR LOCATION AND RESOURCE<br />
ENDOWMENTS PROVIDE. THE LABOR GOVERNMENT IS COMMITTED<br />
TO SEEING THAT AUSTRALIA AND ITS INSTITUTIONS RISE TO<br />
THAT CHALLENGEALRtADY THERE ARE RUNS ON THE BOARD: IMAGINATIVE<br />
PROGRAMS ARE IN PLACE IN THE STEEL AND MOTOR VEHICLE<br />
INDUSTRIES, DIRECTED AT STRENGTHENING THE COMPETITIVE<br />
POSITIONS OF THOSE INDUSTRIES WHILE KEEPING THEN UPON<br />
THE STIMUUU? OF INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION AND AVOIDING<br />
INCREASING COSTS TO USERS OF THEIR PRODUCTS. A SIMILAR<br />
APPROACH HAS BEEN ADOPTED TOWARDS THE PROBLEMS OF THE<br />
DAIRY INDUSTRY.<br />
BUT CLEARLY THE MOST IMPORTAN'T AREA IN THIS PROGRAM OFREFORMS<br />
HAS BEEN ThK CHANGES MADE TO THE FINANCIAL<br />
S YSTEM-.<br />
THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM PLAYS A LEADING ROLE IN<br />
FACILITATING THE ECONOMIC GROWTH WE AS A NATION NEEDAN<br />
EFFICIENT FINANCIAL SYSTEM WILL DIRECT RESOURCES AT<br />
LEASf COST TO THE MOST PRODUCTIVE AREAS OF THE ECONOMY<br />
AND THUS ASSIST IN RAISING THE WEALTH AND LIVING<br />
STANDARDS OF ALL AUSTRALIANSAN<br />
INEFFICIENT FIr'ANCIAL SYSTEM, SHELTERED FROM<br />
INlERNATIONAL COMPETITION AND -STRAITJACKETTED BY<br />
REGULATIONI, WILL TEND TO DIRECT RESOURCES TO LOW-RISK.,<br />
&amp; SAFE" AREAS OF THE ECONOMY-SU. CH CONJSERVAT ISM CANNOT<br />
PROPERLY CONTRI BUTE TO THE ADJUSTMENTS NECESSAR~ Y TO<br />
ENSURE OUR LONG RUN PROSPERITY-<br />
1THE IMPLEMENTAT ION OF ANY SIGNI FICANT REFORM IS A TRICKY<br />
PROCEDURE FOR ANY GOVERNMENT, PERHAPS EVEN MORE SO FOR A<br />
GOVERNMENT BASED ON A PARTY AS DYNAMIC AND DIVERSE AS<br />
THE LABOR PARTY. EVEN~ I N A PARTY OF REFORM SUC( H AS OURS<br />
CHANGE IN POLICY AND PRACTICE HAS TO BE HANDLED WITH<br />
SENSITIVITY-BUT THIS CAN NEVER BE AN EXCUSE FOR<br />
BEGG IN[ G OFF-GOVERNMENT HAVE TO RECOGN ISE THAT THEY ARE<br />
GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS WHICH MAY NOT BE<br />
IMMEDIATELY POPULAR. </p>
<p>THAT DOES NOT AEAN THAT YOU SIMPLY SAY OBSTINATELY THAT<br />
YOC KNOW WHAT IS RJIGHT AND THEN ANNOUNCE THE DEC IS IONYOU<br />
MUST HAVF IN GOVERNMENT A PROPER BLEND OF TOUGHNESS<br />
AND A PREPAREDNESS TO LISTEN. YOU MUST ALWAYS TRY TO<br />
OPEN UP AREAS OF DISCUSSION WHERE THERE ARE DIFFERING<br />
VIEWS AND SAY AS A GOVERNMENT, " LOOK, WE'IRE NOT THE FONT<br />
OF ALL WISDOM", AND TO LISTEN TO WHAT PEOPLE HA\ VE TO<br />
SAY-THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING-SOMETIMES THIS IS<br />
INTERPRETED AS WEAKNESS. BUT ISSUES MUST ALWAYS BE<br />
OPENED TO THE COMMUNITY IN THE GESTATION PERIOD IF THE<br />
ULTIMATE SOLUTION TO THEM IS TO GAIN WIDESPREAD<br />
COMMUNITY ACCEPTANCETHE<br />
OVERWHELMINGLY OBV'IOUS EXAMPLE AT THE MOMENT IS<br />
TAXATION. THE TAX DEBATE HAS BEEN CONTINUING APACE FOR<br />
MOST OF 1985. SOME MIGHT SAY THAT IT HAS BEEN RAGING<br />
LIKE A BUSHFIRE. BUT FAR FROM THE DEBATE EXPOSING A<br />
LACK OF LEADERSHIP ON THE GOVERNMENT'S PART, IT<br />
REPRESENTS THE FULFILMENT OF THE PROCESSES OF OPENEbS<br />
AND CONSULTATJON' WHICH THIS GOVERNMENT HAS MADE ITS<br />
HALL MARK.<br />
ONCE YOU GET AN ISSUE AS BROAD AND AS GERMANE TO THE<br />
POLITICAL PROCESSES AS TAXATION INTO THE PUBLIC ARENA,<br />
THEN IT IS NAIVE TO EXPECT THAT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO<br />
HAVE A BROAD AND SIGNIFICANT DEBATE, INCLUDING W~ ITHIN<br />
YOUR OWN PARTY.<br />
THERE ARE MANY AND VARIED POIN~ TS OF VIEW ABOUT WHAT<br />
SHOULD BE DONE WITH TAXATION REFOPM. WHAT IS AGREED<br />
UPON UNIVERSALLY AT THIS STAGE IS THAT AUSTRALIA'S<br />
TAXATION SYSTEM IS DECAY; NG AND INCREASINGLY INEFFICIENT<br />
AND UNFAIR. ANY GOVERNMENT WHiCH IS WORTH ITS SALT, AND<br />
WHICH HAS. CONCERN FOR THE LONG TERM IN. TERESTS OF OUR<br />
NATION AS OPPOSED TO AN OUTLOOK BOUND FIRMLY WITHIN<br />
THE CONFINES OF THE NEXT ELECTION MUST IMPLEMENT<br />
SIGNIFICANT REFORM TO THE SYSTEM TO RESTORE ITS<br />
FAIRNESS, ITS EFFICIENCY, ITY EQUITY, AND A SIMPLICITY<br />
SO THAT EVERYONE CAN UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW THE TAXATION<br />
SYSTEM AFFECTS THEM.<br />
ANOTHER MISTAKE THAT IS MADE WITH MAJOR AND COMPLEX<br />
ISSUES IS TO VIEW THEIR INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS IN<br />
ISOLATION.<br />
COMPLEX REFORnS SUCH AS THOSE WE WILL EVENTUALLY MAKE TO<br />
THE TAXAT ION SYSTEM CONSI1ST OF MANY ELEMENTS. ALL OF<br />
THEM RELY UPON EACH OTHERANYONE<br />
WHO IS GENUINE ABOUT EVALUATING THE TAX REFORM<br />
OPTIONS OPEN TO THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT LEGITIMATELY<br />
DISSECT EACH OPTION, SINGL. ING OUT ELEMENTS HERE AND<br />
THERE AS ACCEPTABLE OR UNACCEPTABLE. THE ONLY WAY TAX<br />
REFORM CAN BE JUDGED IS BY EVALUATING EACH PACKAGE OF<br />
REFORM AS AN INTEGRATED WHOLE-YOU CAN'T SAY, ' A<br />
CONSUMPTION TAX IS NO GOOD BECAUSE IT HAS TRADITIONJALLY<br />
BEEN REGRESSIVE-' OR, ' A WEALTH TAX IS CRUCIAL lF THE </p>
<p>SYSTEM IS TO BE FAIR'. YOU MUST LOOK AT THE RANGE OF<br />
ELEMENTS OF A PARTICULAR PACKAGETHE<br />
TEST OF WHATEVER PACKAGE IS ADOPTED IS ITS FAiRNESS<br />
AND EQUITY, WHETHER IT IS SIMPLE ENOUGH TO BE EASILY<br />
UNDERSTOOD AND WHETHER IT MINIMISES THE OPPORTUNITIES<br />
FOR AVOIDANCE WHICH EFFECTIVELY PLACE DISPROPORTIONATE<br />
TAX BURDENS ON LOWER INCOME EARNERSTHIS<br />
GOVERNMENT WILL NOT SPONSOR TAX REFORMS WHICH DO<br />
NOT LEAVE THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF PEOPLE BETTER<br />
OFFOVERALL.<br />
WHATEVER THE CURRENT PERCEPTIONS OF THE TAXATION DEBATE<br />
IN THE COMMUNITY, YOU CAN BE SURE THAT THE RELEASE OF<br />
THE GOVERNMENT' S WHITE PAPER EARLY NEXT MONTH, LEADING<br />
UP TO THE TAX SUMMIT IN THE FIRST WEEK OF JULY, WILL<br />
GIVE THE ISSUE A CLEARER DIRECTIONTHE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH TO THE DEPRECIATION OF THE<br />
DOLLAR IS ALSO BASED ON A LONG TERM, OVERALL STRATEGY-.<br />
THE DEPRECIATION IMPOSES A NEED FOR DIFFICULT<br />
ADJUSTMENTS, FOR MORE HARD DECISIONS, BUT AT THE SAME<br />
TIME IT CAN PROVIDE A STIMULUJS TO ECONOMIC ACTIVITY<br />
THROUGH IMPROVED COMPETITIVENESS.<br />
LET THERE b: NO DOUBT ABOUT IT THAT THE DEPRECIATION IS<br />
VERY MUCH A SIGNAL THAT AUSTRALIA CANNOT CONTINUE TO<br />
LIVE BEYOND ITS MEANS, BY BORROWING MORE AND MORE FROM<br />
THF RiEST OF THE WORLD. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IF THOSE<br />
BORkOW! N62 ARE USED SIMPLY TO FINANCE DOMESTIC<br />
CONSUMPTION, RATHER THAN INVESTMENT IN AUSTRALIA'S LON~ G<br />
TERM GROWTH POTENTiAL, AND THUS ITrS CAPACITY TO EXPORT<br />
AND SERVICE DEBTTHE<br />
DEPRECIATION WILL SWING DEMAND TOWARDS LOCAL<br />
MANUFACTURERS, AND AT THE SAME TIME EXPORT EARNINGS WILL<br />
RISE. THE RESULT IS LIKELY TO BE THE ADDITION OF AT<br />
LEAST ONE PER CENT TO OUR ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE NEXT<br />
FINANCIAL YEAR AND, SO LONG AS WE DO NOT DISSIPATE THE<br />
COMPETITIVE GAIN IN A SURGE OF INFLATION, OVER TIME AN<br />
OVER TIME A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN JOBSTHE<br />
COMPETITIVENESS GAINS SROUGHT ABOUT BY DEPRECIATION<br />
SNOULD RESULT IN A CONTRACTION OF OUR PRESENT<br />
UNACCEPTABLY LARGE CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT. ALL<br />
AUSTRALIANS ARE CONFRONTED WITH MAKING ADJUSTMENTS TO<br />
ACHIEVE THIS-WITHIN THESE ADJUSTMENTS, WE MUST REDUCE<br />
THE PROPORTION OF. PRODUCTION THAT IS USED FOR<br />
CO0N SU MP TIO0NOTHERWISE, THE BENEFITS OF DEPRECIATION WILL SIMPLY<br />
EVAPORATE IN AN ENDLESS SPIRAL OF DEPRECIATION AND<br />
INFLATION-</p>
<p>8<br />
THE ESSENTIAL CHALLENGE FOR POLICY IS -0 ENSURE THAT THE<br />
COMPETITIVENESS GAINS ARE FRESERVED. THIS REeUIRES REAL<br />
WAGES TO BE LOWER THAN W) ULD OTHERWISE H. VE BEEN<br />
APPROPRI ATE.<br />
WE ARE DETERMINED TO PRESERVE THE BENEFITS OF<br />
DEPRECIATION WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ACCORD.<br />
You WILL HAVE NOTICED THAT THE ACTU EXECUTIVE, IN ITS<br />
MEETING IN MELBOURNE LAST WEEK, REAFFIRMED THE PRINCIPLE<br />
THAT WORKERS ARE ENTITLED TO PRODUCTIVITY PAY RISES, AND<br />
THAT THESE SHOULD BE IN THE FORM OF SUPERANNUATION<br />
I MPROVEMENTS<br />
BUT THE EXECUTIVE ALSO MADE TWO OTHER RELEVANT POINTS<br />
FIRST, AND I QUOTE, THAT<br />
itIT IS CLEAR THAT NO COST INCREASES ARISING FROM<br />
PRODUCTIViTY DISTRIBUTION ARE LIKELY DURING 1985".<br />
SECOND, IT SHOULD INVOLVE, AND AGAIN I QUOTE,<br />
ItPROGRESSIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF SUPERANNUATION OVER<br />
TIME IN A MANNER WHICH SHOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH<br />
THE ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THE NATION FACES".<br />
THE TREASURER, PAUL KEATING SOMEONE WHO IS NO STRANGER<br />
TO ALL OF YOU HERE TONIGHT INDICATED IN THE ECONOMIC<br />
STATErIENT. EARLIER THIS MONTH THAT THE -QUESTION OF THE<br />
SIZE, TIMING AND PHASING OF ANY PRODUCTIVITY INCREASE<br />
SHOULD BE DEFERRED UNTIL THE SCOPE OF THE DEPRECIATION<br />
AND THE EXTENT OF ITS EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY BECOMES<br />
APPARENTTHE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION ON ANY PRODUCTIVITY INCREASE<br />
REMAINS UNCHANGED. FOLLOWING THE DEPRECIATION, THE<br />
GOVERINMENT TAKES THE VIEW THAT THERE MUST BE A LOWER<br />
REAL WAGE LEVEL DURING THE ADJUSTMENT PERIOD THAN WOULD<br />
OTHERWISE HAVE APPLIED. THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR<br />
BRINGING THIS ABOUf ARE BY DISCOUNTING OR BY DELAYING<br />
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY PRODUCTIVITY INCREASE.<br />
THE POSITION TAKEN BY THE ACTU EXECUTIVE WHICH SEEKS<br />
SUPPORT FOR A PRINCIPLE DOES NOT IN ANY WAY PRECLUDE THE<br />
GOVERNMENT CONIINUI1NG TO HAVE THE OPTION OF A LOWER REAL<br />
WAGE OUTCOME THIAN MAY OTHERWISE BE WARRANTED THROUGH THE<br />
POSITION IT TAKES ON THE SIZE, TIMING AND PHASING OF ANY<br />
PRODUCTIVITY INCREASE. </p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT' S WAGES POLICY, WI THINH THE FRAMEWORK OF<br />
TH7 ACCORD, IS OFTEN THE TARGET OF THOSE WHO WOULD SEE<br />
MINIMAL WAGE RIS! S, AND A DIFFERENT BASIS FOR WAGE<br />
DETEPMIfJATION WITH A DISMANTLING OF THE PRESENT<br />
CENTRALISED WAGES STRUCTURE-SUCH THEOPISING BETRAYS<br />
AN IGNORANCE OF THE STRUCTURE OF OUR WAGES AND<br />
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS SYSTEM.<br />
WE HAVE, FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE, A CENTRALISED WAGES<br />
SYSTEM BASED ON THE TIME-WORN PRINCIPLE OF COMPARATIVE<br />
WAGE JUSTICE. OUR SYSTEM IS FAR FROM PERFECT. BUT ANY<br />
THEORISING ABOUT POSSIBLE REFORMS TO IT HAS TO<br />
ACKNOWLEDGE THE ENTRENCHED NATURE OF THE SYSTEM AND THE<br />
PRINCIPLES UPON WHICH IT IS BASED. YOU CANNOT SIMPLY<br />
WISH AWAY COMPARATIVE WAGE JUSTICE. [ NO AMOUNT OF FORMAL<br />
DECISIONS By GOVERNMENT OR THE TRIBUNALS WILL OVERCOME<br />
ITSO IN RECOG-NISING THOSE REALITIES, ONE MUST ALSO<br />
RECOGNISE. THAT REAL AND EFFECTIVE CHANGES TO THE<br />
SYSTEM, TO AFFECT ITS CURRENT OPERATION, HAVE TO BE MADE<br />
WITHIN ITS EXISTING FRAMEWORK. ANYTHING ELSE WOULD TAKE<br />
MANY YEARS AND IS NO SOLUTION TO CURRENT PROBLEMSTHIS<br />
DOES NOT MEAN THAT CHANGE SHOULD NOT BE SOUGHT.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT' S ESTABL ISHMENT OF T" F HANCOCK COuMMITTEE<br />
WHOSE REPORT WAS TqBLED IN THE KkI~ AMENT A WEEK AGO<br />
DEMONSTRATES THIS GOVERNMENT' S SERIOUSNESS ABOUT<br />
REFORMING THE INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM. BUT CHANGES SUCH AS<br />
DECENTRALISATION, FRAGMENTATION, AND SIMILAR GLIB<br />
SOLUTIONS ARE NOT REMEDIES FOR CURRENT ILLSIT<br />
IS FASHIONABLE TO BLAME CENTRALISATION FOR MANY OF<br />
OUR ECONOMIC PROBLEMS. THE GOVERNMENT.-IS NOT ALONE,<br />
HOWEVER, IN ITS BELIEF THAT SUCH A SYSTEM IS APPROPRIATE<br />
FOR AUSTRALIA.<br />
THE HANCOCK REPORT ITSELF LEPflS CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT.<br />
HANCOCK SAYS, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT " MANY AND SERIOUS<br />
UNCERTAINTIES BESET THE SUGGESTION OF A PERMANENT<br />
ABANDONMENT OF CENTRALISED WAGE FIXATION. AT THIS<br />
STAGE, WE DO NOT THINK THAT THE INCURRING OF THESE<br />
UNCERTAINTIES IS WARRANTED. AND THEYF ARE POSSIBILITIES<br />
OF THE CENTRALISED SYSTEM'IS CONTRIBUTING SIGNIFICANTLY<br />
To AUSTRALIA'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY."<br />
THE REPORT IS COUCHED IN CAREFUL LANGUAGE-IN SOMETHING<br />
OF AN UNDERSTATEMENT IT SAYS THAT " PROPONENTS OF LABOUR<br />
MARKET DEREGULATICN IN THE ROUND NEED, WE THINK, TO BE<br />
MORE SPECIFIC, AND IT GOES ON TO SAY: " WE HAVE GRAVE<br />
DOUBTS ABOUT ITS ( THAT IS, DEREGULATION'IS) REALISM"-</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT SOME QUICK-FIX REPORT NH! PPED UP IN A COUPLE<br />
OF MONTHS TO JUSTIFY A PARlICULAP POLITICAL PCSITIONo<br />
THIS IS A REPORT WHICH TOOK TWO YEARS TO PREPARE, WHICH<br />
IS THE MOST THOROUGH REVIEW OF AUSTRALIA'S INDUSTRIAL<br />
SYSTEM EVER CONDUCTED-IT IS A REPORT BY THREE OF<br />
AUSTRALIA'S MOST RESPECTED INDUSTRIAL EXPERTS AND<br />
PRACTITIONERS-PROFESSOR KEITH HANCOCK, GEORGE POLITES<br />
AND CHARLIEJ FITZGIBBON HAVE A WEALTH OF SCHOOLING IN THE<br />
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS WOR~ LD-IN INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,<br />
PARTICULARLY -AND I SPEAK AS ONE WHO KNOWS A BIT ABOUT<br />
THE SUBJECT -PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE IS THE KEY TO<br />
UN D ER STA N D INGSUPPORT<br />
SUCH AS THIS HELPS TO REINFORCE THE GOVERNMENT' S<br />
VIEW THAT OUR LONGER TERM APPROACH TO ISSUES IS THE MOST<br />
APPROPRIATE APPROACH TO TAKE. IT IS AN APPROACH BASED<br />
IN PRINCIPLE, NOT SHORT TERM EXPEDIENTTHE<br />
GOVERNMENT IS PREPARED TO WEATHER SHORT TERM<br />
UNPOPULARITY FOR THE SAKE OF PRINCIPLE " IN ALL AREASTHE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S FUNDAMENTAL GOAL, HOWEV'ER, IS A<br />
PROSPEROUS ECONOMY, BECAUSE ONLY WITH SUCH CON'DITIONS<br />
CAN ANY REAL PROGRESS BE MADE TOWARDS A FAIR<br />
DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH, RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES. ! T<br />
IS AN ASPIRATION WHICH FITS NEATLY WITH LONG TERM<br />
STRATEGI ESYOU<br />
KNOW US WELL ENOUGH BY NOW TO KNOW THAT THI: S<br />
GOVERNMENT IS NOT ABOUT TO FORCE SHIFTS IN RESOURCES IN<br />
A PEREMPTORY OR DISLOCATIVE WA~ Y-WE RECOGNISE THE<br />
STRUCTURES AND INSTITUTIONS WHICH UNDERLY OUR ECONOMYOUR<br />
SOCIETY-WE BELIEVE THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL REFORMS<br />
WHICH ARENEEDED IN OUR ECONOMY WILL ONLY BE EFFECTIVE<br />
AND PRODUCTIVE FOR EVERYONE'IS BENEFIT IF [ HEY ARE<br />
IMPLEMENTED GRADUALLYIT<br />
IS GRADUALISM AND COHERENCE WHICH DETERMINES HOW W!:<br />
APPROACH REFORM. AND IT IS OUR CONCERN FOR THE WELLBEING<br />
OF ALL SECTION4S OF AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY, FOR<br />
FAIRNESS AND EQUITY TO ALL, WHICH SHAPES THE REFORMS<br />
THEMSELVESOUR GOALS ARE SOCIAL AS WELL AS ECONOMIC. THEY ARE<br />
GOALS BY WHICH ALL AUSTRALIInNS ARE EQUALLY ABLE TO TAKE<br />
ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITIFES OPEN TO~ THEM, TO EXPRESS<br />
THEMSELVES AND DEVELOP TO THEIR FULL POTENTIAL.<br />
WE WANI A SOCIETY , IN WHICH ALL OF US ARE FrwEE TO Go<br />
ABOUT OUR BUSINESS INi OLUR OWN WAYS, BUT IN WHICH WE ALL<br />
