    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was shocked and saddened to learn today of the tragic events in Nepal which have resulted in the deaths of King Birendra, Queen Aiswarya of Nepal and other members of the royal family, and the suicide of Crown Prince Dipendra.</p>
<p>On my own behalf and that of the people of Australia, I convey my sorrow and condolences to the surviving members of the royal family and the people of Nepal.</p>
<p>King Birendra had ruled Nepal since 1972. He became a constitutional monarch in 1990 and remained a pillar of stability in Nepal's transition to democracy. It is my earnest hope that peace and order will be maintained in Nepal. This will be important for Nepal and for the stability of its wider region.</p>
<p>I understand that the Privy Council will be meeting shortly to deal with the situation. It is fortunate that several members of the royal family were not involved in last night's tragedy and remain alive.</p>
<p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Australian Embassy in Kathmandu are monitoring the situation in Nepal closely with an eye to the safety of Australians there.</p>
<p>2 June 2001</p>
