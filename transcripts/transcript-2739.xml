PRE3S STATEMNT NO. 8<br />
8 December 1972<br />
AIRLINE CURPEW<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, today issued an<br />
instruction that airline companies must observe the night<br />
curfew on jet aircraft operations at Sydney Kingsford Smith<br />
Airport. The instruction is aimed at minimising nuisance to<br />
people living in the vicinity of flight paths to and from the<br />
airport. IvMr. Whitlam issued the instruction in a minute to the<br />
Director of Civil Aviation, 8. r Donald Anderson.<br />
He told Sir Donald that, in accordance with stated<br />
government policy, he should ensure that all airline companies<br />
strictly observe the curfew which operates from 11p. m. to<br />
6 a. m. The only exception to this strict enforcement should<br />
be on safety grounds, he said.<br />
Mr. Whitlam told 3ir Donald that it was most important<br />
that the airlines be notified immediately so they can plan for<br />
the Christmas period.<br />
