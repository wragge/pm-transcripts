FOR PRESS P.. pi. 3o/ g9. b_<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert%<br />
On Sunday I expressed the Commonwealth<br />
Government's deep sympathy with the many people who had<br />
suffered great personal hardship as a result of the<br />
bushfires which were sweeping the southern area of<br />
Australia. I said at that time that the Commonwealth<br />
was prepared to help wherever possible and would match<br />
funds provided by the State Governments in financing<br />
schemes for the relief of personal hardship and distress.<br />
I have since received a request for financial<br />
assistance from the Premier of New South Wales and I<br />
have informed him today that the Commonealth Government<br />
will provide, as requested, an initial amount of up to<br />
000 on a for basis with the Government of New<br />
South Wales towards a bushfire relief scheme to be put<br />
into operation immediately.<br />
