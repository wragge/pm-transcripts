FOR PRESS 26 NOVEMBER 1978<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
It has been a long standing rule in our home that during<br />
Christmas time the Fraser family stays together. That rule<br />
has been rigorously applied by Tamie over the years.<br />
Unfortunately, it has had to go by the board this year.<br />
On Christmas Day I will be leaving for Jamaica for an important<br />
international conference.<br />
The Heads of Government from countries including Germany, Canada,<br />
Venezuela, Nigeria and Norway will meet in Jamaica to talk over<br />
world trade and commodity trade problems. As Prime Minister<br />
I will represent Australia at that meeting.<br />
A few days later I will be meeting with President Carter in<br />
Washington to look at a wide range of world economic problems.<br />
The meeting in Jamaica underscores the significance that developed<br />
and developing countries place in particular on the stability<br />
of international trade in comrhodities. Agricultural<br />
and other commodities are of vital importance to almost every<br />
developing country. For countries producing commodities, unstable<br />
prices and markets have hit hard at their export earnings and<br />
growth prospects. This has been disastrous for developing<br />
countries. For purchasing countries, boom-then-bust commodity<br />
markets have entailed sudden and often massive price swings.<br />
This frequently sets off irreversible wage rises and sets in<br />
train longer term inflationary pressures.<br />
Clearly then, it is in the interests of both producers and<br />
consumers that there be stable commodity trade. The Australian<br />
Government believes strongly that a well-managed Common Fund can<br />
help achieve this goal.<br />
Australia, in fact, through representations in world forums over<br />
the past 2 years, has led the way in attempting to bring about<br />
agreement between developed and developing nations on the question<br />
of a Common Fund.<br />
Two senior Australian officials have recently completed talks<br />
in the United States with the aim of further developing the<br />
Common Fund concept. Currently, we are involved in negotiations<br />
in Geneva on the many complex issues involved in the setting up<br />
of such a fund. It is too early to now say whether agreement<br />
on the fund will emerge. Australia would be most concerned at any<br />
stalemate in the negotiations. / 2 </p>
<p>Australia believes that agreements for individual commodities<br />
with assistance from a Common Fund can introduce greater<br />
stability into world trade and to the incomes of developing<br />
countries We earnestly look for an early resolution to the<br />
outsanding questions.<br />
The broader question of the state of international trade also<br />
remains of paramount concern for the Government. The continued<br />
failure of the major trading blocs to deal with agricultural<br />
protectionism and the yielding to pressures for increased<br />
protectionism in other areas pose one of the most testing<br />
challenges for world leaders.<br />
This challenge is all the more pointed because it comes at a<br />
time when the western world continues to battle with the twin<br />
problems of high unemployment and high inflation.<br />
The Multilateral Trade Negotiations have been in progress for<br />
some years. If these discussions lead to new world trading<br />
arrangements, they will certainly set the pattern for international<br />
trade for decades ahead.<br />
A number of countries are now working for a conclusion for some<br />
time in December. The negotiations were originally due to<br />
finish in July, they were thent scheduled to end next month.<br />
A number of countries are now working to conclude the negotiations<br />
then, but expect that the final result would still be subject<br />
to ratification by the Europpan Council of Ministers and by the<br />
United States Congress some time early in 1979. That objective<br />
might still be on the hopeful side.<br />
Australia is taking an active part in the negotiations.<br />
Given our dependence on world trade, and the current international<br />
trading environment, it is in Australia's interest that the<br />
negotiations be successful. Yet, significant differences still<br />
persist. We can only hope that, during the next few weeks,<br />
the major trading blocs will demonstrate a real commitment<br />
to achieving a fairer and more rational trading system. This will<br />
require further concession to be made.<br />
We are all watching their actions over the next few weeks,<br />
trusting that the many assurances they have given will be<br />
reflected in the final outcome of the negotiations.<br />
Australia while recognising the limits of our influence on world<br />
economic affairs will continue to press our case with vigour<br />
and reason. As a Government, this is a responsibility we can<br />
never neglect. </p>
