CIVIC WELOOM AT NARRABRI TOWN HALL<br />
29TH SEPTEMBR. 1961<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIM MINISTER. THE RT, HON. R. G. MENZIES<br />
Mr. Mayor, Mr. Deputy President, and ladies and gentlemen, and boys and girls<br />
I live a most peculiar life, quite crasy. I left the office at 20 to 1<br />
today and have to be back home in time for dinner, on peril of expulsion from q own<br />
house everybody will understand that. Wherever I go in Australia if I am driving<br />
through a town that is big, or a town that is little, or a town that is middle sise,<br />
I see som Hall and I say, in a gloating fashion, " I rem-ber making a speech there<br />
once". I think it is unlikely that there is any Hall left in Australia in which I<br />
haven't had to speak. When I walked in here this morning I reminded myself, and you<br />
confirmed it, that I had made a speech here. I shall never forget this Hall it has<br />
oneof the highest platforms in Australia. ( Laughter) It has a great moral for a<br />
politician to speak froa a very high platform because he is constantly reminded how<br />
fast and how far he can fall! ( Laughter) This is very health-giving to people in<br />
public life. But the last time I was here I was here in my complete political capacity.<br />
There was a by-election. I am enjoying today's visit compared to my recollectiom of<br />
that one. I have never been so hot in my life except in New Guinea. They tured<br />
on the heat from the heavens and the heat from the platforms and the heat from the<br />
audiences. I want to tell you I hope you won't take offence at it I was jolly<br />
glad to see the last of the place. Today is a very much more civilised occasion.<br />
I was very interested just now, talking to you, Sir, the Mayor, to find oat<br />
the system of local government because it varies from State to State. I myself have<br />
occasionally achieved credit with people like yourself by boasting of the fact that<br />
my father was once the President of a Shire and that y erliest knowledge of<br />
politics at a very tender age, right up in the bush, was when the Councillor from the<br />
North Riding cam, clop, clop, clop, down the road, 24 Jiles from where he lived he<br />
came down in a buggy to pick my father up. Then they west clop, clop, clop down<br />
the road and a fairly rough one for another 25 miles, to where the Shire had its<br />
seat, and where it carried on its business. For a leg time I thought that<br />
politicians were Jhire Councillors. ( Laughter) Now of course I have discovered that<br />
it is the other way around: shire councillors are politicians.<br />
But it is a wonderful thing, a good thing, for anybody who presides over<br />
the central government of a nation, and who has great international problems to<br />
consider, to cow into shire or municipal administration, by whatever name it my go,<br />
and see where the grass roots of Government are to be found. Grass still remins the<br />
most important crop in the world, so the grass roots of Governmnt are, I think, very<br />
frequently, the most important aspect of it bec a use you then produce people who have,<br />
beginning with a local sense, and local responsibilities, a feeling for publie<br />
service. It is the feeling for public service that distinguishes a democracy from<br />
all other forms of government.<br />
Now I want to tell you, before we move on to the next port of call, how<br />
delighted I am to be here, and how delighted I am at what you have been good enough<br />
to say Sir. This place is, I discovered, as I came in from the airport, the sam<br />
distance, almost to a mile, from Sydney by rail, as Mildura is from Melbourne. And<br />
to a Melbourne man Mildura seem the last word in remoteness. To say of sombody<br />
that he has gone to live in Mildura is practically to say he has been botted out of<br />
the book of life. I suppose you occasionally feel like that here.<br />
I have now lived a fair number of years unfair my opponents think yet<br />
the longer I live the more I marvel at the tremendous developments that I have seen<br />
in my own lifetime. We, inour generation, I in mine certainly, have seen some of the<br />
most fabulous changes in the life of mankind. Not only great wars and terrible<br />
tragedies, but I can remember the first motor vehicle coming intothe valley, the very<br />
first. It had been bought by the local doctor and it confirmed the belief that most<br />
people had that ' he must be very ricH. It was a motor buggy; not a very comfortable<br />
affair, but very superior to the old horse. Fancy a fellow of my age being able to<br />
remember the first motor vehicle coming into a substantial part of the state of<br />
Victoria. Similarly I can remember the first moving pictures. They jumped up and<br />
down on the screen but they were marvellous. The first film I ever saw was the<br />
_ C i </p>
<p>2.<br />
Great Imerican Train Robbery. And there is no doubt about it, the robbers were<br />
magnificent. But the film was jevky. ( Laughter)<br />
All these things have happened; radio wireless. We have got all the<br />
instrumnts of civilisation put right into our hands except one, the greatest<br />
instrument of civilisation, which is our own spirit. You will test the<br />
civilisation of any comanity by finding out how ma men and women there are in it<br />
who are prepared to do somthing, unselfishly, for other people. That is why I end,<br />
as I began, by saying I like to be brought back into contact with what we call<br />
municipal life, local governent, for it is in local government that you find so=<br />
of the most disinterested service to the comnity that you canfind anywhere inthe<br />
world. Thank you very meh, Sir. I am very delighted that you have given me<br />
this welcom. </p>
