<p>E&amp;OE............</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  Good morning.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Good morning Phillip.</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  Did you stay up on Saturday night?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Did I ever. I got to bed about twenty-to-four. It was a great match. It</p>
<p>   was a fantastic match and I'll be staying up very late this Saturday night</p>
<p>   as well.early Sunday morning. It will be a long day but I think we've got</p>
<p>   a real show.</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  It's going to be. The last week of the referendum campaign, I suppose it's</p>
<p>   the only issue on the agenda for this week in a sense isn't it?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yes. I think it will get a very good run and so it should because it's an</p>
<p>   important issue. I'll be taking the opportunity to suggest to people that</p>
<p>   they should stay with the present constitution. I've been a consistent opponent</p>
<p>   of change to a republic. I've never disguised that fact. I think we have</p>
<p>   a very safe and reliable constitution and I don't think we should take the</p>
<p>   risk of changing it.</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  Can I put this to you that whatever happens on Saturday, the result in a</p>
<p>   sense is probably going to end up as a divisive exercise in that we've got</p>
<p>   a whole lot of people in one camp with fervent views, sometimes passionate</p>
<p>   views, and on the other side others the yes and the no cases will argue</p>
<p>   their case with a lot of energy up and down the country. But in the end,</p>
<p>   despite all of this effort and despite all of the expense and the trouble</p>
<p>   we've been to as a country, at this time in our history at the end of 1999</p>
<p>   we've ended with something that divides us when it could have been something</p>
<p>   else. I mean do you feel that a sense of an opportunity being missed here?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No. You could always, if you were going to as it were force a vote on this</p>
<p>   issue at this time there's always going to be a difference of a view. But</p>
<p>   a movement started some years ago to have a vote on the issue before the</p>
<p>   turn of the century. And I promised the Australian people that if I became</p>
<p>   Prime Minister, although I myself were opposed to change, I would give them</p>
<p>   a vote and I'm keeping that promise. I mean this is democracy. You always</p>
<p>   have differences of opinion. There were differences of opinion in the past</p>
<p>   on other constitutional issues. But I don't believe after Saturday, whatever</p>
<p>   the result, I don't think you're going to have endless division. I think</p>
<p>   Australians are Australians above everything else. I mean I want the referendum</p>
<p>   proposal defeated because I don't want to risk a very safe constitution.</p>
<p>   But if the Australian people vote yes then as Prime Minister, I will accept</p>
<p>   that result and I will facilitate the implementation of their wish. And</p>
<p>   I would say to those people who want a republic that if it is defeated,</p>
<p>   well we get on with our lives. We together as Australians celebrate the</p>
<p>   centenary of our country. I mean this is not a debate about who is the more</p>
<p>   passionate Australian. There are equally committed passionate Australians</p>
<p>   on both sides of the debate and it's just a question of what is the better</p>
<p>   system of government. I don't think we should be frightened to debate differences</p>
<p>   as long as at the end of the day we are above everything else Australians</p>
<p>   and that unites us more than any of our divisions on this might put us apart.</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  One of the phrases you used in your defence of the current system, issued</p>
<p>   in the minute of your Bennelong electorate newsletter which struck me as</p>
<p>   interesting, that is you said the Governor-General is effectively our head</p>
<p>   of state, thereby acknowledging the truth that the head of the constitutional</p>
<p>   arrangement in the country lies the Queen.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I said in that document...</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  In other words it's not quite right, the symbolism of our country isn't</p>
<p>   quite right. The Queen is the head of the constitutional arrangements but</p>
<p>   she's not really our head state. [inaudible].</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I was speaking a truth and the truth that I was speaking was that under</p>
<p>   the constitution the powers of the monarch are discharged by the Governor-General.</p>
<p>   I mean these are things people will take into account.</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  But it's a bit ramshackle isn't it?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I think ramshackle is the last thing our constitution is. I mean even</p>
<p>   the republicans acknowledge that we have a very stable, reliable, secure</p>
<p>   system, otherwise they wouldn't be running around saying - ever so subtlely</p>
<p>   - look this isn't really big change. It's just sort of a white out of Queen</p>
<p>   and Governor General and a write in of president. I mean their whole thrust</p>
<p>   is to say that this is a tiny miniscule change. You know why they're saying</p>
<p>   that? Because they know that the present constitution is very safe and secure</p>
<p>   and is workable. I mean we've had it for a hundred years. All this talk</p>
<p>   about the powers of dismissal of the Governor-General of the President,</p>
<p>   we've never dismissed a Governor-General. And the value of a constitution</p>
<p>   is discovered when it is put under strain and stress. Any old constitution</p>
<p>   will work when everything is going swimmingly. It's when something is put</p>
<p>   under stress and strain that you know whether it works or not. And this</p>
<p>   constitution has worked effectively for a hundred years. I mean I am a person</p>
<p>   who will argue for change passionately if I believe that it is in the good</p>
<p>   of the country as a I did with tax reform. But when it comes to something</p>
<p>   that I see works, I know I feel, as I go around the country the feeling</p>
<p>   I get from the people is gee we really do have a good system.</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  But our national symbols are important aren't they?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yes they are important.</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  ..very important. And isn't it important to get them right?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yes.</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  There's a sense, you implicitly conceded in your letter ..</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No I don't.</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  . there's a sense that our symbols are not quite right because our head</p>
<p>   of state's effectively somebody else.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Sorry, Phillip. Don't..I mean this is a very nice interview. I don't want</p>
<p>   to be antagonistic. But look, don't put words into my mouth and words into</p>
<p>   my newsletter. I didn't concede anything in my newsletter. I asserted the</p>
<p>   obvious and that is that we have a very workable system. We are lucky that</p>
<p>   the accident of history, the circumstances of history have given us a particularly</p>
<p>   stable system. Now in the end people will make up their minds as to whether</p>
<p>   they want to maintain that historical association with the Crown or not.</p>
<p>   Whether that is so offensive to them that it overwhelms the evident advantages</p>
<p>   of the present system. Now that is something that people will make their</p>
<p>   mind's up at the weekend. I mean I don't walk away from that because it's</p>
<p>   an historical fact. But equally the functioning practical day-to-day reality</p>
<p>   is that the Governor-General exercises the powers of head of state in this</p>
<p>   country. I mean that is a matter of law because his powers derive from the</p>
<p>   constitution. So I mean these are things in the end that people have got</p>
<p>   to make their mind's up. You ask me do I feel any less Australian because</p>
<p>   of that arrangement, the answer is no. I don't think anybody does. You agree</p>
<p>   with me that it is not a debate between as to who is the better Australian.</p>
<p>   It's really a debate as to what is the better system.</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  Of course. It's clearly not a debate about who's the most patriotic, or</p>
<p>   who's the passionate Australian. I think you observe a moment ago those</p>
<p>   who feel equally strong on both sides. But the symbolism is important, just</p>
<p>   to return to this point. And it seemed to be underlined most cogently in</p>
<p>   the Olympic Games issue didn't it? Every other country would have its head</p>
<p>   of state opening the Olympic Games. We don't. Whether you regard the Governor-General</p>
<p>   or the Queen as the head of state. You said yesterday in your ..</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I think that it's most appropriate given the sort of country Australia</p>
<p>   is that its Prime Minister open it. I mean I had that view when Mr Keating</p>
<p>   was Prime Minister. It's not something that I've developed since becoming</p>
<p>   Prime Minister myself. And I would have that same view if we were a republic</p>
<p>   because what you've got to remember..</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  That the Prime Minister should open...?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yes because in our system of government the person who effectively sits</p>
<p>   at the apex of the decision making process is the Prime Minister. So there's</p>
<p>   a lot of talk about the importance of the head of state. In a way that is</p>
<p>   an accretion if you like, something that's come into the debate because</p>
<p>   of the argument about a republic. The executive political authority in this</p>
<p>   country is in the hands of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet because we</p>
<p>   are a Westminster system of government. We are not like the American Presidency,</p>
<p>   an executive President, or the Mexican Presidency, or the French Presidency,</p>
<p>   where there is a division, or the Indonesian President or the South African</p>
<p>   Presidency. All of these are very very different presidencies. So when you're</p>
<p>   talking about the identity of the decision maker and so forth, in the end</p>
<p>   it's the Prime Minister who sits at the apex of the political system. But</p>
<p>   we have at the moment a fortunate division where as a last resort if the</p>
<p>   political process doesn't resolve the dispute you have a system of government</p>
<p>   that in a completely non-political impartial fashion can resolve dead lock.</p>
<p>   Now, I don't believe you can duplicate that as well in a republican form</p>
<p>   of the model being voted for on Saturday. And that is an overwhelming reason</p>
<p>   why undecided voters should vote no. I mean, they've got to ask themselves,</p>
<p>   do they really think that you can have as neutral, non-political a Head</p>
<p>   of State arrangement as we have now under the republican model. And if they're</p>
<p>   in any doubt about that then they should, on that ground alone, cast a no</p>
<p>   vote.</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  I was reading a piece by Brian Matthews on the weekend which he made the</p>
<p>   point, look it's not just a question of saying if the current system is</p>
<p>   okay, leave it alone, as he says all political institutions evolve over</p>
<p>   a period of time and that what we're looking at - I don't think anyone argues</p>
<p>   that the current system doesn't work well, it does. But the question is</p>
<p>   whether the symbols that the current system contains are the appropriate</p>
<p>   ones for us and whether we could evolve a system with better symbols. And</p>
<p>   it's forcing that argument, that we [inaudible] evolve.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I think the nationalism of this country is very strong. As I go around this</p>
<p>   country I don't get people - people don't rush up to me and say, you know,</p>
<p>   look I feel that the symbols are wrong. I find as I go around this country</p>
<p>   that people are very satisfied with their identity as Australians. And they</p>
<p>   are not saying to me, look, we lack identity. Look, we have just been through</p>
<p>   a period in our history where we've probably played a greater leadership</p>
<p>   role in our region in relationship to East Timor than on any occasion since</p>
<p>   World War II. I didn't go to that debate and that series of discussions</p>
<p>   other than as the political leader, the elected, democratically chosen leader</p>
<p>   of a powerful independent country. Now, this suggestion which is implicit</p>
<p>   in the republican case that in some way our national growth is stunted because</p>
<p>   of our current constitutional arrangements is really a great furphy of the</p>
<p>   whole proposition. I mean, it is not - look, the choice should not be, which</p>
<p>   is the better system. Do you throw out something that is proven by the track</p>
<p>   record of calm constitutional history to have been a very workable proposition</p>
<p>   and embrace something that does have, for example, a dismissal provision</p>
<p>   of the President to be found, as I understand it, in no other republican</p>
<p>   constitution.</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  Although, as you point out, I think there's probably undue emphasis on that</p>
<p>   in the sense we've never dismissed a Governor-General in the country and</p>
<p>   the likelihood is that we wouldn't be dismissing Presidents either.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No but when you change the system then you do have to ask questions about</p>
<p>   alternatives.</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  Can I just, can I turn to another issue and that is the issue of what's</p>
<p>   going to happen after Saturday. In essence, whatever happens in a sense</p>
<p>   to the first question, whatever happens after Saturday there's going to</p>
<p>   be a lot of unfinished business because it's very likely, if you look at</p>
<p>   the trend of polls, it's very likely that there may be a majority of voters</p>
<p>   in the country who actually vote yes on Saturday but the referendum didn't</p>
<p>   succeed because it didn't pass in the required number of States. Even if</p>
<p>   that doesn't happen there'll be a result which will in a sense leave unfinished</p>
<p>   business because the direct electionists, Mr Reith in Cabinet included,</p>
<p>   want to push on. After Saturday, as far as you're concerned, what should</p>
<p>   happen?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, as to what the result will be, I don't know.</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  No [inaudible]</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I don't know and I'll have to wait and obviously I'm not going to speculate</p>
<p>   about what the result is except that I think it could be very tight. I just</p>
<p>   don't know. Well, I think we can say a few things. You can certainly say</p>
<p>   that yes will mean yes to the present model. There is no likelihood in my</p>
<p>   opinion and all we can do from my position is predict, I can't guarantee,</p>
<p>   but I think if the currently proposed model gets up that will be it. There</p>
<p>   will never be, in my view, a willingness on the part of parliamentarians</p>
<p>   on either side, Labor or Liberal, at some time in the future to put forward</p>
<p>   the option of a directly elected President. So, I say to people who want</p>
<p>   a directly elected presidency, if you're contemplating voting yes on Saturday</p>
<p>   because you think that Mr Beazley, as Labor Prime Minister in some years</p>
<p>   into the future or some other Labor Prime Minister or a Liberal Prime Minister</p>
<p>   of the future, whatever, may in some way give you the option of a directly</p>
<p>   elected presidency I don't believe that will happen. I can only state that</p>
<p>   as a very strong view because once you get a republic those who have been</p>
<p>   pushing hardest for this model will have got what they wanted. And the great</p>
<p>   majority of members of Parliament on both sides are opposed to an elected</p>
<p>   presidency. Now, I mean, I am opposed to an elected President.</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  And so is Mr Beazley.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I mean, I've never disguised that either. I mean, I don't support any type</p>
<p>   of republic. I think people should clearly understand, there is really no</p>
<p>   hope if you're a direct electionist in voting yes in this belief that you</p>
<p>   can sort of have yes and more. Yes will mean yes.</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  If there's a no vote will you, during the term of your prime ministership,</p>
<p>   ever put the question again?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I think if there is a no vote, I mean, whatever the result is in the</p>
<p>   near term people are going to sort of want to put this thing aside and say,</p>
<p>   look, we've had enough of that for a while. I have said before that if there's</p>
<p>   a no vote I don't see the issue coming back in a hurry. As to what happens</p>
<p>   beyond that I can't really predict.</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  Will Mr Reith and others be told to maintain some sort of Cabinet line on</p>
<p>   the issue or will they be able to speak freely?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, to be fair, Mr Reith, I mean, no individual should be singled out.</p>
<p>   I mean, at the moment we have a free vote. We decided.</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  Will that end on Saturday?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  The free vote will end on Saturday, yes, of course.</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  What will happen after Saturday?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No, well, what will happen Saturday is that there will be a government position</p>
<p>   on future handling of constitutional issues. That's what that means.</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  What will that be?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, what that means is that whatever is urged and advocated inside the</p>
<p>   forms of the party will be urged and advocated. People will be entitled</p>
<p>   to argue in Cabinet for anything they like but we will have a collective</p>
<p>   government position.</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  And that's decided by Cabinet after Saturday.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  It will be decided by Cabinet in the normal way. Now, that will apply to</p>
<p>   me. It will apply to Mr Costello. It will apply to Mr Reith. It will apply</p>
<p>   to everybody. But we have quite sensibly in this debate said we have a range</p>
<p>   of views in our party. It's an atypical issue. It doesn't come up every</p>
<p>   year. We're going to allow our Senators and Members a free and open vote.</p>
<p>   And I think that's been quite refreshing and it really has been debated</p>
<p>   with a great deal of civility. There's been an attempt by some of our critics</p>
<p>   and some in the media to beat up every word, every nuance of differences</p>
<p>   between Peter Costello and myself. I mean, he has a different than I do</p>
<p>   on this debate. After Saturday we'll still have different views internally</p>
<p>   about this issue. Of course we will. I mean, you can't run around the country</p>
<p>   advocating a republic and if there's a no vote, say well I no longer believe</p>
<p>   in it. I mean, that is disingenuous any more than.</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  Of course, but in essence there'll be no more constitutional conventions</p>
<p>   after Saturday. Not in a hurry, not at the usual pace, in a hurry, you're</p>
<p>   not in a hurry.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Hang on. It's very important that I not be, I'm not saying you're doing</p>
<p>   it, but I sort of . people don't run around trying to verbal me. I mean,</p>
<p>   I keep seeing people saying John Howard says no means no, John Howard has</p>
<p>   said this, John Howard, of course, has put all of that out of the [inaudible],</p>
<p>   you don't have to worry about it any more, the Prime Minister has assured</p>
<p>   us. I mean, I know everybody is jockeying for what I might call the 'expectational</p>
<p>   advantage'. If you are a yes voter you are desperate to get the direct electionists</p>
<p>   to believe the 'yes and more' philosophy. And if you are a no voter you</p>
<p>   don't want that to happen. So, I'm just choosing my words carefully and</p>
<p>   stating it as honestly as a I can and that is that yes will mean yes and</p>
<p>   I don't believe we'll ever have a direct election. And no means that I don't</p>
<p>   believe that the thing is going to come back in a hurry. Now, that is what</p>
<p>   I indicated last week. I'm not sort of shifting from that. People should</p>
<p>   not exaggerate that or take it out of context or run around and say, ah,</p>
<p>   it's all over, Howard has spoken. All I'm saying is that I believe that</p>
<p>   if the referendum is defeated on Saturday then I think the desire of the</p>
<p>   community and the desire of the Government will be for the issue not to</p>
<p>   be revisited in a hurry. Now, what happens after that I probably have to</p>
<p>   say I won't have any control over.</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  It's eleven to nine. This is 2BL ABC Sydney. Phillip Clark with you. My</p>
<p>   guest is the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Howard. We're talking about</p>
<p>   the yes and no cases and this final week of the campaign. You might have</p>
<p>   a view about it - 9333 1000 is the number. We've probably got time to take</p>
<p>   a few calls about it.</p>
<p>  You'd never be party, if I understand you correctly, to putting a case or</p>
<p>   to putting a proposition to the Australian people that involved a directly</p>
<p>   elected President.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No, I'm against a directly elected presidency. I would argue inside the</p>
<p>   Government and if it ever became a proposition for public debate and resolution</p>
<p>   I would campaign against it because I think that would create an intolerably</p>
<p>   rival power centres within our constitutional arrangement and I've always</p>
<p>   been against it. I believe in the Westminster system. I believe that you</p>
<p>   should have the executive and ceremonial functions of government divided</p>
<p>   between a titular head of State.</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  In essence, a directly elected President would upset that balance.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yes, that's my view, yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  Steve, good morning.</p>
<p>  CALLER:</p>
<p>  G'day John.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  G'day.</p>
<p>  CALLER:</p>
<p>  Just following on from what you were just saying. If you took the view that</p>
<p>   eventually Australia will go the way of a republic, wouldn't it be better</p>
<p>   to then support the 'yes' campaign as it is because that's the way that</p>
<p>   there's a lead to change? You were just saying that.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I understand your argument but see I don't.I agree with Benjamin Franklin.</p>
<p>   There are only two things in life that are inevitable - death and taxes.</p>
<p>  CLARK:</p>
<p>  ..[inaudible] 1st of July next year.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Death and taxes. And they're the things I believe in and I just don't think</p>
<p>   you can run around and say: oh look, something's inevitable. I don't accept</p>
<p>   the inevitability argument about anything. People living in Canada 25 years</p>
<p>   ago used to say to me a republic there was inevitable. My judgement of Canada</p>
<p>   is that the only thing that will make them awaken a republic in the near</p>
<p>   future will be if this country were to become a republic. I mean, it's the</p>
<p>   last thing they want to touch because it's now seen, amongst other things,</p>
<p>   as a point of distinction between them and the Americans. So you can't argue</p>
