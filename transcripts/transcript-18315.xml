The New Year is a time to look with gratitude on the good things of the last 12 months and look forward with confidence to the year that stretches before us.</p>
<p>It's a time for new hope and new beginnings.</p>
<p>Perhaps a personal resolution like spending more time with family or a big life decision like starting a university or TAFE course or opening a business.</p>
<p>Whatever the New Year holds for you, I trust it will be a safe and happy one.</p>
<p>Let's also remember that the 1st of January is the anniversary of Australian nationhood.</p>
<p>So let's also resolve to make this great country of ours even stronger.</p>
<p>Yes we've achieved remarkable things in our nation's journey.</p>
<p>But I firmly believe that even better days lie ahead.</p>
<p>Together let's make 2012 a year of which every Australian can be proud.</p>
