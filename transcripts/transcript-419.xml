DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS<br />
FOR THE PRESS CANBERRA<br />
RELEASED ONLY IN CANBERRA PR 125 1<br />
GOA<br />
0 The Minister for External Affairs, Mr. Menzies, said<br />
today that he regretted the use of force by the Indian Government<br />
to pursue its claim to Goa, and other Portuguese territories<br />
in India. Mr. M'enzies recognised that Indian public opinion<br />
felt strongly about the dispute, which was of long standing.<br />
However, it was the responsibility of nations to seek their<br />
objectives through legal processes or by peaceful negotiations<br />
in accordance with the United Nations Charter. Under the<br />
Charter all members have expressly undertaken to refrain from<br />
the threat or use of force in their international relations<br />
except in self-defence, individual or collective. </p>
