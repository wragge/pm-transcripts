PRIME MINISTER<br />
HELPING DEVELOPING COUNTRIES BENEFIT FROM GLOBALISATION<br />
Australia will contribute $ 1.5 million over 3 years to set up a new international trade<br />
and access facility under the Commonwealth umbrella.<br />
The facility would assist countries with the process of adjusting to and taking<br />
advantage of the opportunities of globalisation.<br />
The theme for this year's CHOGM, Trade, Investment and Development : the Road to<br />
Commonwealth Prosperity, recognises the profound effects of increasing global<br />
integration for developing and developed countries alike.<br />
Globailisation is helping break down barriers to trade and investment,' underpinned by<br />
technological changes bringing the world closer together. But not all countries have<br />
benefited to the same degree.<br />
The new facility will help countries identify and manage the potential economic and<br />
social impacts of trade and investment liberalisation and identify' new sources of<br />
revenue and market opportunities responding directly to the concerns of many<br />
developing countries about opening up to the global economy.<br />
It will also help them fuilfil WTO requirements and meet their other international traderelated<br />
obligations.<br />
The facility, to be administered under the Commonwealth F~ und for Technical<br />
Co-operation, will be developed to complement other assistance, including that<br />
provided through the WTO/ UJNCTAD and the South Pacific Forum.<br />
