    <content><![CDATA[<p>Twice on the AM programme this morning the Leader of the Opposition was asked whether or not the Labor Party would forward to the Australian Taxation Office documents in its possession relating to the GST tax affairs of the Queensland Division of the Liberal Party. On both occasions the Leader of the Opposition refused to commit the Labor Party to doing this.</p>
<p>Mr Beazley has an obligation to provide any relevant documents in the possession of his party to the Australian Taxation Office.</p>
<p>I have asked the Commissioner of Taxation to conduct a full audit of the Queensland Liberal Party's compliance with the GST legislation. That audit is not limited to the Groom FEC. It applies to all FECs and branches of the Queensland Division. It is a comprehensive inquiry. The Liberal Party has nothing to hide.</p>
<p>Mr Beazley has a duty to cooperate. If he refuses to do so he is yet again revealed as a shallow opportunist seeking to score political points.</p>
