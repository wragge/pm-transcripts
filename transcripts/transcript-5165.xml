PRIME MINISTER MONDAY,' 15-OCTOBER ' 197-9<br />
From the Press Office SUMMARY OF ACS"..<br />
Predictably, Bob Hawke won ALP pre-selection for Wills<br />
yesterday. The State's electors may have ended the promising<br />
career of woman Senator Jean Mel zer. She has been placed third<br />
on the Senate ticket, which going by previous elections, gives<br />
her only a slight chance of winning. Naturally, there have been<br />
cries of ' sexism'. But according to the Senator, there may have<br />
been another motive.<br />
Senator Mel zer:<br />
I don't know why I have been moved. So far as I am<br />
aware I have promoted ALP policy. I have worked as hard<br />
as I can in the electorate and in the Parliament. It<br />
appears that there is a group of about 20 people in the<br />
ALP in Victoria who for their own reasons wanted me moved<br />
and they achieved it.<br />
Question One story that I was told was that it was a political<br />
pay-back because you failed to support Simon Crean for<br />
pre-selection in 1977.<br />
Senator Mel . zer<br />
Well, I can't say that. But Simon Crean is in the group,<br />
and when that ballot came up I, after a lot of agonising<br />
over two very good candidates gave my vote to Clyde Holdpv4?<br />
Question Could you be reaping the pay-back?<br />
Senator Mel -zer<br />
Well you would hope not. You would hope that people in<br />
the ALP would be more adult, more attune to the sort of<br />
decisions that people have to make. I didn't make the<br />
decision lightly. It wasn't an easy decision to make, but<br />
I had to choose one of the two.<br />
Question_ In the light of what's happened, could it'. be said that<br />
the ALP is unsympathetic towards women, even a sexist<br />
party now?<br />
Senator Mel' zer<br />
I suppose tghe ALP has always in a sense been a sexist<br />
party;. but I thought we had come to the point where we had<br />
faced'up to the fact that we may have been sexist in the past,<br />
we understood that women being more than 50 per cent of the<br />
population deserve to have at least some representation / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Senator Mel Zer ( cont)<br />
We've got a.: report awaiting discussion at the next<br />
State Conference which talks about positive discrimination<br />
for women, which hardly makes sense when you remove the e<br />
only woman Federal politician you've got..<br />
Quest ion<br />
How many women actually supported you being moved to the<br />
number three position?<br />
Senator Mel . zer<br />
So far as I know, no women supported me being moved.<br />
Question So could it be. said that as far as this. decision is concerned<br />
it was a positive discrimination against women?<br />
Senator Mel zer<br />
, Yes.<br />
-Question How do you feel about what's happened. Do you feel bitter?<br />
Senator Mel zer-<br />
No. I don't feel bitter, because in politics all sorts of<br />
things can happen. I feel a bit shocked. I feel<br />
disappointed. But I am not dead. Not by a long shot.<br />
Firmly backing Senator Mel zer are members of the Women's Electoral<br />
Lobby. Interview with Victorian Secretary, Priscilla Todd.<br />
Said they will be advising people all over to support her as<br />
number one of the ticket, regardless of their political persuasions.<br />
