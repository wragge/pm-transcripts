PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 454<br />
17 February 1975<br />
Mr Anthony and Constitutional Conventions<br />
Mr Anthony's latest outburst suggests that his memory as well as<br />
his principles are on the down-turn.<br />
It is only a little more than a year since Mr Anthony was an ardent<br />
defender of the principle of Senate vacancies being filled by members of the<br />
same party as Senators who had died or resigned.<br />
So concerned was he about this principle that in 1973, before the<br />
retirement of Senator Prowse, he telephoned the Premier of Western<br />
Australia to see whether the principle would be followed. He was assured by<br />
the Labor Premier, Mr Tonkin, that a Country Party replacement would be<br />
appointed to replace a Country Party Senator who wished to retire.<br />
Mr Anthony's rejection now of this very proper Constitutional<br />
convention must be related to his desire to break yet another.<br />
It is quite apparent from the rushby thoe Countr 3iLrty to embrace<br />
Mr Lewis' in( efenSible stand on the issue of finding a replacement for<br />
a KSW L~ tbor Senator, that they are not at all sure of their numberp i" the<br />
Senate. Even without putting a Liberal or Country Party Senator in Mr Justice<br />
Murphy's place, the Opposition has the power to reject any Senate motion,<br />
including the provision of funds for the Government to continue in office.<br />
It is clear that the Opposition is not at all certain that it can<br />
control its own nuinbersa It fears that there may be one Senator within its<br />
own ranks who has a real respect for the Constitution and its Conventions,<br />
and who would stop short of voting outright for a rejection of Supply.<br />
In April last year some of the Liberal Senators were able to tell<br />
themselves that they had not actually voted against Supply. This time Mr<br />
Anthony is making sure that he will have the numbers to go the whole way,<br />
so that he can strike a determined blow at one of the most fundamental<br />
Constitutional Conventions: that the Senate does not determine who should<br />
be in Government, or when elections should be held. </p>
