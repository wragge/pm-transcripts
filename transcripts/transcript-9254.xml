PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPKECBY TE PRflIE MINISTR THE HON PJ KEATING MPl<br />
AUSTRALIAN EMBASSY, PARIS 8 JUNE 1994<br />
Thank you for inviting me to open this exhibition of<br />
works by the women of Utopia.<br />
I will pretend to no expertise in these works of art:<br />
but I will say this.<br />
The art and culture of indigenous Australians is a<br />
wellspring of the national culture, and the more we make<br />
it so the richer will we all be.<br />
Increasingly, I think, we respond to Aboriginal art and<br />
music and iconography, not out of curiosity, but out of<br />
recognition. However limited our understanding of their meaning, we<br />
see something in these paintings which is familiar to us<br />
whether it is the colours, or the abstracted landscape,<br />
or simply the " abrignalitya or RAustralianness" of the<br />
themes and design.<br />
A change has come about in our response to Aboriginal art<br />
and I think that means our hearts and minds are opening<br />
up to the place and the people. I think it means that we<br />
are learning.<br />
In a sense that is what is meant by " reconciliation" of<br />
the indigenous people with other Ausltii-aians.-<br />
It means not just making amends for past wrongs, great as<br />
the wrongs have been.<br />
Nor is it just a matter of compensation, though<br />
compensation is certainly due.<br />
Reconciliation means recognising how much we have to give<br />
each other.<br />
It is more than the giving and receiving of material aid<br />
important as that is. it is more than the goods of our<br />
culture in exchange for the destruction of theirs. U 762 </p>
<p>I think we will know we are making progress when our<br />
Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians alike find pre<br />
themselves thinking less about what can be given<br />
Aboriginal Australians, and more about what they can give That<br />
US. a cc<br />
tha.<br />
This exhibition might help to get us thinking along these Aboz<br />
lines. it<br />
These works of art by the women of Utopia shape our image hel;<br />
and understanding of the Australian landscape and Inte<br />
remind us how much they have always been shaped by<br />
Aboriginal culture. I mi<br />
ever<br />
They tell US something about who we are and where we f it UtOF<br />
in the story of the continent. priv Crea<br />
They are a reminder that it is important for AUJ of us,<br />
to have a story. This<br />
Holm<br />
And from that we might reach the conclusion that all our Aust<br />
stories will be richer if we bring them together. Aust<br />
We non-Aboriginal Australians have a lot to learn from Fina.<br />
the Aboriginal story which is inseparable from the land weale<br />
itself. noti<br />
It has taken us a long while to read the lesson in that, anot<br />
but I believe we are reading it now. it i<br />
There is also a contemporary lesson for us in the way<br />
Aboriginal people pass on their stories and the lessons<br />
they contain from generation to generation. Australian<br />
society generally will be stronger if we do the same.<br />
in turn, the lesson is that the best thing we can return<br />
Aboriginal Australians is a connection with the land.<br />
At one level, this exhibition is a testament to the<br />
resilience of Aboriginal culture a reminder that for<br />
all-the destrui-ci6 Eukopeans have wrought on it, their<br />
story and their art is stronger.<br />
it is therefore a reminder of just how important culture<br />
is in the scheme of all things and why governments and<br />
communities must make it a central concern.<br />
It is all the more ' appropriate I suppose that we should<br />
be reminded of this in Paris.<br />
At another level, the exhibition simply reminds us that<br />
at Utopia we have some great artists producing images of<br />
intriguing beauty and power.<br />
Either way, we are reminded of the heritage late<br />
twentieth century Australia has been delivered. It is a<br />
living heritage of immense benefit to our culture and to </p>
<p>our future, and we have a great responsibility to<br />
preserve and nurture it.<br />
Five That is why the late Robert Holmes a Court, Jane -t Holmes<br />
a Court, and the Holms-a Court Foundation deiserve our<br />
~ 1inksforthe support and encouragement th ey have given<br />
ese Aboriginal art and artists over the years.<br />
It is also why I am proud that the Australian Government<br />
age helped to bring this exhibition to France through the<br />
International Cultural Relations program.<br />
I might also say I take a little extra pleasure this<br />
