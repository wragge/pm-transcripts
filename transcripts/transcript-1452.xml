    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>P. M. No. 120/ 1966</strong></p>
<p>Her Majesty The Queen has bestowed posthumously the award of theÂ Victoria Gross upon the late Warrant Officer Class 2 Kevin Arthur Wheatley.</p>
<p>Warrant Officer Wheatley, who came from Sydney, was a member ofÂ the Australian Army Training Team Viet Nam from February, 1965 untilÂ his death on 13th November, 1965.Â </p>
<p>Warrant Officer Wheatley displayed magnificent courage inÂ attempting to rescue a wounded comrade, Warrant Officer R. J. SwantonÂ of Brisbane, in the face of an overwhelming Viet Gong force estimated at<br />more than a company.Â </p>
<p>On 13th November, 1965, a Vietnamese Civil Irregular DefenceÂ Group Gompany commenced a search and destroy operation in the Tra BongÂ Valley, Quang Nhai Province. Warrant Officers Wheatley and Swanton<br />accompanied the force with the right-hand platoon. Warrant OfficerÂ Wheatley sent a radio message to the centre platoon to report contact withÂ Viet Gong elements. The Viet Gong resistance increased in strength<br />until finally W-, arrant Officer Wheatley asked for. assistance.</p>
<p>While the centre platoon was working towards the action area,Â Warrant Officer Wheatley reported that VWarrant Officer Swanton had beenÂ hit in the chest, and requested an air strike and an aircraft for the evacuation<br />of casualties.</p>
<p>Warrant Officer Wheatley refused to abandon his dying comradeÂ when the company was forced to retreat. Under heavy machine gun andÂ automatic rifle fire, he managed to half drag, half carry Warrant Officer<br />Swanton from the open rice paddies to a wooded area some 200Â yards away.</p>
<p>During this time he was assisted by Private Dinh Do, a member ofÂ the company who, when the Viet Gong were only some ten yards away, urgedÂ Warrant Officer VWheatley to leave his dying comrade. Again he refused,Â and was seen to pull the pins from two grenades and calmly await the VietÂ Gong holding one grenade in each hand. Shortly afterwards, two grenadeÂ explosions were heard, followed by several bursts of fire.</p>
<p>The two bodies were found at first light next morning after theÂ fighting had ceased, with Warrant Officer Wheatley lying beside WarrantÂ Officer Swanton. Both had died of gunshot wounds.</p>
<p>Warrant Off icer Wheatley showed outstanding heroism, determinationÂ and unflinching devotion to a wounded comrade in the face of imminentÂ threat to his own life. His example takes a place of pride in the story of<br />Australia's fighting men.</p>
<p>CANBERRA,<br />14th December, 1966.Â </p>
