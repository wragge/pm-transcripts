FOR PRESS: PM. No. 41/ 1968<br />
PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S STATEMENT<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
The statement re-emphasises two important<br />
aspects of the approach of the United States.<br />
One is that the United States is firmly resolved<br />
to continue the military struggle to the point where it becomes<br />
recognised that talks designed to secure a just and lasting peace<br />
must take place. The other Is that the United States Is prepared<br />
now, as it has been prepared in the past, to enter into such talks<br />
at once, and is prepared to make concessions In an effort to bring<br />
about such talks. The Australian Government has repeatedly<br />
Indicated that it would support peace negotiations provided they<br />
held promise of leading to a just and lasting peace which effectively<br />
safeguards the security and freedom of choice of the people of South<br />
Viet Nam. The Australian Government regards this initiative<br />
by the American President as a further and significant exhibition<br />
of willingness on the part of the United States of America to engage<br />
in taflks aimed at that end.<br />
The halting of bombing over most of North Vt Let<br />
Nam, without insistence on an indication from Hanoi of a willingness<br />
to negotiate or of a reciprocal cessation of military build-up by<br />
North Viet Nam, will test the willingness of Hanoi to enter Into<br />
discussions aimed at a peaceful settlement of a genuine kind. We<br />
must all hope that this response by Hanoi Is forthcoming quickly.<br />
At the same time, the continuation of bombing<br />
in the area to the north of the battlefields will continue to hamper the<br />
flow of troops and war material from north to south and will not<br />
leave allied troops at too great a military disadvantage.<br />
