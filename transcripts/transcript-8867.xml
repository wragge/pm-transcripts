SPEECH BY THE PRIHE MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
STATE LUICKEON WELLINGTON 21 PAY 1993<br />
It Is both a great pleasure and an honour to be here<br />
today, in this famous capital of one of the worldIs<br />
oldest democracies.<br />
I want to thank you for the warm welcome Aunita and I<br />
have received.<br />
This is my first overseas trip since the Australian<br />
federal election on March 13. Jim Bolger was among the<br />
first to telephone and offer his congratulations on the<br />
Labor Party's victory, and in doing so he renewed his<br />
invitation to visit New Zealand.<br />
And I was very glad to accept.<br />
We are old friends, New Zealand and Australia. Good<br />
friends. More serious friends than In commonly admitted.<br />
It Is a friendship Which goes well beyond rivalries in<br />
sport. And boers and wines, and sheep and racehorses and<br />
Sopranos. And films.<br />
It Is a frlendship which goes to a history which we<br />
substantially share, to trade and migration over two<br />
centuries, to shared experiences In peace and war, shared<br />
legends, shared values and aspirations and in the<br />
1990s, perhaps more than ever before, shared<br />
international interests.<br />
Our friendship and the challenges we jointly face are<br />
reflected in the network of contacts which exist between<br />
Australian and New Zealand ministers, and which serves as<br />
a catalyst for continuoui dialogue across almost all<br />
areas of domnatic policy.<br />
In the Closer Economic Relations Treaty we have a model<br />
form of agreement which has brought both our countries<br />
great economic benefits.<br />
We have a long tradition of cooperation in defence.<br />
These days the requirements of oui common interests are<br />
mat by a process of Closer Defence Relations, through </p>
<p>TEL: 21. May. 93 15: 33 No. 006 P. 02/ 09<br />
2<br />
shared training, support and inf rastructure and annual<br />
metings of our defence ministers and service chiefs.<br />
The quality of our defence partnership and the value of<br />
the contribution we each make to wider regional stability<br />
and United Nations peacekeeping depends on our<br />
maintaining credible derenCe capabilities.<br />
These formal contacts are vital to the success of our<br />
relationship, yet in reality the strangth of that<br />
relationship Is substantially built on the less tangible<br />
facts of cultural exchange.<br />
Indeed nothing has established the bond so much as the<br />
simple movement of people between our two countries. For<br />
so long there has been a steady flow these days In<br />
Australia's direction, but at other times In our history<br />
towards New Zealand. A~ nd with the flow has come.<br />
knowledge and famlrarity, end we have learned froA% one<br />
another something about the contours of the Australasian<br />
mind. For generations there has also been a trans-migration of<br />
ideas both ways across the Tasman: in literature and the<br />
arts, in academia, and in the realms of popular culture.<br />
Australian culture continues to be enriched by the<br />
presence of talented and original New Zealan4 filmmakers,<br />
artiste, musicians and writers.<br />
On the other hand Australian popular Culture has for a<br />
long time permeated N~ ew Zealand.<br />
I had no Idea until very recently that New Zealanders of<br />
Jim Bolger's generation were raised on ODad and Dave" and<br />
used to sit in school singing " The Road to Gundagal" and<br />
* Xookaburra Sits In the Old Gum Tree". And those of an<br />
earlier generation than Jim's read the old Australian<br />
bushman's bible The bulletin.<br />
It has been a benign and democratic influence we've had,<br />
I'm sure.<br />
Just as the pervasive Influence in Australia of certain<br />
New Zealand political satirists has been a boon to us<br />
all. In truth, where things really matter, at the heart of the<br />
relationship there really is a common cultural heritage:<br />
and tha irrefutable measure of this to In those<br />
democratic Institutions which srve and symbolise the<br />
faith In democracy and freedom on which both our nations<br />
are built.<br />
it seems to me that paramount among all the things which<br />
unite us is the belief that Australia and N~ ew Zealand<br />
should be countries in which democracy, freedom and<br />
equality of opportunity are exctendled: and if there Is one </p>
<p>T2EL1:. May. 93 15: 33 No. 006 P. 03/ 09<br />

thing which characterises the story of both Countries it<br />
Is the pursuit of those goals.<br />
That wes the other great trans-Tasman migration the<br />
migration of progressive political ideas which heas gone<br />
on for more than a century.<br />
A lot of the people who carried these ideas with them<br />
were people from my side of politics: but there has<br />
always been something of a consensus on both sides of<br />
the Tauinan on both sides of politics that Australia and<br />
New Zealand should be lands of opportunity In the front<br />
ranks of social progress. loa the front rankis of<br />
progressive nations.<br />
There Is no better example of this ambition than the<br />
pioneering a centuary ago of women's suffrage. Now<br />
Zealand and Australia especially South Australia led<br />
the world; and New Zealand, I have to conicede, led South<br />
Australia by one year.<br />
This year New Zealand is commmorating the centenary of<br />
womlen's suffrage. Today It has been my pleasure to<br />
present, on behalf of the Auatralia-New Zealand<br />
Foundation, a small contribution to the celebrations.<br />
We start fron what I think is inalienable commn ground.<br />
But of course It woul4 be a mistake of epic proportions<br />
to Imagine that there are not basic differences between<br />
US. I'm Inclined to think that these differences have their<br />
origin* in environment end geography as much anything<br />
else. From the beginning you can see In the work of those<br />
colonial landscape artists who travelled Australia and<br />
New Zealand, two entirely different countries,<br />
And I think there in no doubt that in New Zealand they<br />
saw a landscape which conformed more readily to European<br />
ideas of grandeur anid beauty than Australia did.<br />
For all their understaable attachment to Britain and<br />
Europe, Australitans have Inevitably been shaped by a land<br />
which to eMphatically lika no othar,<br />
It has shaped our character and our institutions and it<br />
will continue to do so and all the more as we at last<br />
come to just terms with the indigenous people of<br />
Australia. For, In the process of reconciliation we have commenced,<br />
Australians have begun to increasingly appreciate the<br />
ancient and extraordinarily rich and adaptive culture of<br />
Australian Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, and<br />

the contribution they have made to our underatanding of<br />
ourselves and the continent we inhabIt.<br />
Australia'. location so close to South-East Asia has also<br />
affected Australian perceptions. For a long while It<br />
gave Australians a feeling of insecurity: but In recent<br />
times that Is changing and, In keeping with our best<br />
interests, we are engaging with Asia on a cotusercial,<br />
political aria cultural level as never before.<br />
Australia is also demographically different of course:<br />
Jim Bolger notwithstanding, Australia has always been<br />
more Xrlsh; since the Second World war More European, and<br />
recently more Asian,<br />
The development of a culturally rich, pluralist Society<br />
and a remarkably tolerant one I count as one of<br />
Australia's greatest national achievements, and one of<br />
our great assets In the internatianalisation of the<br />
Australian economy.<br />
We see our future as being very much bound up with our<br />
region with Asia and the Pacific and we see our<br />
diversity as a great strength in this.<br />
These same considerations have played a significant part<br />
In the recent devlopmsent of the debate about the best<br />
means by which the unique reality of contemporary<br />
Australia might be best expressed and synbolised, arnd<br />
whether or not the time has coma for a Federal Republic<br />
with an Australian Head of state.<br />
There is also a growing awareness that how well Australia<br />
does in the world depends to a conslderable mxtent on how<br />
we are known in the world, and that depends in part on<br />
the symbols and sense of our Identity.<br />
our two nations have Inevitably developed different<br />
perceptions and policies.<br />
The Australian government and people have continued to<br />
place a high value on our security alliance with thio<br />
united States. New Zealand has chosen a somewhat<br />
different path.<br />
Domestically, the micro reform processes we have both<br />
pursued over the past decode have been pursued with<br />
different emphases and we have been led to different<br />
conclusions in a number of importanL policy areas.<br />
Mly Government i* committed to a social democratic<br />
Australia, a free market economy underpinning an<br />
egalitarian and inclusive social policy.<br />
I don't think we neoed be anxious about the points at<br />
which our national lives diverge. There have always been<br />
differences. The friendship is made stronger by<br />
understanding them by appreciating them. </p>
<p>21. May. 93 15: 33 No. 006 P. 05/ 09<br />
Living in a vast and dLveQrse Continent, and, no lesS, in<br />
a federal system of government, one learns that lesson<br />
early in life.<br />
We are two nations in a world which ia undergoing<br />
profound change. Remote as we may seem trom much of the<br />
turmoil, both Australia and New Zealand have recognised<br />
the need to engage with it and the roles we can play.<br />
We have joined in International efforts to bring peace<br />
and security to the people o? those countries which have<br />
expexienced tragic and appalling war.<br />
It eems to me that those same ideals of democracy and<br />
freedom which are the cornerstone of our two countries'<br />
history are present with our young men and women now<br />
serving with the United Nations forces in Cambodia and<br />
Somalla. And I believe it is appropriate at this point to<br />
congratulate New Zealand for the role it is playing on<br />
the Security Council as it attempts to find effective<br />
international responses to extraordinarily complex<br />
situatlons. As you will know from our discussions this morning<br />
Australia will continue to commit itself to the processes<br />
of CER which have already been so successful in<br />
stimulating trade and investment between our countries.<br />
There will not be quick and easy solutions to everything,<br />
but everything that should be addressed will be addressed<br />
and progress will be made.<br />
Our determination to continue with our bilateral efforts<br />
is matched by our commitment to securing a successful<br />
conclusion to the Uruguay Round.<br />
we confirmed this in our diScusSiona this morning.<br />
We also jointly recognise the need to build on the<br />
economic growth now occurring in the Asla-Pacific region.<br />
I shall make the point this evening in Auckland that we<br />
should build on the success of CER to integrate more<br />
fully with the wider regional economy.<br />
I am greatly encouraged by what has been achieved in<br />
recent months to advance the progress of APEC.<br />
For both our countries APEC can be the avenue of the<br />
expanded coumercial relationship we seek with the region.<br />
The dialogue has now advanced to a point where I am<br />
confident that we will soon begin to see some practical<br />
measures emerge to permit liberalisatlon of trade ana<br />
Investment within the Asia-Pacific ragion.<br />

<p>TEL: 21. May. 93 15: 33 No. 006 P. 06/ 09<br />
Trade and investment cannot take place In a vacuum. I<br />
know we are agreed that in advancing our economic<br />
relations with Asia anid the Pacific we should also be<br />
seeking to Increase our political and cultural<br />
Interaction. I know we are both aware that our shared Interest in the<br />
region will depend in part on the crucial factor of<br />
stability and prosperity.<br />
We can work together to strengthen regional seCurity and<br />
in so doing secure the basis of our own prosperity and<br />
that of Lhe region. And I believe that our suaccess in<br />
this will enrich our people In more than material ways.<br />
I take the view that our efforts Ina Asia and the Pacific<br />
represent the greatest peacetime challenge Ina our<br />
nation's history.<br />
It Is the dawning of a new epoch In our history and, In~<br />
no small way I believe, the fulfilment of our destinies.<br />
There are those Who see in this challenge a threat to our<br />
culture and values.<br />
I say that ae we succeed as we are and as we will we<br />
shall see that our success Is proof of the strength of<br />
those values.<br />
That io why I say we will be enriched in move than<br />
material ways because It will lift our confidence, our<br />
self-esteem and our faith in those things which have<br />
emerged from our experience as Australians and New<br />
Zealanders. Thank you. </p>
