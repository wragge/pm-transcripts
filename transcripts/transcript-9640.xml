PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
LUNCHEON IN HONOUR OF FRANJO TUDJMAN, PRESIDENT OF CROATIA<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, TUESDAY 20 JUNE 1995<br />
It is a great pleasure to welcome you here to Australia.<br />
This first visit by a Croatian head of state is obviously a significant event. It is<br />
a cause for celebration among Australians of Croatian descent, who have<br />
contributed so much to Australia in the past, and who are now especially<br />
well-placed to help build a new and more substantial relationship with<br />
Croatia. Croatian-Australians have played an important part in Australia's history.<br />
Since the Ballarat gold rush of 1854, more than 100,000 Croatian-Australians<br />
have contributed their labour, skills and innovation to Australia's economic<br />
and social development.<br />
Croatian immigrants and their families have helped to open up rural Australia<br />
and to develop our resource and agricultural industries. Croatians became<br />
K miners in New South Wales, cane cutters in Queensland, farmers and market<br />
gardeners in Western Australia and other states.<br />
Croatian fishermen from the Croatian Littoral and Dalmatia helped found the<br />
Australia fishing industry.<br />
Today in South Australia, a significant portion of the industry is run and<br />
owned by immigrants from Croatia. The best-known fisherman among them<br />
is Dean Lukin, the weightlifting champion who won a gold medal for Australia<br />
at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.<br />
Croatian grape growers and wine makers, who first arrived here late last<br />
century from Dalmatia, helped found the Australian wine industry. Today that<br />
industry is worth over $ 1 billion in exports annually. </p>
<p>This year a Croatian-Australian, John Kosovich, received an award in the<br />
Order of Australia, for his contribution to the Australian wine industry.<br />
Croatian labourers and tradesmen, who came to Australia from the displaced<br />
persons camps of post-World War Two Europe, battled the isolation and<br />
hardship of the logging camps, mines, rural construction teams and the<br />
Snowy Mountains Electricity Scheme. They helped to build the modern<br />
Australia. Here in Canberra, the work of Croatian-Australian workers and craftsmen is<br />
all around us, including in this Parliament House.<br />
The entire marble work in the National Library of Australia was erected by<br />
Croatian stonemasons from the island of Brac.<br />
And the Embassy which you will be opening tomorrow, Mr President, is a very<br />
tangible sign of this contribution.<br />
Along the way, Croatian-Australians have introduced their love of soccer,<br />
through players such as this year's player of the year, Mark Viduka.<br />
And a number of Croatians are leading players in our own football code,<br />
Australian Rules.<br />
Croatian Australians have also been prominent in the arts.<br />
Earlier this year I visited Berlin, where 1 was very proud to attend a<br />
performance of Wagner's opera, Tristan and Isolde, conducted by a rising<br />
Australian musician of international stature, Simone Young Simone has a<br />
Croatian family background.<br />
So the skill and talents of Croatian Australians have contributed in important<br />
ways to the modern Australia you are visiting, Mr President.<br />
The commitment shown by communities like the Croatian-Australians to<br />
preserve cultural diversity and respect it, helps foster Australia's sense of<br />
nationhood. Croatian-Australians have applied their skills and culture for Australia's<br />
benefit. And they have done this, as Australians must, with their loyalty first<br />
to Australia.<br />
One issue concerns all Australians about the countries emerging from the<br />
former Yugoslavia: the appalling loss of life and suffering taking place there.<br />
Many Australians have been touched by it, not least because this country is<br />
home to several hundred thousand immigrants from the former Yugoslavia,<br />
and to their descendants. </p>
<p>We understand the pain the conflict causes citizens of the Croatian-<br />
Australian community and other communities with links with parts of the<br />
former Yugoslavia.<br />
Despite the suffering and the horrors which have been deeply felt here, it has<br />
been a tribute to Australians of Croatian, Serb and other former Yugoslav<br />
descent that they have not allowed the pressures and tensions of this<br />
appalling conflict to spill over into their own country.<br />
We share in Croatia's happiness in becoming independent.<br />
That was not achieved easily. And as we ourselves know, making changes to<br />
old practices and habits of mind, introducing economic policy changes and<br />
building a prosperous and just multicultural society is not easy.<br />
Independence carries with it responsibilities as well as rights and powers. It<br />
must deliver security in the broadest sense to all the people of the country:<br />
peace, prosperity, respect for the equality and dignity of all citizens<br />
regardless of their ethnicity, religion or language.<br />
The standing of Croatia and the former republics of Yugoslavia, and the<br />
legacies of their leaders, will ultimately be judged by the success of<br />
democracy within their countries, and the contribution they make to building<br />
peace and stability in their immediate region through cooperation with their<br />
neighbours. lIa m sure all those present here -and all Australians -join mein wishing you<br />
well in contributing to these objectives and in our hope that you can use your<br />
position to build peace in the former Yugoslavia.<br />
You have arrived at a time when Australia is enjoying the results of<br />
fundamental changes in our foreign, trade, economic and social policies. I<br />
y hope you will find much that Croatia and its business people will want to<br />
associate with.<br />
Today, Australia is one of the fastest growing of all the industrialised<br />
economies and forecast to remain so throughout this year.<br />
We are a major trading nation, increasingly looking to take an active role in<br />
the Asia-Pacific region, which now accounts for half of the world GDP.<br />
Already three-quarters of our exports go to this region, over 30 percent of<br />
them manufactured exports.<br />
I believe these developments in Australia and our region are significant for<br />
Croatia as well. Australia is a good place from which to do business in the<br />
Asia-Pacific region. </p>
<p>As the world's 13th largest economy, with a sophisticated research capacity<br />
and a deep resource base, Australia has much to offer European countries<br />
such as Croatia. And the Croatian-Australian community is well placed to<br />
contribute to the development of trade between us.<br />
I am sure all Australians will join me in wishing you and your country well in<br />
your endeavours to secure a peaceful, cooperative and prosperous place in<br />
the international community.<br />
Finally, let me assure you that we look forward to building on the many<br />
personal connections which exist between our two countries to create a more<br />
vital and substantial relationship with Croatia.<br />
I wish you and Mi s Tudjfrian well for your vlslt.<br />
I now invite the Leader of the Opposition to join me in welcoming you to<br />
Australia. Ends </p>
