The Prime Minister Julia Gillard today paid tribute to Australian boxing legend Lionel Rose.</p>
<p>Mr Rose was the first Indigenous Australian to win a boxing world title in any weight class when he defeated Japanese boxer Masahiko Harada in 15 rounds in Tokyo in 1968.</p>
<p>In recognition of this achievement he was named Australian of the Year in 1968, the first Indigenous Australian to be awarded this honour. Mr Rose was also made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the same year.</p>
<p>Lionel Rose was an Australian champion in every sense of the word, and an inspiration to all of us.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister extended her deepest sympathies and those of the Australian Government and community to Mr Rose's family, friends and the Australian boxing community. </p>
