43UTALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS DECEMBER 30,' 1975<br />
ADDRESS AT DECLARATION OF THE WANNON POLLS<br />
I said 2* 0 years ago that I was the representative in the<br />
Federal Parliament of every person in the electorate no<br />
matter how they voted.<br />
That has remained true in all the years since.<br />
In the'job that I now have, it is -important to restate that<br />
principle in a wider context.<br />
The Liberal and National Country Parties were returned to<br />
Government, not to govern only for those who voted for them,<br />
but to gbvern for all Australians in the best way we possibly<br />
can, making judgements concerning the Government of the country<br />
with the interests of every person in mind fio matter where<br />
they live and no matter what their work.<br />
Our task is to govern fairly, honestly and justly for all<br />
Australians to the best of our ability.<br />
That is the task to which I pledge not only myself but the<br />
Government which I lead. 0000000 </p>
