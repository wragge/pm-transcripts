<p>STASK FORCE ON CO-ORDINTATION IN IVELTFARE AND IEALTTH<br />
TERMS OF REFERENCE<br />
1. Against the background of the Government's<br />
Federalism policy and its concern at the proliferation<br />
and overlap of Commonwealth services and programs in<br />
the health, welfare and community development fields,<br />
the Task Force shall examine and report on<br />
the identification of particular services and<br />
programs, currently being undertaken by the<br />
Commonwealth, in the health, welfare and<br />
community development fields, which could. be<br />
better delivered by a State, local government<br />
or voluntary agency and the administration of<br />
which could be transferred to the States;<br />
the possibilities ' or elimination of<br />
individual programs and consolidation into<br />
broader bused programs in a manner which<br />
enables more efficient and economic delivery<br />
whether by the Commolnwealth or the States,<br />
and the establishment of appropriate<br />
consultative arrangements with the States,<br />
local government and voluntary agencies on<br />
future policy planning, administration and<br />
service delivery in the health, welfare and<br />
community development fields;<br />
the possibility of achieving better<br />
co-ordination and avoiding overlap by more<br />
specific definitions of programs, eligible<br />
projects and eligible organisations, having<br />
in mind that co-ordination could be effected<br />
at the State and local government level<br />
without Commonwealth involvement; and<br />
the continuing machinery which should be<br />
established to co-ordinate social policy<br />
development at the Commonwealth level.<br />
2. The Task Force shall<br />
include in its consideration available analyses<br />
and recommendations arising from other inquiries<br />
including the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty,<br />
the Royal Commission on Australian Government<br />
Administration, the Administrative Review<br />
Committee, and the Committee on Care of the Aged<br />
and the Infirm; and<br />
take account of views expressed by consumer<br />
groups and. voluntary agencies, noting the<br />
Government's support of the concept of maximum<br />
realistic community participation in health/<br />
welfare programs funded by the Commonwealth.<br />
3. The Task Force should present an interim report by<br />
31 October. </p>
