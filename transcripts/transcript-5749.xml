FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 16 FEBRUARY 1982<br />
TASMANIAN FIRES<br />
The following letter was sent to the Premier of Tasmania<br />
today:<br />
My dear Premier,<br />
Irefer to your telex of 15 February to me and the Premier of<br />
Victoria concerning the possible use of the Modular Airborne<br />
Fire Fighting System installed in a RAAF Hercules aircraft<br />
for fire fighting in the present Tasmanian fires.<br />
I also have your telex of 16 February in which you advise that<br />
your Government has found it necessary to declare a State<br />
wide special emergency.<br />
The Commonwealth views with concern the serious fire situation<br />
both in Tasmania and Victoria. I am particularly distressed<br />
to learn of the extent of the emergency in your State. I note<br />
from your telex that you have arranged for my Office to be<br />
kept informed of developments and I am grateful for this action..<br />
The Commonwealth obviously stands ready to do what it can to<br />
assist in combatting the immediate danger presented by the<br />
fires. To this end I have asked the Minister for Defence to<br />
assess what immediate Defence resources are available in<br />
Tasmania should you need to call on them. I understand that<br />
your emergency services are in touch with the Natural Disasters<br />
Organisation in Canberra so that any requests for assistance ca~ n<br />
be responded to promptly and in a co-ordinated manner.<br />
I am advised that the difficulties associated with deploying the<br />
Hercules and the associated equipment to Tasmania have been<br />
explained to your officers and that Tasmanian fire authorities<br />
accept that the use of the Hercules would not be a suitable means<br />
of fire fighting at present.<br />
I have also seen the response to your telex of 15 February<br />
from the Premier of Victoria and I am pleased to see that the<br />
Victorian authorities have offered to assist in mobilising smaller<br />
aircraft and providing technical assistance to help you in<br />
your efforts to control the fires. / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
I extend our best wishes to all those engaged in the fire<br />
fighting and I sincerely hope that the crisis will soon be<br />
over. Yours sincerely,<br />
( Malcolm Fraser)<br />
The Hon. H. N. Holgate, MHA<br />
Premier of Tasmania<br />
HOBART TAS 7000 oOOo--</p>
