Leonard Charles Robson was in early life a<br />
distinguished student and Rhodes Scholar for New South<br />
Wales. He served with the First A. I. F. and won the<br />
Military Cross, The service for which he would be most remembered<br />
was that which he gave to the independent schools of<br />
Australia in a variety of ways for more than 40O years. He<br />
was one of the outstanding headmasters in recent times in<br />
Australia, his period of leadership at Shore ( Church of<br />
Eingland Grammar School, North Sydney) extending from 1923<br />
to 1958. He was awarded a C. B. E. in 1955. He was one of<br />
the moving spirits in the formation of the Headxnasterst<br />
Conference. His years of formal retirement saw no slackening<br />
in his work for the independent schools. It was largely<br />
because of his initiative and enterprise that the Industrial<br />
Fund for the Advancement of Scientific Education in Schools<br />
was established; The Fund's income is contributed by<br />
industry and commerce and has been used to help a considerable<br />
number of Conference schools. When the Commonwealth<br />
initiated its own scheme in 1964 for science grants to<br />
schools, Mr. Robson became the first Chairman of the<br />
Advisory Committee on Standards for Science Facilities in<br />
independent Secondary Schools which the Government set up<br />
to aid it in the administration of the new scheme,<br />
Mr. itobson's services to education included, at<br />
the same time, his i'ork as a member of three boards the<br />
Soldiers' Children Education Board, the Board of Secondary<br />
School Studies and a contribution for which the Commonwealth<br />
was particularly grateful, the Commonwealth Scholarships<br />
Board. </p>
