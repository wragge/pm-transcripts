COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. HAROLD HOLT, M. P.,<br />
ON<br />
VIETNAM<br />
Ministerial Statement 1 5 NOV 1967<br />
i BR AV,<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debate?, 17 October 1967]<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT ( Higgins-Prime<br />
Minister&gt;-by leave-There have been, as<br />
honourable members know, two major<br />
political and military matters in South East<br />
Asia before the Cabinet in recent months.<br />
They are the British decision to limit its<br />
role east of Suez and the situation in Vietnam.<br />
The Government has had these great<br />
and serious matters under continuous review<br />
and has been having a close exchange<br />
of views with our allies and friends. I have<br />
today to inform the House of certain<br />
decisions the Government has taken on the<br />
most immediate and the most pressing of<br />
these two issues; that is, the situation in<br />
Vietnam. Before dealing with this in some detail,<br />
may I refer briefly to the British Government's<br />
plans to reduce in stages, Britain's<br />
military presence in Malaysia-Singapore.<br />
This has to be seen against the background<br />
of our own judgment that security and<br />
stability in South East Asia are of first<br />
importance for Australia and we recognise<br />
the need to act positively to maintain that<br />
security and stability and also to assist in<br />
the development of the region.<br />
Consultations with our allies and friends<br />
in South East Asia on these matters are<br />
continuing. My colleagues and I have just<br />
14519/ 67 had the benefit of discussions here in Canberra<br />
with the New Zealand Prime Minister,<br />
Mr Holyoake. I am happy to say there is<br />
a close identity of views with New Zealand<br />
on our common strategic interests in South<br />
East Asia. There is much still to be done,<br />
however, to shape a long-term programme,<br />
in concert with friendly and interested<br />
governments, to the changes which will<br />
follow from the British land withdrawal<br />
from the Malaysia-Singapore region. This<br />
will ' take some time, because the pace is<br />
niot set by one nation alone, ' but by several,<br />
each with a different set of problems.<br />
In the meantime, our immediate preoccupation<br />
is with Vietnam. This is the<br />
most urgent of our current extertial problems,<br />
and it is basic to all our aspirations<br />
for security in Asia. It is in Vietnam that<br />
aggressive Communist pressure-the greatest<br />
political danger in Asia today-is most<br />
severe and direct, and it is in this area<br />
that we must, for the time being, concentrate<br />
much of our defence effort and<br />
resources. There the tide of Communist<br />
expansion is being checked and turned.<br />
But, with no sign as yet emerging that the<br />
North Vietnamese are ready to negotiate,<br />
it is the view of our allies and ourselves<br />
that the military pressure must be sustained </p>
<p>and indeed increased if we are to secure<br />
even more decisive results in the fieldresults<br />
which might lead North Vietnam<br />
to negotiations.<br />
There have been recent visits by Ministers<br />
to Vietnam and to the United States, including<br />
my own visit to Washington last<br />
June when I had detailed discussions with<br />
President Johnson, Mr McNamara, Mr<br />
Rusk and various military authorities, on<br />
the outlook in Vietnam. The President sent<br />
two special envoys to this country-Mr<br />
Clifford and General Maxwell Taylor-who<br />
gave us a valuable survey of progress being<br />
made and of likely trends. Their's was a<br />
range of visits to other countries allied in<br />
Vietnam. As I said earlier, Mr Holyoake has been<br />
here for on the spot talks. Since then, the<br />
Minister for External Affairs ( Mr Hasluck)<br />
has had discussions with President Johnson<br />
and other senior members of the Administration<br />
in Washington in the last week or<br />
so. From all these exchanges the Government<br />
has had the best information and the<br />
most considered assessments to add to its<br />
own. These have strengthened the Government's<br />
confidence that its decisions on our<br />
commitment in Vietnam have been soundly<br />
based, and they have confirmed that we are<br />
making significant progress. There can be<br />
no question of our determination to pursue<br />
our efforts through to the end until we have<br />
achieved our objective-peace and security<br />
for South Vietnam and South East Asia.<br />
I am confident the majority of the Australian<br />
people will continue to give their<br />
support to this policy and will want us to<br />
make a measured contribution which will<br />
give effective support to the allied effort.<br />
The public debate on Vietnam goes on in<br />
various forms here and abroad and, because<br />
it does, I want to re-state very briefly<br />
why we are there and why we must continue<br />
to honour our commitment to support<br />
South Vietnam. Let me repeat, in simple<br />
terms, why we are in Vietnam. We are<br />
there because we believe in the right of<br />
people to be free. We are there because<br />
we responded to an appeal for aid against<br />
aggression. We are there because security<br />
and stability in South East Asia are vital<br />
to our own security and stability. We are<br />
there because we want peace, not war, and<br />
independence, not serfdom, to be the lot<br />
of the peoples of Asia. We are . there because we do not believe that our great Pacific<br />
partner, the United States, should stand<br />
alone for freedom. We will continue to be<br />
there while the aggression persists because,<br />
as a free and independent nation, we cannot<br />
honourably do otherwise.<br />
There are, from time to time, chargesall<br />
unwarranted and quite baseless-that the<br />
Government seeks only a military solution,<br />
that it is determined to win in the tiringline<br />
and that this is our only objective. I<br />
say this: We are determined, and so are<br />
our allies, that we will not be defeated in<br />
-the firing-line. Fortunately there is no real<br />
risk that we can be. The military situation<br />
has been improving steadily, and if we<br />
sustain our progress we are daily securing<br />
the time and enlarging the opportunity for<br />
a response by Hanoi to the repeated offers<br />
to negotiate for peace, free of conditions,<br />
with honour and regard for the rights of<br />
the South Vietnamese people.<br />
In Manila last year, South Vietnam and<br />
its allies, including Australia, pledged themselves<br />
to continue to resist aggression until<br />
it ceased and, at the same time, to seek<br />
earnestly, by every means, a just and lasting<br />
peace. This has been the consistent position<br />
of the United States, the Australian<br />
Government and the other allies in Vietnam,<br />
and it remains our hope that a political<br />
rather than a military solution will be<br />
found. We remain, as we have been at all<br />
times, flexible so that even the faintest<br />
prospect of peace talks can be encouraged.<br />
We have on several occasions suggested<br />
that the Geneva Agreement of 1954 might<br />
provide a suitable basis. There may be<br />
other ways. The allies are ready to talk<br />
about them if they open up and to keep<br />
on taking initiatives themselves.<br />
But the North Vietnamese leaders have<br />
turned down every approach, public and<br />
private. They have done no more than<br />
declare that talks ' could be' or ' might be'<br />
held if the United States stopped bombing<br />
North Vietnam unconditionally, unilaterally<br />
and permanently. But having said that, the<br />
North Vietnamese leaders have not said<br />
that they would then enter into talks. But<br />
they have made it clear that even if talks<br />
did begin . they would keep up their own<br />
military effort. So we must press on with<br />
our action in Vietnam to ensure that the<br />
people of South Vietnam shall not be conquered<br />
by aggression and shall have the </p>
<p>right to choose their own way of life and<br />
their own form of government. This was<br />
our first and only military objective; it<br />
remains our only military objective.<br />
It is easy to suggest that allied strategy<br />
in this area is dominated by an exaggerated<br />
fear of Communism, but there is no<br />
evidence that Communist forces in South<br />
East Asia have given up their revolutionary<br />
drive. The South Vietnamese people could<br />
not stand on their own against a coordinated<br />
Communist penetration. Our<br />
recent assessments confirm our judgment<br />
that if South Vietnam fell to a Communist<br />
system of government, Communist pressures<br />
against the neighbouring States would<br />
continue, and in all probability would<br />
increase. North Vietnamese regular forces<br />
have already been identified in Laos and<br />
guerillas trained in North Vietnam are<br />
already operating in North East Thailand.<br />
The independence and achievements of the<br />
countries of . this region would be at risk if<br />
aggression succeeded in South Vietnam.<br />
I do not think we should ever lose sight<br />
of the fact that this war in Vietnam is a<br />
limited war-it is not being fought on the<br />
pattern of declared wars of the past, where<br />
all the stops were out and a patriotic fervour<br />
and a face to face challenge of survival<br />
were like battalions in action on the home<br />
front. It is far away in personal terms, but<br />
not nearly as far as the battlefields of the<br />
Middle East or Europe. It is ugly-what<br />
war isn't?-and it is prolonged. Yet Australian<br />
forces fighting there are achieving<br />
two immediate results. They are helping to<br />
hold the aggressor in check and they are<br />
giving the South Vietnamese security and<br />
specific aid for the betterment of their<br />
country. They are also manning a front line<br />
of freedom for all of South East Asia.<br />
The recent elections bear witness to South<br />
Vietnam's constitutional and political<br />
advancement. The economic and social progress<br />
under the South Vietnamese Government's<br />
Revolutionary Development Programme<br />
is good. Australia has contributed<br />
more than $ 12m in non-military aid and<br />
is spending $ 2.2m more this financial year.<br />
Our civilian training programme, under<br />
which more than 300 Vietnamese have<br />
come to Australia, will continue. We are<br />
assisting in other major projects in Vietnam, including water supply and technical aid for<br />
schools. Our three surgical teams continue<br />
to do splendid work. None of this could be<br />
permanent if the military shield were not<br />
wide and strong, and the wider and<br />
stronger it is, the better the progress of the<br />
military campaign and the civil programmes<br />
will be.<br />
To that end, therefore-with increasing<br />
progress in mind-the Republic of Vietnam<br />
and its allies have been conferring on what<br />
the situation may require. Each government,<br />
with the benefit of the discussions<br />
which have taken place, will make its individual<br />
decision. Already some of us have<br />
decided to commit additional forces at this<br />
time so that effort may be increased and<br />
so that the military initiative that has been<br />
won can be sustained and the pace of<br />
political, economic and other development<br />
quickened. The United States has already<br />
announced that it will add some 45,000<br />
men-nineteen battalions-to the total of<br />
460,000 it has deployed in Vietnam. Today<br />
the New Zealand Prime Minister has<br />
announced on behalf of his Government<br />
New Zealand's increase-in the form of an<br />
additional infantry company. Other allied<br />
governments are corsidering what more<br />
they can do. For their part the South<br />
Vietnamese are to increase their forces by<br />
some 60,000 men.<br />
The Australian Government has therefore<br />
decided, after consultation with our<br />
allies, to increase the Australian forces in<br />
Vietnam, and I now set out for the information<br />
of the House how this will be done.<br />
An additional battalion group with helicopter<br />
support will be provided from Australia<br />
for the Task Force. This third<br />
battalion group, which will be made available<br />
in November/ December, will have the<br />
effect of almost doubling the offensive capability<br />
of the force and adding considerably<br />
to its operational effectiveness. A tank<br />
squadron-about 250 men of all rankswill<br />
be made available. With their mobility<br />
and powerful sustained fire power, our<br />
medium Centurion tanks will provide better<br />
support and protection for the force. Additional<br />
helicopters with crews and servicing<br />
personnel will be added to the Iroquois<br />
squadron to provide the Task Force with<br />
more tactical mobility. A small number of<br />
Skyhawk pilots and a maintenance element </p>
<p>will be made available on loan for operational<br />
service with the United States Marines<br />
in South Vietnam. An additional engineer<br />
construction unit will be provided to undertake,<br />
for a limited period, specific works<br />
in the Task Force area. The establishments<br />
of headquarters and units will be increased<br />
by some 125 all ranks because of operational<br />
needs in the area.<br />
These additions ill raise the numbers<br />
of the Australian force in Vietnam from<br />
6,300 to over 8,000 men, and will make<br />
them much more effective as a balanced<br />
force. The Government has been able to<br />
do this because of the steady expansion in<br />
-the defence forces over the last few years<br />
by increased recruiting and by national service.<br />
Australia has now the most powerful<br />
and effective defence forces it has ever had<br />
short of war-time mobilisation. The<br />
Government is able to undertake these additional<br />
commitments in Vietnam without<br />
detracting from the strength and readiness<br />
of the forces deployed elsewhere in South<br />
East Asia. Our forces already in Vietnam<br />
have acquitted themselves superbly well. We<br />
have units from all three Services in the<br />
theatre and they have earned the highest<br />
praise from our United States, South Vietnamese<br />
and other allies.<br />
In Phuoc Tuy province, for instance,<br />
which has been a Vietcong stronghold for<br />
many years, the Australian Task Force has<br />
been confronted with a highly mobile<br />
infantry force, well trained and equipped with good quality weapons. Since our forces<br />
were deployed in this area in June 1966,<br />
they have established a high degree of<br />
security in the province, and have opened<br />
up strategic communication routes. Altogether<br />
this force has been in over sixty<br />
major operations since June 1966. In addition,<br />
our air and naval units have played<br />
a very useful role in support of overall<br />
allied operations.<br />
I believe that those who have served,<br />
and are serving, including their parents and<br />
families, are keenly aware of the issues at<br />
stake in Vietnam and know that Australia<br />
has ' to be there', with the same high<br />
courage, as Australia has been in other and<br />
wider wars, in the cause of freedom.<br />
The young national servicemen, who<br />
have responded magnificently to the grave<br />
tasks that have fallen to them, have identified<br />
themselves so completely with our<br />
regular soldiers that there is no discernible<br />
difference. They have clearly shown their<br />
recognition that they are performing a<br />
national duty. They are Australian soldiers,<br />
and I am sure they would not have it otherwise.<br />
I am sure, too, that this House will be<br />
ready to pay all our fighting men, regulars<br />
and national servicemen alike-the soldiers,<br />
sailors and airmen of Australia, serving in<br />
Vietnam-the honour that is their due, and<br />
that this House will support the additional<br />
contribution to their strength -that I have<br />
now announced on behalf of the Government.<br />
