PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, WESTHEAD HOSPITAL, 20 APRIL 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, did it take much, I mean you've had<br />
two Cabinet Ministers now talking about resignation from the<br />
Cabinet PM: Now, don't let's blow up this latest one. There was<br />
all the, Barry was a little bit concerned that, you know,<br />
perhaps not enough was going to be done in the science<br />
area. He had a talk to me about it and everything's happy,<br />
no problems at all. So you're really battling to make much<br />
out of that one. I mean, as I keep saying, if you want to<br />
look for problems go to the other side of politics.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Keating has threatened to cut off money to<br />
New South Wales at the next Premiers Conference if the<br />
Greiner Government endorses petrol tax. Have you endorsed<br />
Mr Keating's<br />
PM: Well, obviously he said we'll have to look at it at the<br />
Premiers Conference when we take into account what happens<br />
with the disbursement of funds and we will have to look at<br />
it. Simple as that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is New South Wales doing the right thing by<br />
trying to reduce<br />
PM: What we've got to do in this country at the moment, as<br />
you know, and what was central to the Statement that we<br />
brought down, is to reduce the level of activity in this<br />
country somewhat. It's too high because we've been sucking<br />
in too many imports and this idea of just thinking that you<br />
can spend more and more by raising taxes a bit to undertake<br />
more activity is not consistent with the sort of approach<br />
that is necessary to get the economy off the boil a bit.<br />
So, that's what our concern is.<br />
JOURNALIST: What did-you think about what's happening to Mr<br />
Macphee? PM: Well, I've expressed my concern about that. I don't<br />
always agree with Mr Macphee but I think he does, as I've<br />
said, represent decent small Liberal strands within that<br />
Party and I think what you're seeing there is part of a move<br />
to the extreme Right within the conservative parties. Now<br />
that's their business. I mean I don't want to get involved<br />
in it any more than to say that. I think it would be<br />
unfortunate if Mr Macphee were to be dumped, but that's<br />
their business. we'll go on with the business of running<br />
the country.<br />
ends </p>
