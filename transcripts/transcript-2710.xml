FOR PRESS: PM. No. 95/ 1972<br />
NURDA APPOINVr' ENTS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. William<br />
McMahon,<br />
The appointment of Sir John Overall, as<br />
Commissioner, and Mr Robert Broughton Lansdown, as Deputy<br />
Commissioner of the National Urban and Regional Development<br />
Authority, was welcomed today by the Prime Minister,<br />
Mr McMahon. Mr McMahon said Sir John had been appointed Commissioner<br />
until 14 July 1973, and* Mr Lansdown had been appointed Deputy<br />
Commissioner for a period of 7 years.<br />
Sir John was the founding Commissioner of Canberra's<br />
planning and development authority, the National Capital<br />
Development Commission and in this role had guided the city's<br />
growth for nearly 15 years.<br />
Mr McMahon said Sir John had previously announced his<br />
intention to retire next July on his 65th birthday but had<br />
offered his services as a consultant to the Commonwealth<br />
should they be required.<br />
Mr Lansdown had been an Associate Commissioner of the<br />
N. C. D. C. since 1965 and had an intimate knowledge of land<br />
development and urban economics.<br />
Mr McMahon said the Government believed it was most<br />
fortunate in having two men of the calibre of Sir John and<br />
Mr. Lansdown to head the new Authority.<br />
EMBARGO: </p>
<p>2.<br />
He said that Sir John had been appointed<br />
Commissioner of the N. C. D. C. in 1958 to carry out the task<br />
of getting a new Authority launched to plan and develop<br />
Canberra and only those who knew Canberra prior to 1958, could<br />
realise just how successful he had been.<br />
