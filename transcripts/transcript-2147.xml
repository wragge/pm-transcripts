FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 87/ 196<br />
FOUR WEEKS'.{ EAVE FOR PUBLIC SERVICE<br />
Follo~ wing is-the-text-, of-a -telegram despatclied this<br />
morning to Mr. H. J. Soutar, Secretary of the A. C. T. U.<br />
" At the conclusion of the discussion on 1 December<br />
with the joint deputation of the Australian Council<br />
of Trade Unions, the Council of Commonwealth<br />
Public Service Organisations and the Australian<br />
Council of Salaried and Professional Associations,<br />
I said that I would present the claim which you had<br />
submitted for four weeks' annual leave in the<br />
Commonwealth Public Service to the Cabinet as<br />
quickly as possible. My colleagues and I have<br />
now discussed the claim. The Government has<br />
concluded that having regard to existing relevant<br />
circumstances it would be inappropriate to grant<br />
an extra week's annual leave to the Commonwealth<br />
Public Service at this time. I have sent a copy of<br />
this telegram to the President of the Council of<br />
Commonwealth Public Service Organisations and the<br />
President of the Australian Council of Salaried and<br />
Professional Associations. J. G. GORTON<br />
PRIME MINISTER." i<br />
