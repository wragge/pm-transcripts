TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE COLONIAL MOTOR<br />
LAUNCESTON 22 OCTOBER 1984<br />
PM: Well this long awaited statement on taxation policy<br />
by the Liberals is deserving of and will receive the contempt<br />
of the Australian people. Someone making an application for<br />
a loan from a bank for an advance to start a pie stall would<br />
have to provide more details to their bank manager than these<br />
people have been prepared to advance to the people of Australia.<br />
They have had 18 months to bring forward a tax policy. They<br />
had talked about precision and certainty so that the electorate<br />
would know where they were going. This is a document totally<br />
lacking in precision. But even what is there is a certain<br />
prescription for economic disaster. I understand that they<br />
have said this time no fistful of dollars, they have substituted<br />
for the fistful of dollars a fistful of unsigned, blank cheques.<br />
Let's look at; hat the impact would be. If you look at in terms<br />
of impact on inflation, the increase in indirect taxation that<br />
they would have to undertake to make up for the selective cuts<br />
in direct tax would imean just for about $ 2.5 billion extra impact<br />
on charges. In other words, if you had another 4 billion increase<br />
in indirect taxes that would put up the CPI by 5 percentage points<br />
which would mean in turn that your budget outlays would increase<br />
by $ 2.5 billion. So you are not only going to have taxation<br />
policies which will be discriminatory in the electorate, uncertain<br />
in their impact, but are going to be disastrous in terms of<br />
economic management because it will put up inflation by<br />
several percentage points-which will mean higher wage claims<br />
and which will in turn mean substantially increased budget<br />
outlays. Whichever way you look at this policy it is as<br />
far as you can make any sense of it all, a prescription<br />
for economic disaster. It is as I say, an insult to the<br />
intelligence of the Australian electorate, totally lacking<br />
in any spelling-out. In the area of a consumption tax they<br />
haven't even made up their mind what sort of consumption tax<br />
they want to talk about, and they will have an enquiry about<br />
that. As I have said I have been waiting for this statement<br />
which we have been promised for so long. I believe it would<br />
be a fizzer, it is arguably the greatest fizzer that any political<br />
party has ever produced in an important area of policy in a<br />
federal election.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there anything good in it at all?<br />
PM: Yes for us it is marvellous. I find it as I indicated to<br />
you that I was looking forvard to it. I would be talking aboit<br />
tox for a very long period. I said as you will rocall ea;: lier<br />
Uu~ -CI-V u~ rl ~ 3j-I1U VL </p>
<p>2.<br />
PM cont: today that I wasn't going to indulge in a hypothetical<br />
snack, I was waiting for the full meal. We will be feeding off<br />
this as will the Australian people be feeding off it for a<br />
considerable period of time after the 1st of December<br />
JOURNALIST: What is your reaction to the income splitting<br />
proposal? PM: Well the income splitting proposals are uncertain in terms<br />
of when, or if, or how. What they would mean in their present<br />
imprecise form would be a discrimination against a large section<br />
of the Australian tax payers who wouldn't get the benefit of them.<br />
But this is the problem that you have with the whole of this<br />
mish-mash of a wish list. You can't describe it as much more<br />
than wish list. I mean, what do they tell you about income<br />
splitting. What will be the dimension of it. When will it be<br />
introduced. No-one can make any sensible statement about what<br />
they are proposing because they haven't in fact given the electorate<br />
any details, as I say of the dimension, or when they say, they<br />
say these things that we list, now this long list of desirable<br />
goodies, we will think about introducing them as budgetary<br />
circumstances permit. No w what have they told us about<br />
possible budgetary circumstances under a coalition government.<br />
What do you say now about all the promises they have made. ARe<br />
all those promises cancelled or are they not. The 2.5 billion<br />
directpromises that have already been made, the other 3.5, 4<br />
depending upon what significance you attach to some of the prorises<br />
they have made, is that 4, 5, 6, 7 billion dollars of promises of<br />
additional expenditure, are they still there, or are they not,<br />
And they say that their capacity to introduce any of these things<br />
will depend upon a combination of expenditure restraint and economic<br />
growth. Now I have gone to those two elements. I mean I ask you<br />
to look at their own conditions for implementing this mish-mash<br />
of a wish list. They say the conditions are: expenditure restraint<br />
and economic growth. Alright, let's look at the first one,<br />
expenditure restraint. They liave given ycu this great list up<br />
until this point of additional expenditure they are going to<br />
undertake. Where is their restraint going to come from Do<br />
we now put a line through everything they have promised in regard<br />
to additional expenditures. Or are they still there on the table.<br />
Does the Australian electorate out there say to themselves tonight<br />
well we have got a promise from. Mr Peacock in regard to the railway,<br />
in regard to his other list, now the submarines, all these other<br />
things, the 2.5 billion firm, specific promises they have made,.<br />
are they on the table or are they not. Now in regard to the ". oss<br />
of revenue, obviously they are sticking with their assets test and<br />
lump sum tax position, so they are denying themselves revenue ; Ln<br />
that way. Or are they still on the table. We don't know. They<br />
say themselves that their capacity to do anything in the tax<br />
area depends upon expenditure restrain and the Australian electorate<br />
is left in a total sea of confusion. about that. WE will want to<br />
know, and the people of Australia will want to know which of your<br />
promises have meant anything. Have you just been fibbing to the<br />
Australian electorate up until today when you have made these promises<br />
or haven't you been. Which promises do you mean you will stick to.<br />
So that's On the expenditure restraint side. Now economic growth.<br />
If you want a prescription for a return to the past of the Liber: als<br />
and the National Party for economic stagnation, it is here. Because<br />
they ask you to Understand what the overall economic implications<br />
are. They are saying that if they move to these substantial reduction:.<br />
in direct tax that haive been talked about here, it will be made up </p>
<p>WUL ZZOt IV, ZZ 0111 1000: 3q MW i 3.<br />
by increases in indirect tax. Now as I have gone through some<br />
of the figuring with you about that. If you take the listing<br />
of income splitting and other direct tax benefits that they say<br />
they may think about giving. They add up to over $ 4 billion, so<br />
that wouldirequire about $ 4 billion increase in indirect taxation.<br />
Now as I have pointed out to you in my opening statement, if you<br />
increase indirect tax by 4 billion that would increase the CPI by<br />
percentage po~ hts. Now just look at the economic implication. s<br />
of that. It sends inflation crazily through the roof, goes into<br />
wages but of itself it would require another $ 2.5 billion in<br />
expenditure-outlays because as * you know something like 60 per<br />
cent of budget outlays are e ither directly or indirectly indexed<br />
So this is the economic madness that is proposed here. You will<br />
havo a policy which will push up the consumer price index very<br />
significantly, and the very pushing up of the consumer price<br />
index means that your expenditure outl~ iys arc going to have to<br />
rise in this case by the order of 2.5 billion, but you remember<br />
the first condition, the first condition of bringing them in<br />
is that you are goinS to have expenditure restraint. YOu'have<br />
got the circle of economic lunacy. The condition of giving effect<br />
to your direct tax cuts is expenditure restraint, so you are<br />
going to increase indirect taxcs in way which pushes up expenditure<br />
outlay increases be'causo that's a condition of bringing in your<br />
indiroct taxes. Now in their last period of government. This is<br />
what they did. A very substantial increase in the reliance upon<br />
indirect taxes. In the last 2 Howa~ rd budgets, sales tax recei'~ to<br />
increased by 1.4 bil: lion dollars, or 66 per cent and that was<br />
right at the very heart of their economic problems. They had<br />
no wages policy. That sort of stuff fed into your wage claims<br />
and your substantial increases and so you got economic stag~ nation.<br />
It doesn't matter which way you look at this policy. If you look<br />
at it in terms of the precision that you are entitled to expect.<br />
I mean how long do they need. They have had 18 months. How<br />
long do they need. No precision at all. And as I say if you<br />
importantly not just at that aspect of it, but do what you hav: e.<br />
got to do and think about the economic imlications of this for<br />
overall macroeconomic policy it is a prescription for a return<br />
to the disaster of the past.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the Qibera-l<br />
Party also includes a child care rebate, there has also been<br />
considerable pressure for The introducticn of some form<br />
-of child-care rebate: Would your government in any way<br />
consider introducing some sort of child care rebate.<br />
PM: Now just let's go back to-. them. You are saying it is<br />
listed. ' Of course, it is listed. But Just about anything<br />
in the area that you would like to think about gets a guernsey<br />
but is therco any 5tatement to the Australian people that it<br />
will be introduced, when and how, what the timetable is.<br />
According to how budgetary circumstances permit. Is that<br />
supposed to be a policy. You can't say that that is apolicy<br />
in regard to child care rebates. Anyone can have a wish list.<br />
But the Australian people haven't been told in election that<br />
that is what goingj to happen. Now in-respect of oursolves<br />
you can have a total contrast . VYa don't have to go intco this<br />
election and say well look we have go wish list about what we<br />
would like to do somo time, perhapst maybe, if the budgutary<br />
circumstances permit. WE have been in control of the budget UlI </p>
<p>since we have been. We inherited the $ 3.6 billions but we have<br />
stuck to the broad situation that we put to the electorate 2 years<br />
ago because now in a matter of days the people of Australia are<br />
not going to have to speculate about whether our budgetary<br />
circumstances will permit some significant achievement in the<br />
area of tax'policy. We have created the budgetary situation,<br />
we have reduced the budget deficit by billion since we<br />
have been in and reducing the budget deficit by getting the<br />
economic growth, by having the mix of policies in the fiscal<br />
area, we have produced a factual tax cut for every Australian<br />
tax. payer which is the equivalent of an $ 11 a week wage increase.<br />
So there you have got the definiteness of Labor in government<br />
having tax policies related to and integrally part of an overall<br />
macroeconomic policy which has produced record economic growth<br />
and out of that we have been able not to hypothesize with the<br />
Australian people but say to them that as a result of successful<br />
macroeconomic policy we have got this fiscal policy which means<br />
you are going to have the first real tax cuts that this country<br />
has enjoyed for years. If we had merely given them tax indexation<br />
it would have been $ 1.3 billion in a full year. The cost of our<br />
real tax cut in a full year is 2.1 billion.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, how does the imprecision of tht Liberal's<br />
tax plans differ from you repeated statements of that Labor's<br />
tax plans will be revealed once the tax review has been<br />
completed in 1985?<br />
PM: It is in this way, as I have just said, I have given you<br />
an explantion of what we have done. We haven't hypothesized<br />
we have produced the first, efffective real tax cuts for a long<br />
period of time. Then we have said, of course, and we have<br />
been saying it for some time, there will need to be a review<br />
of the tax system within a framework which follows on what<br />
we have done. WE are not hypothesizing saying well perhaps<br />
as budgetary circumstances permit. WE have promised the<br />
Australian people there will be no overall increases in taxes.<br />
We made that promise and we have been able to that within a<br />
deficit reduction situation and in aposition where we have<br />
reduced, reduced taxes in the way, in the direct area that<br />
we have talked about. Now we have said, not just in an election<br />
context, we have been saying for some months, that the existing<br />
tax system is not perfect and that we will have a tax review<br />
within the framework that we have put, of giving hard tax<br />
reductions on the table, not meandering about saying it may<br />
happen. They are there, they are on the table. They'll be<br />
in people's pockets in a matter of days.. Now we have said<br />
then promise no further increase in the overall level of taxes<br />
now we will, together with you the community, examine whether<br />
we can make the overall tax system more fair and more efficient<br />
and importantly and there is the great distinction between the<br />
Labor Government and these people opposite that we have said<br />
that we will sit down with the relevant sections of the community<br />
and work out tax reform which will meet the criterion of efficiency<br />
and equity. Now to make any system of tax reform work in a<br />
non-inflationary and equitable way you've got to have the trade<br />
union moverment involved in consultation and co-operation in that<br />
tax reform. Otherwise by definition it. will not work. If you have </p>
<p>P. M. cont...: tax reform based upon cutting down direct taxes<br />
and having billions of dollars increase in indirect tax, which<br />
is what's foreshadowed here, and you haven't got the support of<br />
the trade union movement, then all that happens is that inevitably<br />
you CPI will go up only by the direct result of those increase in<br />
indirect tax, but because they'll also be fed into the wages<br />
system. Because you've got to look at this in total. You haven't<br />
got just a tax policy here presented to you. You've got to take<br />
it into account as part of their overall economic approach which<br />
involves the abolition of centralised wage fixation and the abolition<br />
of the accord. So in their tax reform approach they will have<br />
no co-operation with the trade union movement. By their own<br />
deliberate decision they've thrown that out the window. So you<br />
will have the increase in the CPI as a result of putting up indirect<br />
taxes. But as I've said you'll also have that flowing through, through<br />
increased wages claims, which will -be able to be obtained in many<br />
areas. Now there's the difference. To answer your question there<br />
is the difference between our approach to tax reform and the<br />
Opposition's. It is clear to everyone that if you're going to<br />
have effective tax reform which looks at any change of the balance<br />
between direct taxes and indirect taxes, you must have the<br />
co-operation of the trade union movement. Otherwise it's a<br />
recipe for disaster. And theirs is a recipe for disaster.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, there are three things Mr Peacock<br />
has been definite about he'll have no capital gains, death<br />
duties, or wealth taxes.<br />
You don't quote him correctly. Let me quote him correctly<br />
so that you've got it " no new capital gains taxes".<br />
JOURNALIST: Alright. Well can I a: ssume from your last answer<br />
that through this campaign you'll continue to maintain the position<br />
that those issues are issues for the tax review that's coming up.<br />
I have made it clear, Geoff, during the campaign and during<br />
the quite early stages of the campaign we'll go into more detail<br />
about how we will approach this issue. You won't have to wait<br />
very long for that. But I still go back to the basic point which<br />
is right now on the table in front of the whole Australian<br />
electorate. They were waiting and expecting to get a detailed<br />
tax policy, they haven't got it, they have not got it. With us<br />
you've got the results flowing into the pockets in a very short<br />
period of time and the total difference between us and our opponents<br />
that in any tax review we can make it work because it will be done<br />
in consultation with the business community and the trade unions.<br />
They will not be able to do that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister what scrt of timetable are you looking<br />
at for announcing details of your tax review. Will it be in the next vz. a<br />
or Oh I wouldn't say the details of the tax review will be going<br />
more broadly than that. I'll be talking about it probably this week<br />
I would think. 13ut lot me make it clear, what our immediate priority<br />
will be obviously, as you will want and the electorate will want will.<br />
be a detailed analysis of our opponents. After all they've been tollin: </p>
<p>6.<br />
P. M. cont...: us all that here it was going to be unveiled on<br />
Monday. That Monday 22nd was the big day. No, we will spend some<br />
time in analysing it with you and with the electorate in a bit more<br />
detail in the next few days,.<br />
JOURNAIST: I don't mean to be pedantic but what<br />
Well, why not?<br />
JOURNALIST; when you say broadly what exactly do you mean by<br />
that. When you tal. k about your own taxaetion policy?<br />
Well what I'm saving is thiat will, I'll be talking to<br />
the Australian people Aout how we intend to approach this is what<br />
I was talking about. TWhen I said more broadly I was asked about the<br />
details of it I said we will be broadlyputting to the ' Australian<br />
people what our approach is in a way whicha, of cour,.-e, will bo<br />
much different to what1C's been done here in the basic sense. That<br />
we will be able to show. to the Australian people that our approach<br />
will be done cooperatively with the coimrunity, including the<br />
trade union movement, so that our Lax policy will be seen as an<br />
integral part of overall macro-economic policy. This policy is<br />
a prescription for economic recession. ours will be part of the<br />
process of continued economic growth.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister does that mean a tax summuiit as was<br />
suggested by one person last week?<br />
Well I'll be going to that issue when I address these things.<br />
JOUR-NALIST: Prime Niniter althotigh you are promising this<br />
detailed analysis later on this week..<br />
P. M4.: Well could I just interrupt you Gary, when I say detailed<br />
analysis, what irzi saying is that we'll be addressing ourselves<br />
to the issues that have been raised so far about our tax policy,<br />
those things that have be-n raised, and h.-ow we will go about the<br />
process with the cormunity of undcrtaking that review.<br />
JOURN4ALIST: I was talking about your promise to have a detailed,<br />
to provide a detailed analysis, of your reaction to the Opposition'-s<br />
taxation policy. From what you'v. boan sa . ying it seems to me<br />
that your reading of the policy Llrnost defies a detailed analysis.<br />
I mean you can't really have it botCh ways.<br />
Wlell that's a fair point. I mean. I was really saying that<br />
we are going to dissect, we're having a meal as it were if we could<br />
us that analogy. And there are cjreat gulps that you can havc! and<br />
get satisfaction from. But we want to cio through it in very fine<br />
detail -sentence by sentence each part of the niish-rna. h, evory<br />
promise that's listed and put the intcrn~ il inconsistencies one<br />
the other. I mean it really does warrant some detailed teteti<br />
that respect. I mcan the ba. sic poinit remains quite clearly t~ hat<br />
there are no details about . Yhen and ho-a. A-, nd having said thi~ t </p>
<p>L-LJ V 0I. L ILj VV<br />
P. m. cont x because that's indisputable,, there are nevertheless<br />
elementst conceptual elements# of w'hat are there which will get~<br />
from us veny very detailed analysis. But I come back on the<br />
question of detail, as I said' in* opening it some bloke was goin.-g<br />
to the bank to get an advance to put up a pie stall outside the<br />
Flinders Street ; station-held be required -to give more details -than<br />
they'~ ve put up here. And this is supposed to be a tax policy for the<br />
nation. JOURNALIST: Dar Hawke can I just arsk you about tax splitti ng proposals<br />
which you'oiytuhdo very brief ly.-in 1974 -when -you were<br />
Pres'ident of the ACTU, the ACTU supported tax splitting what'Is<br />
your position... 19m, not addressing myself to that at this point at all.<br />
I'm simply saying that in regard to what we have to deal with here<br />
you've got a vague proposal put which, if taken to its . liimits, let<br />
me say would involve a cost of about $ 2.2 billion. That vwould be<br />
the cost of all income splitting. Or. if you take it to the figure<br />
of 18,000, about one and a half billion dollars. Now. I'm not<br />
going to fall into the g~ reviouLA; error of these people and say,<br />
oh yes .1 think income nplitting is a good. idea. There it is.<br />
You can't do that in this' sort o . area_ You've got to, particularYly<br />
for these people they've had 18 months to come up with a gjreat<br />
detailed policy and that's the very best. they can do we wonlt be<br />
rez; ponding on the run, and say oh yes we think income spl'itting is<br />
a good idea. Yes we* ll put that to our l. ist. We don't opera~ te<br />
that way. We've in fact been thexe in Government, we've produced<br />
t hc goods. And in the tax area it has produced a very substantial<br />
real. tax cut. That's a benefit to everyone. What they aro.<br />
talking about is a very divisive, discriminatory sort of benef! it<br />
perhaps one day,. maybc, soiie Lima for soneone.<br />
