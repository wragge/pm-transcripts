    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Rudd Government congratulates Australian-born and educated biologist, Professor Elizabeth Blackburn, who has been named the Nobel Prize winner for Physiology or Medicine.</p>
<p>Professor Blackburn's Nobel Prize has been awarded "for the discovery of how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase".</p>
<p>Telomeres are the protective caps on the ends of our chromosomes. Research into telomeres and the enzyme telomerase has the potential to deepen our knowledge of ageing and disease.</p>
<p>Professor Blackburn is Australia's first female Nobel Laureate and our eleventh Nobel Prize winner.</p>
<p>This is a great day for Australian science.</p>
<p>Professor Blackburn's achievements are an inspiration for all Australian scientists and those considering a career in science, especially young women.</p>
<p>As a nation Australia has made frequent contributions to the world's great discoveries and Professor Blackburn's work continues that proud tradition.</p>
<p>She must also be acknowledged for her reputation as an Australian scientist who places as much weight on the ethics of research as on the practice of science.</p>
<p>Professor Blackburn now stands in great Australian company alongside the likes of Sir Howard Florey, Professor Peter Doherty, and the most recent winners Dr Robin Warren and Professor Barry Marshall.</p>
<p>The Australian Government recognised Professor Blackburn's extraordinary work with the awarding of the Australia Prize in 1998 - the predecessor to the Prime Minister's Prize for Science.</p>
<p>Professor Blackburn is joint winner with collaborators Professor Carol W. Greider and Professor Jack W. Szostak. </p>
