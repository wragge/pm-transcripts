EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRINS MINISTER<br />
OFFICIAL OPENING OP THE BICENTENNIAL EXHIBITION,<br />
SHIPWRECK I<br />
PERTH 7 JANUARY 1988<br />
Premier Burke<br />
Your Excellency<br />
Mr Chairman<br />
Distinguished Guests<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
This is a remarkable and indeed, unique eventnot<br />
just in the context of Australia's Bicentenary Year,<br />
and the vast range of activities associated with the<br />
Year and not only in the context of Australia's maritime<br />
history but, in its wider context as a tribute to the<br />
indomitable human spirit<br />
our tribute, our salute, to the countless thousands of<br />
men, women and children who, over the course of four<br />
centuries braved the mighty oceans and perished around<br />
our shores.<br />
This remarkable Exhibition bears the simple and poignant<br />
title SHIPWROCKI<br />
That, in itself, is a striking reminder of one of the<br />
central messages which the commemoration of the Bicentenary<br />
is designed to bring to the people of Australia, and<br />
especially to our children.<br />
And that message, or at least an important part of the<br />
message, is about the appalling hardships, the dangera, the<br />
difficulties and the suffering involved in the early part of<br />
the European chapter in the story of modern Australia.<br />
And this Exhibition conveys that message in a manner which<br />
is as moving as it is memorable.<br />
I need only mention two of the displays to make the point. 0037' 78 </p>
<p>2.<br />
There is the display dealing with the Batavia, wrecked off<br />
the west Australian coast in 1629 wore than 350 years ago.<br />
That, in itself, is an incredible story of human evil, of<br />
tyranny, of cruelty and fanaticism.<br />
yet, at the same time, a story of human endurance, courage,<br />
loyalty and faith.<br />
At both those levels, it is almost a parable of the human<br />
condition.<br />
And here I again make-the point, so relevant to the<br />
Biceritenary -that we have to recognise that, throughout<br />
human history great achievement has been all too often<br />
accompanied bygreat wrongs and that our history is no<br />
except ion.<br />
I mention a second example from this Exhibition.<br />
The wreck of the Sirius.<br />
Sirius was Governor Phillip's flagship in the First Fleet.<br />
it then became the supply ship for the struggling colony at<br />
Sydney Cove its lifeline.<br />
The wreck of the Sirius off Norfolk Island in 1190 struck an<br />
almost mortal blow to a settlement already on the brink of<br />
Starvation. Yet it did survive.<br />
And its survival against appalling odds is an epic story of<br />
human endurance and the achievement of the human spirit.<br />
Yet it was the achievement, not of history's heroes, but the<br />
achievement of outcasts and exiles.<br />
And it is through reflecting on these things that all of us<br />
will be able to learn and understand better the true meaning<br />
of the Bicentenary.<br />
And that is why this Exhibition is so important.<br />
So superb an Exhibition is of course a remarkable<br />
achievement in itself.<br />
SHIPWRECKI is one of three Australian exhibitions of the<br />
four projects the International Cultural Corporation of<br />
Australia is managing for the Australian Bicentennial<br />
Authority. This is n itself noteworthy, because in the<br />
past Australia had tended to import major exhibitions from<br />
overseas. 003779 </p>
<p>it is part of the biggest program of Gallery and Museum<br />
exhibitions ever staged in Australia. This is consistent<br />
with the spirit of the Bicentennial Arts Program which<br />
celebrates the achievements of Australia's performing and<br />
visual artists.<br />
And it is the first national recognition of the<br />
international pro-eminence of the marine archaeologists of<br />
the Western Australian Museum and the Queensland Museum.<br />
The Australian public has never before been afforded such an<br />
opportunity to see the fascinating results of the work of<br />
our marine archaeologists, or to see the early European<br />
history of our continent through this evidence of the past.<br />
Jim Leslie has mentioned some of the people and<br />
organisations who have contributed so much.<br />
I add my thanks to his, and, I wish also to acknowledge the<br />
support of scholars and governments in Europe and, in<br />
particular, the Government of the Netherlands.<br />
I congratulate the organising museums the Museum of<br />
Victoria in association with the Western Australian Museum<br />
and the Queensland Museum ( Mr Bob Edwards, Director, Museum<br />
of Victoria, The Hon Mr Justice Kennedy, Chairman of the<br />
Board of Trustees, Western Australian Museum, and Mr John<br />
Bannister, Director, Western Australian Museum are here<br />
today). on behalf of the people of Australia I thank the lenders of<br />
priceless exhibits, particularly the Rijksauseum and The<br />
Royal Coin Cabinet in The Netherlands.<br />
Among the Australian contributors, Australian Airlines is<br />
the major sponsor of the-Bicentennial Exhibition program.<br />
other national sponsors include the new Australian National<br />
maritime Museum.<br />
I also thank Western Australian supporters, members of the<br />
National Planning Committee for the exhibition, and'of<br />
course the International Cultural Corporation of Australia.<br />
Especially welcome has been the assistance given by a<br />
consortium of Dutch companies:<br />
ABN Australia Limited<br />
Amro Australia Pty Ltd<br />
Heineken Australia Pty Ltd<br />
Holdhuys Australia Pty Ltd<br />
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines<br />
Nedlloyd Australia Pty Ltd<br />
Phillips Holdings Industries Pty Ltd<br />
Royal Nedlloyd Groep NV<br />
Seabridge Australia Pty Ltd<br />
in particular, let me mention some of our Dutch friends<br />
whose personAl contribution has been critical. 003780 </p>
<p>4.<br />
I pay personal tribute to his Excellency mr Joris Vos,<br />
Amba ssador of The Netherlands, who ralled Dutch support<br />
for the project; to Professor Ernst van den Bogaart of<br />
the Schiff commission, Department of Foreign Affairs in<br />
The Netherlands who provided valued scholarship and<br />
assistance with Dutch loans; and to Mr Hank Ebes, a<br />
special consultant and print collector who conducted the<br />
delicate negotiations to borrow the Caspar Boudaen Cameo<br />
and arranged for the Batavia Replica Sloop to tour<br />
Australia in 1988.<br />
Let me make one final point.<br />
one of the greatest treasures of the Exhibition is theple<br />
which Dirk Hartog inscribed and nailed to a post near Sark<br />
Day in 1616. It was taken to Holland in 1697 and returns<br />
now to Australia for the first time.<br />
The plate is the oldest known European artifact associated<br />
with Australian history.<br />
But the point I make is this:<br />
The exhibition presents an extraordinary inheritance of<br />
world cultural property.<br />
Europeans set their mark on this continent 372 years ago.<br />
But the oldest artifact made by the Australian aborigine<br />
the oldest so far discovered is 18,000 years old.<br />
As it travels throughout Australia, this Exhibition will<br />
give our people a new perspective and new insights into<br />
their history.<br />
But there are other perspectives, other insights, that can<br />
enrich our understanding, if only we will look and learn. 003781 </p>
