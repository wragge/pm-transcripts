SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.<br />
AT THE OPENING OF BLAKENEY LODGE, TUMUT, 26 JULY 1975<br />
IT GIVES ME VERY GREAT PLEASURE TO RETURN TO<br />
TUMUT WITH MY WIFE TO SHARE JN THE OFFICIAL OPENING OF<br />
BLAKENEY LODGE. WE HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO BE PRESENT AT<br />
THE OPENING OF A NUMBER OF OLD PEOPLE'S HOMES IN NEW<br />
SSOUTH WALES IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS. IN FACT, THIS IS<br />
OUR THIRD IN JUST TWO MONTHS ST. BEDE'S AT HURSTVILLE<br />
WITH BISHOP CREMIN, OZANAM VILLA IN LISMORE WITH<br />
O BISHOP SATTERTHWAITE AND NOW THE MOST BEAUTIFUL, AND<br />
THE EASIEST TO PRONOUNCE, BLAKENEY LODGE, TUMUT, WITH<br />
ARCHBISHOP CAHILL,<br />
THE LAST TIME ARCHBISHOP CAHILL AND I SHARED<br />
SUCH AN OCCASION WAS ON ST. VALENTINE'S DAY LAST YEAR<br />
SWHEN OZANAM HOUSE IN CANBERRA WAS OPENED, I BELIEVE IT'<br />
IS A TRIBUTE TO HIS AWARENESS OF THE NEED FOR SUCH<br />
ACCOMMODATION THAT TWO SUCH HOSTELS HAVE BEEN BUILT<br />
IN HIS DIOCESE IN LESS THAN 18 MONTHS. I REALIZE,<br />
OF COURSE, THAT THE PARISH PRIEST OF TUMUT, FATHER TIERNAN,<br />
HAS HAD MORE THAN A LITTLE TO DO WITH GETTING BLAKENEY<br />
LODGE LITERALLY OFF THE GROUND: PARISH PRIESTS ARE EXPECTED<br />
TO DEVELOP SUCH TALENTS EARLY IN THEIR CAREERS, BUT<br />
FATHER TIERNAN WAS FOLLOWING IN ILLUSTRIOUS FOOTSTEPS,<br />
NONE OTHER THAN THOSE OF THE LATE MONSIGNOR BLAKENEY<br />
AFTER WHOM THE LODGE WAS NAMED, </p>
<p>-2-<br />
I MUST SAY 7-AT, IN ITS SHORTENED FORM, THE LODGE, IT BEARS<br />
A REMARKABLE RESEMBLANCE TO MY OWN ADDRESS IN CANBERRA,<br />
AND IT'S SOBERING TO THINK THAT THAT ADDRESS COULD SO EASILY<br />
HAVE BEEN THE LODGE, TUMUT, HAD THAT FATEFUL VOTE ON<br />
THE SITING OF THE FEDERAL CAPITAL GONE DIFFERENTLY BACK<br />
IN 1908. SiJT TO RETURN TO MONSIGNOR BLAKENEY WHO WAS BORN<br />
IN TUMUT A YEAR BEFORE THAT VOTE WAS TAKEN, WHICH EXEMPTS HIM<br />
FROM ALL BLAME IT WAS HE WHO REALISED THE NEED FOR<br />
ACCOMMODATION HERE IN HIS HOME TOWN, AND APPROACHED HIS<br />
ARCHBISHOP ON THE MATTER, OFFERING AT THE SAME TIME TO PROVIDE<br />
LAND NEXT TO HIS CHURCH, FREE OF CHARGE IN CASE HIS<br />
LoRDs-iTP REQUIRED ANY ADDITIONAL ENCOURAGEMENT,<br />
T*-E .3T iS HISTORY, BUT VERY MUCH A COMMUNITY<br />
HISTORY, SINCE = Cœ CTS LIKE THIS, NATURALLY AND PROPERLY,<br />
BECOME THE CWCE= CN THE WHOLE COMMUNITY, A CONCERN THAT<br />
THE USTRAL :-EMENT IS ANXIOUS TO SEE MAINTAINED.<br />
IT DOES NO: AS OUR OPPONENTS ASSERT, THAT BECAUSE<br />
WE PROVIDE FOORS SOCIAL WELFARE ACTIVITIES LIKE HOUSING<br />
FOR THE AGED. HAT THEREFORE WE SEEK CONTROL OF SUCH<br />
PROGRAMS. IoC. hING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. IT IS<br />
IN FACT AN M= CRTANT ELEMENT IN ALL THE SOCIAL AND<br />
COMMUNITY PRCGRAMS OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT THAT LOCAL<br />
COMMUNITY AWARENESS AND INVOLVEMENT SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED,<br />
PARTICULARLY IN THOSE PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO HELP PEOPLE. o,/ 3 </p>
<p>I E. LIEVE THAT ALL THOSE INVOLVED IN CATHOLIC CARE<br />
FOR THE AGED, WHO HAVE HAD THE OVERALL RESPONSIBILITY IN<br />
NEW SOUTH WALES FOR CO-OPERATING WITH AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
OFFICIALS IN THE FIELD OF HOUSING FOR THE AGED, WOULD<br />
TESTIFY TO THIS,<br />
, EE IN TUMUT, FOR INSTANCE, FOLLOWING THE<br />
FORMATION C' A ANAGEMENT COMMITTEE, A PUBLIC MEETING WAS<br />
CALLED SO THAT ANYONE IN TUMUT WHO WANTED TO GET INVOLVED<br />
IN THE BLAKENEY LODGE PROJECT COULD DO JUST THAT. AND THAT<br />
HIGH LEVEL OF COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT WILL CONTINUE BECAUSE<br />
ITS NOT ALL OVER YET. SURE, MY GOVERNMENT HAS GLADLY<br />
PROVIDED $ 312,000 FOR BLAKENEY LODGE UNDER THE AGED PERSONS<br />
5osE-3s ACT E ICREASED THE SUBSIDY FROM $ 2 TO $ 1<br />
UP T-S FOC LATE LAST YEAR BUT THE PEOPLE OF TUMUT<br />
HAVE RAISED 3 , GOO THROUGH SHEER HARDWORK AND GOODWILL.<br />
ALL T-E OLD SE=-: E =? SANISATIONS, APEX, ROTARY, LIONS,<br />
AND NE ONES, : C '-AY INDIVIDUALS HAVE MADE IT THEIR<br />
. SU.:-SS TO -E I EVEN NOTICED WEIGHT WATCHERS<br />
COMING TO ON THE FRONT PAGE OF LAST WEEK'S NEWSPAPER,<br />
AND IT IS -ANT THAT THIS LEVEL OF COMMUNITY CARING<br />
SHOULD CONT:_--E LONG AFTER THE BALANCE SHEETS ARE ACCEPTABLE<br />
TO FATHER T: E. AN AND BISHOP CAHILL, I KNOW THEY WILL<br />
AGREE THAT ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT THAT PLACES LIKE<br />
BLAKENEY LGE SHOULD TAKE ROOT IN THE COMMUNITY AND BECOME<br />
ACCEPTED AS ANOTHER COMPONENT OF THE TOTAL LIFE OF THE<br />
COMMUNITY, NOT IN ANY WAY CUT OFF OR REMOTE. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE PEOPLE WHO COME TO LIVE<br />
HERE IN BLAKENEY LODGE SHOULD RECOGNISE THIS TOO, BECAUSE<br />
THAT FACT MAY HELP THEM TO REALISE THAT ALTHOUGH IT<br />
REPRESENTS A NEW BEGINNING FOR THEM, AND FOR THEIR FAMILIES<br />
AND FRIENDS, IT'S REALLY JUST AN EXTENSION OF THE LIFE<br />
THEY HAVE BEEN LEADING, ALBEIT IN NEW SURROUNDINGS, BUT<br />
THOSE SURROUNDINGS ARE SO WELCOMING AND COMFORTABLE THAT THE<br />
O TRANSITION SHOULDN'T BE TOO DIFFICULT.<br />
OBVIOUSLY MOST RESIDENTS WILL BE COMING TO<br />
O BLAKENiEY LODGE FROM AROUND TUMUT, BUT I EXPECT THAT OTHERS<br />
WHO MAY HAVE DRIFTED AWAY OVER THE YEARS WILL HAVE A<br />
YEARNING TO COME BACK, TO COME HOME TO TUMUT AS THEY GET<br />
OLDER AND TIRE OF THE RAT RACE AWAY FROM THE<br />
EXTRAORDINARY BEAUTY OF TUMUT, I HAVE A FEELING THAT MANY<br />
OLD FRIENDSHIPS WILL BE RENEWED HERE, AND THAT MANY PEOPLE<br />
WHO COME HERE iLL L: TERALLY TAKE ON A NEW LEASE OF LIFE<br />
-I T-= IR NEW iDENT COMFORT, THEIR NEW COMFORTABLE<br />
:œ: ENDENCE, I AA LOOKING FORWARD VERY MUCH INDEED TO MEETING<br />
A NUMBER OF THE FIRST RESIDENTS TO BE OF BLAKENEY LODGE,<br />
ALL BORN BEFORE THAT FEDERAL CAPITAL VOTE WAS TAKEN, ALL<br />
BORN BEFORE FEDERATION, FOR THAT MATTER. THERE'S MISS CHRISTINE<br />
McGREGOR AND MR TED CURLL, WHOSE AGES ADD UP TO ABOUT 168<br />
I CAN'T BE MORE SPECIFIC WITHOUT BEING ACCUSED OF LACKING<br />
IN GALLANTRY AND WHO WERE EACH CONNECTED WITH OLD<br />
PIONEERING FAMILIES. AND THERE IS MRS ELSIE WILLIAMS WHO, BY<br />
VIRTUE OF HER LONG SERVICE, IS DOUBTLESS VERY MUCH MORE<br />
FAMILIAR WITH THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S RESIDENCE, YARRALUMLA, THAN I AM.<br />
e. </p>
<p>I EXPECT YOU ALL KNOW MY FASCINATION FOR AUSTRALIAN HISTORY. I<br />
AM QUITE SURE THAT A LITTLE LATER ON I WILL LEARN A GREAT<br />
DEAL OF HISTORY THAT HASN'T YET FOUND ITS WAY INTO THE<br />
TEXTBOOKS. I AM ONLY SAD THAT MONSIGNOR BLAKENEY HIMSELF<br />
CAN'T BE WITH US TO SHARE THE REMINISENCES ON THIS GREAT<br />
OCCASION. AS THE TUMUT AND ADELONG TIMES NOTED IN<br />
JANUARY LAST YEAR: " HE WAS A GREAT SON OF TUMUT, A PRODUCT<br />
OF THE LOCAL CONVENT SCHOOL AND THE TOWN AND PROVED A<br />
0 WORTHY SON OF HIS LOCALLY BORN MOTHER AND FATHER, HIS<br />
VERY PRESENCE DIGNIFIED ANY GATHERING AND HIS PERSONALITY<br />
LENT GRACE TO ALL PUBLIC FUNCTIONS HE ATTENDED IN AN<br />
OFFCIAL CAPACITY. -E WON THE ADMIRATION AND RESPECT<br />
OF ALL THOSE WHO SAW HIM GROW FROM BOYHOOD TO THE HIGH<br />
OFFICE OF j'ONSINCR.<br />
IT NG THAT HIS NAME SHOULD BE REMEMBERED<br />
S -EE THE -E LOVED AND THROUGH THE PROJECT THAT<br />
WAS SO DEAR T3 HIS -EART. I HAVE MUCH PLEASURE IN<br />
: ECLARING OPEN BLAKENEY LODGE. </p>
