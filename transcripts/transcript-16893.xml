    <content><![CDATA[<p>The people of Hervey Bay will feel the benefit of increased financial incentives to attract doctors and then keep them, thanks to the Rudd Government's Rural Health Workforce Strategy.</p>
<p>Following the reclassification of Hervey Bay as 'inner regional' from 1 July 2010 doctors may be eligible to receive retention grants for the first time, starting at $2,500 after one year and growing to $12,000 after five years.</p>
<p>In addition, doctors who move to the Hervey Bay area from a major city may be eligible for a relocation grant of $15,000.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and the Minister for Indigenous Health, Rural And Regional Health And Regional Services Delivery, Warren Snowdon, were in Hervey Bay today to hear first hand from local health professionals.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister and Minister Snowdon toured the Hervey Bay Hospital, outlined the National Health and Hospital Reform Commission's recommendations, and listened to local health professionals as they outlined their priorities for the future of the health system.</p>
<p>The consultation with doctors and stakeholders in Hervey Bay is the 67th across the country to road-test the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission's proposed reforms.</p>
<p>The NHHRC report made recommendations for system-wide changes to Australian health care.</p>
<p>All Australians are able to send in their comments and contribute to the national debate on our health system via the yourHealth.gov.au website.</p>
<p>Copies of the NHHRC report are on the website, along with the two other reports presented to the Australian Government - the draft of the National Primary Health Care Strategy and the report of the National Preventative Health Taskforce, which also made recommendations in their areas of expertise.</p>
