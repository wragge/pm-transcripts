PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCH OF " DREAMING OF LORDS*<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE 7 DECEMBER 1988<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
In the presence of this distinguished company, which<br />
includes some of the finest cricketers in the world<br />
indeed, some of the greatest of all time it gives me great<br />
pleasure to launch " Dreaming of Lords", the film which tells<br />
the story of the National Aboriginal Cricket team's tour of<br />
England earlier this year.<br />
We are here today to celebrate the achievements of the 1988<br />
team but we should not forget their predecessors.<br />
on earlier occasions I have discussed in detail. the<br />
outstanding achievements of the 1868 Aboriginal team, the<br />
first Australian team to tour England.<br />
Let me mention now one or two aspects.<br />
we may imagine the difficult adjustment these Aboriginal<br />
sportsmen had to make, in travelling from the rural<br />
quietness of Western Victoria to industrial England. On top<br />
of that, their playing conditions were frequently very<br />
tough. As John Mulvaney and Rex Harcourt have written:<br />
" While matches normally lasted only two days, there were<br />
more of them, which added to the time spent travelling,<br />
often in uncomfortable vehicles and delays were<br />
prolonged while waiting for transport connections. The<br />
hours of play were longer also than at present. Play<br />
began at 11 am or ngon-and usually continued until 7 pm<br />
or later. The additian of sporting exhibitions to the<br />
Aborigines, programme must have involved even longer<br />
hours. There were no tea breaks and the only interval<br />
was for lunch, a 35 minute period at some time between 2<br />
and 3 pm. Most grounds did not provide special catering<br />
facilities for the players who had to take their chance<br />
with the crowd which thronged refreshment tents. If he<br />
was lucky, a player emerged with beer and sandwiches."<br />
I understand the ACS manages these things somewhat<br />
differently these days. 41I05 </p>
<p>Notwithstanding these and similar difficulties, they<br />
performed with great skill and, with the benefit of<br />
hindsight, we can say that in Johnny Mullagh, they produced<br />
one of the greatest Australian cricketers to tour England.<br />
While preparing for the tour, the 1988 tourists came face to<br />
face with the spirit of the men of 1868. Playing in Western<br />
Victoria, at Harrow last Easter, they met Mrs Esther<br />
Burchett, a member of the Aboriginal community.<br />
Mrs Burchett had, in her youth, known Jimmy Tarpot, one of<br />
the stars of 1868. She is now 102 years old and it is<br />
marvellous that she provided a living bridge between these<br />
two fine teams.<br />
It was a great initiative on the part of the National<br />
Aboriginal Cricket Association to organise a tour of England<br />
in 1988. The results of the tour fully justify the high<br />
hopes of those who conceived and organised it, and, of<br />
course, those companies, such as Qantas, who sponsored it.<br />
On the field, they played with distinction, winning 16 of<br />
their 28 fixtures. The opposition they met was frequently<br />
formidable and I am afraid I should probably acknowledge<br />
some responsibility for this.<br />
In January at Manly, I captained a team against John<br />
McGuire's team. My side included some of the great names in<br />
Australian cricket Lillee, Marsh, Chappell and others. We<br />
were soundly defeated.<br />
The news of this result preceded the Aboriginal team in<br />
England, with the consequence that their opposing teams were<br />
frequently stacked with players of international and first<br />
class experience. This makes their for and against record<br />
even more meritorious.<br />
Incidentally, my own contribution at Manly was an innings of<br />
some 20 minutes which was described afterwards by a young<br />
aficionado of the game as " a very solid duck, Mr Hawke". I<br />
am sure that the film makers would not have had the<br />
disrespect to includethis batting effort in " Dreaming of<br />
Lords". There were some outstanding individual performances on the<br />
tour of England. The experienced players like John McGuire,<br />
Michael Mainhardt and Neil Bulger performed with the<br />
consistency and quality expected of them. Young players<br />
like Sean Appo, Bert Pearce and Joe Marsh, who averaged 52<br />
with the bat, all made significant progress. And I am very<br />
happy to say that the'performances of Michael Williams<br />
behind the stumps have earned him a place in the Prime<br />
Minister's XI to play against Viv Richards and the West<br />
Indies team tomorrow.<br />
All the participants benefitted enormously from the tour, in<br />
a playing and a personal ' sense.<br />

<p>The team were great sporting ambassadors for Australia on<br />
and off the field. Doug McClelland, our High Commissioner<br />
in the United Kingdom, sent me very favourable reports of<br />
their progress. And there was considerable press reportimg<br />
in Britain on the tour, all of it very positive. This<br />
reflects enormous credit on Mark Ella the manager, Ian King,<br />
the coach, John McGuire, the captain, amd every individual<br />
player. " Dreaming of Lords" is their story. It puts their tour in<br />
its historical context. It tells of the 17 players on this<br />
unique odyssey, the rigours of their training, how they<br />
coped, as individuals and as a team, with instant celebrity,<br />
and the adventures and social situations they encountered in<br />
typical English conditions.<br />
The film has been made with great warmth, humour and<br />
imagination. In the short term, it will provide great<br />
entertainment. In the longer term, it will be a valuable<br />
historical record. And, at both levels, I hope it will be<br />
an inspiration to the Aboriginal community and to all<br />
Australians. The highlights of the Aboriginal tour are recorded,<br />
including their match at Lords, which was unfortunately<br />
curtailed by rain let's not mention that word again for a<br />
day or two but not before the team had taken the field for<br />
a couple of hours. I am also delighted that their match<br />
against Clive Lloyd's XI is included. And may I take this<br />
opportunity, Clive, to say what. a tremendous privilege and<br />
pleasure it is to have you back in Australia with this<br />
magnificent West Indian side. I am really looking forward<br />
to having you in my side to play the Aboriginal team in<br />
January at Manly.<br />
I want to congratulate mark Manion and Contagious Films for<br />
making the film and to Bob Ellis for writing it, and writing<br />
so entertainingly about the tour. Thanks are due to the<br />
Australian Film Commission and the Department of Aboriginal<br />
Affairs for their support and encouragement.<br />
The film has taken over two years to make and was shot<br />
throughout Australia and Britain. It has been bought by<br />
Channel 4 in Britain and I am very much looking forward to<br />
seeing it on Channel 9 here in the new year.<br />
I hope that the 1988 tour will provide a stimulus to<br />
Aboriginal cricket and that in due course we will see an<br />
Aboriginal test player for Australia.<br />
This film record could not be launched in more auspicious<br />
circumstances, on the eve of what I trust will be a great<br />
day's cricket tomorrow between the Prime Minister's XI and<br />
the West Indies. I wish " Dreaming of Lords" every success<br />
and now invite everybody to sit back and enjoy the<br />
highlights of this extraordinary Aboriginal cricket tour of<br />
England. 4107 </p>
