    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to advise that the President of Pakistan, HE General Pervez Musharraf, will visit Australia from 13 - 16 June 2005.</p>
<p> As the first ever visit to Australia by a head of state from Pakistan, President Musharraf's visit is an historic milestone in our positive and steadily expanding bilateral relationship.  This relationship is based on strong people-to-people links, and today encompasses significant political, commercial, security, education, law enforcement, immigration and cultural cooperation.</p>
<p>  Pakistan is a key ally for Australia in the war on terror, and has played a pivotal role in efforts to dismantle global terrorist networks such as Al Qaeda.  President Musharraf has played a courageous and resolute role in combating terrorism in the region, and has demonstrated a strong personal commitment to improving relations between Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>   A Memorandum of Understanding on counter-terrorism cooperation between Australia and Pakistan will be signed during President Musharraf's visit, bringing to eleven the number of counter-terrorism MOUs Australia has concluded with key partners in the war against terror.  These agreements play an important role in fostering cooperation between our intelligence, security, law enforcement and defence agencies, and help protect Australians and Australia's interests at home and abroad.</p>
<p>I also look forward to discussing with President Musharraf prospects for closer cooperation between Australia and Pakistan in the field of agriculture, and for a formal partnership between the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan.</p>
<p> During his time in Australia, President Musharraf will visit both Canberra and Sydney.</p>
