TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH MIKE CARLTON, RADIO 2GB,<br />
9 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
CARLTONs With-the opinion polls down for the Government,. the<br />
economy in pain, the Prime Minister has been telling his<br />
Ministers and his Party to get out and communicate, to start<br />
selling the Government's massage to get it across to Australians<br />
and I quo.., perhaps, as part of that process, Mr. Hawke joins-us<br />
today on the line from Canberra. Good morning.<br />
HAWKEs Good morning, Mike.<br />
CARLTONs Thanks f or your time. When are you going to use the<br />
word and concede that the country's in recession.<br />
HAWKEi Well that's a pretty sick sort of question after I've<br />
answered it about three or four times in the Parliament. I've<br />
said simply this Mike, that all I have been saying is that as far<br />
as the economics profession is concerned, the technical<br />
identification of recession is when you have two successive<br />
quarters of negative economic growth. That' s what the economic<br />
profession says. That hasn't arisen yet, but I've said and I may<br />
to your listeniers, that doesn't mean that I, in any sense, am<br />
trying to. avoid the fact that as far as very, very many<br />
Australians are concerned, they are being hurt. That is, that<br />
when you slow down the level of activity as we had to do, that<br />
means, by defiLnition, that some businesses and individuals are<br />
going to be hurt and a lot of them very severely, so there's no<br />
point in having fun about the economist's technical definition of<br />
recession. I don't nail my particular flag to that mast. I'm<br />
simply saying that's what the economist's definition is, but it<br />
doesn't mean people aren't already being hurt, they are.<br />
CARLTON: Yeah, but the view from Sydney..... we believe up here,<br />
everyone will say that Canberra is out of touch, that it is a<br />
recession, people are using the word.<br />
HAWKE: People are entitled to use the word. I mean, the man and<br />
the woman in the street is not a professional economist, nor<br />
should they ben expected to be bound by the economist's technical<br />
jargon and technical definition. I have no problem at all if<br />
people say, " We're in recession" and if that's how they feel </p>
<p>and that's how they're being affected, they are -entitled to use<br />
the word. The professional economists haven't got a monopoly of<br />
the word and what, I'm saying to your listeners is this, that the<br />
position with which the Government had to deal, Mike, was one in<br />
which in the previous year, we, as a community, had increased our<br />
expenditure, all of us, by 8% and we'd only increased our production<br />
by 4% and you couldn't allow that to go on because that's<br />
the way to bankruptcy and so you had to Blow the level of<br />
activity down. Wie've done that by tight fiscal policy and tight<br />
monetary policy and tight. wages policy. Now, when you do that,<br />
a. you had to do it, then obviously some people are going to be<br />
hurt, but the point is this, that if we hadn't done that in a<br />
controlled way, out of which, next year we will come into a path<br />
of sustainable economic growth, then the rest of the world would<br />
have imposed a solution on us that would have been infinitely<br />
worse than what we've got.<br />
CA. RLTONs Alright, but rightly or wrongly, there seems to be a<br />
credibility gap. While you talk about a downturn or pain or a<br />
slowdown and so -on, they're talking recession here. Could that<br />
be why your opinion poll rating's down, the credibility gap?<br />
HAWKE: I think -the simple fact is that when you make decisions<br />
as we've had to d~ o as I've just explained to you as we'v, had<br />
to do that, it would have been irresponsible not to do it and<br />
when people get hurt, they don't give you ticks of approval and I<br />
can understand, : r don't have a feeling of disillusionment or of<br />
anger at the fact: that people are marking us down at the moment.<br />
You'd expect that, when they are suffering hurt. You can't expect<br />
people to understand all the ramifications that if we hadn't done<br />
this, then it would have been very, very much worse. I'm not<br />
expecting them to embrace all that understanding and I accept<br />
they are marking us down at the moment. The other side of the<br />
coin, Mike, of course, is, as I've said and in politics, it's not<br />
only the judgment; about yourself, they look at the other side and<br />
there is a sense of community relief almost that the Libs have<br />
. gHot oridw Poeafa cotchkra-t adnodu t, rtahge reeo uwsa s htuhridsy sgeunsrdey o fo fp eHnto-wuapr d, r elPieeafcso. c Tkh, at<br />
particular stupid saga's finished and there's someone else there<br />
and the present Leader of the Opposition is not doing or saying<br />
anything or when he doe say something, it's quickly exposed to<br />
be ridiculous anti then he says " Oh, well I didn't really mean it,<br />
it was just an idea to start debate", but he's had a bit of a<br />
positive run because he's come after the end of the stupid hurdy<br />
gurdy. CAR~ LTON: Alright. There seem to be, though, some doubters in<br />
your own Party don't there? I mean, Bob Carr, for example says<br />
" This is the worse recession since World War 2.1."<br />
HAWKE: Yeah and Bob Carr is wrong and is manifestly wrong.<br />
Take what the Weiitpac bank said I haven't got a publication in </p>
<p>front of me but Just a few weeks ago they just made it quite<br />
clear that this is not as bad as 1982. You've Just got to look<br />
at the figures. In 1982/ 83 you had five successive quarters of<br />
falling employment five successive quarters. You had bank<br />
rates peaking at about 221, far above what they did here and you<br />
had a wages explosion of 17t. You've got wages under control<br />
here, so whether you look at the level of wages, whether you look<br />
at the level 0f investments, the level of employment, what is<br />
happening now has not reached the depth of 1982/ 83. But that<br />
doesn't make me complacent and say " Oh well, it's not as bad as<br />
the Libs brought about in 82/ 83". The only cause that we have<br />
and the basic cause that we have f or optimism as a community is<br />
that the fundamen~ tals are different now. Then, they didn't have<br />
a wages policy, you had a wages explosion, now, we've got a wages<br />
policy. Then, you didn't have any programme for restructuring<br />
the Australian economy, now, we have. We've got the greatest<br />
programme of reform that the country's ever seen and this economy<br />
Sis going to emerge basically stronger when we, as a community,<br />
Whave gone through the necessary pain that we must do to<br />
accommodate to -the fact that we couldn't keep spending 8% more<br />
and producing 4% more.<br />
CARLTON: Right. There seem to be some doubt as to, in your own<br />
Cabinet, John Dawkins, for example, said the other day: " We have<br />
a third world economy, we should be putting financial muscle<br />
behind our export as a change in policy."<br />
HAKM Well, I don't agree with Dawkins that we've got a third<br />
world economy but where John Dawkins is right is that we do in<br />
Australia have very special problems that some third world<br />
economies have, but we've got strength that they don't and<br />
characteristics that they don't, but the problem that we have is<br />
that this is a -very exposed economy because we rely so much f or<br />
our export incoue upon fluctuating commodity prices, that is, for<br />
wheat, wool and so on and what we dig up out of the ground as<br />
well, Mike, and we have no control over those prices. Then large<br />
economies which have a very, very large manufacturing base, in a<br />
Ssense, can determine their own export income to a very large<br />
extent. We can't and in that sense, we're exposed, but, of<br />
course, we have very fundamental strength that put us, you know,<br />
way above other economies and the fact, Mike, is-that in the last<br />
seven and a half years, we, in this country, never forget it.<br />
we, in this country, have had a rate of employment growth twice<br />
as f ast as the rest of the world and you can'It get that unless<br />
you've got sound economic policy and the basic structure being<br />
developed in the right way.<br />
CARLTON: Alright. John Dawkins though, seemed to say-. " We've<br />
had enough of thfe level playing field though, it's about time we<br />
tilted things our way." </p>
<p>4<br />
HAWKE: Yeah, I understand the argument and the fact, of course,<br />
this Government hasn't had some ideological obsession about<br />
playing fields and levels. We have maid this, however. We, that<br />
is Australia, has been in the forefront out there in the Uraguay<br />
round and, without getting technical about it, that's the whole<br />
international discussion that's going on under the GATT to try<br />
and bring about a freer international trading system and that's<br />
particularly important for Australia because we have the world's<br />
most efficient producers of agriculture products. our farmers<br />
are the best, but they are being virtually raped on the<br />
international markets by the practices, the restrictive<br />
practices, of the Europeans in particular, and the Americans<br />
reacting against. the Europeans and they have these export<br />
subsidies and producer subsidies which are ruining our farmers.<br />
Now it's very difficult for us to be out there in that GATT round<br />
at the moment, which is coming to an end now, arguing for<br />
countries to rip down these export subsidies, so that our farmers<br />
can get a fair go and at the same time, be internally embracing a<br />
9 dif ferent approach. That doesn'It mean, Mike, however, that<br />
within our approach to government, we don't intervene. For<br />
instance, when we~ came to office in ' 83, you know that the steel<br />
industry was on the verge of closing down. We said ' not on your<br />
nellie's we introduced the steel plan and now we have a steel<br />
industry, which is not only producing for Australia, but is<br />
producing massively for exports. We did the same in the<br />
shipbuilding industry, so we're not averse to constructive intervention,<br />
but essentially what Australia needs is a manufacturing<br />
sector which is exposed to competition because history shows that<br />
basically, in a manufacturing sector, the only enterprises that<br />
are going to be really efficient are those which come from<br />
sectors which are exposed to the winds of competition.<br />
CARLTON: OK. When do you think.. I mean, you'Ave conceded<br />
yourself, Australians have made sacrifices, they've exercised<br />
restraint for years now. When do you think the pain will stop<br />
and that we'll see some reward for this restraint?<br />
9 HAWKE: Well, let's just get the picture straight, when you<br />
painted a picture Of pain. Australians ( interruption)<br />
twice as fast as the rest of the world and if you want to<br />
relate to the previous ( inaudible) before we came into office,<br />
( inaudible) have been increasing in this country five times<br />
faster than they did in the period of office of the conservatives<br />
before we came in. Now that's not a picture of pain.<br />
CARLTONz But sulrely you Can see that people are feeling pain<br />
now? HAWK!: of course they are, but I'm saying don't give it as an<br />
unrelieved picture. I mean, I will come to the question of the<br />
difficulties but. acknowledge surely, it's not a picture of pain </p>
<p>when you've got employment growth twice as fast as the rest of<br />
the world. Surely, it's not a picture of pain<br />
when we came to office, as a result of the conservatives, only<br />
one in three of our kids, one out of every three, were staying on<br />
in school. Now, as a result of our deliberate policies, we have<br />
changed the social face of Australia, It's now two in three of<br />
our kids are staying on and more of them being able to go on to<br />
have their talents trained in the technical education system, in<br />
our university system. The face of Australia has changed in that<br />
respect. Education used to be the privileged opportunity of the<br />
well-to-do, now iLt's been made available right across the face of<br />
Australia CARLTON; Alright, conceding all that though<br />
HAWKEt 6. the picture of pain. Now, coming to the problem<br />
of the present time, what we've had to do in this period vwe've<br />
9lived in a period of massive swings, massive swings in our terms<br />
of trade, which relates back to what I was saying about what<br />
happens to the -prices you get paid on the international market<br />
and we've had swings back there in ' 85, ' 86 when we lost eleven<br />
billion dollars of national income because of the change in our<br />
couaodity pricei and we had to adjust. We had to adjust there,,<br />
we had to ask for very real restraint<br />
CARLTONt Yeah, but granting all that and accepting all that,<br />
when are we going to . you know, when are we going to move<br />
upwards? When airs we going to see some sunshine?<br />
HAWKEs We have been moving upwards. Look, how can you say the<br />
country hasn't been moving upwards when in fact, you've averaged<br />
over this period, since we've been in office, growth, economic<br />
growth of between 3 and 4 per cent that's what's happened in<br />
that period, when employment has increased by 1.6 million new<br />
jobs. That's growth, that's improvement, that's creating<br />
__ opportunities for people to be employed, to have an income, to<br />
ylook after their kids, that didn't exist before. There has been<br />
growth, but there's had to be restraint as well, particularly in<br />
this most recent period. Now, I'm saying that as we go into ' 91<br />
by the middlet of ' 91 this current downturn -would have been<br />
reversed and we will have resumed the path of growth in the<br />
framework of an economy which we have continued to make stronger.<br />
There has been a situation where the Australian economy now is<br />
more competitive, infinitely more competitive than it was before.<br />
Remember this, that in this last year, our exports of<br />
manufactured goods have increased by nearly 10%. That hasn't<br />
happened by accident, it's happened because we're more<br />
competitive and. it's happened because our great Australian workforce,<br />
the men and women of your prograimme, the men and women to<br />
whom you are constantly talking, have been prepared to accept<br />
restraint. Many of them could have, in fact, obtained much </p>
<p>higher money wagea increases than they... .,,. restraint<br />
and in that process, it's meant two things. It's meant that<br />
they've created employment opportunities for many more of their fellow<br />
Australians and secondly, it means they are now working in an<br />
economy which can now sell its goods competitively on international<br />
markets.<br />
CA1RLTONs Prime Minister, I'll have to leave it there, I'm out<br />
of time, but thanks very much for your time this morning.<br />
HKWKE:, Thank you very much, Mike.<br />
Ends<br />
