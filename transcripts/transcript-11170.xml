<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, good morning to you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hello Steve.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Meg Lees says this agreement creates a fairer taxation system for</p>
<p> all Australians. Are you confident it will create a fairer more efficient</p>
<p> tax system and will encourage investment and jobs growth?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I am.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Peter Beattie says, for example, the tourism industry in Queensland</p>
<p> is going to lose thousands of jobs.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the tourism industry in Queensland is in exactly the same position</p>
<p> as it was when Peter Beattie signed up enthusiastically to the agreement.</p>
<p> There has been no change, no change at all. So if the tourist industry</p>
<p> was going to lose the thousands of jobs of which Mr Beattie was speaking</p>
<p> yesterday why did he sign the agreement a couple of months ago? I</p>
<p> mean, this is just silly talk. If Peter Beattie had, you know, really</p>
<p> wanted to be candid with the Australian public he should acknowledge</p>
<p> that two months ago when he signed up it had a certain disposition</p>
<p> to the tourist industry. Nothing's changed so I mean let's get real.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Okay. Are you also confident that the in-principle agreement with</p>
<p> the Democrats will hold, that there is no backing out because Meg</p>
<p> Lees says she's got an escape clause?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Steve, this agreement will be honoured in full. I haven't invested</p>
<p> in an enormous amount of time and energy into negotiating this agreement</p>
<p> with the Australian Democrats to walk away on some technicality. I</p>
<p> don't want to walk away because this agreement is a first-class agreement</p>
<p> for the long-term improvement of the Australian taxation system and</p>
<p> I can assure the Australian Democrats and the Australian public that</p>
<p> full faith and credit will be given to the agreement when the legislation</p>
<p> is drafted. Now, obviously there'll be some complications. The technicalities</p>
<p> of drafting legislation are always difficult but there won't be any</p>
<p> attempts to chisel away through the negotiating process with the legislation.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>When are we going to see the fine print though because I imagine the</p>
<p> business community is going to be very anxious to have a look?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, we'll see it as soon as possible. But can we please get a sense</p>
<p> of realism. Everybody has wanted tax reform for years. Every senior</p>
<p> business figure to whom I spoke privately last week said to me, even</p>
<p> if we don't like some of the anomalies that a food carve out will</p>
<p> produce please negotiate an agreement. And I think you have got to</p>
<p> understand that there's a certain amount of sectoral posturing going</p>
<p> on at the moment. Of course the chief executives of certain business</p>
<p> organisations feel it incumbent to complain about the complexity.</p>
<p> Everyone knows that we would have preferred the inclusion of everything</p>
<p> but we couldn't get that.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Even an across the board five per cent GST on all food?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The Democrats wouldn't agree to that. Businessmen constantly say to</p>
<p> me, John, you have got to understand the market place in which we</p>
<p> live. I say to businessmen, you should understand the political marketplace</p>
<p> in which a Prime Minister lives. And we got the best deal that could</p>
<p> have been got in the political circumstances that having regard to</p>
<p> the composition of the Senate. And I think it's a great deal. It's</p>
<p> something that has eluded every government for the last 20 years and</p>
<p> the overwhelming private response I have had from the business community</p>
<p> over the last 72 hours has been extraordinarily positive.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Do you agree with your Treasurer who estimates that the additional</p>
<p> compliance cost for business is going to be about $100 million?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Steve, there will be some additional compliance costs. I don't know</p>
<p> the figure, I...</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Who is going to pick up the tab?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the whole business community obviously will have to carry some</p>
<p> of it, yes, of course they will. But there are huge benefits for the</p>
<p> business community. You take a company like Coles/Myer, take a company</p>
<p> like Woolworths that will have this, sort of, divided food situation.</p>
<p> They have enormous cash flow benefits because they hold money interest</p>
<p> free for a certain number of days. So there are a lot of gives and</p>
<p> takes.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Prime Minister...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Steve, it's not ideal but you don't get anything in this world</p>
<p> that is ideal. And it's 85 to 90 per cent of what we wanted and I</p>
<p> find this, sort of, cheese-paring at the edges by some of the spokesmen</p>
<p> for the business community, given what I know to be there strongly</p>
<p> held private views, a bit extraordinary.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>But, I mean, look, I went into my local delicatessen yesterday, non-computerised</p>
<p> business. They're saying you have handed them a nightmare, that they</p>
<p> can't....they are just saying to themselves, how can we possibly</p>
<p> discriminate or determine what's in, what's out? And what is it going</p>
<p> to cost us and am I going to pass the cost onto the consumer?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, look Steve, that wasn't our preferred outcome but I faced a</p>
<p> choice of walking away entirely from fundamental taxation reform or</p>
<p> delivering the outcome that I delivered on Friday. Now, it's as simple</p>
<p> as that, there wasn't another option. The public didn't want another</p>
<p> election which the main issue would have been, do you want a GST on</p>
<p> food or not? The Government didn't want it, we'd had an election last</p>
<p> year and there was no guarantee that if we had another election, even</p>
<p> if we won it, that we would have the numbers in both houses to pass</p>
<p> the legislation at a joint sitting. So there was no practical alternative</p>
<p> and once again I say to those people, I understand what you are saying,</p>
<p> I agree with you that it would have been better not to have had this</p>
<p> carve-out but at the end of the day that was the condition on which</p>
<p> I was able to secure the support of the Australian Democrats. And</p>
<p> I think the national interest has been better served by doing this</p>
<p> deal, 85 per cent of what we wanted, than spitting the dummy and walking</p>
<p> away from it.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Okay. But can I just come back to the compliance cost, whether it's</p>
<p> going to be $100 million or not. If there is an additional burden</p>
<p> on business, especially the small businesses, the non-computerised</p>
<p> businesses, and it's going to cost them. Isn't it likely they're going</p>
<p> to pass that additional cost onto the consumer?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Steve, whether it comes out of the GST application or not the extent</p>
<p> to which you pass things onto your consumer is determined by pressures</p>
<p> in the marketplace not by any generic rules. But could I come back</p>
<p> to something even more fundamental. This huge historic tax reform</p>
<p> is not just about compliance costs. I mean, surely it's bigger than</p>
<p> that, surely it's the fact that 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers</p>
<p> will have a top marginal rate of 30 cents in the dollar. Surely it</p>
<p> is about the fact that we're taking about $4 billion off the cost</p>
<p> of our exporters. Surely it's about the fact that we have delivered</p>
<p> an even better deal to the Australian bush because diesel on rail</p>
<p> freight which carries our wheat from the remote areas of Australia</p>
<p> to the coast that that will be cheaper. Surely it's also about the</p>
<p> fact that we now have for the first time since World War II a durable</p>
<p> agreement with the States whereby they can have access to a growth</p>
<p> tax. I mean, let us have a sense of proportion. It always amazes me</p>
<p> in this country that when you do something big there is a focus on</p>
<p> the periphery, there's a focus...Now, sure it's aggravating to</p>
<p> some people, I understand that. But you have got to look at the broader</p>
<p> scene, you have got to look at the broader national interest instead</p>
<p> of obsessively focusing on one aspect of it. I find that one of the</p>
<p> most distressing things about debate in Australian public life.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Look, Prime Minister, I accept that we need to look at this in terms</p>
<p> of the big picture but out there people are watching and listening</p>
<p> to us this morning who are saying, well hang on a minute, I have heard</p>
<p> at the weekend that there's going to be a GST on toilet paper but</p>
<p> none on condoms. And I know you'll say, look, this is just nit-picking</p>
<p> petty stuff. I have heard that, for example, the largest circulating</p>
<p> tabloid in Australia this morning is saying, under the list GST will</p>
<p> not be levied on cooked chicken but cooked chicken pieces such as</p>
<p> wings are going to be covered by the tax. How do you clear up all</p>
<p> that confusion?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, to start with it's a year before it comes in. The precise definition</p>
<p> of food is going to be negotiated with the Democrats, that was part</p>
<p> of our agreement. So you have got 12 months to do all that. Steve,</p>
<p> can I say again it was always going to be a bit confusing, there was</p>
<p> always going to be some anomalies once you decided to carve out some</p>
<p> food but that was the fundamental condition that the Australian Democrats</p>
<p> laid down. So let's just get realistic about it. I mean, was I meant</p>
<p> to say, oh, I couldn't get 100 per cent I'll take my bat and ball</p>
<p> and go home and sit in my, you know, castle and say, no, I am not</p>
<p> going to play. I mean, that's just childish. I would have been condemned.</p>
<p> I mean, that's not what people expect of their political leaders.</p>
<p> They expect them to negotiate decent outcomes.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>All right. Prime Minister, give me a guarantee that over time the</p>
<p> tax is not going to be widened and increased and what guarantee all</p>
<p> those indirect taxes that are supposed to disappear now will, in fact,</p>
<p> disappear?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the major one that will disappear on the 1st of July</p>
<p> next year will be the dreaded wholesale sales tax, that will disappear</p>
<p> entirely.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>But how do we know, how are the....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, because it will be law, Steve, that is how. I mean, you know,</p>
<p> please, it will be law. You say, how do you know? The law of this</p>
<p> country will abolish it the same day as the goods and services tax</p>
<p> comes into operation.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>And what guarantee your wholesalers and retailers between now and</p>
<p> July 1st aren't going to increase their prices?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, whether you have a GST or not there's never any guarantee that</p>
<p> a price won't go up anymore than there's if we stayed with the present</p>
<p> taxation system you couldn't guarantee that the wholesale sale tax</p>
<p> wouldn't go up. Paul Keating and Kim Beazley jacked it up without</p>
<p> compensation after the 1993 election having won an election campaign</p>
<p> on opposing a GST. So, Steve, I can't predict what people are going</p>
<p> to do in the marketplace. I can only point out that under this Government</p>
<p> inflation is at a 30 year low in other words, prices have risen less</p>
<p> rapidly under us than under any of our predecessors over the last</p>
<p> 30 years.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>One last question, Prime Minister, is there any more your Government</p>
<p> can do for the two CARE Australia workers in Yugoslavia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Steve, yes. We can continue to play every diplomatic card we have</p>
<p> got. We can continue to push, we can publicly appeal, we can privately</p>
<p> ask. We will continue to do everything we can. We can't physically</p>
<p> get them out, that's obvious. But we will do everything we can. We</p>
<p> think the trial was extraordinary. We think the penalties were harsh.</p>
<p> Their lawyers are appealing, we feel for their families and those</p>
<p> families should understand that all Australians are very much with</p>
<p> them and are thinking of them a great deal this morning.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Should Alexander Downer go over?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think that would improve the situation not in the sense that</p>
<p> he wouldn't make a very persuasive case but in one way I think that's</p>
<p> probably not the right way to approach it. I think that is precisely</p>
<p> the, sort of, approach the Yugoslav Government might want only to</p>
<p> reject it. So I believe the more orthodox, low key diplomatic approach</p>
<p> is probably better.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>All right. Thanks for your time Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Always a pleasure.</p>
