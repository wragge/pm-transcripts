MR. CALWELL'S REPUDIATION OF A. L. P. POLICY<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt.<br />
Once again the wide division in Labor ranks has been demonstrated<br />
by Mr. Caiwell' s speedy repudiation of policy points extensively circulated<br />
in New South Wales, allegedly under the authority of the State Secretary of<br />
the ALP in that State. It is reported that more than 500, UuO copies of a<br />
pamphlet containing twenty-five points of Labor policy are being distributed<br />
as th-e first shot of Labor's campaign in New South Wales.<br />
After a detailed report of many of the main policy points had appeared<br />
in the evening press, Mr. Calwell issued a prepared statement last night<br />
explaining that the policy items had been taken from a document issued by<br />
the New South Wales Branch of the Party and comprised extracts from the<br />
Federal Platform of the Party.. He denied that these items had been agreed<br />
on for inclusion in the Policy Speech. He asserted that the Policy Speech<br />
had not yet been written.<br />
These developments highlight the confusion which exists in the ALP<br />
on policy matters. They add to the uncertainty in the public mind as to the<br />
source of Labor Party policy. Does it proceed from the Federal Executive,<br />
the so-cal led " faceless 36", or from the Parliamentary Party itself? The<br />
incident provides another instance of Mr. Calwell repudiating much of the<br />
official Platform of the Party on the eve of a general election. It will be<br />
recalled that he went so far in one election Policy Speech as to give an<br />
emphatic pledge that major, and highly controversial, areas of the Platform<br />
would not be given effect during the life of the ensuing Parliament. No one<br />
imagines that Mr. Oalwell, a dedicated socialist has abandoned these<br />
policies. All but the most gullible would realise that, once firmly entrenched,<br />
he and his colleagues would at some point of time give effect to policies<br />
for which they have been striving throughout a political lifetime.<br />
While Mr. Caiwell says the Policy Speech has not yet been written, the<br />
Secretary of the ALP in the senior State of the Commonwealth, is apparently<br />
permitted to flood New South Wales with policy undertakings derived from the<br />
official Platform, but, on Mr. Calwell's statement, lacking any sponsorship<br />
from the Federal Parliamentary P-arty.<br />
Mr. Calwell says " categorically", to use his own term, " that there will<br />
be no promise to introduce a thirty-five hour working week, with a subsequent<br />
reduction to a thirty-hour week in the lifetime of the next Parliament", although<br />
this is a significant objective set out in the Platform. He says he " will not<br />
mention tax cuts or tax increases"~ Is he trying to imply that there will be no<br />
changes in tax rates by a Labor Government over the three year term of a newlyelected<br />
Parliament? Apparently with no change in revenue, a glittering<br />
cluster of new benefits is to be provided. He says he " will not talk about the<br />
establishment of a non-profit national insurance office to compete with private<br />
enterprise". Does this mean he has no intention of adopting any such<br />
policy, or the other socialist objectives of the Party, over the life of the<br />
next Parliament? Honesty and good faith demand that the Labor Party comes to<br />
clear decisions as to what it is the Australian people are being invited<br />
to endorse. What has so far emerged is a species of fraud on the public.<br />
