-A AUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 21 MAY 1989<br />
JOINT STATEMENT WITH THE HON. JOHN BANNON, MLA<br />
PREMIER OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA<br />
Thousands more South Australian children will gain access to<br />
child care under a new $ 10 million program announced today<br />
by the Prime Minister and SA Premier John Bannon.<br />
Families, particularly working parents who need quality care<br />
for their children outside school hours, will have access to<br />
twice the present number of places.<br />
The package also provides a boost for parents not in the<br />
workforce who seek occasional child care to give them short<br />
term breaks from caring for their children.<br />
It follows agreement for a new three-year child care program<br />
by the Commonwealth and South Australian Governments.<br />
" The package will build upon the solid foundation we have<br />
already created to provide the best possible children's<br />
services for South Australian families," Mr Hawke said<br />
today.<br />
The new program is against a backdrop of significant<br />
increases in child care services since the election of the<br />
Hawke Government. Nationally, the Federal Government has<br />
created 68,000 new child care places since 1983. Of these,<br />
more than 4,500 have been provided in South Australia.<br />
The last Federal Budget launched a National Child Care<br />
Strategy which will provide 30,000 additional places over<br />
the next three years.<br />
Under this Strategy, our agreement provides that, for South<br />
Australia: OUTSIDE SCHOOL HOURS care places will be effectively<br />
doubled, providing an extra 1,700 places for children<br />
needing care and quality activities before or after<br />
school. MORE CHILD CARE centres will be built in key areas of<br />
need. Five child care centres, providing a total of 247<br />
new places will be built. This will mean subsidised<br />
long day child care centres will care for more than<br />
6,300 South Australian children. </p>
<p>S FAMILY DAY CARE places will be boosted by 330 places to<br />
provide a total State-wide coverage of care for some<br />
5,500 children.<br />
S PARENTS seeking short term breaks from their children<br />
will gain greater access to occasional care, with 160<br />
new places being provided. This program will provide<br />
particular help to parents not in the workforce and will<br />
focus on existing community facilities to ensure parents<br />
have access to child care in their local neighbourhood.<br />
The new package will involve capital works expenditure of<br />
some $ 5 million and operational contributions by both<br />
Governments totalling $ 5 million over the next three years.<br />
The Federal Government will continue to provide fee relief<br />
to enable low income and single parent families to use the<br />
centres. Locations of the new child care services will be announced<br />
following further discussions between the Commonwealth and<br />
State Governments. </p>
