FOR PRESS PM. No,, o6!<br />
DEVTLOPMENT OF NOCRT \ Nf ATUSTRALIA<br />
Statement by the Prime Min.... ister. the_. Hon. ir obert Menzies<br />
Today the Prime Min. ster and Commonwealth Ministers<br />
met with the Premiers of Queensland and Western Australia to<br />
discuss means of achinvij.: Lg closer co-operation in the development<br />
of Northern Australia. The Comonweal c Mini. sters in attendance<br />
were Mr. McEwen, Mr. Holt, Senator Sir William Spooner and Mr.<br />
Barnes. The Premiers expressed their full support for the<br />
action taken recently by the Cormmonwealth to make the examination<br />
of Northern Development problems the special responsibility of<br />
the Minister for National Development, and for this purpose, to<br />
establish a new Northern Division within his Department.<br />
It was agreed that this arrangement provided the most<br />
appropriate machinery upon which to develop closer co-operation<br />
and co-ordination of activities between the two States and the<br />
Commonwealth, including the Northern Territory.<br />
The three Governments have alreoady demonstrated vigorous<br />
support for Northern Development and are currently engaged in<br />
projects in the area involving very large sums of money. These<br />
projects have been developed more or less ad hoc.<br />
They include beef cattle roads in northern parts of<br />
Queensland Western Australia and the Northern Territory, the<br />
reconstruction of the Mt. Isa railway, port development in the<br />
Kimborleys area of Western Australia the brigalow lands development<br />
scheme, and the first stage of the Ord River project. These<br />
together involve expenditure, by the Conmonrwealth and the States,<br />
of approximately Å“ 65 million.<br />
In considering future action, the Ministers agreed that<br />
it was desirable for the three Governments to develop continuing<br />
liaison arrangements. It was agreed that the est: blishment of the<br />
Northern Division of the Commonwealth Department of National<br />
Development provided the means for the development of continuing<br />
liaison between Co: mmonwealth officers and officers of the States<br />
of Queensland and Western Australia. The task of the officers<br />
concerned will be to study all aspects ofrnrthorn development<br />
for the purpose of assisting Ministers in determining what ought<br />
to be done to develop the north, how it should be done and the<br />
assessment of priorities. The manner in which the task would be<br />
approached would, of course, need to remain flexible to meet<br />
changing circumstances. The Ministers agreed that appropriate Commonwealth and<br />
State Ministers would neat together from time to time to review<br />
progress in Northern Development, to co-ordinate thinking, and give<br />
directions to those who will be required to investigate particular<br />
proposals. As a starting point, the Northern Development Division,<br />
in co-operation with State Officers, will prepare an assessment<br />
of the progress inde with projects now in hand and of those that<br />
might warrant consideration in the future. This document, which<br />
will include some qualitative and quantitative assessment of / 2 </p>
