STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, NIP<br />
One of the themes of this years' South Pacific Forum is tourism and its role in the<br />
region's economic development. To support this theme Australia has proposed<br />
a package of additional measures to develop ecotourism in the region.<br />
The package, worth $ 625,000 initially, will involve extensive short-temi training<br />
programs both for tourism planners and private sector operators, involving an<br />
Intensive six weeks training program, attachment to relevant Australian<br />
institutions and long-term follow up.<br />
In addition, five post graduate fellowships will be offered to train public and<br />
private sector tourism managers.<br />
A third element will provide support for the conservation of sensitive island<br />
environmental or cultural sites of national tourism significance. I<br />
Tourism already makes a major contribution to the regional economy. In most<br />
island countries it is already the largest source of foreign exchange earnings,<br />
with strong growth predicted through to the end of the century,<br />
But the region still accounts for only one per cent of the global tourism market<br />
and has enormous untapped potential.<br />
For examrple, tourist numbers to Australia are expected to rise to six million by<br />
2000. Each extra one per cent of the foreign arrivals to Australia Forum island<br />
cou ntr ies are able to attract would add 3, 000 jobs and contribute an extra<br />
million in foreign exchange earnings to the region.<br />
one of the South Pacific's greatest attractions is Its unique environment, How to<br />
use the environment effectively for tourism while protecting it is one of the<br />
region's biggest challenges. This scheme Is a start in that direction.<br />
