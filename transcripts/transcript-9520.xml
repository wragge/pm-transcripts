PRIME MINISTER 23/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
VISIT TO AUSTRALIA BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE<br />
CZECH REPUBLIC, H. E. MR VACLAV HAVEL<br />
am very pleased to announce that His Excellency Mr Vaclav Havel,<br />
President of the Czech Republic, accompanied by Mrs Olga Havlova, will visit<br />
Australia from 26 to 30 March as a guest of the Australian Government.<br />
President Havel will visit the Northern Territory as well as Canberra, Sydney<br />
and Melbourne.<br />
President Havel has been a central figure in the political and cultural life of<br />
his country. His courageous political activism was instrumental in the<br />
revolution which restored democracy to Czechoslovakia. He has since<br />
played a vital role in guiding the Czech Republic. He is also, of course, a<br />
distinguished playwright.<br />
I am looking forward to discussing with the President on 28 March ways in<br />
which Australia and the Czech Republic can enhance our economic, political<br />
and cultural ties. Our links are underpinned significantly by the thousands of<br />
Czechs who have migrated to Australia since 1945 and who have made such<br />
an important contribution to the life of this country.<br />
The Presidential party will include Mr Ivan Kocarnik, Deputy Prime Minister<br />
and Minister of Finance, Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, Minister of Industry and Trade,<br />
Mr Josef Tosovsky, Governor of the Czech National Bank and<br />
Mr Alexandr Vondra, First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs.<br />
CANBERRA 23 MARCH 1995 </p>
