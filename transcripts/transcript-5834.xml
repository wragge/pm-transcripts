J1JUSTIVAL2A<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 15 JUNE 1982<br />
VISIT TO SAUDI ARABIA BY MR SINCLAIR<br />
The Right Honourable Ian Sinclair, MP, Minister for<br />
Defence, will present the Australian Government's<br />
condolences in Riyadh, Saudi-Arabia, on the death<br />
of His Majesty King Khaled bin Abdul-Aziz bin<br />
Abdul-Rahman Al Sa'ud, King of Saudi Arabia.<br />
King Khaled passed away on 13 June and has been<br />
succeeded by his brother, King Fahd bin Abdul-Aziz<br />
bin Abdul-Rahman Al Sa'ud.<br />
A number of other countries will be sending high level<br />
delegations to Riyadh to express condolences. These<br />
include Vice President George Bush from the United<br />
States, Prince Philip and Secretary of State Pym from<br />
Britain, King Juan Carlos of Spain and President<br />
Mubarak of Egypt.<br />
The Australian Government's decision to send a senior<br />
Minister to present condolences in Riyadh is a mark<br />
of the respect in which King Khaled was held and the<br />
importance that is attached to the relations between<br />
Australia and Saudi Arabia. During the seven year<br />
reign of King Khaled, Saudi Arabia has assumed an<br />
increasingly important role in world political and<br />
economic affairs, and has played an important<br />
stabilizing role in Middle East affairs. Australia's<br />
relations with Saudi Arabia also developed strongly<br />
Mr Sinclair will present condolences in Riyadh on<br />
16 June and will return to Australia the next day.<br />
