FOR PRESS 8 NOVEMBER 1977<br />
JOINT COMMUNIQUE ISSUED ON 8 NOVEMBER 1977 BY THE<br />
PRIME MINISTERS OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA AND AUSTRALIA<br />
ON AUSTRALIAN AID TO PAPUA NEW GUINEA<br />
The Papua New Guinea Prime Minister, Mr Somare, and the<br />
Australian Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, announced today that<br />
the Australian aid supplement for 1978/ 79 under the Australian/<br />
Papua New Guinea Aid Agreement of 1976 would be $ A35 million.<br />
The two Prime Ministers recalled that in their Joint Communique<br />
of 4 March 1976 they had agreed upon a new aid relationship<br />
which would properly reflect Papua New Guinea's independent status.<br />
It had been agreed that the objectives-of the new relationship<br />
would be to facilitate and promote economic and social development<br />
for the people of Papua New Guinea, to facilitate the achievement<br />
by the Papua New Guinea Government of its objective of increasing<br />
self-reliance, and to enable Papua New Guinea to plan its<br />
development on the basis of resources available to it including<br />
those to be provided by Australia but to put an end to<br />
arrangements under which Australia had been involved in<br />
Papua New Guinea's budget-making.<br />
The two Prime Ministers further recalled that, under the 1976<br />
Agreement, Australia had agreed to enter into a new long-term<br />
commitment on economic and social aid to Papua New-. Guinea<br />
and to provide a minimum of $ AlBO million in social and economic<br />
aid to Papua New Guinea for each of the five years beginning<br />
1 July 1976. Further annual supplements to this basic annual<br />
grant were to be considered in the light of circumstances.<br />
It was decided that the annual supplements for 1976/ 77 and<br />
1977/ 78* above the base figure of $ A180 would be $ 10 million and<br />
million-respectively.<br />
In the past few weeks there had been exchanges of views between<br />
the Australian and Papua New Guinea Governments on the question of<br />
further annual supplements under the Agreement.<br />
The Papua New Guinea Minis-ter for Foreign Affairs, Mr Olewale,<br />
had discussions with Australian Ministers on the matter in<br />
September. During October, the Australian Minister for Foreign<br />
Affairs, Mr Peacock, also had discussions with Mr Holloway, the<br />
Papua New Guinea Finance Minister. Noting that the Papua New Guinea<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>Government had decided to move to a calendar fiscal year<br />
with effect from 1 January 1978, it was agreed that a<br />
decision on the level of supplementation for 1978/ 79<br />
was needed in the near future.<br />
On the basis of these Ministerial exchanges Mr Fraser has now<br />
informed Mr Somare that, subject to normal Parliamentary procedures<br />
relating to appropriations, the Australian Government will provide<br />
Papua New Guinea with an annual supplement in 1978/ 79, the third<br />
year of the Agreement, of $ A35 million. This will bring<br />
the Australian aid grant to Papua New Guinea for that year<br />
to $ A215 million.<br />
Mr Fraser also confirmed to Mr Somare that the Australian<br />
Government will give full and detailed consideration to ways<br />
and means by which the 1976 Agreement might be further developed<br />
on the question of the determination of the annual supplements<br />
for the fourth and fifth years of the Agreement.<br />
Mr Somare expressed his Government's warm appreciation of the<br />
Australian Government's decision on the level of the aid<br />
supplement for 1978/ 79 which he and his Ministerial colleagues<br />
saw as a renewed earnest of the Australian Government's commitmen<br />
to the agreed objectives of the 1976 Aid Agreement. </p>
