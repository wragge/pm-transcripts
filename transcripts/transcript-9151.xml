Subject: R\ V Paul Keating<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Compere' ( Jim Waley): For Paul Keating there's double cause for celebration on this<br />
first anniversary of his re-elected government. Yesterday Labor<br />
won the by-election in the Western Australian seat of former<br />
Treasurer, John Dawkins, a victory which brings to Canberra<br />
the Fremantle doctor, Carmen Lawrence, -who's expected to<br />
breeze straight into Cabinet.<br />
Laurie Oakes:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Laurie Oakes:<br />
Paul Keating: The Prime Minister is in our Canberra studio this morning. To<br />
talk with him, Sunday's political editor, Laurie Oakes. Laurie<br />
Thanks, Jim. Prime Minister, welcome to the program.<br />
Thank you, Laurie.<br />
Carmen Lawrence handed you a pretty good anniversary<br />
present. I think she did and congratulations to her. She won well and I<br />
think for the government to see a pick up, a swing to the<br />
government in a by-election, is unprecedented. I can't<br />
remember any time in the 25 years I've been in public life </p>
<p>Laurie Oakes:<br />
Paul Keating: when at any by-election there was a swing to the government.<br />
Even you wouldn't have predicted that, would you?<br />
I thought we would Someone asked me the other day and<br />
my staff were talking about it coming back from Perth last<br />
week, how we'd go, and I said I thought we would pull out the<br />
1993 result. As it turns out, we've picked up another one per<br />
cent.<br />
Laurie Oakes:<br />
Paul Keating: Carmen spoke to me last night and she said, ' Look, whatever<br />
this result means for me, there's no doubt that it would not<br />
have happened unless the government was doing reasonably<br />
well. And the notion that we're doing poorly in Western<br />
Australia I didn't find anywhere in the course of the<br />
campaign'. I think what it is also, Laurie, it's a repudiation of<br />
garbage bin politics. I mean she's suffered so much vilification.<br />
The attacks on her in the House of Representatives and the<br />
Senate under privilege about blood on her hands I mean all of<br />
that muck raking the Liberals literally ripped up the rule book<br />
for this by-election.<br />
But Carmen Lawrence herself in the campaign said everywhere<br />
she went she was getting feedback from people that they're<br />
sick and tired of the behaviour in the federal parliament too<br />
and she's going to bring that message to you and others in<br />
Canberra. Yes but I think it's one thing to talk about behaviour and it's<br />
another thing to talk about what is done and said. I mean for<br />
instance all of this attack on Ros Kelly over now a month in<br />
the end what does it bring the Liberals in a by-election?<br />
Answer: a swing against them. Look, Laurie, it's always. </p>
<p>Laurie Oakes:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Laurie Oakes:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Laurie Oakes:<br />
Paul Keating: That's really a long bow, isn't it? I wouldn't have thought the<br />
swing against them was down to the Ros Kelly affair. Surely<br />
that's got a fair bit to do with Liberal leadership woes?<br />
They were saying that the concentration on this issue and Mrs<br />
Kelly's resignation was a big plus for the Liberal Party. Well,<br />
where's the plus? I mean it's a legitimate question for me to<br />
ask. Where is the plus? The answer is there is no plus because<br />
the public wisely are looking for value always and they're<br />
looking for fundamentals.<br />
But your own polling, though, showed that at the time of the<br />
sports rorts affair hitting the front pages in the West there was<br />
a swing against you and it came back to you last week when<br />
the Liberals were brawling.<br />
I think the swing against I've said to you, I think Laurie,<br />
and I've said to others, all of this sort of static what is for the<br />
public, static and the public debate which doesn't go to their<br />
lives, their values, which doesn't go to the long run<br />
fundamentals of the country, just a big discount factor. If the<br />
Liberals want to keep at this, let them go their hardest but<br />
where does it leave them when there's a swing to the<br />
government in a by-election such as this? It leaves them with<br />
those tactics basically<br />
Just to make that grin a bit wider, the next McNair poll in the<br />
Bulletin Magazine shows that you've now got a 17-point lead<br />
over Dr Hewson as preferred Prime Minister. Have you seen<br />
him off, do you think? Who do you think you'll be fighting at<br />
the next election?<br />
Laurie, a year after the election a year ago, in the year since<br />
we've seen the economy heading towards 4 per cent </p>
<p>Laurie Oakes:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Laurie Oakes:<br />
Paul Keating: economic growth, 200,000 jobs, a legislative solution to the<br />
vexing problem of Mabo, Australia getting itself set up<br />
properly in the Asia-Pacific with APEC. They're the things of<br />
value and I think it is those things which carry the weight of<br />
public opinion.<br />
Do you think you'll be fighting the election against Dr<br />
Hewson, or has this result finished him?<br />
I don't know but you see he told us, and we should remember<br />
what he said a year ago that Australia would be into a double<br />
dip recession. You remember the gun sight ads in the election<br />
campaign bang, taking out your jobs. There's 200,000 been<br />
put there in their place. I think Malcolm Fraser's comment of<br />
two weeks ago in the Australian he said, ' A year after<br />
Fightback was repudiated by Dr Hewson no-one in the Liberal<br />
Party knows what the Liberal Party's philosophy or policies<br />
are'. And I think that's true.<br />
This result will worry some people. Obviously this is a signal<br />
to you to maintain the arrogance and you might get away with<br />
it because of the weakness of the Opposition.<br />
I just reject that maintaining the arrogance line, Laurie. Look,<br />
I started consulting about Mabo in April of 1993 and I kept it<br />
up til December. I mean arrogant people don't run those sorts<br />
of consultative processes. I did the same throughout the year<br />
on APEC trying to build a constituency for that leaders'<br />
meeting in November the following year. I think in the caucus<br />
and in the cabinet I'm the first amongst equals in there. It is a<br />
cooperative process. We've had a generational change inside<br />
the government. There's tremendous enthusiasm on the part of<br />
the newer Ministers. In that I think this sort of old claim, that<br />

Laurie Oakes:<br />
Paul Keating: to have pride in one's work and determination to see things<br />
done, is arrogance it's untrue. But whether it's untrue or not,<br />
I don' t in a sense care provided that we keep making the<br />
changes and we keep getting the fundamentals better.<br />
Carmen Lawrence presumably will go into the Ministry at the<br />
next caucus meeting on Tuesday week. Is that right?<br />
I would like to see her in the Ministry. It is a matter for the<br />
caucus. I mean everyone knows my views about this. I would<br />
very much like to see her in the government.<br />
And that would be the time table Tuesday week?<br />
In the event that the caucus agreed, yes.<br />
And what sort of portfolio do you have in mind? You must<br />
have thought about this.<br />
Not very much. No, I haven't because I would like to consult<br />
her. Laurie, there's a thing called commonsense and<br />
presumption. It's not sensible and it's presumptuous to have<br />
discussions myself and Carmen about what she might do<br />
and portfolio. The first thing is see what the public think. Let's<br />
get the by-election out of the road, see what the caucus thinks<br />
and in the course of those consultations I'll see what I think. I<br />
mean after talking to my colleagues, to Brian Howe, my<br />
deputy, and to the other leaders and opinion leaders inside the<br />
caucus, I'll talk about the spread of jobs.<br />
But presumably if she's to be the kind of use that you want,<br />
you'll have to give her some sort of important portfolio in the<br />
social policy area, won't you?<br />
Not necessarily. It should be<br />
You wouldn't get rid of her on admin services?<br />
No. I think, given her record as a Premier and as a major </p>
<p>Laurie Oakes:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Laurie Oakes:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Laurie Oakes: contributor to the Labor Party and to Australian public opinion,<br />
she should have a policy job.<br />
Now, are you just filling one vacancy the Ros Kelly vacancy?<br />
Or are you now going to close up the hole left by Alan<br />
Griffiths? It's clear from the sequence of events that it's not going to be<br />
opportune to resolve the question with Alan Griffiths now.<br />
There's some flexibility there for us. I'll soon be establishing<br />
the inquiry which Alan asked me to establish. That'll take<br />
some time, though. So I mean it still leaves the government<br />
happily, I might say in a position where it can make<br />
judgments about all these things. But it will mean, I think, the<br />
fact that Dr Lawrence will be joining the caucus and will<br />
contest a place in the ministry, that it will be the occasion of a<br />
set of decisions about ministerial responsibility.<br />
This will be your fourth reshuffle in three months. That's<br />
starting to look a bit untidy. People are talking about<br />
instability. You won't want another one a month or two down<br />
the track, will you?<br />
Laurie, let me say this to you: I don't think in terms of Alan<br />
Griffiths or Ros Kelly any of us would want these things. But<br />
let me also say that what we are seeing, and have seen, with<br />
the resignations of people like Neil Blewett and John Kerin and<br />
John Dawkins is the opportunity for a major generational shift<br />
in the government. The vigour, the youthfulness, the vivacity<br />
for the job all those sorts of things are on display I think with<br />
the newer members of the ministry and the cabinet and, might<br />
I say, those who've been there across the last 10 years.<br />
But surely you want it to settle down? Can I ask you I </p>
<p>Paul Keating:<br />
Laurie Oakes:<br />
Paul Keating: specifically, do you still hold to that promise to keep Alan<br />
Griffiths' job open until this situation is resolved or, for the<br />
sake of stability in the government, do you think it's gone on<br />
too long?<br />
I think that's a matter to be amicably settled. I think this is a<br />
very fair caucus. No-one is going to say of Alan, well, because<br />
of this matter where you've resigned but have since been<br />
cleared by the police, and he has and where there's an<br />
inquiry in prospect, which he has every confidence of being<br />
cleared in terms of his ministerial conduct. This is a very fair<br />
caucus and I think that caucus will consider Alan's position<br />
very favourably.<br />
On the night before the election a year ago at a party with your<br />
staff, you said that if you won the election Labor would do<br />
more things here than any other Western government will do in<br />
the next three years. Now there's been criticism in the last few<br />
days that at apart from the employment White Paper and a<br />
Mabo social justice package, the agenda for the next couple of<br />
years looks pretty empty.<br />
I don't think that. Let's go back to that statement. What have<br />
we got since? We've got the economy growing faster than any<br />
other Western economy between 31/ 2 and 4 per cent now.<br />
We've had the creation of 200,000 jobs across the year. We've<br />
had the legislative settlement of Mabo, which in most<br />
comparable countries could have taken five to 10 years and put<br />
the whole development of a continent under question, with<br />
continual claims being lodged in the High Court. We have the<br />
continual improvement in Australia's position in Asia, in the<br />
world. We're not only building structures in Australia but </p>
<p>Laurie Oakes:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Laurie Oakes:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Laurie Oakes:<br />
Paul Keating: we're building structures for Australia outside of Australia, and<br />
we're now going to try and do something in Western world<br />
terms novel about long-term unemployment.<br />
I was going to ask you about that.<br />
Either we have developed in the public commentators a bunch<br />
of sort of insatiable change junkies. I've been here for<br />
years, Laurie. No coalition Prime Minister could have made<br />
that claim after a year in office at any one time.<br />
Let's talk about unemployment. Obviously the economy is<br />
recovering. The former Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank<br />
said on Business Sunday this morning that even though when<br />
this recovery reaches a peak he expects unemployment to still<br />
be at 8 or 9 per cent. Is he right?<br />
Time will tell but one thing is for sure: long term<br />
unemployment will be far higher than at any other time and I<br />
think we do have to get these people job ready and stream<br />
them back into the labour force. In other words, of those<br />
laminations, that laminar flow from various parts of the<br />
community into employment, one of those laminations has to<br />
be from the long-term unemployed. In other words, what we<br />
are trying to do is to get those people out, up, get their esteem<br />
up, get their work experience up and get them back into work.<br />
But the possibility of unemployment still at 9 per cent when the<br />
recovery hits its peek: that's pretty grim, isn't it?<br />
I don't know whether I'd be as pessimistic as that. But, again,<br />
one thing's for sure: there is no substitute for economic growth<br />
for employment and the government does want to see the<br />
economy grow. I noticed some terribly dismal and I thought<br />
pretty pathetic headlines in one of our major newspapers a day<br />
1; </p>
<p>Laurie Oakes:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Laurie Oakes: or so ago saying, ' Let's put our foot on the brake'. We've got<br />
a sort of a pile of unused resources out there in the capital<br />
stock. We've got a pool of people unemployed. Now is the<br />
time to take those resources up and not to in some way put a<br />
suture on it just as we're starting to get the thing flowing.<br />
There seems to be a mindset at the moment that good news<br />
equals bad news, that the growth figures mean that inflation is<br />
inevitable, higher interest are inevitable.<br />
I think we just can't cop this kind of analysis, Laurie. The<br />
country cannot cop this sort of gloomy analysis. When we're in<br />
a recession, it's terrible. We grow for six months, it's<br />
shocking. From the dismal sort of fiscal and monetary watches<br />
I mean people who in the big public debate wouldn't blow a<br />
candle out. I mean in terms of if you said to them, ' Look, you<br />
run an agenda and get the place back on its feet', they wouldn't<br />
know where to start. Now, this place of sort of studied caution<br />
at this point, at this point, we don't need it. That's not to say<br />
we don't need always to be vigilant about inflation and we<br />
will be or that we don't need a sensible role for monetary<br />
policy. Of course we do. But we have been in a recession,<br />
after all. You've just made the point about the store of<br />
unemployed people, including the long-term unemployed.<br />
Now's the time to get on with the growth and to get the place<br />
really moving so we take some of those resources up.<br />
Another anniversary question: again in that speech in the night<br />
before the election you told your staff that voters were<br />
contemplating taking Labor back but not with any relish. And<br />
you said, ' We love their votes but we don't particularly need<br />
their love'. Is that the way you still feel? You don't care how </p>
<p>Paul Keating:<br />
Laurie Oakes:<br />
Paul Keating: Australians think about you?<br />
We want their respect and their regard. Look, they must<br />
understand now that Labor is setting Australia up in the<br />
for a period of low inflat ion regrowth. We've got proximity to<br />
markets that are growing faster than any in the world for the<br />
first time in our history. This government has made the<br />
structures and the access and the cultural change to exports to<br />
let us be part of that. Now, it is in those matters of substance,<br />
of fundamental importance to Australia, that mattered yesterday<br />
in that by-election. They will matter in the next federal<br />
election. In other words, the public elects the government to<br />
deal with Australia's problems and its fundamentals and the<br />
government responds. Whether on the way through they like<br />
the way I part my hair, or the look of the faces of the ministry,<br />
in a sense is secondary to whether they approve of the policy<br />
fundamental job and the fundamental things that the<br />
government's doing.<br />
If yesterday's result was not about Carmen Lawrence's<br />
personal popularity, does that mean you expect a swing to the<br />
government in next week's Bonython by-election?<br />
I think each by-election is different but I think that the<br />
government is travelling reasonably well because I think the<br />
public do look for value. I've always thought this always<br />
right throughout my political life. Laurie, you've reported me<br />
saying nearly a decade ago that good policies are good politics<br />
that don't sell the public the dump, don't believe cynically you<br />
can feed them pap or dross and that they'll take it. They won't.<br />
They'll look through it and see what you're actually doing.<br />
What we're doing is re-modelling Australia and giving it a </p>

Laurie Oakes:<br />
Paul Keating:<br />
Laurie Oakes:<br />
Compere: future and giving it a sense of optimism, particularly I think<br />
with our young people, giving it a setting in the part of the<br />
world we live.<br />
You're getting some help from the Opposition, though, aren't<br />
you? We've got an Opposition that doesn't know where it is. I mean<br />
I noticed John Howard saying this morning, ' I'm not<br />
yesterday's man'. He's right about that. He's a man of<br />
years ago.<br />
We're out of time but thank you very much, Mr Keating.<br />
Good, Laurie.<br />
Back to you, Jim.<br />
