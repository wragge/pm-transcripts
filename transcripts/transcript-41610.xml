    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Liberal and Nationals Government is acting to cut travel times for the people of the NSW South Coast by committing to build a new northbound bridge across the Shoalhaven River.</p>
<p>This $155 million commitment will ease congestion and improve freight movement in the region.</p>
<p>It will mean South Coast residents spend less time in the car and more time with their families.</p>
<p>The new bridge will cut the travel time for about 50,000 vehicles that cross the Shoalhaven River on the Princes Highway each day.</p>
<p>The project will include a new four-lane bridge with intersection upgrades on approach roads, substantially improving commuter and freight access and supporting future growth of the region.</p>
<p>By managing the budget, we are able to invest in the roads that the people of the south coast need. This project will enable people to get home sooner and safer. It has been secured by the ongoing advocacy of the Member for Gilmore, Ann Sudmalis.</p>
<p>The Princes Highway is the main road and key freight corridor connecting Sydney with the Illawarra, Shoalhaven and regional communities to transport goods right along the south coast of New South Wales.</p>
<p>The current northbound bridge will be dedicated to southbound traffic and the existing southbound bridge, built in 1881, will be preserved for ongoing community use.</p>
<p>Community involvement and feedback has been vital in bringing the project to this point and the Australian Government will seek an equal funding contribution from the New South Wales Government to see this important regional project delivered to the south coast.</p>
<p>This commitment follows the Australian Governmentâ€™s previous funding of $10 million for planning to develop the preferred option. The final business case is well progressed and will be submitted to Infrastructure Australia for assessment.</p>
