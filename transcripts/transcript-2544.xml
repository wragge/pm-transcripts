COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. W. McMAHON, M. P.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
ON<br />
LONG TERM AID TO BANGLA DESH<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 29 February 1972]<br />
Mr McMAHON ( Lowe-Prime Minister)-<br />
by leave-Honourable members will<br />
recall that on 31st January the Australian<br />
Government announced formal recognition<br />
of the Government of Sheikh Mujibur<br />
Rahman as the Government of the new<br />
state of Bangla Desh. In announcing recognition,<br />
the Minister for Foreign Affairs<br />
( Mr N. H. Bowen) said that, as a nation<br />
of 75 million people bordering the Indian<br />
Ocean, Bangla Desh was likely to play an<br />
increasingly important role in the affairs of<br />
South and South East Asia. He also said<br />
we looked forward to co-operating with<br />
Bangla Desh in various regional organisations,<br />
including the Colombo Plan and the<br />
Economic Commission for Asia and the<br />
Far East. In taking this action, Australia<br />
was among the first of the Western and<br />
Commonwealth nations to accord recognition,<br />
and, I think we can claim, gave the<br />
lead to many of our neighbours. We have<br />
since followed up this initiative with positive<br />
steps in the field of aid to Bangla<br />
Desh. On 16th February, less than 3 weeks<br />
after we had recognised the new nation,<br />
my colleague, the Minister for Foreign<br />
Affairs, announced the imminent departure<br />
of the first sea-cargo of emergency relief<br />
aid to be shipped direct to Bangla Desh.<br />
During the same weekend, the first trainee<br />
under the Colombo Plan to ' be nominated<br />
by Bangia Desh arrived in Australia. He<br />
will be followed by many others, as our<br />
long term plans to assist Bangla Desh with<br />
technical training come to fruition. At the time the announcement of the<br />
direct cargo of relief aid was made, the<br />
Minister said that the Government had the<br />
long-term needs of Bangla Desh under<br />
active consideration. Bangla Desh is one of<br />
the most overpopulated and impoverished<br />
regions in the world. Its natural resources<br />
are few, its secondary industry barely<br />
developed and much of what had been<br />
established was destroyed during the fighting<br />
there. International aid will be required<br />
on a large scale, not only to provide<br />
immediate relief and repair the damage<br />
caused during the war, but also to help in<br />
building up this young nation as a viable<br />
economic unit. We have also borne in<br />
mind the words of the Bangla Desh Minister<br />
for Rehabilitation, who said recently in<br />
welcoming Australian emergency relief aid:<br />
' He gives twice who gives quickly.'<br />
So the Government has been looking to<br />
what aid Australia can best provide, to<br />
accord with . the future long-term needs of<br />
Bangla Desh. We have been looking ahead<br />
to the next stage, and to longer-term aid<br />
programmes. For the next financial year,<br />
beginning in just a few months, Australia<br />
will provide aid for Bangla Desh totalling<br />
$ 4m. This will be in addition to the $ 2m<br />
of aid already in the pipeline. This new<br />
amount of S4m will be for special rehabilitation<br />
assistance, for -regular aid, including<br />
projects and experts, training, and for food<br />
aid. It is a special amount which we shall<br />
make available to assist Bangla Desh in<br />
coping with the extraordinary problems </p>
<p>which will confront it in its early stages of<br />
nationhood. We have been having continuous discussions<br />
through our mission in Dacca with<br />
the Government of Bangla Desh. Details<br />
of the precise forms in which we intend to<br />
provide this longer-term aid are being<br />
worked out on the basis of the planning<br />
priorities of the Bangla Desh Government.<br />
These will be announced at appropriate<br />
times by my colleague, the Minister for<br />
Foreign Affairs. I would, however, like to<br />
make it clear to the House that the plans<br />
for new aid to Bangla Desh which I have<br />
just announced are the first stage of Australia's<br />
long-term assistance. The ways and<br />
means in which this programme is to be<br />
and will be developed shall be kept under<br />
regular review. Earlier I said that Australia had taken a further initiative. It is, I point<br />
out to the House, that, apart from India,<br />
which is Bangla Desh's closest neighbour,<br />
Australia is one of the first of those<br />
nations which have recognised Bangla<br />
Desh to come forward with a commitment<br />
of longer-term aid, other than emergency<br />
relief. I believe that, as we gave the lead<br />
to many nations in recognising Bangla<br />
Desh, this action, of announcing plans for<br />
longer-term aid may also give a lead to<br />
other nations to act similarly. For it is<br />
only with the concerted help of friendly<br />
countries that Bangla Desh will be enabled<br />
to emerge from the problems of her birth<br />
in war. Our aim is to help Bangla Desh to<br />
take her place as a stable and developing<br />
economy which will make a constructive<br />
contribution to the South Asian region.<br />
