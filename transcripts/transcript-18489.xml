This ground, Adelaide Oval, is universally admired and it's one of the grand old venues of Australian sport and Ian has spoken to you this morning about some of those moments in sport, some of the history of this place.</p>
<p>It's been home to football and cricket in Adelaide for 140 years, a sports ground with a river end and a cathedral end, and with a marvellous traditional scoreboard - the best in the world just as described by Ian.</p>
<p>For so many South Australians, it's a place of very fond memories. Bert Oldfield's courage in 1932, and Mike Hussey's run chase in 2006, and the Victor Richardson gates and the old scoreboard are known and loved by so many.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of South Australians have jammed in here to watch football games in the past.</p>
<p>We, of course, we were participating in our own football league before the days of the AFL, and when people came here to feel very close to their fellow South Australians and to watch a great game.</p>
<p>And there was that wonderful preview when Port played Melbourne at the end of last year, of what AFL footy will be like here from 2014.</p>
<p>So this is a very big project, it's taken long term decisions, substantial investments, sacrifices from everyone involved and above all faith in the future.</p>
<p>And that's happened because leaders in the community of the wider South Australian public all came to recognise that we have a chance to give Adelaide Oval a future every bit as grand as its past.</p>
<p>Securing the future of top-line cricket here, ensuring the long-term viability of AFL football in South Australia, and bringing to life the River Precinct and the centre of Adelaide all week and all year round. </p>
<p>It's why, when I was asked by Kate Ellis in her capacity as local member, to provide funding to help deliver this project, we were pleased to provide the funding.</p>
<p>I know that our contribution, $30 million, is only part of this much larger $535 million project.</p>
<p>But I also know that this funding will make a difference in securing the development of the surrounding wetlands and making sure there is suitable car parking in and around the Oval for people who come here for all sorts of events.</p>
<p>We didn't want such a grand redevelopment to be diminished by not helping to get some of these very important details right.</p>
<p>And I know, growing up here in South Australia, just how much of a change this redeveloped oval will bring.</p>
<p>You're in days of change for South Australia, very, very optimistic days lie ahead.</p>
<p>There's a real focus on this city now, on Adelaide and its future, and I know through this redevelopment, the other work that is happening at State Government level and at local council level, the city can look forward to its future with pride.</p>
<p>And part of that sense of pride will be what happens here and seeing in just two years from now one of the great sporting grounds of this country rise up around us.</p>
<p>I want to congratulate everyone who's worked so hard, congratulations for being on time and on budget one week in, here's hoping every week's like the first week, and for all of you who are doing all of the hard work, on you rests the dreams and hopes of the young cricketers and footballers who are sharing with us the unveiling of the time capsule today commemorating the start of major construction work.</p>
<p>So it's great they're here to witness it. I'm going to look forward to coming here in the years ahead, to see what's achieved here, to watching some footy here, to spending some time at the new redeveloped Adelaide Oval.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for all being here this morning to celebrate this special event. </p>
