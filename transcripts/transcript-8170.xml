CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ANNUAL DINNER, METAL TRADES INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION<br />
CANBERRA 22 OCTOBER 1990<br />
It is always a pleasure to address the Metal Trades Industry<br />
Association -and particularly so when its Annual Conference<br />
has adopted as its central theme such a critically important<br />
topic. Australia's " brainpower imperative" means many things.<br />
It means we value intellectual skills; it means we are<br />
committed to learning and to training in our schools and<br />
universities and in our offices and factories; it means we<br />
are working for the future with research and development; it<br />
means we are seeking to fulfill the creative potential of<br />
our minds so that the inventions of our imagining can become<br />
the instruments of our daily life; and it means applying our<br />
knowledge so that the products of our mind can become the<br />
objects of international trade for the betterment of our<br />
national economy.<br />
It means we turn the lucky country into a country that is<br />
clever as well.<br />
During the last election campaign, when I used that phrase,<br />
" the clever country", I did so proud of the Government's<br />
achievements and excited by the plans we had for the<br />
forthcoming term of Government.<br />
As you know, since the election we have pushed ahead with<br />
creating a new network of Cooperative Research Centres,<br />
linking universities, the CSIRO and other research groups in<br />
an unprecedented way, to focus the talents of our best<br />
researchers on projects that will stretch the horizons of<br />
our knowledge and enlarge the capacities of our economy.<br />
Already the program is showing dividends, through the<br />
greatly enhanced interaction between research institutions.<br />
There is a sense of willingness and determination in the<br />
science and technology community to pull together in the<br />
interests of Australia's future. </p>
<p>At the same time, the Prime Minister's Science Council that<br />
I have established is well underway. The Council meets<br />
again next week to consider important topics related to<br />
adding value to raw materials and to capture more<br />
effectively the benefits of research in manufacturing<br />
industry.<br />
Professor David Craig, the President of Australia's most<br />
prestigious scientific body, the Australian Academy of<br />
Science, recently praised my Government's " strong and<br />
manifest backing for science and technology" and that is<br />
praise indeed for the nation as a whole, since it will be<br />
the nation as a whole that will stand to gain from these<br />
initiatives. So when I used that phrase " the clever country", I was aware<br />
of what the Federal Government could do and would do in this<br />
critical area.<br />
What I perhaps underestimated was the way in which the<br />
phrase would be picked up by the community at large in the<br />
media, in the professions, in business and enter the<br />
lexicon as a new yardstick of national self-assessment.<br />
What we have seen since the election, and it has been very<br />
welcome, has; been not just a burgeoning of the use of that<br />
phrase, " clever country", but with it, an ever greater<br />
commitment, throughout the community, to doing what is<br />
necessary to build such a country.<br />
So it is within that broad context that I express my<br />
congratulations to the MTIA for this conference on the<br />
" brainpower imperative".<br />
You are demonstrating that the commitment to value-adding,<br />
which is the prime focus of your work as individual<br />
manufacturers, is in fact part of your deeper commitment to<br />
a process of adding value to the quality of Australian life<br />
itself.<br />
My friends,<br />
That commitment is of course not surprising coming from the<br />
MTIA which is, as I have had the opportunity to say in the<br />
past, one of the foremost industry participants in the great<br />
transformation that is sweeping the Australian economy.<br />
From being one of the staunchest advocates of protectionism<br />
you have become one of the most far-sighted and active<br />
agents in the creation of a more competitive,<br />
internationally-oriented Australian economy.<br />
You haven't Just paid lip service to the goal of a vigorous<br />
manufacturing sector; you have been out there building it. </p>
<p>I have always valued and appreciated the close and<br />
constructive links between the MTIA and the Federal<br />
Government links that date back to the earliest days of<br />
the Accord and the Economic Summit.<br />
A few weeks ago we met once more, and, seated in the Cabinet<br />
Room, your representatives gave me and my colleagues the<br />
benefit of your views about the national economy and its<br />
prospects for the future.<br />
There's no secret that it was a pretty frank discussion;<br />
some of your people have been doing it tough, and that's<br />
what you were there to tell me.<br />
But what I believe was apparent to those of you engaged in<br />
those private talks was that I have never underestimated the<br />
depth or the: breadth of the problems being experienced in<br />
parts of the economy.<br />
I have never tried to hide from the fact that the prevailing<br />
economic conditions, and the strategy that the Government<br />
has followed to remedy those conditions, have caused some<br />
hurt and not just for metal trades employers but other<br />
businesses too, along with home owners, farmers and others<br />
throughout the Australian community.<br />
I recognise that. How could I not? I probably travel around<br />
Australia, and meet more Australians, and listen to more<br />
individual views about the nation and the economy, than any<br />
other person.<br />
It's one of the most enjoyable privileges of this job and<br />
one of the great sources of learning for me.<br />
As far as I am concerned, the views I get from individual<br />
Australians, as well as from groups such as the MTIA, form a<br />
vitally important supplement to my regular Canberra diet,<br />
which at times tends towards a pretty desiccated menu of<br />
economic analysis.<br />
You only need to glance at the Financial Review today to see<br />
what I mean. It reports " a quiet battle" allegedly being<br />
waged among the Government's advisers about how to run<br />
monetary policy.<br />
This debate might seem extraordinarily remote, and even<br />
somewhat callous, to anyone who lives in that vast place<br />
known in Canberra as " the real world" that is, the rest of<br />
Australia. It is surely cold comfort to those who are struggling and<br />
making sacrifices to be told that the extent of their future<br />
hardship depends on the outcome of some arcane debate among<br />
nameless officials. </p>
<p>I make the point, without commenting on the accuracy or<br />
otherwise of the story, that there are, of course, always<br />
differences of opinion among advisers and public servants;<br />
that's their job, and I'd be concerned only if they were in<br />
unanimous agreement.<br />
But my job as Prime Minister and the job of my Cabinet<br />
colleagues is different: we have the responsibility to<br />
decide, and to do so according to what we believe are the<br />
best interests of the people of Australia.<br />
That is why the time you spent in meeting with us a few<br />
weeks ago was well spent.<br />
Your representations, along with those of others, forcefully<br />
underlined the picture we were getting from the official<br />
statistics about the impact of high interest rates.<br />
So we moved a week ago to bring interest rates down by<br />
another percentage point. It was the fifth easing of<br />
monetary policy since the start of the year, with results<br />
now flowing through to businesses and home borrowers.<br />
The dollar has moved down substantially as a result, with<br />
further benefit to Australian exporters.<br />
But no one pretends that this is the end of the matter.<br />
Economic revitalisation is a job for the stayers; this<br />
Government is in it for the long haul.<br />
So we will keep the pressure on, with wages and fiscal<br />
policy and with unrelenting efforts to improve the<br />
efficiency of the economy, so that Australia does emerge as<br />
a more competitive and productive place.<br />
The interest rate cut was just another instalment a<br />
significant instalment, certainly in the continuing<br />
economic strategy we are pursuing.<br />
It's a strategy that I know is vital to the interests of<br />
your members. It is a strategy designed to reduce the<br />
current account deficit, and with it the growth in our<br />
foreign debt as a proportion of GDP, and to bring our<br />
inflation more into line with our trading partners.<br />
It is astonishing to read that the Business Council of<br />
Australia declared over the weekend that there is no<br />
strategy to our economic policy " no policy framework the<br />
business community can believe in".<br />
If the average Australian were asked his or her opinion, it<br />
would probably be that there is too much strategy too<br />
tight a focus on the long-term goals at the expense of more<br />
immediate, but of course counter-productive, targets like<br />
lower interest rates. </p>
<p>If the average trade unionist were asked, we would probably<br />
hear a similar analysis: too long a view at the expense of<br />
short-term wage increases.<br />
The point is, this Government has formulated and implemented<br />
an economic strategy that is wholly unprecedented in<br />
Australian history in its determined rejection of the<br />
false logic of protectionism, its embrace of long-term<br />
structural ripform, and its responsible macro-economic<br />
management. Some have suggested that our strategy is leading to a<br />
serious recession. Let me draw here, as I have in<br />
Parliament, the differences between conditions in 1990 and<br />
conditions in 1982/ 83.<br />
In 1982-83, GDP fell by 2% over four consecutive<br />
quarters; today we have yet to see two consecutive<br />
negative quarters<br />
in 1982-83, employment fell by 2.6% over five<br />
consecutive quarters; today quarterly employment<br />
growth remains positive<br />
in 1982-83, private business investment fell by<br />
today the fall in private investment is<br />
forecast to be much less.<br />
Underlying those differences are these structural<br />
differences: in 1982-83, the recession had been sparked by a<br />
wages explosion; today wages growth is moderate<br />
and controlled<br />
in. 1982-83, the 90 day bank bill rate peaked at<br />
22%; this time the peak was a little over 18% and<br />
has eased by around 5 percentage points since<br />
in. 1982-83, the public sector borrowing<br />
requirement was 5.7% of GDP; today it is zero,<br />
with the public sector making no net call on<br />
private savings.<br />
So with double-digit inflation and double-digit<br />
unemployment, 1982-83 was the worst recession in 50 years.<br />
We will see nothing like that this time around. Indeed, the<br />
shape of the recovery that will emerge as we enter 1991 and<br />
1992 was foreshadowed in our Budget documents.<br />
My comments to you are not a best-guess prediction by some<br />
arms-length economic commentator, but a soundly-based<br />
estimate by the leader of the Government that has designed<br />
and pursued an economic strategy to achieve just that<br />
result. That is another difference from 1982-83 that the statistics<br />
do not reveal. </p>
<p>6.<br />
The Fraser-Howard Government presided over an economy that<br />
was pitching downhill, informed only by the philosophy of<br />
Mr Micawber that is, by the hope that something would turn<br />
up. This Government can look to a recovery fuelled by the easing<br />
in monetary policy, and the personal tax cuts and wage<br />
increases of Accord Mark VI. Inventory and housing cycles<br />
will recover. Recent falls in the dollar, if sustained, will<br />
help exporters and manufacturers. Employment growth can be<br />
expected to resume under the Accord.<br />
So the main concern to manufacturers like yourselves can<br />
take centre stage again: diversifying and improving our<br />
competitiveness so that the products of your expertise and<br />
your investment can get on to the markets of the world and<br />
win new buyers there.<br />
My friends, let me turn finally to industrial relations.<br />
I have noted with interest Dr Uhlenbruch's speech of this<br />
morning, and in particular your concerns about enterprise<br />
negotiations and overaward versus award payments. I am also<br />
aware of course of the claim by relevant unions in your<br />
industry for an across the board 4 percent productivity<br />
payment. It is clear that these issues raise concerns for the<br />
Government that go well beyond their impact on the metal<br />
trades itself. Indeed they go to the heart of the Accord<br />
Mark VI and the future viability and effectiveness of the<br />
overall wages system.<br />
The Government is determined to ensure that<br />
the stability achieved under the current approach of<br />
developing consistent minimum rates between awards be<br />
maintained enterprise negotiations play an important role in<br />
accelerating the implementation of restructured awards<br />
into individual enterprises<br />
the 7 per cent wage target for 1990-91 is achieved.<br />
I want you to know that Federal Cabinet discussed this issue<br />
this afternoon; you should know that the Government is<br />
determined to ensure that the principles I have just<br />
outlined are given effect.<br />
Indeed it is necessary that such principles be recognised by<br />
all parties to national negotiations as we move to a wider<br />
consensus based approach to discussions about future wagefixing<br />
and industrial relations systems within Australia.<br />
I I </p>
<p>The Government does not see enterprise bargaining operating<br />
in a totally unfettered way. That would be simply a re-run<br />
of the disasters of the early 1980s.<br />
Enterprise bargaining should operate under guidelines<br />
established : by the Industrial Relations Commission<br />
including the requirement that the increases be paid for<br />
achive improvements in productivity and profitability;<br />
results not Promises.<br />
In our view, incorporating the increases from enterprise<br />
bargaining into industry awards will only exacerbate the<br />
flow-on problems highlighted by Dr Uhlenbruch. It will take<br />
us back to the days of leap-frogging and of interminable<br />
wage rounds days well known to you in the metal industry.<br />
It would also set back the introduction of the flexibility<br />
that we have all been seeking in the wage system.<br />
We do not ignore the concerns of employers faced with<br />
disputes about enterprise-specific increases. But we are<br />
confident that a solution can be found under the auspices of<br />
the Commission by developing guidelines that do not reflect<br />
the money outcomes in minimum rates awards.<br />
Options could include production bonuses and performancerelated<br />
pay that do not affect the regular award rate and<br />
would not therefore generate inconsistencies or encourage<br />
leap-frogging. If the parties so desire such options could<br />
be included in the award.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
I close as I began. Let me express my appreciation to the<br />
MTIA for extending its hospitality to me this evening and,<br />
more importantly, for extending to me and my Government the<br />
benefits of your constructive advice throughout the year. I<br />
look forward. to your continued active involvement in the<br />
resolution of the key economic issues we face as a nation in<br />
the year ahead. </p>
