PRIMEMLINISTE<br />
FOR MEDIA FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 24 1982<br />
ADDRESS TO THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING<br />
OF THE AUSTRALIAN GREEK WELFARE SOCIETY<br />
I welcome the opportunity to be here to celebrate the<br />
Society's 10th anniversary. You are a significant<br />
contributor to the network of organisations, churches<br />
and brotherhoods an * d regional associations that make<br />
such a major contribution to the' vitality of Australia's<br />
Greek community.<br />
The work of the network serves both _. Australians of Greok<br />
extraction and the whole . of Australia's multicultural.<br />
society. I think I firs-t attended a meeting of the<br />
Australian Greek Welfare Group almost a decade ago in<br />
December 1973, and knowing the Welfare's reputation for<br />
fire-eating, I accepted the invitation with some trepidation.<br />
I thought you were going to ask for things like a major<br />
review of post-arrival programmes and services; a multicultural.<br />
televis-ion service; funding for ethnic schools; ethnic<br />
radio across Australia. On the night, you appeared to be<br />
content with briefing me on various other issues, needs<br />
and priorities. What I didn't fully grasp was that I hadjust<br />
been condemend to a decade of correspondence from<br />
Spiro Moraitis.<br />
Due to their distinctive -culture, the Scots have always<br />
been equipped to deal appropriately with Greeks bearing<br />
gifts. Over the last 10 years we have been taught to be<br />
waryof Greeks armed with typewriters. But in the course<br />
of that decade, and partly because of such typewriters,<br />
a vast amount has been accomplished.<br />
The Australian Greek Welfare Society's community and<br />
advocacy role has been a major catalyst for change.<br />
Not least, the Australian Greek Welfare Society has urged<br />
and advised politicians in both State and Federal spheres<br />
on a variety of issues. The issues the Society has pursued<br />
with me include welfare7 multicultural broadcasting, education,<br />
child care, employment and training. We have not always agreed<br />
that a particular course of action is the most appropriate,<br />
but we have always understood the.. value of dialogue, of the<br />
open expression of viewpoints, and the need for service to<br />
Australia. / 2 </p>
<p>G-W2S<br />
In all our discussions, I have always appreciated the Society's<br />
ability to reach judgments on the basis of the issues themselves<br />
rather than on the basis of other concerns. That has made Ihe<br />
Society's support on the issues very gratifying, and its<br />
criticisms more pointed and more effective. But the Australian<br />
Greek Welfare Society is not merely a body demanding action<br />
from other people. It has itself acted to deliver service<br />
in a number of areas including welfare, child care,, youth<br />
work and educational and vocational counselling. Byi its<br />
actions, the Australian Greek Welfare Society has shown<br />
that those who paternalistically believed that ethnic<br />
communities needed help, but could not help themselves,<br />
were very wrong indeed.<br />
In 1978, the Galbally Report, of which your own Nick Polites<br />
was an author, recognised " the growing capacity and desire<br />
of ethnic organisations to provide their own services".<br />
We acted on that recognition, and our approach has been<br />
vindicated by the recent evaluation of the Galbally Report,<br />
particularly in respect to the Grant-in-Aid Scheme, which,<br />
I understand, is of some interest to you.<br />
That evaluation found that the Grant-in-Aid Scheme has been<br />
very successful. Ethnic groups have been able to establish<br />
and extend much needed-and much appreciated programmes.<br />
Bilingual staff have increased substantially, and community<br />
groups and organisations are-both willing and able to take<br />
on even greater responsibilities. On the basis of that<br />
evaluation, we are extending the Grant-in-Aid Scheme to<br />
further enable community-based agencies, particularly<br />
those ethnically based, to provide welfare services to<br />
migrants. Hopefully we have put behind us the specious arguments that<br />
special services for ethnic groups, delivered by ethnic<br />
groups -themselves are a source of division. But they<br />
really shouldn't exist or should be done away with at the<br />
earliest possible opportunity. All groups need organisations<br />
that are particularly sensitive to. their own needs, that have<br />
a capacity to deal with their clients needs sensitively<br />
and with a high degree of cultural and linguistic awareness.<br />
I think it is a sign that our growing national maturity<br />
that we now recognise that services for migrants are no<br />
different from the special services we support for other<br />
groups with particular needs in our society. At the same<br />
time, however, we should not avoid the realisation that<br />
much more needs to be done to make general agencies<br />
serve the whole Australian population regardless of their<br />
ethnic origin.<br />
Achieving this will require time because large organisations<br />
are sometimes resistant to change, but I have no doubt<br />
that given a continuous impetus, departments and authorities<br />
will increasingly meet the needs of Australia'. s ethnic groups.<br />
That impetus will be given because what we are committed to<br />
is not one-off actions, but on-going reform across a broad<br />
front. Over the past four years, we have had a major review of<br />
post-arrival services; established . a multicultural television<br />
service, provided funding for ethnic schools; and extended<br />
established ethnic radio right across Australia. ./ 3<br />

<p>A-GW3--<br />
We have entered into a major new commitment to implement<br />
al'mo-st without exception the recomimendatLions of the<br />
, Galbally report, and I think you will know from the last<br />
week that we don't necessarily accept the recommendations<br />
of bodies that are put to us. Sometimes we reject recommendations<br />
even from Royal Commissions, when they are wrongly based.<br />
But the fact that we have overwhelmingly accepted the<br />
recommendations of that review, * says much for the quality<br />
of the review and I hope it says something of the commitment<br />
of the Government.<br />
The measures proposed will extend and improve special programmes<br />
and services for migrants and most importantly they will<br />
considerably enhance the equality of access and opportunity and<br />
direct assistance to those who need it most. Over $ 200 million<br />
has been spent on migrant services and programmes since the<br />
Galbally Report, and new expenditures will flow from the<br />
Government's overwhelming acceptance of the Galbally<br />
evaluations' recommendations.<br />
As you know, the value of the commitments can't be measured<br />
in terms of dollars spent. The real value is to be measured<br />
in terms of substantive reform. I believe that compared with<br />
our starting position, we have brought about a number of<br />
profound and significant changes. Perhaps most importantly<br />
today Australians from non-English speaking backgrounds<br />
are seen to acknowledge what they always knew that Australians<br />
can retain a particular affection. for their country of<br />
origin and still be Australian in the fullest and best<br />
sense of the word. I think one of the best things that<br />
I have heard said was when someone from an ethnic community<br />
not from yours, but from another large one was in Canberra<br />
speaking with me a while ago. He said for the first time,<br />
in; ithe last 18 months and he and his family-had been<br />
here for quite a long while since the War for the first<br />
time in the last 18 months, he felt it was no-longer<br />
necessary to look over his shoulder. If Government policy<br />
had contributed anything to helping achieve that, I think<br />
that is the best compliment that could be paid.<br />
We can'. t afford to take achievements for granted, or slacken<br />
our efforts in the future. We have all seen the publicity given<br />
to tat small but global minority that want to turn back the<br />
clock to older days when there was no tolerance. I would like<br />
to make it quite clear that this Government has no intention<br />
of allowing the voice of bigotry to prevail in Australia, ever,<br />
at any time. The achievements which have been made are important<br />
to Australia at large. They benefit and they enrich the lives<br />
not only of the newest members of the community, but of all<br />
Australians, and on behalf of the Government, I reiterate<br />
the commitment to a united, just and multicultural Australia.<br />
Some of you will remember that during the visit to Australia<br />
last March by President Karamanlis, I announced in recognition<br />
of that visit, we would introduce the awards programme. Those<br />
awards,. two of the first, were awarded tonight. I was delighted<br />
to be able to make the announcement of a specific award rather<br />
than the general principle, because that again is seeing something<br />
happening, not just announcing a policy in a vacuum, but seeing<br />
two of the young people from your community who will go to Greece<br />
as Australians, and come back. with a wider knowledge of Greece.<br />

That I believe is something that could not have happened<br />
maybe 5 years ago, certainly it.-couldn't have happened 16<br />
or 15 years ago. It is very pleasing to see policies come<br />
alive with the faces and people that are going to benefit<br />
from it. But 5, 10 or 15 years ago, I think if anyone<br />
asked if we would see the situation in which there would<br />
be Australian Greek President awards for young Australians<br />
to go and study for a while in Greece, people would probably<br />
have said it would never happen. There have been a number<br />
of awards Churchill Fellowships or the Queen Elizabeth<br />
Trust Scholarships for young Australians have a special<br />
relationship to the United Kingdom. There have been some<br />
awards that have special relationships with the United<br />
States. But I think that now that there are some specific<br />
awards which relate to Australia and Greece quite specifically<br />
indicates that Australia really has come of age, that<br />
Australia has matured, that~ it's truly the multicultural<br />
society and that those narrow, introverted days when this<br />
was an Anglo-Saxon community and not much else are<br />
really behind us for good. As a result, Australia is<br />
a very much better a-ation than it has ever been before.<br />
I would like to thank you very much for asking me to<br />
be here tonight, to helv participate in your 10th anniversary.<br />
I would like to thank you all very much for what you are doing<br />
to help build a more equal and tolerant Australia. I think<br />
the whole world-at the moment is going through a somewhat<br />
difficult* time, but I still believe Australia-is still the.<br />
best country-in). the world in which to bring up a family. Whatever<br />
the difficulties may be, I believe there are more opportunities<br />
here than in almost any other country in thew~ orld. I know<br />
that members of the Australian Greek Welfare Society, and the<br />
whole Greek community, have contributed enormously to the<br />
Australia that we all know and love.<br />
