SPEEQO by the<br />

on<br />
THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON ESPIONAGE<br />
delivered in the<br />
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES on<br />
TUESDAY, 25th October, 1955. </p>
<p>itOYAL COMMISSION ON ESPIONAGE<br />
When a Royal Commission sits for months to investigate<br />
matters of national security, it is not common to have the tabling<br />
of the report followed by the making of charges relating to the very<br />
matters enquired into. But on this occasion, Dr. Evatt has indulged<br />
himself in the luxury of once more be ' coming the advocate in'this House<br />
of causes of which he was the professional-advocate before the-Royal<br />
Commission; professionally but unsuccessfully. In-short, he is asking<br />
this Parliament, which has not heard the witnesses, to-sit-as-a Court<br />
of appeal from three judges who heard every word of the evidence, who<br />
read every word of all the doctv-nts, who-listened to all the cross<br />
examination and who, for some weeks, not two hours,. listened to<br />
Dr. Evatt himself. This is a state of affairs so astonishing-that,<br />
if it were not for the office held by Dr. Evatt and his leadership-in<br />
this Parliament of a great Party, I would invite the House-. and the<br />
people to treat the whole of his submissions-as being either frivolous<br />
or offensive. After all,-the whole purpose of appointing a Royal<br />
Commission ( and this one was appointed by the unanimous vote of this<br />
Parliament, and with terms of reference unanimously-agreed upon by<br />
this Parliament) is to transfer the business of investigation-from<br />
Parliament, which is not equipped for such matters, to a trained body<br />
of investigators whose-findings will carry weight with both Parliament<br />
and people. But Dr. Evatt is nothing if not persistent. Before he ever<br />
appeared professionally before the Royal Commission, he had-clearly<br />
made-up his mind to attack it, to lower its reputation in the public<br />
mind and, if possible, to destroy its findings in advance. These<br />
tactics are not unknown in the world, though they are not normal in<br />
democratic countries. -He went through the motions of-appearing before<br />
the Commission-as a lawyer. In reality, as the judges subsequently<br />
had to point out to him. he-seemed to be appearing-for himself, and to<br />
find it impossible to distinguish between his somewhat nominal-functions<br />
as Counsel for a couple of members of his-staff, and his real function<br />
as the political exponent of points of view which,. before the Royal<br />
Commission, made him the instant ally of-Lockwood and Hill and all-the<br />
other Communists involved in the enquiry. He has now thought fit, no<br />
doubt with the approval of those who-sit-behind him, to develop a<br />
series of charges, all of which he made directly or indirectly before<br />
the Royal Commission, and on all of which the Commission has. found<br />
against-him. I would exceed the boundaries of time and trench upon<br />
eternity if I were to endeavour to follow point by point the erratic<br />
course of his arguments. Belicving as I do that the patience of<br />
Honourable Members is already sufficiently strained, I will content<br />
myself by dealing with what I might loosely describe as the substa-nce </p>
<p>of his main charges.<br />
I will summarise them.<br />
Against the Judges he makes the charge that they were<br />
incompetent, that they-acted without proper evidence, that they<br />
culpably failed to discover a great conspiracy, : and that they have<br />
made a false report.<br />
Against the which I will refer to as the Security<br />
Service the Service set up by the late Mr. Chifley in 1949 after<br />
there had been serious leakages from the External Affairs Department<br />
between 1945 and 194p8-Dr. Evatt unleashes a volume of hatred<br />
which I have not seen surpassed. He concentrates his venom upon<br />
Brigadier Spry, the head of that Service but, through him, he-charges<br />
the Service with being corrupt, oppressive, conspiratorial and<br />
actuated by Party political motives. He even goes so far as to say<br />
that for people like Brigadier Spry, peace is a dangerous word; a<br />
strange allegation to be made against a man who has been decorated<br />
in the service of his country, and who was wounded in the service of<br />
his country on the Kokoda Trail.<br />
Against Mr. Victor Windeyer. who appeared to assist<br />
the Royal Commission, he makes tihe charge ( which would be damaging if<br />
it came from any other quart.&gt;) that he lent himself to a conspiracy<br />
with me and with others, designed tc inflict damage upon the Labour<br />
Party when an election was penxding, and that he aid this by-accepting<br />
instructions from me, and even the phraseology which I : am alleged to<br />
have submitted to him.<br />
Against myself as Prime Minister of the country, he makes<br />
a bewildering variety of charges. First: he says-that I ' saved up'<br />
the Petrov matter for election purposes until April, 1954 though, as<br />
he alleges, I knew-all about it as far back as 1953. His witness on<br />
this matter is a book published in the name of one, Bialoguski;<br />
Bialoguski being, on his own view, a man of no credit except when<br />
he speaks against me. Second, he says that I suppressed public<br />
knowledge of the payment of Å“ 5,000 to Petrov until after polling day.<br />
Third, he says that I encouraged or directed Mr. Windeyer to exaggerate<br />
and deceive in his opening address and, if I understand his -speech,<br />
that I drafted some of Mr. Windeyer's opening speech. Fourth, he says<br />
that I grossly betrayed my trust by giving wide publicity to<br />
allegations without first finding evidence in support of them and fifth<br />
he says, with a singular-and imaginative effort, that I conspired<br />
against Madame Oilier. ' spirited' her out of the country, and had her<br />
held incommunicado so that the in-estigation of episodes concerning her </p>
<p>could be unfairly conducted. There may be other charges against me,<br />
the chief of which is that I am Prime Minister, but I have not been<br />
able either to isolate or define them<br />
On the other side, Dr. Evatt has devoted no small amount<br />
of the two hours which the House granted him to defending certain<br />
people. Who are they?<br />
First he has defended Dr. Burton, whose published political<br />
views cannot sensibly be regarded-as-finding favour, except with the<br />
Communists. Why he thought it necessary to defend Dr. Burton in a<br />
discussion on the Royal Commission-report I do not understand, for<br />
the-fact is that these incompetent and gullible Royal Commissioners<br />
( as I understand him to say) made no finding adverse to Dr. Burton<br />
at all. Second, he has gone to some pains to defend Mr. Sharkey,<br />
the leading Australian Communist, against the well-founded charge-that<br />
he received from Moscow 25,000-dollars as some recompense for the<br />
costs incurred in his campaign, conducted in the closest collaboration<br />
with Dr. Evatt, against the Communist Party Dissolution Act.<br />
Third, he has come to the rescue of Mr. Clayton, found by<br />
the-Royal Commission', on the clearest possible evidence, to be the<br />
chief member of the Communist spy ring in Australia.<br />
Confronted by a report which, in the view of 95% of the<br />
Australian people, is a careful but magnificent tribute to Australian<br />
judicial procedures, he has-sought to destroy the-authenticity of the<br />
Moscow papers found by the Judges, after many months of investigation,<br />
to be completely authentic, by calling-as his somewhat-remote witness,<br />
Mr. Molotov who, we are told,-says that the papers are not genuine,<br />
-and that the whole matter represented an attempt to create bad blood<br />
between this country and the Soviet Union. In brief, Dr. Evatt would<br />
have us believe that months of investigation on oath, scores of<br />
thousands of questions and: answers, and the meticulous examination of<br />
documents should-all be brushed aside because the nation found guilty of<br />
espionage-says ' We are not guilty'.<br />
What I have already said-will, without any verbal decorations,<br />
satisfy all sane and sensible people that Dr. Evatt, suffering from<br />
persecution delusions, is-introducing us into a world of-sheer fantasy.<br />
But it is necessary I think, if only for the historical record, that<br />
I should say more about matters which could otherwise quite adequately<br />
be dismissed by the hearty laughter of a nation which possesses both<br />
good sense and humour. I therefore propose to remind the House and </p>
<p>the pecple of some of the facts which: relate to those who-stand<br />
indicted by Dr: Evatt. This I think necessary because: a very<br />
natural query in the minds of any of us when people are charged with<br />
se:-ous offences is ' What kind of people are these?' I start with<br />
the Judges themselves.<br />
Mr. Justice Owen, who derives from one of the most: celebrated<br />
judicial families in New South Wales, was, as a private soldier, a<br />
member of the A. I. F. from 1915 to 1919. He subsequently-went-to the<br />
Bar. He was appointed a Supreme Court Judge in 1937. His capacity<br />
and integrity are household words with every lawyer in New South Wales<br />
except, apparently, Dr. Evatt, The odd thing is that he was profoundly<br />
trusted both by Mr, Curtin and Chifley. It was on their appointment<br />
that he was Chairman of che Central Wool Committee during the War<br />
from 1942 to 1945. In 1945 Mr. Chifley sent him to London on a most<br />
important mission regarding surplus wool disposals. To challenge him<br />
as Dr. Evatt has, in his desperation, challenged him in this case, is<br />
to challenge a man who represents in his own person the highest<br />
qualities of mind and character, and the finest judicial traditions in<br />
this country. But, so that a couple of Communist agents can be brought<br />
off, and Mr. Molotov may be justified, Dr. Evatt is prepared to impeach<br />
Mr. Justice Owen's competence, judicial perception : and objective<br />
honesty. The second Judge wvi: Mr, Justice Philp, : a member of the Supreme<br />
Court Bench of Queensland since 1939. Himself a member of the'First<br />
and with a grievous family loss in this last war, . this learned<br />
Judge has waited all. these years to be attacked-in the same-way,-and<br />
in the same contemptible interests.. His character and work-need no<br />
eulogy of mine, for his professional and personal standing are alike<br />
beyond criticism. The third Judge,-Mr. Justice Liger. twood, also a member of<br />
the A. I. F. in the first world war, has been a Justice of the Supreme<br />
Court of South Australia-since 1945. I had thought that this-lofty<br />
and splendid man might have escaped the torrent of abuse. How Dr. Evatt<br />
attacks either his competence or his-judicial attributes, I -do not-know;<br />
for it was Dr. Evatt himself who appointed him as a single Royal<br />
Commissioner to investigate charges made against, among others, Mr. Ward.<br />
His findings exonerated Mr. Ward, At that time I heard no: complaint<br />
by Dr. Evatt against Mr. Justice Ligertwood. But, today, when he-isa<br />
party to a unanimous report on the Petrov matters, he is exposed to<br />
condemnation which is not based upon reason, but upon a sheer passion<br />
of hatred against people who have made findings against the-Communists.<br />
And then there is Mr. Windeyer Mr, Victor Windeyer, Q. C.<br />
who appeared to assist the Royal Commission and who-was, quite </p>
<p>properly, so-convinced that he must be free of-any influence that,<br />
from first to last with the exceptions that I will refer to, said.<br />
he did not wish to be ' instructed' by the Commonwealth Law Department<br />
as Counsel are normally instructed by solicitors. Who is<br />
Mr. Windeyer? He is a lawyer, a former distinguished-lecturer in<br />
law, and-a great soldier. A Major General, a military the<br />
holder of a D. S. O. and Bar, and three times mentioned in despatches;<br />
a veteran of Tobruk, of Alamein, of the capture of Finachhafen; for<br />
some years from 1950 the Citizen Forces member of the Military Board.<br />
Any New South Wales lawyer must know that the name of Windeyer, like<br />
the name of Owen, represents all that-is-best in New South Wales-legal<br />
tradition. So far I have mentioned the four lawyers who have been<br />
accused, but I must-say somethingabout-the head of the Security Service,<br />
-Brigadier Charles Spry, -against whom-a most venomous attack has-been<br />
made, an attack, I do-not doubt, calculated-in the interes. ts of the<br />
Communists to weaken the authority of the Security Service, to discourage<br />
good men from going-into it to make its officers fearful of<br />
political victimisation, and, therefore, to give-aid and-comfort to our<br />
-enemies. Charles Spry is a graduate of Duntroon and of the Staff<br />
College in the United Kingdom. He saw-active service in India in 1936.<br />
He-was-with-the Seventh-Australian Division in the Owen Stanleys and on<br />
the Kokoda Trail. He was wounded there. He was decorated withthe<br />
He was Director of Military Intelligence in Australia from 1946<br />
to 1950,-a period, for the bulk of which Dr. Evatt, as Attorney General<br />
and-Minister for External Affairs, had the-benefit of his notable<br />
: services. -And finally, of course, there-is myself. I-am not here-to<br />
defend myself against fantastic charges, though I will say-a few<br />
temperate words about them before I-finish. But I must permit myself<br />
to say that I have, for over-a quarter of-a : century, served the Australian<br />
people in-the very heat of political-controversy, that-for almost-fifteen<br />
years those who-are-closest to me have unanimously maintained me as their<br />
-leader, -and that I am, therefore, not-entirely. unknown, either in<br />
-character or-act,-to the-Australian people. Yet, according-to -Dr. Evatt,<br />
last year or the year before, made myself a party to a: swindle and was<br />
-able to secure the-collaboration of those distinguished men-whom I have<br />
-named-in order to-make that swindle-effective.<br />
Having-said so: much about the persons in the drama, I will now<br />
turn first to a consideration of-what-the Royal -Commission-has-found,<br />
and-second to a-consideration of the Evatt/ Molotov charges. </p>
<p>First, the. Royal Commission found -that -the -Petrovs -left<br />
Sthe Russian service -and -sought asylum-in-this country of -their own<br />
choice,. and without pressure. -Second, it found that : the-Petrovs<br />
, are witnesses of truth, with accuracy of a high order. . It-arrived<br />
; at-this conclusion after-Petrov had been-in the witness -box on thirty-<br />
-seven days-for-approximately seventyfour -hours-; in all somewhat longer,<br />
it will be agreed, than-Mr. Molotov) and Mrls. Petrov on-twentyone-days<br />
. for approximately thirty hourssin-all. Third, ? it has found-that-during<br />
-the period-which has-elapsedsince -their-defection -they have been<br />
questioned on behalf of-theicounterespionageiservice of other countries<br />
with results-which have-been of-the-greatest-value to-those: countries.<br />
-This finding-is confirmed -by -subsequent experiences to-which IawilI<br />
refer later on. Fourth, the Royal-Commission-found that the Petrov<br />
papers were genuine. Dr.-Evatt has adduced here, . ashe-was-indeed<br />
ibusy-in adducing-for : a long-time before-the Royal Commission-in-his other<br />
capacity, arguments to show-that-the papers-were forgeries. I-was-not-required-<br />
to listen to his-arguments before the-Judges, but-I heard-his -arguments<br />
-here. All. I-need say is -that-his attempt,-to overthrow-months of<br />
-investigation both -internal and-external -by-the Judges -has been pathetic<br />
iahd ineffective. Fifth, -the Commission-has-found that-' for-many years,<br />
the Government of-the UiS. SSR. had-been using-its Embassy-at-Canberra-as<br />
a: cloak-under which-to-control -and operate -espionage-organisations -in<br />
-Australia.' -Sixth, -it found-that the only -Australians-who-knowingly--assisted-<br />
this-espionage-were Communists. -Seventh, -itfound that-without Communism,<br />
-Soviet espionage-could have no hope of-success in-Australia-and-that -the<br />
. existence-here of Communists-was thefundamental-cause of the-formation of<br />
our Security Service-by Mr. Chifley, and necessitates-its retention as bei,.<br />
-essential -to-the -security-and-defence of-Australia.<br />
-The -Conwiission -made -some particular -findings-abouti individuals,<br />
though -it-found-that -the -evidence ; stopped-short of-justifying-a prosecution<br />
under the-existing-Australian-law.<br />
-It-also-made-some observations-about the-case of one, -Madame<br />
Ollier, -as-supporting-its -finding-that the Soviet Embassy-was-engaged-in<br />
espionage. It-is only-in-this -context that-the -case -of Madame-Ollier<br />
. achieves any -importance -but,-having -regard -to the -fact that -Dr. Evat's<br />
delusions of-grandeur have -led,-him-to take the -unprecedented -step of offering<br />
his views by correspondence to-the French-Court-which-tried Madame<br />
Ollier, I will-say a few words about that matter before -Iconclude.<br />
Dr. Evatt's* ' case -against the Commissioners and.-their Report<br />
is completely disposed of by the Report itself. His ' case': against-me<br />
is also, -in one respect, -the case against-Mr. -Windeyer. Dr. Evatt said<br />
that the opening by Mr. Wingdyer was melodramatic ' Never was -there<br />
-such-a sensational opening'. lam a little handicapped on this point<br />
because-I was, -at the time, in Perth and certainly found-nothing exciting </p>
<p>in the press reports. But Dr. Evatt has, in his speech, not only<br />
criticized Mr. Windeyer's language -but has pointedly suggested that I<br />
was its draftsman Indeed, he said that I ' must take personal responsibility<br />
for all the exaggeration and deception-.,<br />
The facts are that Mr. Windeyer made an opening characterized<br />
by great moderation and restraint. He made no reference that might<br />
damage one political-side or the other except that he mentioned that<br />
there were names of Members of Parliament on both sides included in the<br />
documents. I am indeed reluctant to invoke the observations of Counsel<br />
on a matter of this kind but I think that I should tell the House since<br />
these charges have been-made the relevant, substance of-a recent<br />
communication from Mr. Windey'r in London. I had written to him thanking<br />
him for his work on the Council of the Australian National Universityand<br />
had expressed my regret that he had felt unable to continue: it. He replied<br />
appropriately. He then, quite voluntarily, went on to give me his recollection<br />
of the one meeting I had with him, which was before the enquiry<br />
began, on the Saturday or Sunday in Sydney, the others present being the<br />
Solicitor General, Professor Bailey, Mr. A. S. Brown, the Secretary to the<br />
Prime Minister's Department and Mr. Spry. He confirms that I gave no<br />
directions except on four points, but said that the conduct of the enquiry<br />
should be left to the Commissioners and Counsel. Four matters were-then<br />
discussed. They were:-<br />
Whether there should be a press interview of the Petrovs.<br />
I decided that there should not.<br />
The references in the documents to Madame Ollier, under<br />
the name ' Olga'. I said that the French Ambassador<br />
should be informed through the proper channels that her<br />
name was mentioned.<br />
The payment to Petrov of Å“ 5,000. I did not know of this<br />
before. Mr. Windeyer said that to him the amount seemed<br />
small in the circumstances. I said that it was: a-matter<br />
to be proved and proved publicly, and that this-should: be<br />
done later in its proper setting when Pe, trov was examined.<br />
The fourth matter was about an interpreter. Having heard<br />
of Mr. Birse's qualifications and his complete independence,<br />
I directed that a signal be sent to Winston Churchill<br />
asking whether Birse could come. I further said that I<br />
felt that, in the long run, it was probably advisable to<br />
take evidence in public rather than in private: as had been<br />
done in Canada, but that no -individual's name should: be<br />
mentioned by Mr. Windeyer in opening the matter. I<br />
expressed the view with which Counsel agreed that it would<br />
not be proper to mention any names until after the Election. </p>
<p>This common recollection of Mr. Windeyer and myself is<br />
of course, a complete refutation of-a suggestion of political malpractice.<br />
To have opened the Å“ 5,000 payment except in-direct<br />
association with the surrounding circumstances would have been most<br />
misleading, and would have invited gross misrepresentation. But, in<br />
any event, the political allegation is manifestly absurd. Dr. Evatt's<br />
theory is that the whole of this matter from beginning to end was<br />
cooked up to defeat him at an election. Apropos of this I well<br />
remember the cynical but wise remark of a former Supreme Court Judge<br />
in my own State who-said-to a young Advocate, ' You may think that it<br />
is permissible to regard your opponent as a: crook; -but-it-is an<br />
elementary blunder to treat him as a fool'. Now Dr. Evatt says,<br />
putting it in homely terms, that in these matters I was a: crook! -But<br />
why-should he also charge me with being: a fool? After all, every<br />
Honorable Member will realize that when I made my announcement to the<br />
House about Petrov and a Royal Commission I would have been in the<br />
ordinary course well entitled to quote a specimen of the documents Petrov<br />
had brought with him. If I-had done this the names of O'Sullivan,<br />
-Grundeman, and others, directly or indirectly associated with Dr. Evatt<br />
would have become public property. The political reaction would have<br />
: been tremendous.--But I did not do so. On the contrary, I gave a<br />
direction in an-entirely contrary sense. I went further thanthis.<br />
Early-in the campaign it appeared that some reference to the Petrov<br />
matter. had been made on the public platform. I at once communicated with.<br />
: every Government candidate in Australia and said that as this matter would<br />
receive judicial investigation I wanted-it kept out of: a political campaign.<br />
I have every reason to believe that this request of mine was scrupulously<br />
observed. Why it should be thought that, having-cunningly-schemed to<br />
produce Petrov on the eve of an election, I should then go to all sorts of<br />
trouble to defeat my own scheming, I am at a loss-to understand. At an<br />
equal loss will be all Australians whose minds are not unbalanced by<br />
delusions or obsessions.<br />
It will be remembered that my announcement of a Royal Commission<br />
was unanimously approved by the House. It will also be remembered that<br />
the Bill which I introduced on August 11th, 1954, to put beyond doubt the<br />
authority and powers of the Royal Commission: and the protection of: its<br />
proceedings, a: Bill which included the: names of the Royal Commissioners<br />
and: the Terms of Reference, was-unanimously: approved by-the House. -In<br />
other words, the House, -including Dr. Evatt, specifically authorized the<br />
three Judges to conduct their investigation . into-the mattersassigned-to<br />
them. But Dr. Evatt, for reasons of his own, was gravely disturbed-by<br />
what might appear. He, therefore, on the pretext of appearing for two<br />
people, went as Counsel before the Royal Commission. It was clear, from<br />
the outset to everybody, including the Communists,. that his object was to<br />
destroy the authority and reputation of a Royal Commission whose creation </p>
<p>he had voted for. Before he had ever studied the documents in court<br />
he set out to-suggest conspiracy, fraud-and forgery. He was listened to<br />
with exemplary patience. He created an atmosphere entirely delightful<br />
to the Australian Communist Party. The Royal Commission therefore very<br />
properly, though expensively, devoted a great deal of time to listening<br />
t allegations, most, or all, of which he repeated last week. All I need<br />
do is to remind the House that when it made an interim report on these<br />
matters the Royal Commission said:<br />
' Appendix No. 2.<br />
' 36. Apparently, in these circumstances, Dr. Evatt conceived the theory<br />
that he and the political party which he-leads had been made the victims<br />
of a political conspiracy and he nroceeded to cross-examine the witnesses<br />
before us with that in mind. After the withdrawal of his permission to<br />
appear, his juniors continued in the same line.<br />
' 37. Charge followed charge with bewildering variations. Suggestionswere<br />
made of blackmail, forgery, uttering, fabrication, fraud and<br />
conspiracy and upon the repeated assurances of Dr. Evatt that his<br />
examination of witnesses was directed to these matters and would prove<br />
them.-we felt constrained to permit him great latitude in his questioning.<br />
This we-felt bound to do, since an exhaustive-inquiry by us into the<br />
authenticity of Exhibit-J was part of our duty.<br />
' 38. Lockwood was very willing to follow and exploit the line taken on<br />
behalf of Grundeman and Dalziel.<br />
' 39. As day followed day -and . all that we heard was-constant reiteration<br />
of vague charges of-infamy, we demanded of counse'l, on 1st September, that<br />
they formulate with-some exactitude their-allegations. Dr. Evatt then<br />
charged that Exhibit J had been fabricated by the Petrovs as part of a<br />
political conspiracy with the enforced aid of O'Sullivan who, he alleged,<br />
has-been blackmailed into collaborating in the fabrication of the document<br />
and into inserting therein-as sources the names of himself, Grundeman and<br />
Dalziel. The political conspiracy was alleged to be one to injure Dr. Evatt<br />
and the Australian-Labour Party by procuring the false insertion in Exhibit<br />
J of the names of three of his secretaries as sources witt theintention<br />
that the Petrovs should-so nicely time their actions that Exhibit J could<br />
be produced and published on the eve of the Federal elections in 1954.<br />
He further-charged that al least one-senior officer of the Australian<br />
Security Intelligence Organization, Richards, had-been guilty of-serious<br />
derelictions of duty in-that, without proper care and inquiry, he had<br />
accepted from Petrov fabricated documents, had paid him large sums of public<br />
money for them, and had ' uttered' these documents, presumably to the Prime<br />
Minister of Australia. </p>
<p>' 42. Although, in the result, all the charges turned out to be<br />
fantastic and wholly unsupported by any credible evidence, they were<br />
grave and necessitated patient-judicial inquiry by us.<br />
57We heard the -evidence of: all persons who, so far as we could-see,<br />
would be able to throw any light on these allegations, and there were<br />
placed-in our custody and examined by us the contemporaneous-Security<br />
reports and records, including wire recordings of certain -significant<br />
conversations relating to Petrov's decision to: leave the Soviet -service<br />
and to the receipt of the documents handed: by him to Richards. The<br />
evidence of these persons, supported as it is by the contemporaneous<br />
records, entirely disposes of all suggestions of improper or negligent<br />
conduct on the part of Richards or any other officer of the Security<br />
Service. Indeed, we think that these officers. acted with high intelligence<br />
and complete propriety in difficult and delicate : circumstances'<br />
But I must concede that Dr. Evatt is not easily cast down.<br />
He has indeed performed . the astonishing feat, backed by Mr. Molotov's letter,<br />
of-asking that an International Commission be set up to investigate the work of<br />
thesethree Australian Judges though -he has himself -said, as I understand him,<br />
that -the results of their enquiry were -insignificant : and fruitless. . I -will<br />
leave it to the Australian peop. le to decide whether -they have soilittle<br />
faith-in their own judiciary as to wish to have its work reviewed by an<br />
international body including, anong others, -the -very people against-whom-the<br />
findings of the Royal Commission -arc directed. At-the-risk of', repeating<br />
myself I point out to the House that Dr. Evatt's passions, , which -he -has<br />
with-careful preparation exposed to the House, are against -the -Prime Minister<br />
of his own country and for the Foreign Secretary of-the Soviet Union;<br />
against -three Australian Judges of impeccable reputation: and-for-some<br />
nebulous -and hypothetical international commission; against-the -Australian<br />
Security Service headed by a distinguished: and patriotic Australianand-for<br />
people -like Sharkey and Clayton. The truth -is, of course, that-the one<br />
passion . animating his-mind here, as before the -Royal-Commission, is-for<br />
-himself. -So far as it pretends to be -a passion -for. justice it -is demonstrably<br />
false. His defence of Clayton is indeed noteworthy, One of: the -things<br />
that proved Clayton's activities was Frances Berrie's evidence. She was<br />
* a Communist employed in Dr. Evatt's own office, and deposed that-she -had<br />
given to Clayton documents taken from Dr. Evatt's office! </p>
<p>He says that I knew all about Petrov in 1953.<br />
All I-need-to say on-this -matter -is that I had-never heard of<br />
-Petr. ov -before his defection -in April of 1954. -Dr. Evatt's case-td<br />
the-contrary-is, on-analysis, quite laughable. -When one-looks-at-it<br />
one-sees -that -it-is entirely-based upon-what-he has-read -in a-book<br />
published -under -the -name of -Bialoguski. It-is perhaps worthy of -note<br />
Sthat he spoke -with contempt -about -this man-and-accepted his -evidence -in<br />
i -book only -when he -thought it told. against me. It appears -that<br />
Bialoguski did-call at my office at Canberra, as-I have -asertaind-from<br />
my then Private -Secretary, on October 7th, 19$ 3.<br />
My -then Private Secretary, Mr. Yeend, who though relatively<br />
junior has a-high reputation-in the Civil Service, -saw-him-and-disposed of<br />
his problem, as he -thought, to Bialogusl's -satisfaction. -There was -no<br />
need for Yeend to mention -the matter to me and he did not do-so.<br />
After Bialoguski published -an account -of -the -episodhein thenewspaper<br />
in June of-this year Mr. Yeend gavd. me his recollection of -it.<br />
He states that he did not receive a ' sealed envelope' fom<br />
-Bialoguski, that -Bialoguski's chief complaint -was -that -he -was -asking -for<br />
higher pay-and-that Yeend referred this matter to Mr. Spry and-thatat<br />
no -stage -was -the name of Petrov mentioned nor -was mention made of the<br />
possibility of -any diplomat's defection. Mr. Yeend has -said -to -me . that<br />
it could be -inferred from Bialoguski's book that in October 1953 I knew<br />
of the work he was doing and knew of his visit to-Canberra. Mr. Yeend<br />
confirms that he certainly made no mention to me of either Bialoguski's<br />
complaint or even his existe It was not until after Bialoguski's<br />
-appearance before the Royal Commiission that Mr. Yeend placed him as -the<br />
man he had-interviewed. A few days later he mentioned to me,-for the<br />
first time, that the man ( Bialoguski) -who had just given evidence-had<br />
called and-seen him-in 1953.<br />
-But Dr. Evatt'-s charges do not rest there. Driven on by his<br />
-strange obsessionThe says that -a plan -for Petrov's reception was-communicated<br />
to the Heads of Commonwealth Departments on the 17th February,<br />
19-54. -The fact is that no plan was communicated to any department.,<br />
Early in February, 1954 I now learn that the Solicitor-General and the Secietar<br />
of -the Department of -External Affairs as -individua. Ls were -warned of-the<br />
possibility of a defection. This warning was given orally-by. the Director-<br />
General andwas -given to no other people except the-Attorney-General and-the<br />
-Minister -for External Affairs. I was -myself told-that-there was-the<br />
possibility of a-defection-but the identity of the -subject was not disclosed,<br />
-not did I ask for it. The head of my Department : was not'informed at any<br />
, stage prior-to the actual defection. I -repeat -that I had not -heard of Petrov<br />
before his actual defection in April of 1954. </p>
<p>-12-<br />
Dr. Evatt, posing as the universal defender of: liberty,<br />
has made the case of Madame Oilier his own. Not only has he broken<br />
all records as an Opposition Leader by communicating with the Foreign<br />
Secretary of another country in order to get a distant and uncrossexamined<br />
denial of charges found to be true by an Australian tribunal<br />
but he has, so he boasts, performed the remarkable act of-writing to a<br />
French Court presumably to tell. that court how it ought to conduct its<br />
business. Under these circumstances it is desirable that the Oilier<br />
matter which incidentally, was publicly unknown until September 4th,<br />
1954, should be seen quite clearly.<br />
The Royal Commission was not concerned to find Madame Oilier<br />
guilty or innocent of an offence against French law. It has stated<br />
its attitude very plainly in Chapter 11 of its Report. What it said was<br />
that the Soviet M. V. D. had a basic design to obtain through Madame Oilier,<br />
who was an officer of the French Embassy in Canberra, the cypher and<br />
cyphering techniques used by the French Embassy and-such other secret<br />
information as might be useful to the Soviet. The Commissioner's -said:<br />
( paragraph 610) ' It-appears also from-the evidence that-some time prior<br />
to Pakhomov's departure from Australia in June, 1952, he had, on-behalf of<br />
-the given Madame Oilier a watch-costing Mrs. Petrov and<br />
Pakhomov selected the watch at a shop in Canberra; Pakhomov took the<br />
watch and later reported that he had given it to Madame Oilier. Mrs.<br />
Petrov paid the Å“ 35 purchase price from the M. V. D. funds and accounted for<br />
it to the Moscow Centre, which did not question the payment. Neither of<br />
the Petrovs could fix-the date of the purchase of the watch, nor could<br />
they swear whether or when Pakhomov had in-fact handed it to Madame Olier.'<br />
It also quoted the Moscow letter of January 2nd, 1952, relating to Madame<br />
Oilier confirming the object of the enquiries and. suggesting that meetings<br />
should occur-at places-located-at a distance of 40 to 10 miles from<br />
Canberra. The Commission went on to find that Madame Oilier had met<br />
Petrov at Cooma and also that to encourage her she had-been presented with<br />
an expensive watch. The Commission went on to find that the results of<br />
what it called ' these laborious and persistent efforts of the M. V. D. were<br />
almost negligible.' It concluded by saying that: " The evidence clearly<br />
establishes that in respect of Madame Oilier espionage was conducted by<br />
two members of the Soviet Embassy in Australia, namely Sadovnikov and<br />
Petrov, and a Tass representative, namely Pakhomov, all acting as espionage<br />
-agents under the specific direction of the Soviet Government.'<br />
These findings excite the passionate indignation of Dr. Evatt.<br />
Yet, in fact in the recent proceedings in France I understand Madame Oilier<br />
admitted the Cooma contact and the receipt of the watch. No doubt the<br />
-French Court felt that her ' indiscretions':, shall I -say, had been adequately<br />
punished by the fact-that she had been imprisoned for-some. two months before<br />
the trial. But all this is of little significance in the Petrov Enquiry.<br />
What is the charge? It will not be thought very convincing by most people<br />
that Dr. Evatt should be quite passionate about the Oilier affair being<br />
investigated in Australia in the absence of evidence by Madame Ollier,<br />
when he is so obviously pleased that Madame Oilier-should </p>
<p>-be set-free in France -in the absence of evidence of the Petrovs. The<br />
* ttuth is that the-rear charge -is, I -fear, against me. To-use his own<br />
picturesque -language, -I amasupposed to have ' spirited' Madame Oilier out<br />
of-Australia and arranged to have her held -incommunicado in another<br />
country. The Royal Commission has stated the facts quite accurately. I<br />
' do not share Dr, Evatt's-devotion to -instructing other-countries as to<br />
h-ow they -should-conduct -their business. As I have-. already indicated,<br />
all -I-did was to say that-the French -Ambassador -in Canberra should : be told<br />
* im-uadvance-that Madame Oilier's name was going to-be mentioned -and that hewould<br />
no doubt-seek-instructions-from his own people. What happened then?<br />
I merely read the Royal -Commission': s Report:<br />
' 599. In -view of these circumstances, ahortly after-the -defection and<br />
before our first-sittings the Department of External -Affairs con identially<br />
notified-the -French Ambassador of -the reference to Madame Oilier contained<br />
-in the Moscow Letters,: and -she was sent -by her -Ambassador to Noumea, where<br />
ishe-would be-cut off not only from-access to-secret communications -and<br />
* ciphers -but also-from any dangerous associations-she-might possibly-have<br />
formed. ' 600. The-evidence concerning Madame Olier was heard by us-in private<br />
: session -in Melbourne on 20th July 1954. -Because of diplomatic-immunity<br />
and-later her-absence from Australia, she could-not be: subpoenaed to<br />
attend-and she did not attend the session. Opportunity was-afforded-the<br />
French Ambassador to be repr.: srnsd at the -session, but this was not<br />
availed of. We agreed to supply him with the transcript of the proceedings<br />
and to withhold its immediate publication in order to give the Freihh<br />
Government -an opportunity ofstusying it and of making such arrangements<br />
as it considered appropriate. Later, the French Ambassador having-agreed<br />
-to the date of publication, the transcript was publighed on 4th September<br />
1954. ' 601. We assume-that the-transfer of Madame Ollier-to Noumea and-the<br />
-abstention of-the -French Government -from-availing-itself of-the opportunity<br />
-afforded it to be represented -at our Inquiry were partly because of-itas<br />
desire that-any proceedings-in connection with hershould-take place on<br />
-French-soil and-in accordance with French legal procedure, and partly-because<br />
it would not be -in -accordance with diplomatic practice -for -her<br />
Government -to waive-its immunity and-rights under international -law and<br />
permit her to give evidence. We were, of-course, willing to-hear-her-if<br />
-her Government had waived its immunity, and this -we made known.<br />
-' 602. In-fact the French Government, after-receiving the transcript<br />
made -its own interrogation of her -in Noumea, and -in consequence Madame<br />
Ol1ier was -arrested there and-sent to -France -for further interrogation.' </p>
<p>-14-<br />
my 27 years in Parliament I do not remember any debate so<br />
astonishing as this. I-would have thought thattwhen a democratically<br />
elected Parliament unanimously approved of a Royal Commission-and by Statute<br />
unanimously approved of the names of the Judicial Commissioners, . a dis-<br />
-cussion upon their Report would have concerned itself with whether dangers<br />
to the country had been revealed and whether any, and if-so what, . steps<br />
ought to be taken to prevent repetition of those dangers. I would certainly<br />
not have supposed that a Member of Parliament professionally-employed on<br />
behalf of some of the Parties would have taken the occasion to challenge the<br />
character and capacity of the Royal Commission and. to seek to invalidate its<br />
findings by the very-simple expedient of selecting one. or two facts out of<br />
thousands, and one or, two questions and answers out of-scores of thousands<br />
in order to discredit the Judges and the Counsel who appeared to assist them.<br />
Nor would I have thought it likely that Parliament should be invited to reopen<br />
and pursue charges already described by the Judges as fantastic and<br />
unfounded. But this is not all! It has been clearly found that there were<br />
leakages from the Department of External Affairs from 1945 to 1948 when<br />
Dr. Evatt himself was the Minist-:. So serious were these regarded that-the<br />
Security Organization was set up by Mr. Chifley himself. That-Organization<br />
-was placed under the direction of a South Australian Supreme Court Judge,<br />
Mr. Justice Reed, who was on loan from the State of South Australia. When his<br />
term ran out my own Government appointed Mr. Spry. The effective maintenance<br />
of the-Service was obviously a desirable thing. A. S. I. O. is not a police<br />
force ( nor, incidentally, has it ever proposed to take over any Commonwealth<br />
Police Force). It is an Intelligence Organization. It must be obvious<br />
. to a child that in the Intelligence field there should be the closest<br />
-collaboration between the civil and-military arms. Is there something wicked<br />
about having an Intelligence Organization a Counter Espionage Organization?<br />
Are we to leave-it to the spies to do their work unchecked? Do spies of<br />
other countries operate for our good, or our security, or our future? The<br />
business of counter espionage is a business which requires great character,<br />
great courage, great skill and considerable freedom of action. Honest<br />
. Australians will be more easy in their minds to learnfrom this Royal Commission<br />
-Report that our security organization has been so effective that in the last<br />
six years practically no information has been-secured. by Communist agencies.<br />
-All this is so elementary and so clear that one is at a loss to understand why<br />
the Leader of the Opposition, the alternative Prime Minister of this country,<br />
should be at such patient pains to destroy the reputation and the efficacy<br />
of the Security Service. On behalf of that Service I reject and condemn the<br />
allegations that have been made that it has acted in a political way. The<br />
men who constitute it are patriotic, skilful, and industrious men.' It willbe<br />
a poor thing indeed if men in such a Service are given to understand that<br />
if their investigations are not agreeable to the Leader of the Opposition<br />
they may expect to encounter dismissal and-infamy if a change of Government<br />
occurs. </p>
<p>At the risk of-straining the patience of-the-House, I add<br />
this. In the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States, the<br />
reputation of A. S. I. O. is very high. Its handling of the Petrov case<br />
has been the subject of commendation and congratulation. This is<br />
important, for, without mutual trust and confidence between the Security<br />
Services of those countries and ourselves, information. will be withheld<br />
from Australia, as indeed it frequently was-before 1949 and the establishment<br />
of the Security Service.<br />
Under all these circumstances, it is a wicked thing that. such<br />
a consistent campaign should have been conducted by the Communist Party<br />
outside this House, and by Dr. Evatt inside it, for the express purpose<br />
of weakening confidence in and therefore rendering it less<br />
effective for its purposes of counter espionage. I do not hesitate to<br />
say that this is one of Dr. Evatt's principal purposes-in this matter.<br />
He has not concealed his violent hatred of that Service and of the people<br />
who make it up. It wi4l be, I hope and repeat, abundantly clear that,<br />
should he become the head of the Government of this country, the present<br />
senior personnel of the Service will be dismissed and the possibility of<br />
getting adequate recruits utterly, and perhaps permanently, destroyed.<br />
This is a dreadful manoeuvre. All I can do to counter it is to state, on<br />
behalf of the Government and, I believe, on behalf of the overwhelming<br />
majority of Members, that we regard these Security Officers as men of<br />
capacity and integrity and patriotism. So far as my Government is concerned,<br />
we will do everything in our power to protect them'<br />
It is, of course, the very fury of Dr. Evatt's obsessions against<br />
the Security Service which has led him to turn away from his consistent<br />
battle on behalf of Australian communists to make his now celebrated appeal<br />
to Mr. Molotov. This appeal would be childish if it were made by an<br />
obscure nonentity. It becomes atrocious when it is made by a leader who<br />
is an aspirant for the Prime Ministership. Could anybody have believed<br />
that a Royal Commission, sitting for many months with patient care and<br />
making findings as a result of its investigations, should have those findings<br />
curtly rejected by the very Government whose activities those findings have<br />
exposed, a government which in fact closed-its Embassy here and destroyed<br />
its records. A new procedure has been invented by Dr. Evatt himself on<br />
behalf of communist-espionage. It is as if,-after the person-in the dock<br />
has been convicted by the jury, Dr. Evatt springs-up and-says to the<br />
convicted person, ' Were you guilty?' and the person replies ' I was not.'<br />
Dr. Evatt then turns, denounces the Judge, denounces the jury, denounces<br />
counsel, and-denounces all the witnesses-who-have given evidence-for the<br />
Crown. Such conduct may be novel and arresting in an ordinary court.<br />
It would be regarded-as some evidence of eccentricity, and would certainly<br />
lead to a process of contempt of court. Internationally, it represents<br />
a studied insult to Australian Judges, Australian judicial procedures, and<br />
an Australian report. </p>
<p>-16-<br />
Altogether too little attention has been paid to the valuable<br />
results which have proceeded from the defection and disclosures of the<br />
Petrovs. To deal with local matters first, it must be obvious to<br />
Honourable Members that, but for the disclosures and the investigations<br />
of the Royal Commission, it is reasonable to assume that Mr. O'Sullivan<br />
and Mr. Grundeman would still be with Dr. Evatt in this building, and,<br />
but for the last election result, attached to the Prime Minister, and that<br />
the espionage of the Soviet Embassy would-still be both operating and<br />
unknown. But even more important -is that the information provided by the<br />
Petrovs, only some of which came within the scope of the Royal Commission,<br />
has proved invaluable to other democratic countries. Petrov himself, as we<br />
know from the United Kingdom authorities is the most senior defector from<br />
any of the Soviet intelligence services since 1937. As such he has been<br />
able to supply more information than any previous single defector regarding<br />
the espionage activities of the M. V. D. Both of the Petrovs have, in fact<br />
since April 1954,. been continuously supplying information, some affecting<br />
the security of Australia and, possibly more importantly, some providing<br />
general intelligence of great assistance to the Western domocracies, which<br />
intelligence has not, and of course cannot, be made public.<br />
I want to inform the House that communications with the United Kingdom<br />
Security authorities show specifically that the information obtained from<br />
Petrov is in many cases confirmed by information held abroad and, in other<br />
cases, has enabled a material addition to their information. In point of fact<br />
scores and-scores of-Soviet Intelligence operatives working in democratic<br />
countries have been identified as a result of the disclosures of the Petrovs.<br />
In addition to all this, they have, of course, supplied-invaluable information<br />
regarding Soviet Intelligence methods of operation and techniques of<br />
espionage. I will not. need to remind the House-that the recent events regarding<br />
Maclean and Burgess, and the case in Sweden, were striking confirmation of<br />
the accuracy of what the Petrovs have had-to say.<br />
I think I should add that, under all these circumstances, Honourable<br />
Members will agree that it would indeed-be astonishing-if no money had been<br />
paid to the Petrovs for-their protection and their maintenance. The-whole<br />
idea is farcical. The Royal Commission-fully investigated this matter and<br />
found it completely proper.<br />
And so I come to the end of what I have to say. I have referred to<br />
those who are charged by Dr. Evatt. But honourable public opinion will<br />
acquit them, beyond question. But the same honorable public opinion will<br />
not acquit the man who made these reckless and villanous charges; nor will<br />
it acquit those who have, in this House, authorized those charges and by </p>
<p>17-<br />
their presence and support countenanced them. If there: is a charge to<br />
be made it is this. Dr. Evatt has, from first-to last-in this matter,<br />
for his own purposes, in-his own interests and with the enthusiastic<br />
support of every Communist in-Australia, sought to discredit the judiciary,<br />
to subvert the authority of the Security Organization of Australia, to cry<br />
down decent and patriotic Australians and build up the Fifth Column of our<br />
enemies. I am therefore, compelled to say that, in the name of all these<br />
good and honorable men, in the name of public: decency, in the name of the<br />
-safety of Australia, the man on trial in this debate: is Dr. Evatt himself. </p>
