<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister welcome to Dateline. Before we begin with APEC,</p>
<p>   may I ask you some questions about some international developments.</p>
<p>   First of all, Iraq Â have you got any updates from President</p>
<p>   Clinton?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I received a letter from President Clinton this morning outlining</p>
<p>   the history of recent events, asking for Australian support in the</p>
<p>   event of an American military strike. Certainly there was nothing</p>
<p>   in the letter that I disagreed with. There's no doubt that</p>
<p>   the patience of the world has been sorely tested by Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>   The agreement that was made some months ago that averted military</p>
<p>   action should have been observed, and if some military activity</p>
<p>   takes place then it will be on the head of Saddam Hussein because</p>
<p>   the world cannot accept his continued refusal to submit himself</p>
<p>   to a proper United Nations supervised inspection.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So you are offering political support. Would you be offering any</p>
<p>   military support if that was asked?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that's a completely hypothetical question. It's</p>
<p>   not been asked and I don't expect it to be asked.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well, closer to this region, your reaction to the developments</p>
<p>   in Indonesia yesterday? It seems to be returning to the chaos of</p>
<p>   really May?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't know that it is as serious as that but certainly any</p>
<p>   civil disturbance is of concern. Deaths are extremely regrettable.</p>
<p>   We had hoped with the new administration that there would be some</p>
<p>   progress towards a more open society and that has plainly happened.</p>
<p>   Dr Habibie has gone further than many of his critics suggested.</p>
<p>   I don't want to jump to conclusions on the basis of what has</p>
<p>   occurred over the last few days. Obviously it is disturbing but</p>
<p>   we are still maintaining a sense of optimism and hope about the</p>
<p>   future in Indonesia. It is a very important country to us and we</p>
<p>   are very sympathetic to the enormous economic adjustment that the</p>
<p>   country is now going through and it is very much in Australia's</p>
<p>   interests that that adjustment occur and there is some faint indication</p>
<p>   that the economy of Indonesia is starting to adjust.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But could President Habibie hurry those reforms, or should the</p>
<p>   students be a little bit more patient?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you could always argue either of those arguments. You can</p>
<p>   always say that maybe he could hurry up the reforms, on the other</p>
<p>   hand, you can say that people should understand that when you've</p>
<p>   been used to a fairly authoritarian system for a long time, any</p>
<p>   movement down another road is progress. Certainly Dr Habibie has</p>
<p>   surprised a lot of people with what he's done. He has gone</p>
<p>   further. He's gone further with East Timor than many people</p>
<p>   suggested, and I just hope he keeps the momentum going. But it is</p>
<p>   a difficult situation. There's a lot of social strain. The</p>
<p>   living standard of that country has plunged, and there are tens</p>
<p>   of millions of Indonesians living below the poverty line. So, it</p>
<p>   is a potent cocktail for discontent and civil disturbance.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well Mr Howard, looking forward to the APEC summit, you know APEC</p>
<p>   has come under heavy criticism, certainly in the light of the Asian</p>
<p>   economic crisis and its perceived irrelevance to it. How decisive</p>
<p>   will this meeting be in terms of restoring confidence in the organisation</p>
<p>   or rendering it totally irrelevent?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think APEC has had anything to do with the Asian economic</p>
<p>   downturn.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But in terms of offering support and being relevant to it...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well APEC was never meant to be a supplement to international financial</p>
<p>   institutions, never. APEC was always designed as a political forum</p>
<p>   to promote the cause of trade liberalisation in the region. It was</p>
<p>   never meant to supplement or replace or augment the role of bodies</p>
<p>   like the IMF or the World Bank. Now it is a difficult time and there</p>
<p>   are pressures for the trade liberalisation process to slow down.</p>
<p>   We understand the difficulty of many of the economies that have</p>
<p>   gone into recession, on the other hand, it is in their interests,</p>
<p>   both medium and longer term that the trade liberalisation process</p>
<p>   be maintained. And we'll be arguing for that and we'll</p>
<p>   be arguing for policies that will re-ignite growth in the region</p>
<p>   and we'll be putting the case for broader reforms to the international</p>
<p>   financial architecture along the lines that I outlined in my speech</p>
<p>   to the Banking Supervisors conference in Sydney a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well certainly Dr Mahathir has said that he doesn't expect</p>
<p>   a lot to develop at this conference and has asked some of the stronger</p>
<p>   economies to be understanding. Is it really a bit much to ask some</p>
<p>   of the very hurt economies to liberalise at a time when their instincts</p>
<p>   will be telling them to protect themselves?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we are talking about a liberalisation goal for those countries</p>
<p>   of the year 2020, which is 22 years away from now, so we are not</p>
<p>   saying you have got to open every trade barrier or tear down every</p>
<p>   trade barrier tomorrow. We are talking about a measured period of</p>
<p>   time. So therefore you've got to look and you can afford to</p>
<p>   look at the medium to longer term and we'd be saying to those</p>
<p>   countries that the way out is not to retreat it back to protection.</p>
<p>   I mean, we saw what happened in the Â30s when that occurred.</p>
<p>   Any suggestion that you solve the economic challenges of the region</p>
<p>   by reverting to protection is badly misplaced. Of course we understand</p>
<p>   their difficulties and no country has done more relatively than</p>
<p>   Australia to help. We after all have given to the three, IMF rescue</p>
<p>   packages, along with Japan, we are the only country in the world</p>
<p>   to have done that. So our credentials in Kuala Lumpur as a strong</p>
<p>   country willing to help are quite impeccable and one of the advantages</p>
<p>   I will have is that I'll be speaking on behalf of a country</p>
<p>   whose domestic economy has weathered the storm better than anybody</p>
<p>   expected and also a country that was very willing to help Indonesia,</p>
<p>   Korea and Thailand in their time of economic trouble.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And of course you will be taking a leading role in promoting good</p>
<p>   economic governance at this summit.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I will.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What does that mean? I mean, are we actually telling them that</p>
<p>   it is perhaps their fault because they have been into crony capitalism</p>
<p>   and perhaps they haven't had very good economic practices?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well these things are always a combination of domestic doings and</p>
<p>   international financial development, and quite plainly a transparent</p>
<p>   prudent banking system is very important to economic strength. And</p>
<p>   there is certainly some evidence that in some of these countries</p>
<p>   that hasn't been perhaps as evident as it might have been and</p>
<p>   if improvements are to occur in that area then that will go a long</p>
<p>   way towards providing a stronger economic infrastructure and foundation</p>
<p>   for the future, yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think they'll be responsive to such advice. I mean,</p>
<p>   this is all happening in Malaysia, a country that has put up the</p>
<p>   shutters instead of looking towards reform in order to protect itself?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, many of these countries have already started to do things</p>
<p>   on that front. The Thais have done it, the Koreans have done it,</p>
<p>   there's been no lack of willingness on the part of many of</p>
<p>   the APEC countries to adjust their own situation and I'm full</p>
<p>   of admiration for the things like what has occurred in Thailand,</p>
<p>   taking an example, I mean, Thailand has taken some very nasty medicine</p>
<p>   to put her own house in order and I congratulate the Thai leadership</p>
<p>   and their Prime Minister for what he has done. I know how hard it</p>
<p>   is for their people, because you are talking about millions of people</p>
<p>   being in absolute poverty, so the adjustment process has begun and</p>
<p>   we'll be continuing courteously, but with appropriate firmness</p>
<p>   to be arguing a point of view.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And Mr Howard, finally, you have indicated that you will be having</p>
<p>   bilateral discussions with Dr Mahathir. You'll be bringing</p>
<p>   up, I believe, the question of Anwar Ibrahim, even though the Malaysians</p>
<p>   have said they would prefer leaders not bring up that issue even</p>
<p>   in bilateral discussions.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm not going to get into the detail of what I might</p>
<p>   say to the Malaysian Prime Minister, except to say that when I have</p>
<p>   a bilateral discussion such as this I think it is always appropriate</p>
<p>   that any issue that is relevant to the bilateral relationship should</p>
<p>   be raised, but as to the detail of how it might be raised, or what</p>
<p>   might be assumed to be views of people advising the Malaysian Government,</p>
<p>   I'm not going to get into that, but it is an important bilateral</p>
<p>   relationship. I think it is important I speak to Dr Mahathir. I</p>
<p>   have expressed some views on Dr Anwar in the past. I certainly hold</p>
<p>   to those views quite strongly, but I also regard the relationship</p>
<p>   as incredibly important to this country, and it is appropriate that</p>
<p>   the Australian Prime Minister and the Malaysian Prime Minister always</p>
<p>   talk very directly to each other.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, thank you very much for your time.</p>
