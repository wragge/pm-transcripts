<p>The Australia II team has accepted the Federal Government's invitation to attend a celebration in Canberra on November 11 to mark their victory in the America's Cup.</p>
<p>Major celebrations to which the Federal Government contributed were held last weekend in Perth the home of the challenginq club. it is fitting that the Australia II contingent should now be welcomed in the National Capital.,</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Federal Government and the ACT House of Assembly will jointly welcome and congratulate the team at a ceremony in Civic Square at 12.30 pm on 11 November.</p>
<p>I know that all Australians, and the people of Canberra in particular, will join with me on this occasion in expressing our admiration for these sportsmen and our jubilation at their achievements.</p>
<p>Other activities will include a luncheon at the Lodge, receptions given by the ACT House of Assembly and the Canberra Yacht Club and a visit to the new Parliament House site. The Federal Government's invitation followed my statement<br />to Parliament on October 4 when I announced that the Government was planning to honour the Australia II team.</p>
