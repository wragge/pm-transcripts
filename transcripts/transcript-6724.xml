PRIME MINISTER<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE PARLIAMENT HOUSE, PORT MORESBY<br />
16 SEPTEMBER 1985<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, has Mr Somare indicated any change of view<br />
on the Australian patrol boats?<br />
PM: I am glad that question has been asked. I have had a<br />
discussion with the Prime Minister and I am very pleased to<br />
announce that Papua New Guinea will be taking four patrol boats.<br />
Q So they will become part of the program. I am very pleased to<br />
announce that. And it will be important I think to have this<br />
commonality program, Papua New Guinea and other important<br />
countries in the region.<br />
JOURNALIST: How did you change Mr Somare's mind?<br />
PM: We just had a discussion about it and while the basic<br />
specifications of, I take out the word basic, the specifications<br />
of the boat will not be changed. We will under the defence cooperation<br />
program, provide a degree of armament to the vessel<br />
which will meet their requirements. And so I think everyone's<br />
best interests have been well served.<br />
JOURNALIST: The original agreement was for 6 boats. Will they<br />
be getting two boats from elsewhere?<br />
PM: No they wouldn't be getting the two boats from elsewhere<br />
as we understand it.<br />
K-JOURNALIST: Are you surprised ( inaudible)<br />
PM: No. My colleagues of the Australian media will tell you,<br />
I am always relaxed about these matters. I think you can very<br />
often get through what appear to be problems just by some sensible<br />
discussion. And that is what happened in this case.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you disappointed that they are not taking the<br />
full 6 boats?<br />
PM: No, not at all. I think that this is appropriate at this<br />
stage. JOURNA\ LIST: Prime Ministor, Presidert Mitterand has i nvi ted<br />
Pac fic leaders to s<br />
you e going? ). AUST RA L IA..' </p>
<p>PM: I will not. I have one message and one message alone for<br />
President Mitterand. And that is the one I delivered retently.<br />
If President Mitterand is so interested to prove to everyone<br />
in our region. just how absolutely safe these tests are there is<br />
one logical conclusion that follows. Take his tests back to<br />
France and have those absolutely safe tests in metropolitan<br />
France. JOURNALIST: Have you any idea of why he is making this offer<br />
at this time, domestic politcal reasons?<br />
PM: I am not privy to the workings of the mind of President<br />
Mitterand. And I don't assume the impudence of trying to enter<br />
his mind. But the message that I have given is the right one.<br />
And just you look at it. The logic of it is overwhelming. He<br />
is saying to the countries of this region, come and see how<br />
absolutely safe it is. Now if that is true then pick up his<br />
trappings and all his scientists who can tell you how absolutely<br />
it-is. Pick it all up and take it back and do it in France.<br />
Because it is absolutely safe.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, in the last 24 hours Mr Mitterand has<br />
Q suggested PM: You just demoted him; he is President.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sorry, President. President Mitterand has suggested<br />
that anybody who criticises France's tests or its operations in<br />
the Pacific in fact are foes of France. Are you putting Australia<br />
in that categor9? I<br />
PM: It is introducing a new dimension into international<br />
relations. The logic of that is and I understand that the French<br />
have a great love of logic, that the logic of that is that if<br />
you oppose a particular policy of another country then you re<br />
its foe. That introduces a very dangerous dimension into<br />
relations between nations. I repudiate it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, did you discuss this issue with your South<br />
Pacific Forum colleagues this morning?<br />
PM: Which issue? The one we are talking about now?<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: No, I didn't.<br />
JOURNALIST:-So you don't have any idea what their response is?<br />
pm; Yes, I do. I met with them Rarotonga and on the basis of<br />
everything that happened there I would believe that their reactio.<br />
would be the same as mine.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you witnessed Papua New G-inea's<br />
independence 10 year celebrations today. Do you remain confider: t<br />
that our bicentennial celebrations will go smoothly?<br />
INI: They are ttuo iderenCient ratt-s. thinlk it is<br />
' hat I should riot intrude Australian domestic matters here. i<br />
am more than happy to answer any questions about that wvien I<br />
return to Australia. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the Nuclear Free* Zone Treaty which was<br />
signed today. The American response so far has been that ' Lhey<br />
have been studying that agreement to see implications of its<br />
policies in the Pacific. Have you had any more feedback from<br />
the United States about their attitude to it? And the country<br />
of the treaty<br />
PM: I don't want to go into details. But let me say this. You<br />
will appreciated that my Defence Minister, Kim Beazley, has just<br />
been, in the United States. Obviously, amongst other matters he<br />
discussed this issue. Those discussions will continue at a number<br />
of levels. I simply express the hope that the United States will<br />
appreciate both the intrinsic importance and significance of the<br />
Treaty for the countries of this region, indeed beyond it. And<br />
also its total compatability with our alliance relationship and<br />
therefore in the light of those considerations we will able in<br />
due time to bring itself become signatories to the protocols.<br />
But you will appreciate that under the decisions made at<br />
Rarotonga there will be later this year, I think probably about<br />
November, the officials together will be approaching the<br />
metropolitan and nuclear powers. But in the time leading up to<br />
those joint approaches we will continue these discussions. And<br />
as I say I hope they will be fruitful.<br />
JOURNALIST: Onto another matter. Australia has got a direct<br />
involvement with the Irian Jayan situation here through money<br />
we have contributed towards feeding those people who have come<br />
across into Papua New Guinea through the United Nations. Mr<br />
Morrison has spent ten days in Irian Jaya and has made some<br />
comments about his visit there. And the Prime Minister-, Mr<br />
Somare, has commented that consideration must be given to allowing<br />
some of the people in those camps to stay here, to resettle in<br />
Papua New Guinea. I was wondering if you had discussed these<br />
matters while you have been up here and what your overall<br />
impressions are of the relations between this country and<br />
Indonesia and the developments on the border?<br />
PM: Let me make these points. Firstly, I must put the first<br />
consideration that I have consistently made whenever this issue<br />
has arisen. And that is that the situation on the border is one<br />
between two sovereign, independent nations, Papua New Guinea and<br />
Indonesia. And we don't presume to intervene a position of<br />
( 9 Australia betieen those two sovereign, independent nations. And<br />
that point is paramount and must be understood. Having said that<br />
clearly, in relations between these two countries, each of which<br />
are friends of-ours, and with whom we have good relations, it<br />
is in our national interest that the issue between them be<br />
resolved in-a way which is least disrputive. Therefore, we have<br />
had discussions with both Papua New Guinea and Indonesia and no<br />
doubt will continue to do so. I have had only a brief opportunity<br />
to have discussions with Mr Morrison. I hope that before I leave<br />
I may have a further opportunity. lie will be submittiri~. a detailed<br />
report of his visit to Irian Jaya which of course I will read<br />
as soon as I can when I get back. I have discussed the matter<br />
also with Mr Somare and I believe as a result of those discussions<br />
there will be further meetings between our officials and the<br />
officials of Papua New Guinea in the near future so tha-t we can<br />
be kept up to date with the latest de,-veloPiients. I shc-. eld a.<br />
a further point that you iw. ould appreciate. We in Australia havu-_<br />
the added interest now, if you like, in that we have these five<br />
Ir~ ao,. nSjorraesi. aveappJ ie '~ Faes tatu,-_ </p>
<p>They are not getting refugee status, they are not getting refugee<br />
status. And we obviously for that reason have a vested interest<br />
in this matter being resolved because I want to make it quite<br />
clear as far as Australia is concerned, we do not want to see<br />
any exodus of West Irianese into Australia.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what in fact is happening to these five<br />
refugees, if they can't come to Australia.<br />
PM: Well, currently their application for a change of status<br />
is being processed. We are opposed to that, but we have as you<br />
know the processes under which people there are able to make those<br />
applications. We will have to consider the position at the end<br />
of those processes.<br />
JOURNALIST: But what is the alternative if they are refused<br />
refugee status?<br />
PM: Well we will come to that when this process that is underway<br />
at the moment comes to a conclusion.<br />

courts Dors committee and ultimately by the<br />
PM: Well that is what I am referring to, the process-, I am<br />
referring to the Dors process. And I am not intervening in that<br />
at the moment. I am simply saying that I have made our position<br />
clear as to what we think. We don't approve of the change of<br />
status which is being applied for but they have the right under<br />
those processes to do it. And let's just wait and see what<br />
happens there.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, back on patrol boats. Are any<br />
concessions being made to the Papua New Guinean request for<br />
PM: No there is no change to the specifications of the boats.<br />
The contract was signed last week. I conveyed that to them.<br />
We have had the discussions with them last year which..<br />
agreement, 20 July last year in writing. We have proceeded on<br />
that basis. They have accepted that and there will be * no change<br />
to specifications. I have indicated that under the defence cooperation<br />
program we will put some armaments on the boat, that<br />
involves no change to the specifications, no change at all.<br />
JOURNALIST: cost of the armaments coming out of the defence<br />
PM: Under the defence co-operation program, yes. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: ( inaudible question on meat cannery, 300 employees,<br />
PM: Well this has been a matter that was discussed earlier at<br />
officials level. It hasn't been discussed between the Prime<br />
Minister and myself. And I have really got'nothing to add on<br />
it at this point. I think Papua New Guinea is entitled to make<br />
its own decisions. We have made representations to them about<br />
the possible implications of these decisions. But it is not a<br />
point either the Prime Minister has with me or I with him.<br />
JOURNALIST: Could I follow up Ken's question, Mr Hawke. I was<br />
just wondering in your dicussions with Mr Reid about...<br />
PM: No, I am not answering any questions about that here. I<br />
would neither be fair to myself or as I know to your<br />
colleagues that you have left behind in Canberra.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible question)<br />
PM: I am prepared to answer-any questions in the Parliament or<br />
Q outside the Parliament, not only prepared to but looking forward<br />
to it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you also talk to the Fijian Government about<br />
accepting the patrol boats?<br />
PM: Our discussions with Fiji are going on on this matter.<br />
