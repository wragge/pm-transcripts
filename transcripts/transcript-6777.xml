E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
INTERVIEW ON ELEVEN AM 8 NOVEMBER 1985<br />
JOURNALI1ST: Giood morning Mr Hawke, thanks for being with us again. Well,<br />
the economic indicators continue to point to a basically sound economy. -Yet<br />
our dollar does seem to be having troubles. What has gone wrong?<br />
PM: Well, the basic area of concern is in the current<br />
account and it was known tljat we would have troubles with<br />
the current account for a while even when the devaluation<br />
occurred. It takes some time for the competitive benefit<br />
we get from devaluation to work itself through with a<br />
reduction in imports and an increase in exports, but we<br />
are confident that that will take place. And you rightly<br />
say, Ken, the fundamentals are good. They are reflected in<br />
the fact which I think will give great comfort to all your<br />
viewers yesterday's employment figures. it is the first<br />
time for three years that unemployment rate is down below<br />
8% That is very good news. We are very confident<br />
that while we will have to wear slightly higher interest<br />
rates for a while, while we are having the trouble with<br />
the dollar, it will come good.<br />
BEGG: Does that mean that intervention of some kind is out.<br />
You talk about the possibility of higher interest rates. Is<br />
that a response to the dollar?<br />
PM: Monetary policy has firmed somewhat. That is quite<br />
clear. And in-' the result of that firming of-monetary polic j<br />
there has been this increase in interest rates, but we are<br />
not talking about dramatic intervention because we are<br />
confident in the correctness of the basic fundamentals of our<br />
economy.<br />
BEGG: Are you saying that interest rates are going to rise<br />
further, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: You know very well that it is not proper for the Prime<br />
Minister or the Treasurer to speculate in this immediate term<br />
about what is going to happen to interest rates, because<br />
that speculation or observation of itself by either the<br />
Treasurer or myself, can have its effect on the market. We<br />
are not going to do that.<br />
BEGG: The Opposition Leader yesterday said you basically had<br />
two options. You could either go to the ACTU and say the<br />
productivity deal is off, or you could allow interest rates<br />
to go up.' </p>
<p>PM: Well I would have thought, Ken, that if Australians<br />
were looking for one source they would not go to for economic<br />
advice, it would be the current Leader of the Opposition who<br />
was the architect of the worst recession in this country for<br />
t) O years. Interest rates soared. Unemployment soared.<br />
Inflation soared. We don't want, or need, Mr Howard's advice.<br />
He has had his go. He has made a bigger mess of it than any<br />
Treasurer in the nistory of this country. We have turned<br />
around this country. We have saved it from the shambles of<br />
Howard. We don't need to turn to him for advice. And we won't.<br />
BEGG: So basically the economic strategy stays as is?<br />
PM: It would be madness to depart from an economic strategy<br />
which has produced Australia as the fastest growing economy in<br />
the world, which has empployment growing at a significantly<br />
faster rate than the rest of the world and within containable<br />
levels of inflation. Now, it is the case, as we have said,<br />
that we have certain difficulties at the moment on the current<br />
account and the balance of payments area, and that has produced<br />
this run, the pressure on the dollar. But we are confident,<br />
as I say, that with the calm approach that we are taking, this<br />
will turn around, and that by the end of this year the current<br />
account relationship to the GDP will be acceptable and will<br />
continue to improve.<br />
BEGG: So you don't at times perhaps wonder or even possibly<br />
suspect the motives of the money market?<br />
PM: No, I'm not a conspiracy theorist. I rather say this<br />
that I think they have their time horizons far too shortened,<br />
that they tend too readily to react to one particular bit of<br />
information or one particular event. I mean, I think they<br />
over-reacted to the 3.8% increase in wages. And this is, I<br />
think, a silly thing to do because in fact it is quite clear,<br />
and the business community have told us that they now accept<br />
the fact that the non-discounting in September and the 2%<br />
discounting early next year, they accept will produce basically<br />
the same sort of result in inflation terms as if you had done<br />
some in September and done some next year. Now, I think the<br />
market should have understood that.<br />
BEGG: From time to time we have heard over the last year,<br />
and indeed before, that as a nation we are living beyond our<br />
means. Is that what has happened?<br />
PM: We have, over a period of time, because we have borrowed<br />
very substantially. You can't keep on doing that. You have<br />
got to look at the elements of that borrowing, as far as the<br />
Commonwealth itself is concerned. And if you look at its<br />
external debt, our external debt as a government is more than<br />
covered by our reserves. The great proportion of the debt is<br />
as a result of private borrowing by enterprises in Australia.<br />
Now that has been made on what they consider to be good and<br />
rational economic grounds to invest in en ' terprises which are<br />
going to produce returns into the future. And I believe that<br />
will occur. But you can't indefinitely go on borrowing at the<br />
sort of level that we did. And of course part of the overall<br />
economic stragegy that we have adopted is to reduce the call of </p>
<p>government upon markets. We have reduced the deficit very<br />
significantly and in co-operation with the States, we have<br />
reduced the total public sector borrowing requirement very<br />
substantially. So this will reduce the call by governments<br />
upon foreign markets and over a period of time should lead to<br />
a relative reduction in the pressures in the capital markets<br />
and therefore an easing of interest rates. But we are<br />
cxperinc. n3 this p~ i-prcssuire at thec-momcn~ t for the reasons<br />
that I have given.<br />
BEGG: So we are in for a tough time as far as interest rates,<br />
for a while?<br />
PM: Well, for a while we have to live with high interest<br />
rates. But I believe that when you are making a judgement<br />
about economic policy you have got to look at the totality<br />
of it. And I believe that the Australian people are proud<br />
of the fact, and they should be proud it is not just a<br />
question of government they are proud of the fact that as<br />
a community we have worked together employers, the trade<br />
union movement, and government, to very substantially reduce<br />
the level of unemployment. When we came to office we inherited<br />
a figure that was going up to about 10.3% unemployment. We<br />
have got it down to 7.8% now. And we reduced inflation very<br />
substantially. The result is that the young people of<br />
Australia are looking at better job prospects now than they<br />
have for a very considerable period of time.<br />
BEGG: As you say, Prime Minister, unemployment is coming down,<br />
but you still do have a fairly high level of youth unemployment.<br />
Looking ahead, what do you target what do you see as a<br />
possible? PM: Well, I am looking, as I have said before, to towards the<br />
end of this decade a situation where as a result of our<br />
initiatives in education and employment and in training that<br />
we will have substantially eliminated unemployment in the level<br />
of 16 and 17 year olds and have brought it down very<br />
substantially at the next level of teenagers.<br />
BEGG: Does that mean in the old sense full employment, or<br />
is that an impossible dream?<br />
PM: Well, when we talked about full employment in the past<br />
we talked about it traditionally in terms simply of looking at<br />
jobs as such. I think we have got to understand that we live<br />
in a rapidly changing world. The impact of technology is<br />
upon us. So what we have got to do is have a range of programs<br />
which means that we have more of our young people staying in<br />
the education system longer. We need a more varied range of<br />
training programs which we are bringing in. So that what you<br />
will have is the young people of Australia occupied in either<br />
education or training or employment or a combination of these<br />
things. I. believe we can . get towards a position where,. as I<br />
say, in those age groups that I have talked about, we will get<br />
very close to having them fully occupied,-as they should be. </p>
<p>I3EGG: Prime Minister, 1 unfortunately we have run out of time.<br />
OUr thanks again, and as this is our last program, all the<br />
best for the year.<br />
PM: Ken, can I say thank you to you, and as this is the last<br />
program, congratulations to the station for a great year.<br />
And may I take this early opportunity of wishing all your<br />
viewers a good Christmas and a happy new year. </p>
