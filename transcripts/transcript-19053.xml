<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard and NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell have today announced more New South Wales communities will have access to jointly-funded natural disaster assistance following extensive flooding.</p>
<p>A natural disaster declaration has been made in the following four local government areas:</p>
<p> * 	Great Lakes<br />
 * 	Inverell<br />
 * 	Moree Plains<br />
 * 	Upper Hunter</p>
<p> These measures will help families, small business owners, not-for-profit bodies and primary producers to restore any damage caused by the floods and ease some of the associated burden.</p>
<p>This declaration triggers a range of assistance through the jointly funded Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, including Personal Hardship and Distress Assistance, concessional loans for small Business, primary producers and not-for-profit bodies, freight subsidies for primary producers and grants for voluntary not-for-profit bodies.</p>
<p>Assistance is also available to local and state government authorities for counter disaster operations and the restoration of essential public assets.</p>
<p>There are now 19 local government areas across northern New South Wales eligible for disaster assistance following the recent flooding and storms with Ballina, Bellingen, Byron, Clarence Valley, Coffs Harbour, Glen Innes Severn, Gloucester, Kempsey, Kyogle, Lismore, Nambucca, Port Macquarie-Hastings, Richmond Valley, Tenterfield and Tweed already receiving assistance.</p>
<p>Australian Government agencies are working hand-in-hand with New South Wales authorities to ensure that people receive the assistance they need during these difficult times.</p>
