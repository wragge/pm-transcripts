    <content><![CDATA[<p>HE Ahmet DavutoÄlu, the Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey and the Hon Tony Abbott MP, the Prime Minister of Australia, agreed to enhance bilateral cooperation to counter terrorism, tackle terrorist financing and mitigate the threats from foreign fighters, during their official bilateral meeting held today in Ankara.</p>
<p>Turkey is on the frontline in the fight against DAESH and plays a crucial role in these efforts. Australia welcomed Turkey's renewed efforts to prevent young people from using Turkey's border as the entry point to joining DAESH and other terrorist organizations through tougher border controls and increased information sharing. Both parties underlined the importance of identifying and stopping foreign terrorist fighters travelling to conflict zones, at their country of departure. With over 100 Australians fighting with DAESH in Iraq and Syria, and the arrest this week in Melbourne of young men intent on bringing the violence to Australia, Australia will continue to do all it can to stop foreign fighters.</p>
<p>The Prime Ministers welcomed the first interagency counter terrorism talks held in Turkey in November 2014 and agreed to hold these talks annually. They also welcomed closer police and operational support including the joint training conducted between the Turkish National Police and the Australian Federal Police in December 2014 and increasing liaison and cooperation between relevant agencies. They agreed to use all avenues to tackle the scourge of terrorism including sharing information that will lead to prosecution of terrorists, and developing an effective counter narrative to extremist ideology especially online.</p>
<p>The Prime Ministers welcomed progress towards a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty and agreed to commence work on an MOU on the return of foreign fighters.</p>
