FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 24 OCTOBER, 1982<br />
RESIGNATION OF LINDSAY THOMPSON<br />
Lindsay Thompson has given long and dedicated service to the<br />
Liberal Party and to the people of Victoria. He firs t. entered<br />
the Victorian Parliament in 1955 and represented the<br />
Higinbotham Province and later the Monash Province in the<br />
Legislative Council until 1970. He was the Leader of the<br />
Government in the Legislative Assembly between 1962-70. He<br />
then transferred to the Legislative Asseribly, successively<br />
re-elected as the Member for Malvern. He successively held the<br />
Ministeries of Aboriginal Welfare, of Housing and Forests,<br />
and of Education, and he became Treasurer and Minister for<br />
Police and Emergency Services in 1979.<br />
He became Premier of Victoria at a difficult time in June 198].,<br />
and in the short time until the 1982 Victorian election he led<br />
the Government and his Party with strength and courage, but in<br />
spite of his own valiant efforts he did not have time to turn<br />
it around.<br />
Lindsay Thompson will be remembered for the quiet dignity<br />
and effectiveness with which he discharged his responsibilities,<br />
and for the high standards of integrity and courage<br />
which he brought to public office.<br />
I would like to thank Lindsay Thompson, and his wife Joan,<br />
for everything they have done for the Liberal Party and in<br />
serving the people of Victoria. I wish them both every<br />
happiness during their retirement. </p>
