JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
by.<br />
VICE PRESIDENT HUBERT H. HUMPHREY AND PRIME MINISTEF.<br />
HAROLD HOLT<br />
CANBERRA. FEBRUARY 19, 1966.<br />
AMBASSADOR CLARK: Gentlemen it is indeed an honour and pleasure for<br />
me to introduce the Vice President of the United States of America, the<br />
Honourable Hubert H. Humphrey who has come to Australia on a special<br />
mission for President Lyndon Johnson following the historic Honolulu<br />
Conference. Prime Minister Holt, of course, needs no introduction.<br />
Gentlemen, the Vice President of the United States.<br />
MR. ROBERT-ABERNATHY N. B. C. What is the attitude of Australians<br />
towards the war in Vietnam, the conduct of that war and Australian<br />
involvement there? Then what are your comments on the demonstrators we<br />
have seen today?<br />
MR, HOLT: Gentlemen, you heard me say at the luncheon that the Australian<br />
people and I speak as the Head of this democracy, fully conscious that in<br />
a democracy you speak for a majority and I believe in this case an overwhelming<br />
majority. The Australian people are firmly behind the administration<br />
of the United States in the stand that it has taken in Vietnam. We understand<br />
fully the reasons for your presence in Vietnam. And because those reasons<br />
were so magnificently stated for us today by the Vice President, because of<br />
those reasons we are there with you as we have been over the years in other<br />
causes where Australians and Americans have been together in the cause of<br />
f reedom. You mentioned the demonstrators here today. Well, they're<br />
entitled to demonstrate in the kind of democracy we have. But I thiz* a<br />
truer indication of the state of opinion is that in the government parties, and<br />
these are men and women responsible to Australian electors and having<br />
to carry the responsibility of their judgments and their decisions into their<br />
electorates. But there is not one member of the two government parties in<br />
both Houses of the Parliament who has not been fully in support of our<br />
intervention with you in Vietnam and in support of the American policy there.<br />
I believe and subscribe wholeheartedly to the statement that the Vice President<br />
has made. I only wish that what he has put so compellingly and movingly and<br />
clearly to us today could have reached out to every household in every free<br />
country of the world. And I hope that the message that he has given us today<br />
will spread throughout not merely the free world but even reach into the darker<br />
recesses of the Communist world because there was a great statement coming<br />
from a free people directed to freedom-loving people throughout the world.<br />
And we are greatly indebted to him for this heartening statement of the<br />
American attitude.<br />
ALAN REID Sydney Sunday Telegraph A defence question: Release<br />
yesterday in Washington of an Armed Services hearing of January 20 reveals<br />
that Secretary McNamara has asked for more troops from Australia. I ask<br />
you, Sir, have you discussed this with the Prime Minister? And I ask the<br />
Prime Minister what is his reaction to this request.<br />
MR. HUMPHREY: In response to your question, Sir, I have not made any<br />
request to the Government of Australia for additional forces in Vietnam. I<br />
read on the press wires the matter from Washington, the release of certain<br />
testimony from the Armed Services Committee in Washington. The Government<br />
of Australia will do what it feels it can do and we Americans have faith and </p>
<p>confidence in their judgemnent. I said today in my remarks in the other<br />
room that Australia today is a participant in a host of activities in many<br />
countries including her commitments to the defence of Malaysia, her foreign<br />
aid activities in the Colombo plan countries, her emergency assistance to<br />
India, her help in Pakistan, her great contribution a very generous<br />
contribution to the Asian Development Bank, and her forces now in<br />
Vietnam. You would expect, I am sure, that the Government of the<br />
United States would encourage every country that it can to make some<br />
contribution, and greater contributions in Vietnam. This would be a very<br />
natural thing for our government to do. But may I say we are very<br />
grateful to have as our partner in Vietnam, amongst other partners, Australia<br />
and the New Zealanders and the Koreans and ourselves and other countries<br />
that are indeed some 30 of them in activities of a non-combatant nature.<br />
We're hopeful that there will be more, particularly in that other sector<br />
of the non-combatant services.<br />
MR. HOLT: Could I supplement that, Mr. Vice President?<br />
You know we are in almost daily, certainly close and continuous<br />
discussion and consultations at some level or other with the United States of<br />
America. What the Vice President has said about our talks today I<br />
confirm completely of course. He has raised no question with us which<br />
implies or presents any pressure of any kind to this country. But we are<br />
engaged together in Vietnam. We are engaged together in some of these<br />
other activities of an economic and social kind to which the Vice President<br />
has referred. There need be no mystery about the fact that at a time when<br />
American forces have been increased very substantially in a conflict in<br />
which we are both involved but along the line in service discussions and in<br />
various other ways we've talked together about what one country can do and<br />
what another can do, and what we can do ourselves. It's well known, as the<br />
Vice President has just put it to you, that Australia has obligations in a<br />
number of directions. We are trying to help against Malaysian confrontation.<br />
We are helping to a degree in Vietnam. Wc are helping in the aid field. We<br />
are trying to secure the situation of New Guinea for which we have accepted<br />
great responsibilities. And we have here a continent, as I said earlier, the<br />
size of the United States. In two states of this continent of ours Mr. Vice<br />
President, you could contain the whole of France, Germany, Italy and the<br />
British Isles and in one of those States there is less than a million people<br />
and in one of the others there is less than 2 million people. And so we have<br />
in Australia a great variety of responsibilities to discharge. We are capable<br />
of coming to our own judgement. As to what contributions Australia should<br />
make, whether it is of a military kind, an economic or social kind, in any<br />
particular area or issue and in anky part of the world. And I can say with<br />
entire sincerity and frankness that at no time has any pressure been put upon<br />
this country of an improper or irregular character by the Government of the<br />
United States or any representative of it. But we are grown people, we can<br />
think and speak in realistic terms about these things. And what a remarkable<br />
world it would be if at no point in discussions in either service quarters or<br />
administrative or governent quarters that the question hadn't been raised<br />
as to whether Australia could do a little more here or a little more there.<br />
Sir, you have stated the position quite accurately from our point of view<br />
and I'm glad to be able to confirm it.<br />
HERSCHEL HURST Melbourne Sun: I'd like to submit a question a<br />
supplementary question to the one asked by Mr. Reid. And that is; what<br />
answer, if any, has our government given, or you yourself given to Mr.<br />
McNamara's stated request for an increase in troops?<br />
MR. HOLT: We have been considering for some time now what more could<br />
usefully be done in Vietnam. We have had discussions as you know with<br />
the Defence Minister of the United Kingdom quite recently, and it was<br />
important for us to be clearly aware of British intentions and of forming </p>
<p>-3-<br />
some judgement ourselves of the future picture in that particular area<br />
of the world and, indeed, of the British contribution in this area of the<br />
world, because quite clearly that had a bearing of what Australia can do in<br />
one part of South East Asia or another. We've since had the advantage of<br />
the talks with the Vice President and our discussions at various levels in<br />
the administration and at the service levels. We have come to no conclusion<br />
as yet but this matter is actively under consideration. I hope we shall<br />
soon be in a position to what extent Australia feels able at this point of time,<br />
having regard to our commitments in all these other directions I mentioned,<br />
to supplement our present scale of forces in Vietnam.<br />
TOM WICKER New York Times: Mr. Prime Minister, is it possible that<br />
some time in the near future you may be able to augment activity in Vietnam<br />
on the civilian side? For instance, those similar to the medical teams<br />
you have there now, as well as perhaps things like military.<br />
MR. HOLT: Well, I shall certainly hope that we will be able to play an<br />
increasing role in these and other directions. As the Vice President has<br />
pointed out to you, Australia has recently made a contribution to the<br />
Asian Development Bank quite disproportionate to the size of our population<br />
or our resources. There is to be a United States contribution of<br />
S. 200, 000, 000. There is a Japanese contribution of $ UJ. S. 200, 000, 000<br />
and an Australian commitment of $ A85, 000, 000. There are a variety of<br />
directions in which economic and technical assistance is being given by<br />
Australia. Not merely in South Vietnam but throughout this whole area. You<br />
may have read that only in the last week, or was it earlier this week, we<br />
have announced an Australian grant of w'-eat to a value of S. 9, 000, 000<br />
to India in order to assist that country. In a variety of ways, we are trying<br />
to give effect to the sort of spirit which resulted in Australia pioneering<br />
international aid activities in this part of the world through the Colombo Plan.<br />
And we have welcomed the imaginative approach, the constructive approach<br />
of the President. And we have watched with appreciation the drive being given<br />
to this effort by the Vice President. This approach which sees a military<br />
victory as being only a part of the purpose which lies ahead for us; and<br />
before the military victory has been achieved we would hope to be well on<br />
our way with work that can be done in this constructive economic and social<br />
improvement through South East Asia. But don't overlook the fact that we are<br />
still only a country of something under 12, 000, 000 people inhabiting a vast<br />
continent with all the problems that distance and scarcity of population make<br />
for us. But you will find us not an unwilling ally a country which has<br />
contributed something under just under half a million casualties in two<br />
World Wars when we had less than eight million people in Australia is not<br />
a country that is laggardly in its recognition of international responsibility.<br />
MR. HUMPHREY: I might add to what the Prime Minister said, that in<br />
every country that we have visited we have found the heads of government to<br />
be enthusiastic and in full support of the Asian Development Bank. I believe<br />
with the exception of one country where the resources were entirely too<br />
limited I believe it was Laos. There has been a generous contribution<br />
on the part of those countries to the Asian Development Bank which offers,<br />
I think, a great hope for economic and social development in the Asian areas.<br />
SAM LIPSKI The Bulletin: Mr. Vice President what are the needs of<br />
Vietnam Would you care to give us your assessment of the kind of time<br />
scale that's involved in military activities? By this I mean, how long do<br />
you think the present phase of military activities is likely to go on? And are<br />
you able to say whether in one year or in two years there is likely to be<br />
some major change in the present strategy of the United States purely<br />
in the military field disregarding for a moment whatever other social or<br />
economic activities the United States might undertake. </p>
<p>MR. HUMPHREY: Sir, I don't think it is possible, nor would it be even<br />
reasonable to try to project what the time scale will be on military<br />
activities. I can only say this: that whatever is required and that whatever<br />
amount of time is needed that the people and the government of the<br />
United States are prepared for that. We realise that this is a difficult<br />
assignment but we do see encouraging developments. The forces of the<br />
allies, the government of Vietnam, the United States, Australia, New<br />
Zealand and Korea, those forces are on the offensive. They are winning<br />
every engagement in which they are coming in contact with the enemy. the<br />
forces of the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese are suffering defeats and<br />
heavy casualties. I believe that this spells for us the hope of a military<br />
success. But I want to make it quite clear that military success alone<br />
does not mean the accomplishment of our objectives, because the objectives<br />
must be a stable government and a viable economy for Vietnam and that,<br />
Sir, to me is the most difficult assignment. Actually I really believe that<br />
the military capability for what people call military victory is there, and<br />
it can be assured'. But the economic and social progress that is required<br />
will test us very severely and will take considerable time, energy and<br />
resources, but to this we are willin&amp; to give ourselves and we find othe rs<br />
willing to do the same.<br />
LEN BICKEL A. B. C. ( Australia): Following the general tenor of your<br />
statement, can you give us any idea of the shape or the pattern or the type<br />
of form of government that you would find acceptable both in the United<br />
States and to South Vietnam that might ensue following a settlement with the<br />
communists? And secondly, what would be the role of the Viet Cong<br />
in the long term administration of that government?<br />
MR. HUMPHREY: Well, Sir, our purpose in Vietnam is to thwart the<br />
aggression, to stop the aggression, so that the people of Vietnam can make<br />
their own choice as to what kind of a government they want and what their<br />
future will mean. I do not think it would be proper for a free nation such as<br />
the United States, and I am sure my Australian friends agree, for us to<br />
outline the character of government that the people of Vietnam should have.<br />
What we are trying to demonstrate by our efforts in Vietnam is the right<br />
of free choice and that includes ' die freedom to establish a government of<br />
their own choosing, the freedom if they wish, to have a united Vietnam<br />
whatever they wish to do. But we are not going to tolerate conditions, if<br />
we can prevent it, of having force and aggression design the future of a people<br />
or a nation. And your second question, Sir, I forgot, Sir.<br />
MR. BICKLE: What would be the role of the Viet Cong in a settlement?<br />
MR. HUMPHREY: Well, the Viet Cong is not a government and I want to<br />
make it quite clear and that in any negotiations that may take place our<br />
Government's position has been that North Vietnam, which does mastermind<br />
the military operations of the Viet Cong, is the sovereign, is the regime<br />
that is recognised for purposes of negotiations. And whomever they wish to<br />
bring with them as friends and associates to the conference table is their<br />
business. But the Viet Cong is not a government institution; it is not<br />
recognised as a government entity, and it will not be recognised as a<br />
government entity.<br />
STUART HARRIS London Times: I am not quite clear who I ought to<br />
address the question to, if you forgive me, because I really want to get an<br />
answer. The questiorn would like to ask either of you is this; is whether<br />
the American Governent has taken the Australian Government fully into<br />
its confidence-on the contingency planning in Vietnam both of a political<br />
and a military character on the basis of the Australian government was not<br />
represented in Honolulu, and I would like to feel that from the American<br />
point of view that the American has taken the Australian government fully<br />
into its confidence on the possibilities and the possible responses by America<br />
to those contingencies, and I'd like to feel that the Australian government from </p>
<p>its point of view feels completely happy with the American government, and<br />
be quite sure that its comrnital is certain, provided the contingencies<br />
have been foreseen.<br />
MR. HOLT: Mr. Harris, I don't know that I follow the latter part of the<br />
question entirely but I can say this: that the Australian government<br />
believes that the co-operation, the supply of the information and discussion<br />
from the United States Government to the Australian Government could not<br />
be closer. I don't know of any direction in which we could have closer<br />
consultation or discussion the awe received at aUl levels from the United<br />
States and those who serve it.<br />
MR. HUMPHREY: And may I add that the prime purpose of my visit with<br />
the Prime Minister and the Ministers of this government is to answer any<br />
questions that the Ministers may have and to fill in any or all details<br />
relating to the Honolulu conference, and to advise and consult with the<br />
members of this government relating to plans and programmes that our<br />
government has in mind. We do feel that the continuing consultation is<br />
essential and in fact we have discussed today even the improvements and<br />
methods of such consultations and discussion.<br />
MAXAMILLIAN WALSH Australian Financial Review: You're a friend<br />
of India Sir, and I know Indians enjoy a greater measure of diplomatic<br />
contact with Hanoi than does the United States. I was wondering, Sir, whether<br />
the Indians were able to indicate to you whether Hanoi's attitude to<br />
negotiations is any less intransigent than it has been in the past? Or the<br />
other way?<br />
MR. HUMPHREY: The Indian Government has been very helpful in this<br />
matter. The President of India, who is a highly respected statesman, as you<br />
know, offered his good offices and the good offices of his governent to<br />
bring about negotiations and discuissions leading towards peace. I'd been<br />
assured by representatives of the Indian Government that they would intensify<br />
these efforts. I have spoken to the representatives of the Indian Government<br />
about the desirability of having the co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference<br />
reconvene a Geneva Conference. Regrettably the information from Hanoi is<br />
not at all encouraging and I think it should be clearly understood that the<br />
Indian Government, because of the aggression of China upon its frontiers and<br />
borders, is not, does not, have the kind of contacts that it would like to have<br />
in Hanoi, and surely not in China; but the Indian Government is being helpful<br />
we are in close contact and consultation with the Indian Government.<br />
President Johnson has been in personal consultation by letter and communicating<br />
with the Indian Prime M~ inister. On two occasions I have spent a considerable<br />
period of time with the President of India and we have nothing but feeling of<br />
gratitude towards that government for what it is attempting to do.<br />
STAN STEPHENS Adelaide Advertiser: Mr. Vice President, is it<br />
the intention of President Johnson despite the mor~ k-than somewhat<br />
discouraging signs emerging from Hanoi today to continue his peace efforts?<br />
MR. HUMPHREY: Yes, Sir. Bi-laterally, through normal diplomatic<br />
channels through the United Nations, through the extension of good off ices<br />
on the part of friendly nations and non-aligned nations, and any at all. And<br />
we have been getting, we have had efforts, from sources that are as varied<br />
as the Commonwealth Nations, Nasser, the President of the United Ar ab<br />
Republic, the President of India, the 17 non-aligned countries. We will<br />
pursue any avenue, any honourable avenue, towards a conference table<br />
discussion lending itself towards negotiations and we will continue to do so.<br />
RICHARD CROLL Channel 7, Sydney: Since you have been here to<br />
answer questions of the Australian Government on the subject of the<br />
Honolulu Conference and since Australia is fighting in Vietnam: </p>
<p>-6-<br />
a two-part question. No. 1 Do you think in any future conferences<br />
Australia should take part? And, do you think that it would be fair to<br />
say to make a gesture of increasing its troops in Vietnam that the<br />
Americans would welcome it?<br />
MR. HUMPHREY: I am sure of that, Sir. Let me just say a word<br />
to you about the Honolulu Conference to put it in proper perspective.<br />
President Johnson had intended to go to Honolulu in October to meet<br />
there with our representative General Westmoreland and the head of<br />
CINCPAC, Admiral Sharp and other officers of our government, including<br />
our Ambassador, Ambassador Lodge. Because of his operation surgery,<br />
he could not go. He spoke to me about it then. A little later on in the<br />
month of Januaiy, I don't think this has been spread on the record particularly;<br />
he spoke to me about my possibility of going, and then when it was<br />
discovered that Secretary McNamara was meeting with General Westmoreland<br />
and since President Johnson had not as yet had a cbance to meet with<br />
General Westmoreland since he had been assigned in Vietnam, and<br />
Ambassador Lodge had not returned to Washington since he had been<br />
assigned to Saigon, the President felt this gave him an opportunity on a<br />
weekend to go within the jurisdictional limits of the United States, Hawaii<br />
being the 50th State, to meet with our officials and at the same time to<br />
meet with the government leaders of Vietnam whom he had not met. Our<br />
President believes a great deal in personal diplomacy. He likes to know the<br />
men that he talks to. As he has indicated in the past, you can get the<br />
measure of the man when you have a chance to be with him and talk with him.<br />
This was a meeting that had as its purpose the co-ordination of activities<br />
between the government of Vietnam and the United States. Every government<br />
that's friendly to the United States that is involved in this matter was<br />
notified and was informed by letters from the President. I am sure that<br />
without indulging without violating any rule of secrecy that the Prime<br />
Minister the former Prime Minister of Australia, and the present Prime<br />
Minister of Australia had been in personal communication with the<br />
President of the United States.<br />
RICHARD CROLL: -That would be an internal matter in the United States.<br />
MR. HUMPHREY: -Yes. I do think, Sir, that the suggestion that you have<br />
made, which is one, by the way, which has been discussed by some of us<br />
on this journey, is very meritorious. Mainly, that in due time the allies<br />
involved in the struggle in Vietnam will want to consult in a much broader<br />
framework than the Honolulu Conference.<br />
ALLAN REID Sydney Sunday Telegraph: Have you had any concrete<br />
assurance in detail from the present South Vietnamese Government they will<br />
produce the social re form that is so obviously necessary for the success<br />
for the outcome, of your military effort.<br />
MR. HUMPHREY: Yes, Sir, indeed we have. Now the assurances have been<br />
given by the Chairmen of the Government, the Council of Ken, that is known<br />
as National Unity Council General Chu, and by the Prime Minister Prime<br />
Minister Ky, and his Ministers. Frankly we have been impressed,<br />
favourably impressed, by these gentlemen This is a relatively new<br />
government but it has been empowered for better than seven months and<br />
has exhibited considerable stability. The Prime Minister, Prime Minister Ky,<br />
made a very favourable impression upon the President and indeed upon myself<br />
with the sincerity of his purpose in advocating and instituting the necessary<br />
economic political and social reforms. The question of the ability to carry<br />
out is one that only time can tell. We are working with them. It is our view<br />
that our Australian friends, our New Zealand friends, and the Koreans and<br />
others that will be working with us will have to be of help to the Vietnamese<br />
government in terms of technicians and specialists to help carry out these<br />
reforms. But we have already seen the reforms in action. I have visited, Sir,<br />
on the spot, at least two areas in the Saigon district where I witnessed some </p>
<p>-7-<br />
of the reforms underway. I believe candour and frankness is the only<br />
way to deal with these men. It is an uphill fight. It will be difficult. But<br />
these men seem determined to make the effort and Prime Minister Ky<br />
told me, he said that had we been at this 12 years ago much of the trouble<br />
we have today would not be here and he said, " I am determined to have<br />
honesty in my government; I am determined to have a social revolution.<br />
I do not intend to let the Viet Cong say that they are the revolutionaries.<br />
I am the revolutionary, said Prime Minister Ky to me. He said, " I will<br />
carry out these reforms. Akid I've noticed since we've left that he has<br />
acted, and, for example, on the black market a new code new law and an<br />
Inspector General to pursue the black market violators, the violators and<br />
the black marketeers. The appointment of a new Director of Docks and<br />
Harbours things that were needed manpower that was needed. The<br />
establishment of a training school for the training of cadres the training<br />
of cadre personnel to go into these villages and hamlets. We believe that<br />
there is a sincerity of purpose. We also know that there is a limitation<br />
of trained manpower, and that' 9 why I said to you earlier that the<br />
struggle for the reconstruction of the country which has been literally<br />
decimated by the Viet Cong, that that's the long-term battle. Actually<br />
I am much more optimistic on the military front. I find that the real<br />
challenge ahead is going to be in what we call the programmes of<br />
pacification and world construction.<br />
ALAN REID: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. </p>
