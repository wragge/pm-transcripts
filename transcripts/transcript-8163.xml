AUSTRALIA,<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, ST FIDELIS HALL, COBURG,<br />
14 OCTOBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: Well I've been in touch with Mr Kelty over the last<br />
couple of days and I'll remain in touch with him. I'm<br />
hopeful that the discussions that are going on now will<br />
resolve it. It certainly should be resolved.<br />
JOURNALIST: If it does continue how damaging will it be<br />
to the Australian<br />
PM: Well I'm not concerned with hypotheticals. All I'm<br />
concerned with is trying to do what little I can to help<br />
to get it resolved.<br />
JOURNALIST: The four unions say that if ESSO swallowed<br />
it's pride and agreed to negotiate while they're on<br />
strike it could be resolved within 24 hours. Do you<br />
think that ESSO should do that?<br />
PM: Well 3: hope that both parties or both sides will do<br />
everything that's necessary to get it resolved.<br />
ends </p>
