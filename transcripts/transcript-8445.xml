PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
COMMONWEALTH DAY<br />
Commonwealth Day is an occasion for reflection on the<br />
continuing international relevance of the Commonwealth of<br />
Nations. The strength and durability of the Commonwealth lies in its<br />
diversity and. size 50 countries representing a quarter of<br />
the world's population together with mutual respect for<br />
each other's national sovereignty, traditions and culture.<br />
These characteristics have enabled the Commonwealth to<br />
remain relevant to its member countries in rapidly changing<br />
times. In keeping with the pace of developments on the<br />
international scene brought about through the collapse of<br />
communism and resurgence of democracy, the Commonwealth<br />
itself has undergone significant change.<br />
The Heads of Government meeting in Harare last October<br />
marked a turning point as leaders sought to build on<br />
Commonwealth achievements in working for an end to apartheid<br />
and the establishment of a free, democratic and non-racial<br />
South Africa. Like other countries represented at Harare,<br />
Australia also pledged to work with renewed vigour for the<br />
protection and promotion of democracy and the rule of law,<br />
the independence of the judiciary, just and honest<br />
government and fundamental human rights. This presents a<br />
challenging agenda for the 1990s, but it is one which the<br />
Commonwealth is well qualified to address.<br />
