FOR PRESS: P. M. No 92-1970<br />
CHISHOLM BY-ELECTION RESULT<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
My warmest congratulations to Mr. Tony Staley for his<br />
remarkably good win in a by-election for a seat already held by the<br />
G vernment. He has reversed the normal swing away from the GoverLnment<br />
ii a by-election at this stage, has improved the Government', shar<br />
of the vote compared with the General Election las: t year.<br />
It is pleasing to see that the ALP has not increased its vote<br />
in spite of this being a by-election.<br />
Mr Staley has made an impressive start on what I am sure<br />
will be a long and successful career in the Federal Parliament.<br />
CANBERRA September 1970 </p>
