Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Defence Science and Personnel Minister Warren Snowdon announced today a new pin of recognition for defence families.</p>
<p>Speaking at Kranji War Memorial in Singapore the Prime Minister said the new pin would recognise the special role family members take on when our military personnel serve abroad.</p>
<p>Our Diggers make a brave and honourable contribution to the nation when they serve overseas. </p>
<p>But their sons, daughters, partners and parents also make a significant sacrifice too.</p>
<p>This new pin will be for these family members across Navy, Army and the Air Force who go for stretches without their loved ones, often under anxious circumstance knowing their loved one is deployed in dangerous conflict zone.</p>
<p>Mr Snowdon said the Department of Defence would work with family support organisations, including Defence Families Australia on the design of the pin.</p>
<p>It's important the design and look of the pin appropriately reflect its purpose and we will be making sure families have the opportunity to provide input into its design.</p>
<p>While some community and ADF organisations have individual badges or medals, no universal pin of recognition across the forces has previously existed.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister also thanked the Member for Robertson, Deb O'Neill who raised the idea with the Prime Minister after receiving the suggestion from one of her constituents, Milan Nikolic.</p>
<p>Milan served as a UN peacekeeper in Rwanda during the genocide and was severely injured while on active duty. His wife and two children back home battled their own health problems without the support of their husband and father.</p>
<p>It is expected the new pin will be released later this year. </p>
