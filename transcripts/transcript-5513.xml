AS DELIVERED<br />
' PRIME MINISTER FRIDAY, 13 FEBRUARY, 1981<br />
ADDRESS TO BUSINESSMEN'S BREAKFAST<br />
PERTH<br />
I am delighted to be here in support of Allan Rocher, who is<br />
translating himself from the Senate to the House of Representatives.<br />
Ife has already demonstrated that he will be a very effective<br />
and constructive member for Curtin. He will be able to contribute<br />
very greatly to the workings of the Liberal Party and thd-<br />
Federal Government.<br />
I do not think there is mauch need for me to say very much about<br />
Allan in regard to that, because he is well known here as a<br />
very strong supporter of private enterprise and of the kind of<br />
government that I think most of you would believe is important.<br />
I do not really want to speak for a great while, because I want<br />
then to hear your views, or to try and res-pond to questions.<br />
But there are one or two points first I might make. It is plain<br />
that over the last five years there have occasionally been one<br />
or two difficult decisions. Much of this was building the<br />
foundations of a strong Australia, a strong economy, which could<br />
then march forward into the 1980s in a way that all people would<br />
see the benefits of the work that had been done. In a sense, it<br />
is like building a foundation. What has happened over the last<br />
five years was all underground. Now we are up to the ground<br />
level and over the years ahead of us, I think it is going to<br />
be above ground and clear for everyone to see.<br />
Five years ago Australia was economically very sick indeed.<br />
We were worse than the world position on nearly every count<br />
that you would like to take; whether it was inflation, or growth<br />
or productivity. But now that has very largely been reversed.<br />
It is much easier to get an economy moving if you are going with<br />
the world trend, if world trade is growing, if world productivity<br />
is rising, and if inflation is low, then an economy can be dragged<br />
along with that. But we have achieved very significant advances<br />
swimnung upstream, against the trend, with world trade sluggish,<br />
with growth in major economies falling not even standing still<br />
in a number of instances. with growth in major economies falling<br />
and with inflation around the world rising. Against most of<br />
that, we have done very well indeed. It worth noting that the<br />
OECD forecast for the whole area in real growth in GDP is only<br />
1% in 1981, but that is quite a different picture for Australia,<br />
where they estimated 4% growth. That I think, is the highest.<br />
estimated by that organisation for any OECD country. That ha~ s<br />
obviously only happened as the result of consistent policies,<br />
co-operation between States such as Western Australia and the<br />
Commonwealth, and policies that have been persistent and enduring<br />
and working to the advantage of industry and of all Australians. </p>
<p>-2<br />
Some might think that this growth is just taking place in<br />
the great resource industries, in the great mining areas, but. it<br />
is much more broadly based than that. There has been a surge<br />
in strength, growth in investment in the private sector, and.<br />
the last Bureau survey suggests that real business fixed<br />
investment for 1980 was up 25% on the year before. That again,<br />
is not a bad effort, having ii mind the picture of what is<br />
happening in countries such as America, the United Kingdom,<br />
France and Italy.<br />
Oil exploration estimates are the highest since 1969, so that<br />
is a great turn around. The Department of Industry and Commerce<br />
forecast of either firmly committed or final feasibility stage<br />
mining and manufacturing projects is now up over $ 33 billion.<br />
I can still remember that second election in 1977, when I came<br />
out with a figure that Australia was standing ready to go with<br />
$ 6,000 million worth of investment and development on the<br />
same definition. Everyone knew that Labor had stopped the<br />
country so dead in its track they thought this could not be<br />
possible. How could there now be $ 6,000 million worth ready<br />
to go? Well, there were, and in the two years after that, that<br />
figure of $ 6,000 million was in fact exceeded. But that<br />
figure of $ 33 billion, of which $ 10 billion and $ 11 billion is<br />
estimated to be taking place in this State, is a great<br />
challenge because the kind of problems Australia is going to face<br />
are in a sense the reverse of those that confronted us five<br />
years. I would much sooner, though, have the problems of trying<br />
to accommodate all that great development in a sensible and<br />
reasonable way, of having this country march forward, of having<br />
the problems of shortages of skilled labour, but then having<br />
policies that are designed the overcome that. These are much<br />
better problems than the problems of drought, the problems of<br />
difficulty, the problems of company losses and people going<br />
bankrupt because inflation is too high and the whole country is<br />
stagnated. . The problems of moving forward, and moving forward<br />
rapidly, can be real. They can be challenging, but they are<br />
the kind of problems that we ought to have. In fact, they are<br />
jIKi. Ir . the kind of problems.-we-have been working to have over the last<br />
f i: e'-: as-Iam, ddit, has come about that way.<br />
rshould nobtbe intimidated by the size of the task, by the<br />
:"--great scope7. of the investment that is planned and intended to<br />
. Itake place-in Australia. That also is a challenge. But there<br />
w ili be---soe who say ulook, this is beyond us, it is too much.<br />
IWe will not be able to get the shortages of skilled labour filled,<br />
and there will be other bottlenecks". Well, if there are<br />
let us see if we cannot break the necks of those bottles open<br />
and let us get this country moving forward as rapidly as possible.<br />
The growth in many areas is broadly based across Australia<br />
and across industry. Even though it is only in the early stages,<br />
empl6yment increased by about 170,000 last year, by 30,000 or<br />
more in this State double the Australian average. That is a<br />
Sgreat tribute to the policies of this State and what can happen.<br />
None of this has happened by accident. It has not happened just<br />
because Sir Charles has spoken about development and ( inaudible),<br />
or because I have. It has happened because of the consistent I<br />
application of policies which are designed to keep inflation<br />
below that of many of our major trading partners, which do restrain<br />
Government expenditure, which keep taxes as low as possible/ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
consistentwith asensible and responsible budgetary approach<br />
to the affairs of the nation. It is very easy sometimes to<br />
say that taxes will be lowered, but if taxes are going to be<br />
lowered, it has got to be done responsibly and it has to be<br />
matched in broad terms by reductions in Government expenditure.<br />
I think it is same for any family. If you are going to spendinore<br />
yo. have got to have resources to cover the debts, and so it is<br />
with a nation. You cannot spend on the never-never, whether it<br />
is Governments or whatever. If taxes are going to be reduced,<br />
you have to be able to cover that in a responsible and reasonable<br />
way. The tax reductions which Ian Warner spoke of have been<br />
consummated within a sensible and responsible overall approach.-<br />
to the management of the country's affairs.<br />
For those who are technically inclined and I mention it simply<br />
because there has been a little laxity in this area for a great<br />
variety of reasons over the last couple of years but in the<br />
last six months growth, to December, the money supply growth<br />
has been within the estimated Budget range. I know very firmly<br />
that it is John Howard's intention to keep it there. To the<br />
extent that wage determinations might be higher or larger than<br />
we believe is appropriate..<br />
( Tape turned over)<br />
that I have been speaking, but also the problems of<br />
militant unions, and this is something which I do not believe<br />
any Government ha6 completely and totally got the answer to.<br />
What you really do need is a changed attitude, a changed<br />
understanding amongst many people. I heard on an ABC programme<br />
two or thre3_ months ago one . of the most militant union leaders<br />
in the United Kingdom coming out quite plainly and saying " well,<br />
we got and we accepted a 6% wage increase because if we had<br />
pushedfor a higher wage increase than that there would have been<br />
more unemployment in our own industry". This was one of the real<br />
left wing, radical trade unionists in Britain. I think<br />
Margaret Thatcher, with quite rigid application of policies, has<br />
achieved-a-significant change in attitude in the United Kingdom<br />
amongst other union leaders. They are getting some more sensible<br />
wage agreements as a result. But where do you find that kind. of<br />
responsibility amongst Australian trade union leaders? I think<br />
we need to remember sometimes that one of the most favourite<br />
sons from this State is the architect of the madness of the wage<br />
policies in the Whitlam years, and of the excesses to which the<br />
-Z AC has consistently pressed.-It is in fact Bob Hawke ' s policies<br />
that led to the kind of wage escalation in the 1974-75-period.<br />
He was in charge of the ACTU at that time, and the proponent of<br />
the policies which said ' well, we will get everything we can out<br />
of the system, and then we will screw industries for as much as<br />
we can get above and beyond that'. That is still the policy of<br />
the ACTU. But is it not fair enough for this country to look<br />
for something a little more responsible from people who we know<br />
must realise that that kind of policy is just madness for thEir<br />
own constituents, for employment and for commonsense and<br />
the strength of this nation. / 4 </p>
<p>4<br />
In the union area a changed attitude is necessary. We are<br />
trying to assist that change in attitude with certain actions<br />
in relation to the Builders Labourers Federation. While I know<br />
it is mostly an Eastern problem and mostly a Victorian problem,<br />
that particular matter is going to be pursued with the utmost<br />
vigour. We made a decision because the various court cases<br />
had got to the point where were able to do that. Construction<br />
at the Omega base is just going to go ahead no matter what.<br />
That is happening, but that is not the end of the matter and<br />
it is not the end of the argument with the Builders Labourers<br />
Federation which has done enormous damage to my State and which<br />
I know quite well has prevented people from going ahead with<br />
major construction projects in Victoria simply because of the<br />
policies of Mr. Gallagher and the union leader who has robbed<br />
the State of Victoria over the years of tens of thousands of jobs.<br />
That is the kind of industrial blackmail that this country can<br />
no longer tolerate, Governments are going to have to co-operate<br />
very closely, to have reasoned and sensible policies. What we<br />
are really after is that change of attitude which will make<br />
everyone understand, and know, that if commonsense and reason<br />
0 can only prevail there is an unlimited future for this country and<br />
prospects in the 1980s which cannot be matched by any other<br />
advanced Western country anywhere in the world. It is all within<br />
our grasp.<br />
Over the next two or three years I think we are going to seal<br />
the success of this decade in what is going to happen. I know<br />
that Western Australia is going to be very much in the forefront<br />
of these great developments. The future of this State with<br />
Sir Charles and his team is unlimited. This is exciting indeed.<br />
If anyone doubts, well just take another trip to Britain, or<br />
another trip to the United States you had better do that quickly<br />
because the scene there might be changing quite dramatically.<br />
But many countries overseas now envy the Australian economy<br />
and the prospects and possibilities that are open for successful<br />
enterprise, for making profits, for providing employment and for<br />
building a greater nation. 000---<br />
