PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY 11 JULY 1982<br />
ADDRESS TO THE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN STATE COUNCIL<br />
OF THE LIBERAL PARTY<br />
It is always great pleasure for me to be in Western Australia.<br />
Since I last spoke to the Western Australian State Council,<br />
Sir Charles Court has retired as Premier. Through his vision<br />
and determination, he made an unparalleled contribution to<br />
the development and economic growth of Western Australia.<br />
He was the driving force behind the kind of development which<br />
is now . so clo3ely associated with the name of Western Australia.<br />
Sir Charles is a great Australian, a great Western Australian<br />
and a great Liberal.<br />
I am certain that Ray O'Connor will build on Sir Charles'<br />
achievements, and by leading the Liberal Party to victory<br />
at the next State election will be able to maintain this<br />
State's outstanding record. Mr O'Connor certainly showed<br />
a determination to pursue Western Australia's interests at<br />
the recent-Prmiers' Conference and Loan Council meeting.<br />
0 These meetings were of great importance. The Loan Council<br />
meeting was cone of the most successful for many years.<br />
The Commonwealth's package to the Loan Council gave the States<br />
total freedom, and with it, responsibility for deciding their<br />
own borrowings and interest rates for electricity supply.<br />
This was-not -only-an historic decision, it was a decision which<br />
only a Liberal government could have taken. Labor wants to<br />
4<br />
T centralise everything in Canberra and would never even . cotemplate..,<br />
sharing such. reonsiihilities with the. Sates.<br />
The added freedom, as well as the added responsibility and<br />
accountability that the States have accepted, will be<br />
welcomed by the community. The electricity decision was of<br />
particular-importance for Western Australia. The Western<br />
Australian government will now be able to proceed unencumbered<br />
by Loan Council controls with the Dampier to Perth gas pipleline,<br />
a project which will provide enormous economic benefits for<br />
Western Australians. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
The tax sharing issue was obviously vastly difficult#<br />
but the Commonwealth proposal means that all States have<br />
received significant real increases in their funds for<br />
this coming year. It also provides a guarantee that the-<br />
States which stood to lose, including Western Australia,<br />
will receive real increases in their tax sharing funds over<br />
the next -three yearo. In 1982/ 83, Western Australia will<br />
get an increase in funds of at least 2% in real terms,<br />
and a further real increase of at least 1% is guaranteed<br />
in each of the following two years.<br />
A further feature of the Loan Cowicil wair? th. cQ~ miitment<br />
by the Commonwealth to grant $ 65 million for welfare<br />
housing to the States. Following our housing package, this<br />
grant: further underlines our commitment to housing, -and I<br />
was delighted that Mr O'Connor gave it the strong support<br />
he did.<br />
r Pre si dentt,, We stern Australia has one of the most dynamic<br />
economic recordsi in Australia. This State has been one of<br />
Australia's economic locomotives. This record has not beenachieved<br />
just by luck. It has been made possible by the creation<br />
of an economic framework which encourages investment and<br />
free enterprise and which recognilses the need for responsible<br />
econo mic managemnent, a record which Liberal governments at<br />
Fede 1a and State levels have made possible.<br />
These policies are pursued on behbilf of the whole community.<br />
We are the only political party in Australia which is not<br />
encumbered by sectional interests. Above all, uni~ ke the<br />
ALP, we are not answerable to a militant trade union leadership.<br />
Responsible economic policies over the last few years have<br />
enabl ' ed Australia to move against the international economic<br />
tide and for some time, have enabled our economy to grow and<br />
real disposable incomes to rise.<br />
But we need to recognise that world economic conditions have<br />
deteriorated ini a way that no-one' anticipated, and that with<br />
this -continued deterioration, Australian economic conditions<br />
have also changed. Industrial production in the Major World<br />
economies has been falling, not rising. World trade actually<br />
fell last year for the first time in over twenty years*<br />
And real Interest rates in America and Europe are at historically<br />
-high ' levels.<br />
We have been told repeatedly that! economic recovery will start<br />
soon. I suppose that if someone says that often enough and<br />
: for long enoughk they are bound to be right eventually.<br />
Personally# I.!; shall believe it when I. see it. in the meantime,<br />
world recession has really started to hit Australia hard. its<br />
impact can be n; een only too clearly by looking at what has<br />
happened to our export prices for major commrodities. ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Between 1979/ 80 and 1981/ 82 copper prices have fallen,<br />
in constant prices from $ 1955 to $ 1631 per tonne, iron<br />
andF-te-eIl pri-ces iromi-$ 2ll ' to $ 363 per tonne, aluminium<br />
prices from $ 1410) to $ 1072 per tonne, beef from $ 2267 to<br />
$ 1609 per tonne and wheat from $ 147 to $ 138 per tonne.<br />
Yet--ave rage -e arn -ing s -increased in real dollar terms over<br />
the same period by over $ 17 per week. While export earnings<br />
have been fallingq, we have continued to pay ourselves higher<br />
wages, continued to give ourselves shorter hours. This is<br />
onl-yjmaking-Austicaliam indus-tries less competitive internationally<br />
and encouraging Australian consumers to buy imports instead of<br />
Australian producits. That means less profit for Australian<br />
firms. it means less Incentive to invest and it means<br />
fewe~ r jobs.<br />
Whil1e all of this~ has been happening, inflation rates have<br />
been ' falling amon,, g our major trading partners. Much of -the<br />
Sdecline has resulted from the weakness of their economies,<br />
and it has brought about much more-modarate-wage-demands.<br />
Settlemients of 5 or 6 percent are not uncomon and that stands<br />
in stark contrast with increases in Australia of between<br />
and 20 percent when account is taken of shorter working<br />
hours. All of this has created a situation in Australia of a different<br />
ordei~ from that -prevai ling even -12 months ago.* Squeezed between<br />
psi~ g.~? ag cut -, reduced-demand. and Aepresed epz'ic~ s-: as<br />
resltof overseas conditions, it~ 4-iii t o-nd'i t 11firMS<br />
have reduced their activity levels, started to shed labour<br />
and to re-evaluate investment plans. Today the rise In business<br />
investment, which had reached a 30 year record just a year ago,<br />
bas virtually ceased, and ' while investant. xemains ata high<br />
level it has done so because a substantial number of projects<br />
. previoutly. started-have yet to be brought * to v. onmpletioi,.<br />
substantial new in~ vestment decisions are unlikely while world<br />
economic conditions remain as they are, and investment is<br />
the basis on which Australia's groiwthjihd-, iireAlinofles,,<br />
* ultimately depends.<br />
Clearly, we must do everything we can to minimise the impact<br />
fioMrid rxecessidn-on,. the Australiani-. eoonomy-.-q~ ust do..<br />
everything we ca~ n to make sure that Austaais well placed<br />
to tike advantage of any world upturn when it does come.<br />
We cannot prevent world conditions from affecting us but. there<br />
is-much we can do to help ourselves. Certainly this will'be<br />
-Very muchnth. Gvxnet' mindfc.,<br />
d1 ircumstances which -ire both different and difficult.<br />
it is no longer necessarily a matter of the Government making<br />
way for private sector activity, for activity is falling,<br />
employment prospects are diminishing, and the world recovery<br />
*-that' is. needed to. get the private sector. expanding aLgain. is not 4.. 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
' It is also vital for Australians to realise more fully how " Iportant.<br />
it: is to work together to overcome the present difficult<br />
economic climate. We need to understand to a much greater<br />
extent that as Australians we have complementary interests.<br />
Thai is particularly true in the field.. of: Industrial<br />
relations, where we must ta}. e every opportunity to establish<br />
a mo~ re co-operative climate. Just a few days ago a task<br />
force which included representatives of the ACTU, the<br />
seagoing maritime unions, and the Australian shipowners<br />
_ signed a proposal based on the Crawford Report into the<br />
Australian shipping industry, designed to improve industrial<br />
relations procedures in the shipping industry ana to allow<br />
Australian ships to compete on similar terms with flag<br />
carriers of Australia's major trading partners.<br />
This report, which will now be considered by the Governm~ ent<br />
in th-e budget ' ccntext, provides an example of what can be<br />
achievecl when urions, management and governments are willing<br />
_. to co-operate, willing to work together. The effects of<br />
disputes at Australian ports, in particular our coal loading<br />
porto, is a lesson to us of whiat can happen if we do not<br />
co-operate with one another.<br />
We a'e not being seen -as a reliable supplier of coal -by the<br />
Japahese and the South Ycoreayis because our ports are so of ten<br />
in a'state of disruption. Now that is partly because not<br />
enough has been inveoted in infrastructure. -But ii is also -because<br />
industrial ralaton.._ are so bad. . The problems of coal deliverieg fronith<br />
East coast ports.. may seem somewhat distant from western Australia.,<br />
Jt the interestn of -the whole of Australia are involved.<br />
In )( 9rea a few wee) s ago, I visted the huge Pohang steel mill,<br />
which is produci3. ngabout-ninemillion tonnes a year of steel<br />
using coal from the Eastern States of Australia and iron ore<br />
from Western Australia. The same company is going to build a<br />
new mill, capable of producing at least as much steel again,<br />
but whetherco-frm the -East-and iron ore from the West will<br />
be used as the s; ource of supply for that new mill depends on<br />
whether we can r-e-establish for Australia . s -potts a name<br />
for reliability.<br />
The Commonwealthi Government is'working with the governments+<br />
of Quteenslana and NSW on the difficulties of the coal ifidustry<br />
including the problems at ports. These problems are now too<br />
serious to start apportioning blame. we must sit down together.<br />
and t. ry to fh'li~ os </p>
<p>' The tripartite conference between the ACTU CAI and the<br />
Government last kVednesday was another example of the co-operative<br />
spirit that is needed. All parties at that conference<br />
recognfised that we need to work together because we have<br />
common interests. There was a wide measure of agreement<br />
about -the economic problems facing Australia. A tripartite<br />
working party will try to reach agreement on a cortWi0f<br />
statdfementbn thea economy to the wage case hearing in August.<br />
Clearly, with r-esolve, the ACTU., CAI and the Government can<br />
work together. This is only a start, but it is a basis<br />
on which to help build a better industrial climate. And we<br />
must remem~ ber that our success as a nation in working together<br />
will be critical to Australia's future and the economic<br />
prospects o f oir children.<br />
Mr President, the importance of this State is not only<br />
based on its contribution to Australia's economic growth<br />
in recent year;. Western Australia is of great strategic<br />
importance. Aiistralia West coast is vital to Western interests<br />
in the Indian Ocean and a Western presence in the Indian<br />
Ocean is vital for the defence of Australia. it is also of<br />
great importance as a trade route for Burope, the United States<br />
and Japan--.<br />
Much of the oil from the Middle East, for example, is shipped<br />
throi~ gh the Indian Ocean to Europe, the. US and Japan.. The<br />
presence of the Soviet Union in that Ocean must-be a warning<br />
to us all that. our freedom and our democratic way of life should<br />
not be taken for granted. if we were not pr~ epared to protect<br />
our vital Interests in the Indian Ocean, then we would be saying<br />
we w-ere -p-t epa red to * defend our way of life and contribute<br />
to our own security.<br />
The sudden eruption of the Falkland Islands dispute reminds us<br />
of two lessons. First that military conflict can break out<br />
with very little warning. Who would have thought just four<br />
months ago that Britain was about to become involved in<br />
a war? Secondly, it reminds us that a country wiftholit adequate<br />
defences demonstrates to the world its lack of commitment<br />
to the protection of its-teprr-Itorial integrity and of its<br />
people. The Falkland islands were unprotected, ' They were invaded.<br />
That is a lesson we should not forget.<br />
The Government has an unswerVing commitrent to a. secure<br />
Australia, a strong defence force and close co-operation<br />
with our allies and friends. Australia's defence spending<br />
has been increased substantially. outlays last year were up<br />
by nearly 20%, well above-general-price -Incresso ewe<br />
and 11 percent. We are in the middle of a $ 6 billion defence<br />
re-equipment programme and in the words of the recantly<br />
retired Chief of the Defence Force-Staff, we now ha. e the-; best<br />
equipped and best trained force'we have ever had in peace time.<br />
The Government is upgrading our defence deploymest. in N~ orthern<br />
and West Australia through an expansion of the RAAF base at<br />
Darwin and possibly at Tinda1 nqair Katherine to support the<br />
tactical fighter force, which will include--the new FA/ 189;<br />
thirough the creation of the highly specialised tWorforce which </p>
<p>6-<br />
is expanding our surveillance in remote parts of Northern<br />
Australia; through increased surveillance over the Indian<br />
Ocean with the, new Orions, which are the raost advanced maritimesurveillance<br />
aircraft in the world; through progressively<br />
Modernised comnujnicatioris at North West Cape in co-operation<br />
with the Unitea States; through the new patrol boat base at<br />
Darwin; and through the creation of the naval base at<br />
Cockburn Sound.<br />
We are ensuring that our military aircraft and ships are<br />
equipped with the latest, most effective equipment. Whilewe<br />
have our own highly trained, professional defence forces,<br />
defence co-operation with our friends and allies is also<br />
essential and such co-operation has been growing In depth<br />
and importance in recent times.<br />
There* is the deployment of the B52s. We have joint ixercises<br />
with Malaysia, .1ingapore, New Zealand and the United K~ ingdom<br />
under. the Five ]? ower Defence Arrangements. Australian Orion<br />
aircraft are stationed at Butterworth and the Mtalaysians<br />
* co-operate in" the operational deployment of these aircraft,<br />
and we co-operatbe in exercises with the United States.<br />
Exercise Fxeedom Pennant, a joint Austral ian-UnIted State$<br />
exercise is to begin this week. ' This morning I visited<br />
tJ~ e-9S Peleliu wihich is taking part in this<br />
exerqi-se, and J woula l ike to take -th is o'pportunity to Anroupce<br />
that the USS Goldsborough will be visiting ports on Australia'sa<br />
Eastern seaboard later this month.<br />
These defence agreements are at the very heart of Australia's<br />
defence policy and security. Today no free country can afford<br />
to stand alone in the face of totalitarian regimes openly<br />
hostile to our way of life. Even the'United-States -emphasises<br />
-that-it can only guarantee the security of the free world-in<br />
concert with. its traditional allies.<br />
Two and a half weeks ago the ANZUS Council met in Canberra.<br />
ANZUS is Australia's vital defence alliance with the United<br />
States and New Zealand. That meting was overshadowed by a most<br />
disturbing debate over visits to Australian ports by nuclear<br />
armed ships. For years Australia has had a bipartisan policy<br />
ofsipport for AN2rJS. That unity was destroyed by Mr Cain's<br />
and Mr Hayden's announcements opposing the entry into Australian<br />
ports of ships carrying nuclear weapons, statements which<br />
would: have meant that no US, French or British ships cotild enter<br />
our ports.<br />
Mr Cain has continued to declare th at nuclear powered or armed<br />
ships would never be welcome in Victorian ports, So far as I<br />
am aware&amp; Mr Burke hiar. not changed. his position of opposition<br />
tro V7isits'by * nuclear armed ships, and Mr Hayden's reversal<br />
of his position came in statements which were at all times<br />
equivocal o. 17 </p>
<p>7<br />
Do't it is not only on nuclear ships that the Labor Party<br />
-has-called into cuestioi its real commitment to our allies,<br />
in particular the United States. Two weeks ago Mr Hayden was<br />
reported as repeating his insistenice that Australia must be<br />
able to veto all. US orders " initiating military action" which<br />
would pass through the joint communications facilities at<br />
* North West Cape. That is an astonishing statement an<br />
impossible demand.<br />
The No rth West Capeis-a-relay station which helps ensure<br />
that information can be transmitted to submarines. The United<br />
States must be able to communicate with its submarines without<br />
delay pr hindrance if it is to respond effectively to an<br />
aggressor. Yet Mr Hlayden would weaken that ability, thereby<br />
underiining the United States' military capability in this<br />
Successive Labor Dfengg Mipisters in the Whitlani government<br />
Saccepted the prationo of the North West Cape facilities.<br />
SThey xrecognised there could be no'veto. Why then does Mr Hayden<br />
now call for a Vteto? Why does he want to impose conditions<br />
which he must know the United Stater, would not. accept.. conditions'<br />
which he must know would mean closing down the facility.<br />
I can only conclude that it is a pay of f to the socialist<br />
left 1f his parlty.<br />
* To clcjse the Noxrth-We 7fCajp__ facility would weaken Western<br />
defendes, it would weaken. Australia's defence, it woUld<br />
reduce the effectiveness of America's nuclear deterrent,<br />
and it would undermine our relations with the United States.<br />
When we look at the ALP's. lees than full-blooded support<br />
for the American alliance, and At. the underlying anti-American<br />
sentiment which so often comes out of the ALP, such as M4r Hayden's<br />
statement last year-that-haw thought -there was " vast concern"<br />
In the communit * y about America, we are entitled to ask ourselves<br />
whether the reason why the ALP givea its support to ANZULS is<br />
simply to avoid losing votes.<br />
An Australian government must have a clear sighted view ofits<br />
interests, its friends, its obligations and its<br />
responsibilities. Because we are remote geographically<br />
from major power centres of thie Western-MUliance, remote. from<br />
the Unitbd States and from Europe, there is all the more<br />
reason for us to have alliances which are firm.<br />
It would be an irresponsibl2e, potentially catastrophic folly<br />
to isolate ourselves from those alliances which help to<br />
guarantee our security. Without allies Australia during the<br />
Second World War would have been impossible to defend. This<br />
year * we have celebrated the 40th* annivers.. ar. of the Batle<br />
of the Coral Sea, a battle fought and won by the Ameri can-Navy,<br />
a battle which was critical to Australia's defence. / 8 </p>
<p>-8<br />
That anniversary should remind us all that we cannot do without<br />
-strong defence and close and reliable allies. And it reminds<br />
us that our alliances must be kept in good order. I can<br />
understand and Ic share the concern of people, especially young<br />
people ,-. about thie dangers of war. The peace marchets in Europe<br />
and America have shown how great those concerns are, and<br />
although there is an element of Soviet manipulation and<br />
exploitation behind these marches, I also have no doubt<br />
mnany of those who have taken part In those marrches have<br />
been completely sincere in their actions.<br />
I made both thes~ e points in a recent speech in New York,<br />
although the sec~ ond one was not reported at all. It is easy<br />
to say that experience tells us that the only way to maintain<br />
peace is if potential enemies can see that aggression does<br />
not pay. But whole generations have grown up without any<br />
experience of the circumstances of the last World War, with<br />
little knowledge of the underlying reasons for NATO, ANZUS,<br />
and the whole Western Alliance.<br />
-I-believe -tha we have an obligation to present these<br />
arguments and reasons to those who have not lived through<br />
a global coniflict. Not in terms of weapons and rilitary<br />
arrangements, but in terms of preservation of the liberal<br />
democratic way of life, governed by respect for law.<br />
K_-Antu Ilam conf ident* that wh~ n -the arguments in support of our<br />
[-Y. allia~ ces and of resistence to aggression are presented in<br />
these~ iterms, tbi~ n-young. people will be convinced by them.<br />
I have spoken today about two principal issues which are so<br />
vital'to us all the economy and defence. They are issues<br />
which. underline the differences between the Liberal Party<br />
and the ALP. Labior wants to abandon responsible economic<br />
polioes. Their alternative policies will give no real<br />
assistance in coping with a sustained world downturn# and they<br />
would'certainly mean that we-would not be in a position to<br />
take advantage of any upturn.<br />
0 Whenever Labor has been in power It has abandoned respon sible<br />
econoinic polib, 4es that has happened in New Soutjt Wales where even with..<br />
a 17.2 percent. -increase In Commonwealth grants, Mr Wran has<br />
had to put up State charges and taxes by in excess of $ 350 million.<br />
Labor'left the Trasmanian economy in a total mesa, and David Tonkin<br />
in South Australia has had to battle to restore his State's<br />
economy after t-Vaf-earsof Labor mismanagement.<br />
Labor'has little~ enthusiasm for our international alliances,<br />
i n particular our vital alliance with the United States.<br />
One doesn't have to go back to the Labor governmetbt to be<br />
reminded of how disastrous Labor's policies are. Last week's<br />
ALP conference has, shown us that in six and a half years<br />
of opposition, -the ALP has learnt hothing.<br />
As Liberals we know the road forward will not be an easy one.<br />
Eut we also kcnow that we can confront its challenges with<br />
responibility, determination, courage and success. </p>
