PRESS STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 191<br />
Sunday 24 February 1974<br />
NATIONAL ESTATE PROJECTS FOR WESTERN AUSTRALIA<br />
The Australian Government has offered Western Australia $ 330,000<br />
this financial year for projects to preserve the National Estate.<br />
The grants are being made to help a wide variety of projects<br />
put forward by the Western Australian Government on behalf of<br />
Government authorities, the National Trust and local government bodies.<br />
In my policy speech in 1972 I stated that in relation to land,<br />
an over-riding objective of a Labor Government would be " to preserve<br />
and enhance the quality of the national estate". In May 1973 we<br />
established a Committee of Inquiry which will soon present its report.<br />
Both the inquiry and the concept itself have been welcomed<br />
throughout Australia. There is clearly a rapidly growing concern over<br />
the pressures that threaten what is best and most valuable in our<br />
surroundings. Equally there is a growing sense of the value and beauty<br />
of our natural and cultural inheritance.<br />
The Australian Government's introduction of the concept of the<br />
National Estate, and its assumption of responsibilities in preserving<br />
and enhancing it, represent a turning-point in our national sense of<br />
values and in our cultural maturity.<br />
We have a great and varied inheritance to protect and care for.<br />
Australia is in many ways unique in her wildlife and her many natural<br />
beauties. Further we are now beginning to recognise the value of the<br />
often excellent buildings and historic towns left us by early<br />
Australians. All these things, and many more, comprise the National Estate,<br />
and to conserve and enhance them will increase our own sense of pride<br />
and responsibility as a nation and extend the respect of other peoples.<br />
I want to pay special tribute to the help and co-operation that<br />
my Government has received from the Western Australian Government in<br />
developing the idea of the National Estate.<br />
The Western Australian Government arranged for a State Policy<br />
Group to be established and this has provided a most useful contact point.<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Actions taken by the State in this way show how the States and<br />
the Australian Government can work together in a joint effort to<br />
preserve our heritage.<br />
In some cases the funds to be provided to Western Australia<br />
this year are by way of assistance towards large projects which have<br />
been planned and will be executed by the Western Australian Government.<br />
A large sum is being provided to help with the acquisition<br />
of land for park purposes on the south-west coast. Many Perth people<br />
use this area for recreation. The Western Australian Government<br />
hopes to see a system of parks developed for the benefit of city dwellers.<br />
$ 40,000 is being made available, through the Environmental<br />
Protection Authority, for estuarine management studies and associated<br />
urgent measures in the Peel Inlet and Hardy Inlet areas.<br />
Several historic towns form part of the man-made heritage of<br />
Western Australia. Help will be given to the town of York for<br />
development of its special characteristics, to Cossack in the<br />
north-west, and Greenough near Geraldton. Funds will be provided<br />
to the Esperance Bay Historical Society to establish a local historic<br />
museum. Fremantle will receive special attention as it is one of the<br />
few towns in Australia that retain its historic character and is at<br />
the same time a thriving community.<br />
The Australian Government has arranged, through the Cities<br />
Commission, to finance an action plan for the preservation of<br />
Fremantle. $ 30,000 has been allocated for this project.<br />
Funds will also be provided to the National Trust for help<br />
in restoration of a number of important projects planned by the<br />
Trust. </p>
