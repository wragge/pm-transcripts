TRANSCRIPT OF COMMENTS, QUEANBEYAN FRIDAY 27 MARCH 1987<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you rule out an early election?<br />
PM: You can't put a question like that will I rule out? I've<br />
got nothing to add to what I've said.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well some of your backbench don't think you can win<br />
an early election.<br />
PM: And a lot of them do, so what's that mean?<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you explain to us why Rod Cameron was asked to<br />
interrupt his Japanese trip to return home?<br />
PM: I didn't know held been asked. I read it in the Financial<br />
Review that he'd been asked to interrupt his trip.<br />
JOURNALIST: Care to speculate as to why?<br />
PM: No I don't care to speculate about these things. All I<br />
notice is the rapidly diminishing acceptance of the Liberal Party<br />
under the leadership of John Howard. His performance in the last<br />
couple of days has defied description. They were committed to<br />
supporting the equal employment opportunity legislation and he's<br />
walking around the country saying his foremost responsibility is<br />
to defend the integrity and the independence of the Liberal<br />
Party. That they were not going to be dictated to by outside<br />
forces. So what happens? His first test, the very first test<br />
aftrer he says he's going to defend the independence of the<br />
Liberal Party he gives in, he changes his position, he says they<br />
won't support the bill because it might upset the National Party<br />
in their meeting here this weekend.<br />
JOURNALIST: How important is the National Party, the results of<br />
the meeting, to the prospects of an early election?<br />
PM: I think it has a very great significance just in its own<br />
right. Leave elections aside. What you're witnessing now is the<br />
tearing up of the fabric of the traditional conservative politics<br />
in this country. You have this force from Queensland which is<br />
saying it shall be the determining direction of where the non<br />
Labor forces go. That force in Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen has a<br />
contempt for the Liberal Party, a total contempt as he does for<br />
anyone in the National Party who doesn't agree with him. It's<br />
very important for the whole of Australia to see what happens </p>
<p>2<br />
there this weekend at the Lakeside. Are they going to tear up<br />
the Coalition? He says they will. Then what does the Liberal<br />
Party do? Does it continue as it has to just kowtow to the<br />
dictates of the more extreme elements of the National Party, or<br />
is it then going to just concentrate its energies on just<br />
fighting within its own ranks? The bitterness between Mr Peacock<br />
and Mr Howard are fundamental, they won't go away. And so you've<br />
got a disintegrating conservative force in Australia, which is<br />
not surprising. If you're going to analyse this properly you've<br />
got to understand the reason why these things are happening is<br />
because neither Mr Peacock nor Mr Howard, in the four years<br />
they've had the responsibility of leading the conservative forces<br />
in this country, have done any significant work at all about<br />
addressing themselves to the issues of policies, the issues that<br />
are confronting this country. They have nothing. John Howard<br />
has come up with what? Incentivation! When you create, as I<br />
say, that sort of vacuum, that's what opens up the possibilities<br />
of your Joh Bjelke-Petersens.<br />
JOURNALIST: This morning Senator Richardson said the electorate<br />
doesn't traditionally like an early election. You'll have the<br />
Australia Card as a trigger. Do you think you can keep the<br />
electorate on side if you do decide to go early?<br />
PM: It's not a question of keeping them on side if I decide to<br />
go early. The question of the Australia Card has a very great<br />
intrinsic significance. I think people need to understand how<br />
important it is. It's not just a piece of legislation. It is<br />
fundamentally important to do two things, which leads to a third<br />
result. First, to crack down on tax avoiders, the black economy,<br />
people who don't pay their taxes and they can do that in the<br />
absence of an identity card. And also, it's the only efficient<br />
way of totally cracking down on welfare cheats. If we have the<br />
capacity through a card with photo to crack down on tax cheating<br />
and welfare frauds, that in a relatively short period of time<br />
will bring in the best part of an additional $ 1 billion into the<br />
coffers of Commonwealth revenue, which means there are lesser<br />
burdens on the rest of the people. It means there's a greater<br />
capacity to do things that people want. So you can see this<br />
piece of legislation is just no ordinary bill. It is fundamental<br />
to decent government, to proper tax collection, equitable tax<br />
collection so that people have to pay their share. It's also<br />
fundamental to seeing that people don't cheat on the welfare<br />
system. The Liberals and Democrats have got a very serious<br />
decision to take. Not just in terms of whether it will trigger<br />
an election. But they really have to ask themselves are they<br />
going to insult the Australian people by casting their vote in<br />
favour of tax cheats and welfare frauds. It's a very big<br />
decision. JOURNALIST: Is the legislation that crucial you'll take it to<br />
the people though?<br />
Pm: I haven't said that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Just in relation to Mr Howard's comments this<br />
morning. He was saying your credibility would be damaged if you<br />
decide to go early, or if you change your mind and say you're<br />
going to go early. What do you say in response to that? </p>
<p>3<br />
PM: Well I say these things in response to Mr Howard. Firstly,<br />
he is in no position to talk about questions of credibility. He<br />
has this week performed the most unbelievable turnaround, saying<br />
at the beginning of the week his first responsibility was to<br />
protect the integrity and the independence of the Liberal Party<br />
from outside forces. First test, within 24 hours he capitulates<br />
to the National Party. So don't let's take any notice of Mr<br />
Howard. You talk about an early election. I think the only<br />
thing you can be certain about in early elections is that<br />
there will be an early election for the leadership of the Liberal<br />
Party. JOURNALIST:........... national implications do you think?<br />
PM: I don't think national implications, no.<br />
JOURNALIST: What about the ABC/ SBS merger. What's the current<br />
state of play?<br />
PM: Well it looks as though there's not going to be support for<br />
that in the Senate and I've made that quite clear that the<br />
Government would not proceed by administrative means to attempt<br />
to make that merger. I think that in those circumstances we'll<br />
have further discussions with the representatives of the ethnic<br />
community because I think they increasingly understand that the<br />
Government is concerned with maintaining and indeed improving the<br />
standard of the services provided by the SBS. I'm making clear<br />
to them that before I agreed to the proposal to merge I wanted a<br />
guarantee in writing, which I received, that there would be an<br />
improvement in the capacity to deliver the SBS type services in a<br />
merge situation because the SBS would have access to the greater<br />
capital facilities of the ABC. But if the Parliament, the<br />
Senate, is not going to pass it then that will give us more time,<br />
the Government and the ethnic community, to talk together and<br />
move to a position where'they could be satisfied that their<br />
legitimate requirements would, in fact, be more than met in such<br />
a situation. I think it's probably in everyone's interests that<br />
we have the opportunity to do that and I think that can be<br />
achieved. ends </p>
