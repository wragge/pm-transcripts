THIRD MEETING OF THE ASIAN<br />
AND PACIFIC COUNCIL<br />
Opening Speech by the Prime Minister, 1. 5 AUG i968<br />
Rt. Hon. J. G. Gorton, Mp<br />
Canberra, ACT 3AR'<br />
JULY 1968<br />
It is my privilege to address you this morning on what is an<br />
historic occasion for the Australian Government and people.<br />
On behalf of the Australian Government, it is my pleasure<br />
to welcome to Australia the distinguished representatives of the Republic<br />
of China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the<br />
Philippines, Thailand, and the Republic of Viet Nam as well as the<br />
observer from the kingdom of Laos.<br />
The Asian and Pacific Council is a young organisation, having<br />
been established in Seoul just two years ago. It has had a promising<br />
beginning and it is the Australian Government's conviction that it will have<br />
an increasingly important role to play in the future of the region.<br />
ASPAC includes a representative group of significant countries<br />
in the area and we in Australia are proud to be members of it.<br />
As a regional organisation, ASPAC has some unique<br />
characteristics. It includes countries from North Asia, South-East Asia<br />
and the South Pacific, but it do-es not include countries from outside the<br />
region. A number of other regional organisations do include<br />
as full members the great powers from outside the region and it is right<br />
and proper that this should be so. The region in which we all live will<br />
for a long time to come need the help and support of the adv anced nations<br />
outside it. But the existence of ASPAC testifies to the fact that there ip<br />
a growing recognition in our region that in the long run our destinies will<br />
be determined by our own efforts.<br />
Since the end of World War 11 there has been a steady growth<br />
of regional consciousness in many parts of the world. Increasingly<br />
governments and peoples have realised that their individual efforts can<br />
be made more fruitful if they work closely with their neighbours.<br />
We now understand perhaps more clearly than in the past<br />
that goodwill between neighbours, and a readiness to look forward to<br />
friendliness and co-operation rather than backwards to old hostilities, is an<br />
indispensable requirement for that progress towards the decent standards<br />
of living to which all our peoples asp4:-e. We must have cordial co-operation<br />
among ourselves and it is to be promotion of this co-operation to which the<br />
Asian and Pacific Council is dedicated.<br />
The need for regional co-operation was recognised in the<br />
Asian and Pacific region as early as anywhere in the world, yet in some<br />
ways the translation of this into practical action has not proceeded as<br />
rapidly as it has elsewhere. 9/ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
The reason for this perhaps is that the peoples of our region<br />
have rich and diverse cultures, and in recent times they have followed*<br />
very different historical paths. In some cases their links have been with<br />
European countries rather than with their neighbours. But now the basic<br />
facts of geography and economics are reasserting themselves and none Of<br />
us can doubt that ultimately the future of this region lies in the hands of:<br />
the peoples and countries within it, so many of whom are represented here<br />
today. It is true that before ASPAC was founded, bodies like the Colombo<br />
Plan and the regional commissions and institutions set up under the United<br />
Nations played an important part in stimulating the sftse of a regional<br />
community. Indeed, if you cast your minds back, two remarkable achievements<br />
in regional economic co-operation that come immediately to mind are<br />
the Asian Development Bank and the Mekong Development Project; and a<br />
complex network of other regional activities has already been developed.<br />
The principal purpose of all these existing activities has been to apply to the<br />
development of the area the resources and knowledge available from countries<br />
jutside the area. This is where ASPAC differs somewhat from previously<br />
established regional organisations. Its main concern is to promote<br />
co-operation among the countries inside the region itself and to develop the<br />
potential strength within it through our own efforts.<br />
The prospects for practical co-operation of this kind are<br />
steadily increasing. For example, the rapid economic growth in several<br />
ASPAC countries will help to ensure that trade between them continues to<br />
grow. It is important that the rate of growth of a number of developing<br />
countries in ASPAC is higher than that of all but a few countries outside<br />
thiis region. The annual growth rates among the majority of ASPAC countries<br />
ranges from 5 per cent to more than 8 per cent. This compares with an<br />
approximate average of about 4 per cent for ' he total Asian and Far East<br />
region. Our own Australian trade with ASPAC countries is growing<br />
rapidly. In 1966/ 67 about one quarter of our total trade was with our<br />
fellow members of ASPAC.<br />
We are particularly pleased that ASPAC countries are beginning<br />
to benefit from the Australian scheme for tariff preference on certain goods<br />
manufactured by developing countries, and we hope that they will tak-e<br />
increasing advantage of the scheme and the opportunities which it presents.<br />
Economic and social progress can of course only be maintained<br />
in our region in circumstances of peace and stability. Unfortunately, the<br />
region is one which at the present time in history is most exposed to threats<br />
of direct and indirect aggression. While these threats exist, we must<br />
welcome the support of our major allies in contributing to the security of<br />
the region but must at the same time do our best to provide for our defence<br />
through our own efforts, and we should do our best to ensure that no<br />
internal differences of opinion upset the peace and stability which the region<br />
requires. / 3 </p>

Lt may be appropriate for mre to say that Australia has<br />
long recognised her responsibilities for contributing to the security of<br />
the region. Indeed, since the end of the Second World War, the youth of<br />
Australia has participated in the fight against aggression in Korea, in<br />
Malaysia and in Viet Nam, and its armed forces have made a small but<br />
valuable contribution to the security of other countries in the region.<br />
ASPAC is in no sense a security organisation and in the view<br />
of the Australian Government it should not attempt to become one; even<br />
though we recognise that if our efforts under ASPAC to promote the welfare<br />
of the region are to succeed means it is necessary for the region to be<br />
secure from aggression. The answer to aggression is not, of course, to be found<br />
only in the military arena. Military strength itself flows from a prosperous<br />
and progressive community, but so does political stability and freedom from<br />
subversion, and in order to achieve that prospercui s and progressive<br />
community 4ad that political stability,. neighbourly co-operation in paths<br />
of peace is we believe, essential,<br />
So in ASPAC, we are seeking to establish a close comradeship<br />
and a practical working co-operation in the political, economic, cultural<br />
and social fields. We also will maintain an open door through which other<br />
countries in the region can join us whenever they wish to do so. This, of<br />
course, is a matter for their free choice.<br />
But we hope, however, that as the real objectives of the<br />
organisation are increasingly appreciated and understood, there will be a<br />
growing inclination in all the countries in the region to realise the value<br />
of the kind of co-operation that ASPAC stands for.<br />
What we are seeking to establish is a genuine and deep<br />
understanding in all aspects of our relations of one another's points of view<br />
and of one another's problems. None of us is seeking to force the adoption<br />
of a common view upon others, but rather to develop a common approach<br />
to those problems which all of us share. In short, to identify the problems<br />
which are common and to seek to discover whether there is a common<br />
solution which we can together apply.<br />
One of the great advantages indeed of ASPAC is that it is not<br />
an organisation which meets to make proposals which are to be voted upon,<br />
to have decisions which are to be done by majority rule, but rather to meet<br />
in order to discuss, to identify and to see whether there are common<br />
approaches which can solve the problems of the region.<br />
We have already become in ASPAC a valuable forum for the<br />
exchange of those views between government leaders and the officials of<br />
our countries. They meet together not only in this Council, but regu larly<br />
between Council meetings in the Standing Committees of ASPAC, and at<br />
numerous international conferences, they take the '-pportunity of holding<br />
informal consultations among the delegations from this region, representing<br />
each one of the countries here present.<br />
I believe the organisation must be congratulated on the<br />
practical way in which it has set about its task,, s. During the past year,<br />
my col-league, the Minister for External Affairs has chaired the regular<br />
meetings of the Standing Committee and those meetings have been most<br />
valuable in promoting that kind of understanding of which I have spoken and<br />
which is the basic objective of this organisation. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Durirg the year, the ASPAC Registry of Expert Services has<br />
been established in Canberra and is now in operation, and at this Council<br />
meeting, Ministers will be asked to give their final endorsement to the<br />
agreement establishing the ASPAC Cultural and Social Centre in Seoul.<br />
I have no doubt that further projects of this kind will be developed, and<br />
each will have some contribution to make to those objectives of which I<br />
have spoken to you this morning.<br />
I would like to conclude by reiterating my welcome to the<br />
distinguished representatives here today, and by expressing the hope and<br />
confidence that your deliberations during this Third Asian and Pacific<br />
Council Meeting will further strengthen the ties that unite us, I hnpe by<br />
seeking, peering down the paths of the future, to put into your minds a<br />
vision of this region with its people, politically free and economically<br />
prosperous, working together for the good of all human beings in the region,<br />
perhaps partly as a result of conferences such as these and of the work put<br />
into those conferences by the representatives of the countries who are here<br />
today and by the backing they will get from the ordinary men and women<br />
who in this region, and perhaps ultimately in the world, have a common goal<br />
which ASPAC seeks.<br />
I declare the meeting open. </p>
