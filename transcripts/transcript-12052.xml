    <content><![CDATA[<p>Subjects: East Timor relations; Aston by-election; Senator Tambling</p>
<p>E&amp;OE................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You're obviously happy with the Timor Gap agreement.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes it's a good outcome, it's very fair to the new state of East Timor but it's also an arrangement that's good for Australia. It's just a tribute to the negotiating skills of Alexander Downer and Nick Minchin and all the team that have worked with them and it will be a way of giving some revenue security to the new country which is going to be a very poor country and need a lot of assistance, but not to an unreasonable degree. I'm very happy with it and I congratulate those involved and it's an example of what can be achieved if people adopt a cooperative attitude.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible) fair?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh yes it is. Given their location and the circumstances, yes it is.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You're not disappointed that it wasn't closer to 60/40.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I never expected it to be anywhere near that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Any comment on the no drop in interest rates this morning?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, except to remind you that interest rates are at a 30 year low in Australia already. The average mortgage is $300 a month cheaper than what it was when this Government came to power and the last time the Labor Party held the seat of Aston interest rates were 17%.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Just on Aston. It's not looking good for you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the polls at the moment are not, no. We are behind.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you surprised?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh nothing surprises me in politics but it inspires me to work harder and to remind people who don't want to deliver an undeserved bonus to Mr Beazley that they can't muck around with a protest vote. We are behind and everybody who wants a Liberal success should give us their vote.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you worried by reports this morning, I believe in the Financial Review, saying Labor is likely to take 14 key regional seats in the election later this year?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There's nothing particularly new about predictions of a Labor victory at the general election.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What, predictions? No.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Grant Tambling, are you disappointed by the ..</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh yes but, you know, bear in mind that the Country Liberal Party's a separate party, but I think he's done a good job and he did the right thing and that's a matter between him and the party organisation.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard have you made a decision yet on whether to extend the $14,000 first home buyers grant?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh no, no. I've simply said we'll always take decisions that are sensitive to the interest of the home building industry, but we haven't taken any decision to do that, certainly not.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Just with the Grant Tambling issue, is there any option for an appeal?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you'll have to ask him and the CLP about that. CLP's a separate party, it's not part of the Liberal Party so I don't have any authority in it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Would you urge them to.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'd urge you to talk to Grant Tambling and the party organisation. Thankyou.</p>
