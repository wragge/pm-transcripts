PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
FAREWELL TO THE MAIN CONTINGENT OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
MEDICAL SUPPORT FORCE TO RWANDA, TOWNSVILLE,<br />
AUGUST 1994<br />
Well let me start by saying how pleased I am to be here in Townsville. It is<br />
an occasion for great national pride to farewell the main group of the<br />
Australian Defence Force that will travel to Rwanda as part of the Australian<br />
Medical Support Force.<br />
And it is yet another example of Australia responding to an international<br />
humanitarian emergency.<br />
You see, one of the great things about this nation of ours is that it boasts a<br />
people with a profound generosity of spirit.<br />
And it is a fundamentally Australian generosity of spirit.<br />
It is a generosity of spirit that extends from what we do for our own people<br />
be it fighting floods or bushfires to what we do for those in other parts of the<br />
world who face even more devastating events like the death and violence, the<br />
disease and starvation of Rwanda.<br />
When Australians are faced with a humanitarian crisis, we respond<br />
immediately, instinctively and we do something practical.<br />
We are a nation of doers and helpers, not talkers and watchers.<br />
There are many great stories of individual Australians giving of themselves<br />
for the people of Rwanda from well known artists like John Farnham, to the<br />
Darwin nurse Judith Chappell a veteran of Cyclone Tracey who now, at 59, is<br />
making her own way to help in Rwanda. And, of course, there's the many<br />
other Australians already working with Australian and international aid<br />
agencies on the ground in Rwanda.<br />
i </p>
<p>2<br />
As a nation, Australia has responded to the crisis in Rwanda: the people of<br />
Australia have given more than $ 12 million in public appeals and the<br />
Government of Australia has given $ 10 million in humanitarian aid.<br />
Worldwide, that easily puts Australia among the top five aid donors to<br />
Rwanda. But it's not merely a question of dollars our assistance will help the<br />
Australian individuals and agencies working under enormously difficult<br />
conditions in the camps. And it will also help the United Nations to repatriate<br />
refugees and rehabilitate Rwanda with projects for its longer-term economic<br />
development. This humanitarian aid is vital. But it can not do the job by itself.<br />
What is needed just as much is the creation of conditions inside Rwanda that<br />
will encourage the refugees to return to their homes.<br />
After what so many of them have seen and experienced, it is not surprising<br />
that they are reluctant to return and suspicious of Rwandan authorities.<br />
This is where the United Nations Assistance Mission In Rwanda ( UNAMIR)<br />
comes in, and it's whe6reyou come in.<br />
You are part of a group of around 300 men and women of the Australian<br />
Defence Force who will serve in Rwanda some of you in the medical group,<br />
some of you as infantry and support personnel or in headquarters and liaison<br />
positions.<br />
Those of you who are leaving today will join the 76 members of the Australian<br />
advance party who arrived in Kigali on 8 August and who are already at work<br />
preparing the Kigali Central Hospital for your arrival.<br />
Your main job will be to provide medical support which will keep UNAMIR<br />
effective. Elements of your team will provide support to UNAMIR forces deployed<br />
outside Kigali through the provision of mobile casualty collection posts.<br />
And any of your excess capacity will be directed to helping ordinary<br />
Rwandans.<br />
The next six months will be tough. Your experiences may be unpleasant.<br />
They may be dangerous.<br />
They will certainly be different from anything most of you have encountered<br />
before. </p>
<p>But I know that you will rise to these challenges and draw great fulfilment and<br />
satisfaction from your work because that's what the members of the<br />
Australian Defence Force do.<br />
You are well trained and well prepared for your operation.<br />
And you follow in a fine tradition of outstanding Australian service to many<br />
United Nations operations, in places like Cambodia, the Middle East,<br />
Mozambique, Somalia, Cyprus and the Sinai.<br />
In all of these places, Australian service men and women have been known<br />
for the practical way they get on with their job with discipline, good humour<br />
and innovation.<br />
Each of you will be changed by what lies ahead of you. But more important<br />
than what what we do for ourselves is what we do for others what you do<br />
will help change the lives of many people in Rwanda, it will help build a future<br />
for Rwanda.<br />
It's as simple and as powerful as that.<br />
And what you do is also part of a broader national effort.<br />
At the end of the day, yours is a very practical contribution, and, for mine, that<br />
makes it a distinctly Australian contribution.<br />
On behalf of the Government and on behalf of all Australians, I want to say<br />
how proud we are of you.<br />
I want to thank you and wish you every success in the tasks before you. And<br />
a safe return to your families and loved ones when your tour of duty is over. </p>
