    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to this joint news conference between myself and the Prime Minister of Vietnam. The Prime Minister and I have had an extensive discussion and have recommitted ourselves to the further improvement of the bilateral relationship between our two countries. The people-to-people links between Australia and Vietnam are very strong, evidenced by the presence in Australia of some 200,000 of our citizens of Vietnamese heritage. I told the Prime Minister that they were making a very positive and valued contribution to modern Australian society. Trade and investment between Australia and Vietnam are both growing. We particularly welcome the growth in mining investment. Australia supports Vietnam's accession to the WTO and subject to agreement on some outstanding matters it will be possible for a bilateral understanding regarding that accession to be concluded between Australia and Vietnam. Mindful that Vietnam will host the APEC meeting at the end of 2006, I offered Australian assistance in relation to preparations by Vietnam for that gathering which offer has been accepted. And finally the Prime Minister expressed to me Vietnam's support for Australia's involvement in the East Asian Summit. Prime Minister I again and publicly this time very warmly welcome you to our country, you have been here before, this is your third visit, your second as Prime Minister and you are a valued guest of Australia.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER KHAI:</p>
<p>Thank you Prime Minister John Howard. I am delighted to come back to your beautiful country which has achieved - recorded great achievements under the leadership of your honourable Mr Prime Minister. And we're pleased to note that Mr Prime Minister has been able to fulfil his job as the Prime Minister of Australia and I would also like to congratulate you Mr Prime Minister for your election as the Prime Minister for the fourth consecutive term, which shows your leadership and great achievements under your leadership. And under your leadership the relationship between Australia and Vietnam has seen fine developments. Our cooperation has a standard to cover all political, economic trade investment, education, training and even security and defence areas. And during this visit I would also like to reaffirm to Mr Prime Minister about the need for the two countries to further deepen our friendship and comprehensive cooperation for the mutual benefits of our two countries and our two peoples. Mr Prime Minister and I have just had a very fruitful talks and through the press I would like to thank the Government of Australia for providing all the assistance for Vietnam, that have Vietnam improve people's life, reduce poverty develop, economic and social infrastructure. Also I would like to thank the Australian Government for their support to Vietnam's efforts to join WTO. Of course there remains issues that need to be further discussed between the two sides. I would like to reassure you that Vietnam will provide to Australian investors and businesses no less favourable conditions compared to other European and American businesses. And we also highly appreciate the role played by Australia in the region and the world; therefore we support Australian participation in the East Asia Summit. And as a coordinator in the ASEAN, Australia dialogue partnership we will work actively with other ASEAN member countries for this effort. Of course as you may know we have to follow the principle of consensus amongst ASEAN. I also would like to thank Mr Prime Minister and the Australian Government for the intention to assist Vietnam in hosting APEC meeting, 2006. We look forward to receiving a team from Australia in Vietnam to help us to successfully organise APEC meeting 2006. And once again to the press I also would like to convey my sincere thanks from the government and people of Vietnam to the Australian Government and people for their effective and generous assistance extended to Vietnam during the last years. And we note with satisfaction that relations between the two countries are to continue to give a lot (inaudible) in all areas. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Do we have a few, two or three questions?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible) think that Australia should sign the ASEAN treaty of amity and cooperation in order to gain an invitation to the East Asian Summit? And could I ask Prime Minister Howard to respond to your answer as well?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER KHAI:</p>
<p>I don't think so. These are two separate issues. We have nine multi-lateral negotiations in (inaudible) and with Australia we have eight bilateral negotiations already and our negotiations for WTO (inaudible) started ten years ago and at that time there was no question of East Asia Summit. I'd like to emphasise once again that we always highly appreciate the role played by Australia in the region and the world. Therefore Australia should participate in such a summit meeting and should have an important voice in that forum.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Just a moment. I don't have anything to add to that answer.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Khai when you go to Washington in your scheduled trip later this year to talk with President Bush, do you expect to further defence and strategic ties, what do you say about people who believe that is part of a wider policy of containing the power and influence of China? And could Mr Howard also comment on how Australia sees those developing defence and security links between Hanoi and Washington?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER KHAI:</p>
<p>Arrangements are now being made so that I may visit the States at the end of June.  And 30 years has passed since the end of the war.  This is the first ever visit by a leader of a unified Vietnam to the United States.  And the purpose of my visit to the United States is to elevate our relationship to a higher plane in a new situation and we don't take into the consideration as such of the factor of China.  We need to strengthen the comprehensive relationship and cooperation with the United States, we will continue to develop our neighbouring relations with China.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>When do you expect to have something definitive to say about the Amity and Co-operation Treaty?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>We're looking at that issue.  As I indicated several weeks ago the outcome of the Foreign Ministers' meeting in Cebu injected a new element.  We're in no tearing hurry to complete the examination.  It'll be looked at in a measured way.  Therefore I can't put a timeline on it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>...Douglas Wood and would you appear on Arabic TV to make your own plea for his release?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>I don't have anything to add to what has been said publicly on this issue.  I believe that it's been very carefully and sensibly handled by both Mr Downer and Senator Hill.  And most particularly by members of the Wood family in a moving and admiral fashion given the personal stress involved.  I'll give very careful thought to any advice I receive and act accordingly and beyond that I don't think it's sensible to add anything.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question about Australia's relations with Washington?  I see Michael Thawley is making his farewells. How close are you to a decision on a new Ambassador to the United States?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>I apologise for these domestic matters.  We'll make a decision quite soon on that.  But whilst on the subject can I take the opportunity of expressing my admiration for the remarkable job that Michael Thawley did as Australia's Ambassador to Washington.  He was skilful and dedicated, exceptionally professional and has taken through his efforts, and of course the efforts of others, our relationship in Washington to levels that it hasn't reached before.  He can leave his post well satisfied that he's made a major contribution to further cementing already very close relationships with our closest alliance partner.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the Treasurer continues to publicly call for an orderly leadership transition, and you and he are clearly at odds over the timing of any transition, of whether a transition should occur.  How is this affecting the Government's ability to function at the highest levels and how do you think it could be resolved?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>I gave some detailed interviews about this matter on Monday.  I don't have anything at all to what I then said.  I think we might have one more.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, are you confident you'll be attending the APEC conference in 2006 as Prime Minister of Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Next question.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, just in relation to the talks today, (inaudible) Vietnam, was there any discussion of the issue of free entry into Vietnam of Vietnamese language books, newspapers and music as a human rights and freedom of expression issue and also as potential WTO issue?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>No.  I think we might give it a rest after that.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER KHAI:</p>
<p>Thank you very much.  </p>
