PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J KEATING MP<br />
AUSTRALIA-INDONESIA AGREEMENT ON MAINTAINING SECURITY<br />
Cabinet has agreed that Australia and Indonesia will sign on Monday 18<br />
December a security agreement between our two countries.<br />
The Agreement on Maintaining Security commits the two governments to:<br />
consult at Ministerial level on a regular basis about matters affecting<br />
their common security and to develop such cooperation as would<br />
benefit their own security and that of the region;<br />
consult each other in the case of adverse challenges to either party or<br />
to their common security interests and, if appropriate, consider<br />
measures which might be taken by them individually or jointly and in<br />
accordance with the processes of each government; and<br />
promote, in accordance with the policies and priorities of each,<br />
cooperative activities in the security field.<br />
This is a serious and important step for both countries. The agreement is a<br />
significant and natural extension of the cooperation Australia and Indonesia<br />
have built in recent years through mechanisms such as the Australia-<br />
Indonesia Ministerial Forum and our collaboration on APEC. It demonstrates<br />
the confidence each of us has in the intentions of the other. But it goes<br />
beyond that to set out in formal terms for the first time our common interests<br />
in the peace and security of the region around us, and our intention to<br />
cooperate together in support of those interests.<br />
The agreement will reinforce the security of the region as a whole by<br />
demonstrating to our friends and neighbours that Australia and Indonesia will<br />
continue to build a close and cooperative relationship.<br />
It does not affect our existing international commitments. It is premised on<br />
our respect for the sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity<br />
of all countries. I 150/ S </p>
<p>Discussions about the agreement have been in progress for eighteen months.<br />
I first discussed the matter with President Soeharto in 1994. I am grateful to<br />
General Peter Gration AC, the former Chief of the Defence Force, who acted<br />
as my personal emissary in discussions with Indonesia on this agreement.<br />
Formal processes need to be completed in Australia, with the submission of<br />
the Agreement to the Executive Council for approval. I expect that to happen<br />
today.<br />
The agreement will be signed by the Foreign Ministers, Senator<br />
Gareth Evans QC and Mr Ali Alatas SH, in the presence of President<br />
Soeharto and myself. The two Defence Ministers, Senator Robert Ray and<br />
Mr Edy Sudradjat, will be present, together with the Chief of the Australian<br />
Defence Force, General John Baker AC, and the Commander-in-Chief of the<br />
Armed Forces of the Republic of Indonesia, General Feisal Tanjung.<br />
