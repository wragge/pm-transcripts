PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 13 MARCH 1990<br />
It was with deep regret that I learned of the death of<br />
Sir Reginald Wright.<br />
After serving in Tasmania's House of Assembly from<br />
1946-49, Sir Reginald served as a Senator for Tasmania<br />
from 1949-78. He was Minister for Works from 1968-72 in<br />
the Gorton and McMahon Governments.<br />
In recognition of Sir Reginald's distinguished<br />
contribution to Australia and as a mark of respect the<br />
Government will accord him a State Funeral.<br />
The service will be held in the Uniting Church, Reiby<br />
Street, Ulverstone, Tasmania on Wednesday, 14 March 1990<br />
at 2.30 pm, to be followed by interment in the Ulverstone<br />
General Cemetery.<br />
As a further mark of respect, the Australian National<br />
Flag will be flown at half mast in Tasmania and the<br />
Australian Capital Territory on Wednesday, 14 March 1990,<br />
the day of the State Funeral. 1 W<br />
