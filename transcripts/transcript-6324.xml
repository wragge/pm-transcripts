FOR MEDIA 14 February 1984<br />
Terms of reference for an enquiry by the Commonwualth Grants<br />
Commission into State tax sharing relativities have been<br />
transmitted to the Chairman of the Grants Commission, the<br />
Hon. Mr. Justice Else-Mitchell, CMG. The current arrangements<br />
for the distribution of the tax sharing and identified health<br />
grants expire at the end of June 1985.<br />
I have written to all the Premiers and the Chief Minister of<br />
the Norther: n Territory, in terms of the attached letter,<br />
advising them of the terms of reference. </p>
<p>ACTING PRIME MINISTER CANBERRA<br />
My dear Premier<br />
Thank you for your letter to the Prime Ministei. setting<br />
out your Government's views regarding the proposed<br />
review of State tax sharing relativities and the report<br />
on this matter prepared by Commonwealth, State and<br />
Territory Treasury officers.<br />
I note that there was a considerable measure of<br />
agreeme' between officials on the structure and basic<br />
content of the terms of reference for the review,<br />
although some significant differences regarding coverage<br />
and emphasis did emerg&amp;:. I note also that in providing<br />
comments, you, the other Premiers and the Chief<br />
Minister, naturally enough, sought to convey views in<br />
relation to those differences rather than the areas of<br />
agreement. Nonetheless, there was a considerable amount<br />
of common ground in the alternative terms of reference<br />
prepared by the Commonwealth and State officials.<br />
I now wish to advise you of the Commonwealth's decision<br />
to proceed with a review and attach for your<br />
information, terms of reference which have been<br />
transmitted to the Commonwealth Grants Commission by the<br />
Special Minister of State. In reaching its decision,<br />
the Commonwealth has carefully weighed up the arguments<br />
put forward by you, the other Premiers and the Chief<br />
Minister. * In palticular, I refer to the view put by<br />
several of the Premiers that there are higher priority<br />
tasks to be undertaken and that the review of<br />
relativities should therefore be deferred. While some<br />
of the issues referred to in that context are important<br />
in their own right, the Commonwealth does not consider<br />
that they give rise to a need to defer the review. it<br />
is important that Governments have available to them an<br />
independent and up to date assessment of relative State<br />
needs as a basis for negotiations on the general revenue<br />
sharing arrangements to apply beyond June 1985. / 2 </p>
<p>A major area in which all the Premiers and the Chief<br />
Minister expressed reservations related to the proposal<br />
to ask-the Grants Commission to present its assessment<br />
both inclusive and exclusive of the Northern Territory.<br />
The Commonwealth has noted the concerns of the States<br />
regarding the size of the pool of funds to be divided up<br />
if it is decided to bring the Territory into the tax<br />
sharing arrangements applying to the States after June<br />
1985. However, as th-size of the pool to be<br />
distributed will be a matter for determination at the<br />
appropriate time, the Commonwealth does not see such<br />
concerns as in themselves constituting grounds for not<br />
seeking the Commission's assessment on the two bases<br />
proposed. In that context, I need hardly emphasise that<br />
any decision on how the Territory will be treated after<br />
1984-. 85 will only be taken closer to the time and after<br />
full negotiations with all the parties involved. I have<br />
also noted the ChieZ Minister's concern that the<br />
Territory should be free to present arguments to the<br />
Commission that the Territory has needs which are not<br />
apparent in the States or which differ from those of the<br />
States. For this reason, I have inserted an additional<br />
clause in the terms of reference.<br />
The officials' report contained an agreed reference to<br />
the treatment of payments for South West Tasmania.<br />
Although the Commonwealth appreciates the concerns<br />
raised subsequently regarding this inclusion, it<br />
believes that the arrangements between the Commonwealth<br />
and Tasmania in relation to our undertakings regarding<br />
the cessation of work on the Gord3on-below-Franklin Dam<br />
have a quite special status. As a result, it does not<br />
see their proposed treatment in the review as having any<br />
wider implication~ s.<br />
Premiers expres-sed differing views on whether a<br />
paragraph dealing with business undertakings should be<br />
included in the terms of reference. I consider that the<br />
assessment of business undertakings by the Commission<br />
does raise a number of special questions of both<br />
practice and principle and I am concerned to establish<br />
as firm as possible a foundation on which judgements on<br />
the matter can be based. I have therefore decided to<br />
include a paragraph on business undertakings in the<br />
transmittal letter along the lines proposed by<br />
Commonwealth officers. I would stress, however, that<br />
this inclusion does not prejudice any decision on the<br />
appropriate basis for the assessment of tax sharing<br />
relativities. / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
rhe othet areas of differences of view that arose<br />
centred around the extent to which it is considered<br />
desirable to focus the work of the Commission.<br />
Particularly in view of the short time available to the<br />
Commission to conduct the review, Commonwealth officials<br />
took the view that it was desirable to provide some<br />
focus on issues, while State officials generally<br />
preferred an approach that would leave the Commission's<br />
approach in those areas as a matter for debate before<br />
the Commission. In general, the Commonwealth believes<br />
th. at the Commission will be able to make better use of<br />
its time if greater focus is provided in the terms of<br />
reference on these matters. Accordingly, the terms of<br />
reference have been based principally on the draft<br />
provided by Commonwealth officials. The Commonwealth<br />
believes that this will not unduly restrict the Stat1es'<br />
ability to argue their case before the Commission.<br />
You will be aware that in discussions between the<br />
Commonwealth and Queensland Governments in relation to<br />
the Medicare Agreement with that State, it has been<br />
suggested that an additional clause be included in the<br />
Terms of Reference on that issue. If it is decided in<br />
that context that an additional clause should be<br />
included, I will provide you with a copy of the revised<br />
Terms of Reference as soon as possible.<br />
1 would now ask for your full co-operation with the<br />
Commission in undertaking the review and look forward to<br />
productive negotiations with you in the first half of<br />
1985. 1 have written in similar terms to the other Premiers<br />
and the Chief Minister.<br />
Yours sincerely<br />
Lionel Bowen </p>
<p>P. TTACHMENT<br />
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR REVIEW OF TAX SHARING<br />
RELATIVITIES AND IDENTIFIED HEALTH GRANTS<br />
" Pursuant to sections 16 and 16A of the Commonwealth<br />
Grants Commission Act 1973, I hereby refer to the<br />
Commission for inquiry and report, by 31 March, 1985 at<br />
the latest, on the question of the per capita<br />
relativities for distributing tax sharing grants which<br />
the Commission would regard as appropriate to apply<br />
after 1984-85 to:<br />
a distribution of tax sharing grants among the<br />
States only; and.<br />
a distribution of tax sharing grants among the<br />
States and the Northern Territory with the Northern<br />
Territory being treated on the same basis as the<br />
States.<br />
2. The Commission's assessment should<br />
be based on the application f the principle that<br />
the respective tax sharing grants to which the<br />
States are entitled should enable each State to<br />
provide, without having to impose taxes and charges<br />
at levels appreciably different from the levels<br />
imposed by the other States, government services at<br />
standards not appreciably different from the<br />
standards provided, by the other States; and<br />
take account of<br />
differences in the capacities of the States to<br />
raise revenues; and<br />
( ii) differences in the amounts required to be<br />
expended by the States in providing government<br />
services of a comparable standard.<br />
The word State( s) in this paragraph is to be taken as<br />
also covering the Northern Territory.<br />
3. The Commission' s assessment of relative fiscal<br />
needs should be based on the years 1981-82 to 1983-84<br />
inclusive but the Commission should report on<br />
developments in relative fiscal positions over a longer<br />
period and, to the extent practicable, should indicate<br />
what allowance ( if any) might be made to State factors<br />
assessed for the period 1981-82 to 1983-84 if account<br />
were to be taken of trends over a longer period or, with<br />
respect to the 1981-82 to 1983-84 period, factors judged<br />
to be of temporary nature. </p>
<p>4. The Commission' s assessments should cover areas of<br />
revenue and government services broadly similar to those<br />
covered in its Report on States Tax Sharing and Heaalth<br />
Grants 1982.<br />
The Commission should also present its assessments<br />
in such a way as to show:<br />
factors applicable to the tax sharing grants on the<br />
basis that relative health needs are to continue to<br />
be reflected in the distribution of tax sharing<br />
grants; and<br />
factors applicable to the tax sharing grants<br />
separate from factors applicable to health grants<br />
on the basis that health grants ( that is<br />
" identified" health grants and Medicare<br />
compensation and other specific health payments)<br />
are distributed in accordance with relative health<br />
needs and that relative health needs are not<br />
reflected in the distribution of tax sharing<br />
grants.<br />
6. The Commission sh ' uld exclude from its assessments<br />
payments of financial assistance in 1983-84 that are<br />
received by Tasmania from the Commonwealth as a<br />
consequence of cessation of the Gordon-below-Franklin<br />
dam. The Commonwealth will advise the Commission when<br />
the final scope of the financial payment~ s for 1983-84<br />
has been settled. The treatment of payments for future<br />
years will be determined when the terms and scope of the<br />
financial assistance for those years have been<br />
determined." In forwarding these terms of reference the Government<br />
notes that the provisions for the payment to the States<br />
of tax sharing crants, and to the States and the<br />
Northern Territory of " identified" health grants, in the<br />
States ( Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981 ( as<br />
amended by the States ( Tax Sharing and Health Grants)<br />
Amendment Act ( No 2) 1983) do not have any legislative<br />
authority beyond 1984-85. It is therefore ex~ pected that<br />
these arrangements will be reviewed in 1984-85. The<br />
Government also notes that the arrangements for the<br />
payment to the States and the Nort~ hern Territory of<br />
grants to compensate for losses of revenue and<br />
additional costs under Medicare, details of which will<br />
be provided separately to the Commission, are scheduled<br />
to commence on 1 February 1984. They are also expected<br />
to be reviewed in 1984-85.<br />
The Government recognises that if there were to be major<br />
changes to either or both of these health funding<br />
arrangements after 1984-85, there could be implications<br />
for the appropriate distribution of tax sharing grants. </p>
<p>As regards the Northern Territory, the Government would<br />
expect the Commission to report on arguments put to it<br />
that needs exist in the Territory which are not apparent<br />
in the States or which differ from those of the States,<br />
and to report, if any such needs exist, on whether they<br />
would be best addressed in the context of the tax<br />
sharing arrangements or separately from those<br />
arrangements. In relation to business undertakings, having in mind the<br />
desirability of encouraging improved efficiency in the<br />
provision of services provided by such undertakings, the<br />
Covernment would like the Commission specifically to<br />
report on:<br />
the continued appropriateness of applying the<br />
principle of fiscal equalisation in respect of<br />
services in the nature of business undertakings;<br />
any data deficiencies or other di. fficulties in<br />
making quantitative allowances for policy and<br />
efficiency differences between the States with<br />
respect to business undertakings;<br />
whether measures might be available to improve the<br />
measurement of such differences; and<br />
the effect of a decision not to have relative needs<br />
in these areas, if quantifiable, reflected in the<br />
distribution of the grants.<br />
In asking the Commission to include 1983-84 in its<br />
assessment, the Government recognises that the<br />
availability of data may be more comprehensive for the<br />
earlier years of the assessment period. The Government<br />
has sought the assistance of the States in the timely<br />
provision ofl dat-a in respect of 1.983-84 and it has asked<br />
the Australian Statistician to do all that he can to<br />
assist the Commission with data for its inquiry.<br />
In addi-tion, the Commission is asked to indicate the<br />
extent to which Commonwealth tax sharing payments to<br />
each State in recent years ( including 1983-84) have<br />
fallen short or exceeded ( as the case may be) the amount<br />
that would have been paid had tax sharing P7. ayments been<br />
distributed among the States on the basis of the State<br />
factors recommended by the Commission.<br />
Finally, the Government asks that the Commission assist<br />
interested parties to the extent possible by again<br />
undertaking supplementary calculations to show the<br />
effects on the Commission's assessments of using<br />
different methodologies in those cases where one or more<br />
of the parties request alternative approaches to be<br />
adopted. </p>
