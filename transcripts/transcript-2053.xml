FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 41/ 1969<br />
COMMEMORATIVE AIR RACE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Commonwealth Government will give its support to<br />
a proposed air race from England to Australia to commemorate the<br />
anniversary of the historic flight by Sir Ross and Sir Keith Smith<br />
in 1919. We have offered a grant of $ 25, 000 towards the cost of<br />
the project, which the Royal Federation of Aero Clubs of Australia is<br />
planning to stage at the end of this year. The Commonwealth offer is<br />
made subject to the Federation demonstrating that it can raise<br />
sufficient finance from other sources to carry the project through<br />
successfully. The Government would also provide a trophy for the<br />
, Winning crew. Arrangements are being made to associate the air<br />
race with the celebrations of the Captain Cook Bicentenary.<br />
The a ircraft would, a s fa r as pract icable, foll ow the<br />
same route as the Smith brothers, touching into their home town of<br />
Adelaide, before going on to Sydney.<br />
