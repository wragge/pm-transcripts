    <content><![CDATA[<p>The 2015 COAG agenda will address the problem of violence against women at a national level.</p>
<p>To advise COAG on these actions and other initiatives, I have established an Advisory Panel on violence against women.</p>
<p>I am pleased that retiring Victorian Police Commissioner Mr Ken Lay APM, and the 2015 Australian of the Year, Ms Rosie Batty, have agreed to be the founding members of the panel. Further announcements regarding membership of the panel will be made in due course.</p>
<p>Building on the <em>National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children</em>, the Commonwealth will seek the agreement of all states and territories to prioritise the implementation of a national Domestic Violence Order (DVO) scheme.</p>
<p>Under the scheme, if a protection order is issued in one state, it will apply in all states. Work on a national DVO scheme commenced in 2014 and it must be a priority for COAG.</p>
<p>Development of national standards for how we intervene against perpetrators and hold them accountable will also be a priority.</p>
<p>Furthermore, COAG will consider the enactment of a national approach to dealing with online safety and the misuse of technology, so we can protect women against newer forms of abuse.</p>
<p>Every week in Australia a woman is killed by a current or former partner and one in three women over the age of 15 experience physical violence in their lifetime.</p>
<p>Important work is already being done to prevent violence and assist women. I commend those who are contributing to these efforts, however, the current system is fragmented.</p>
<p>We must ensure systems across Australia work effectively to provide better, more integrated support to women and we must simplify the complex maze of services victims of domestic and family violence are expected to navigate.</p>
<p>I was proud to launch the Second Action Plan of the <em>National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children</em> in June last year.</p>
<p>The five national priorities of the Plan, agreed by the states and territories, are:</p>
<p>·         Driving whole of community action to prevent violence;</p>
<p>·         Understanding of the diverse experiences of violence;</p>
<p>·         Supporting innovative services and integrated systems;</p>
<p>·         Improving perpetrator interventions; and</p>
<p>·         Continuing to build the evidence base.</p>
<p>All governments are determined to eliminate violence against women. Continued collaboration between the Commonwealth and the states and territories is crucial in achieving that objective.</p>
