SPEECh BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT HON.<br />
WILLIAM McMAHON, IN THE HOUSE O1 REPRESENTATIVES<br />
FOREIGN POLICY<br />
23 AUGUST 1971<br />
The speech on foreign policy by my colleague stands out in<br />
complete contrast to the superficial approach of the Opposition.<br />
To my mind, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has set out,<br />
in a responsible way, the Government's record and its attitude on the vital<br />
issues before us in the international scene. I commend him for what he has<br />
said in his first report to the House in his new portfolio.<br />
There are one or two objectives of policy I want to stress.<br />
The first is to emphasise very clearly and very simply that our foreign<br />
policy is based on the fact that our own national interest must be of paramount<br />
importance at all times.<br />
We are not going to be run around the place by anybody. We are<br />
an independent country. We will never be a satellite of any power, close though<br />
our relationships with others might be. But we must face realities.<br />
We are not a great power and we cannot play a decisive role in<br />
resolving the big issues between East and West. Nevertheless, we have a<br />
role which we play, both in the region of South-East Asia and the Pacific, and<br />
in the wider international community as well. It is up to us to play that role<br />
responsibly. Keeping in mind at all times that we have a long and honourable<br />
record for honest dealing in international affairs and that we want to live in<br />
peaceful and profitable co-existence with all. We want to achieve this<br />
objective no matter how different the political philosophies of other countries<br />
might be from ours.<br />
I believe we are achieving that objective. And I believe those who<br />
ahrtse us, our foreign affairs officers have a mature and sophisticated<br />
approach to their duties which serves Australia well.<br />
These observations need to be made because we are all conscious<br />
that this is a period of considerable change sometimes very rapid change<br />
and we must be alert to the consequences and flexible in our responses. e e / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
But we must not be pushed or panicked into new postures or<br />
adventures with unpredictable consequences smart though they may have<br />
appeared to be at the time. To the contrary, we must move forward<br />
deliberately after careful consideration of every step we take. And for<br />
good reason. Foreign policy cannot be made by a series of unthought out<br />
adventures. It must evolve from the passage of events and our own<br />
appreciation of the trends of the future and our relationships with others.<br />
We live in a world of interdependence. This goes for<br />
countries great and small. Our identification with the international<br />
world is * Our membership of the United Nations,*<br />
* Our membership of the Commonwealth of Nations<br />
* Our treaties with friendly powers and<br />
* Our association in a variety of international and<br />
regional arrangements for security, trade and<br />
economic aid.<br />
In this complex of relationships we have made some important<br />
advances in recent months as the Foreign Minister has pointed out. They have<br />
been dealt with fully and effectively. I will not go over the ground again.<br />
But there is a second matter I want to raise in the context<br />
of a foreign p olicy debate. This is the wa we conduct our foreign<br />
policy. No medium power like Australia can negotiate effectively<br />
in sensitive areas of international relations in the full glare of the<br />
spotlights. The pursuit of our foreign relations depends on frank and<br />
confidential exchanges with many countries. We have to respect their<br />
confidences as we expect them to respect ours. We do not peddle the<br />
gossip of the diplomatic cocktail rounds in the capitals of the world.<br />
The credibility of a government in its international dealings<br />
depends heavily on the sanctity of its undertakings and the security of the<br />
confidences given to it by others. No considerations of party politics must<br />
be allowed to compromise this credibility. The conventions for<br />
international conduct must be high and responsible.<br />
I deplore the failure of the Opposition to respect these<br />
conventions. I deplore the recent antics of the Leader of the Opposition<br />
when he led a delegation to some of the countries of Asia, notably to the<br />
People's Republic of China. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
I remind Honourable Members that the Leader of the opposition went to China<br />
to play politics with wheat. He fou-d himself declaring, on behalf of his Party, a<br />
foreign policy for Australia that was not withiin-his power to implement. It was not the<br />
policy of the elected Government of Australia. It is a policy in conflict with our<br />
national interest. And very much so very much in line with the policy of the greatest<br />
communist power in Asia.<br />
I do not complain about the action of the Chinese Leaders. They, too, have<br />
a national interest to promote and have obviously done so.<br />
wit meBut what I do call into question and I believe a majority of Australians agree<br />
wit me-is that, at a time when the Governmeat was in contact with the Chinese seeking<br />
to open up a dialogue, a full surrender to Peking's point of view was made publicly by<br />
the Leader of the Opposition.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition did not come back with any assurance of future<br />
wheat sales. He didn't come back with anything except defensive responses and<br />
evasive answers to those who criticised<br />
His conduct<br />
The concessions he volunteered in Peking and<br />
The gratuitous advice he offered to other countries.<br />
He did, of course, come out of China saying that the Chinese Government was<br />
quite willing to participate in any renewed Geneva Conference.<br />
Chou En-Lai has just made a categorical denial, saying there is no question of<br />
such a conference. The official Chinese press has also described talk about a new<br />
Geneva conference as " a sheer fraud which is ridiculous and absurd."<br />
This surely tests the credibility of the Leader of the Opposition.<br />
Mr. Speaker, we are seeking as a Government to establish better relations with<br />
the People's Republic of China. In concert with our friends we hope she will join in<br />
the efforts of the countries of our region and the broader international community to<br />
promote peace and prosperity for all peoples in accordance with the Bandung principle<br />
to which Chou En-Lai himself has publicly subscribed.<br />
We want to see this happen. And we will make our contribution where we can.<br />
We will do so without sacrificing one single part of our national interest. And we will<br />
try to achieve this objective while retaining an honourable position with our friends<br />
and allies. I remind the House again that there is no sudden short cut to normal relations<br />
with China as history so clearly shows, particularly Soviet and Chinese history.<br />
Patience and hard-headed negotiation are needed.<br />
The process is not one that will require, on our part, spectacular public<br />
gestures or instant decisions. / 4 </p>
<p>And this problem must be considered in the total context it is important, I<br />
think, to see our own position clearly against the background of the forthcoming<br />
meeting of the United Nations and the planned visit to Peking by President Nixon before<br />
May of next year.<br />
The Government's policy on representation in the United Nations of the People's<br />
Republic of China and of Taiwan has already been stated in this IHouse during the<br />
course of thi 3 debate.<br />
I have said it was inevitable and right that China should be a member of the<br />
United Nations and should hold the permanent seat in the Security Council. I have also<br />
said that we believed the Republic of China Taiwan should be given the chance of<br />
maintaining its membership if it so desired.<br />
In the final result these are matters for collective decision by the United<br />
Nations. There has been a lot of talk about there being only one China and that Taiwan<br />
is a Province of China. But when the Leader of the Opposition states this proposition<br />
he evades the fact that there are two Governments each controlling a certain area with<br />
a certain population and each claiming to be the Government of the whole of China.<br />
And he would put a seal of legality on the forceful takeover of 14 million people<br />
by a Government they do not want. He obviously does not understand that acceptance<br />
of the idea that Taiwan is a province of China implies that force can be used to restor e<br />
control by China without invoking United Nations assistance.<br />
The de facto situation is that neither the P. R. C. nor the R. 0. C. exercises<br />
administrative control over all the territories they claim. While this situation exists<br />
where two Governments are in political and jurisdictional conflict third countries are<br />
free to recognise whichever Government they choose.<br />
Australia has for many years recognised the Taiwan Government the Republic<br />
of China and in 1966 completed the formalities by establishing an embassy there.<br />
Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition has alleged publicly that the decision<br />
to send an Australian Ambassador to Taipeh was arranged by the late Mr. Holt as<br />
Prime Minister without the knowledge of his Foreign Minister of the day then Mr.-<br />
now Sir Paul Hasluck.<br />
This is utterly untrue. This is the second test of the Leader of the Opposition's<br />
credibility. The decision was made by the Cabinet of the day. It is on record and beyond<br />
dispute. This then is our position.<br />
I believe it is in our national interest first to have a collective decision by the<br />
United Nations on the admission of the People's Republic of China and the status of the<br />
Republic of China of Taiwan.<br />
When representation in the United Nations is clarified we shall be better placed<br />
to examine the problems of recognition and diplomatic relations with Peking. </p>
<p>In his various public statements the Leader of the Opposition has endeavoured<br />
to suggest that the whole of South-East Asia is about to go or should go cap in<br />
hiand to Peking. The truth is that South-East Asian countries are moving with caution<br />
as we are., They realise the desirability of adjusting to changing circumstances in Asia<br />
and the likely entry this year or next of Peking into the United Nations.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition has said the Canadian formula is the one his<br />
Party would adopt for immediate recognition of China. This doesn't make sense because<br />
the espousal of any formula now would prejudge events yet to take place in the<br />
United Nations. And in any case only a naive person would set out what he would finally<br />
accept as his first position in any negotiation.<br />
The Canadian formula " notes" China's claim to Taiwan. In his statement on<br />
the subject the Canadian Minister of State for External Affairs ( Mr. Mitchell Sharp)<br />
said Canada had made it clear to the Chinese from the start of their negotiations " that<br />
the Canadian Government does not consider it appropriate either to endorse or to<br />
challenge the Chinese Government' s position on the status of Taiwan.<br />
But Mr. Whitlam, while adopting the Canadian formula as his own, also concedes<br />
Taiwan to China. And, as I have said, by so doing does not exclude the use of force in<br />
the resolution of this issue by the Chinese.<br />
For reasons I have mentioned there is no need to rush into recognition.<br />
Mr. Whitlam has said " we must accept the view of President Nixon that<br />
diplomatic relations must be normalised as speedily as possible. I have no knowledge<br />
that the President or his Administration have said that at all. This is the third test<br />
of credibility. They, like us, have declared their attitude on China's admission to the United<br />
Nations. And they, like us, are seeking a dialogue in their bilateral relationship.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition, on his recent ill-starred journey, not only<br />
dismissed the future fate of the people of Taiwan in a most casual manner. He also<br />
took upon himself the role of publicly declaring the policy Japan should adopt about her<br />
treaty with Taiwan.<br />
I quote his own words at the National Press Club here in Canberra.<br />
" We should be the first to point out to Japan that she is not in<br />
honour or reason irrevocably tied to a treaty forced on her<br />
when she was weak and dependent... we should say to her that<br />
she is now entitled to pursue her own interests which require<br />
a restoration of relations with China.<br />
That is the Leader of the Opposition brashly telling one of the great powers<br />
of Asia and one that is likely to be, in the foreseeable future, a dominant power<br />
what it should do. Japan, I emphasise, is a very great trading partner of ours and<br />
one with whom we are associated in many regional activities. </p>
<p>This kind of advice disregards~ Australia's -interest by assuming at once that it<br />
is to our advantage for China and Japan to m-ve into a close relationship. It also<br />
racks of interference in the internal affairs of Japan. Who are we to say " Japan is<br />
now entitled to pursue her own interests?"<br />
In fact it looks precisely the kind of negotiating position China herself could<br />
take up towards Japan. In short, the Leader of the Opposition urges Japan to tear up<br />
her treaty with Taiwan and do business with China.<br />
That any Member of this Parliament should seriously advocate such action is<br />
utterly deplorable in the context of our national interest. It displays either ignorance<br />
of international relations or a cynical opportunism towards international agreements.<br />
It implies that international agreements such as A. N. Z. U. S. which is the<br />
corner-stone of our security are expendable scraps of paper.<br />
This is the first time in Australia's history that a Leader of the Opposition<br />
has been the total advocate of another country's cause. It is a dangerous policy to<br />
this country. Let me quote some editorial comment from a leading newspaper in Asia.<br />
The Singapore edition of " The Straits Times" on 14 July said this and I quote<br />
" The Australian Government is ready to discuss diplomatic relations with<br />
Peking and though recognition may be a long way off ( Mr. McMahon's<br />
phrase) the intention is sincere and the endeavour is not assisted by<br />
the Labor Party mission'is extraordinary behaviour . it is one thing<br />
for Mr. Whitlam to campaign in Australia for radical policy changes,<br />
but quite another to play Party politics openly in Peking. This is<br />
irresponsibility of a high order.<br />
Mr. Speaker, a great deal has happened since then.<br />
The fact that President Nixon and Premier Chou En-Lai have agreed to meet<br />
in Peking some time before May of next year has added a new dirnens ion to the<br />
international debate on China.<br />
The United Nations will meet next month, and in our contacts with China there<br />
has been some clarification of each other's viewpoints. I have no dramatic forecasts<br />
to make on what the future holds. It is difficult to see how Australia can have more than<br />
a marginal influence on American-Chinese relations.<br />
Because America is a super-power and China a great power I think it may be<br />
inevitable that they will treat on a bilateral basis on the big issues. [ I saying this I<br />
do not intend to suggest that we expect to have no exchanges of views with America<br />
on all issues of common interest.<br />
It is part of the practice of our diplomacy to keep in close, continuing touch<br />
with America and our other friends, particularly in the Asian and Pacific region. This<br />
they encourage and this we will continue to do. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
And I emphasise what I said when I began. We will base our action on two<br />
principles Australia's national interest comes first at all times.<br />
And our diplomatic conduct accords with the highest<br />
conventions of honourable dealing and respect for<br />
the rights of others.<br />
A clear understanding of the Leader of the Opposition's actions during . his<br />
Peking visit makes it extremely difficult to reconcile them with these principles.<br />
