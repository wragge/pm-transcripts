    <content><![CDATA[<p>In March of this year, at the Oration to the Centre for Corporate Public Affairs, I announced that the government would establish a new body to promote partnerships and philanthropy in Australia.</p>
<p>It is with great pleasure that today I announce the membership of the PrimeÂ Ministerâs Community Business Partnership, which I will chair.</p>
<p>The Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Jocelyn Newman, will be Deputy Chairman.</p>
<p>I am delighted that eleven prominent Australians have agreed to be part of this ground breaking initiative. The Partnership will play an important role in developing a new social coalition for Australia by fostering new partnerships between community, government and business. It will also broker major philanthropic and partnership efforts, and provide a source of innovative and creative approaches to meeting needs within our community.</p>
<p>The inclusion of four members - Elizabeth Cham from Philanthropy Australia, David Gonski of Wentworth Associates, Patrick McClure of Mission Australia and Fergus Ryan from Arthur Andersen â who have previously contributed to the Business and Community Partnerships Roundtable which I convened in March 1998 will provide an important level of continuity.</p>
<p>Brisbaneâs Archbishop Peter Hollingworth and the Rev Dr Gordon Moyes of the Wesley Mission will bring a depth of understanding and experience of community needs.</p>
<p>Richard Pratt of the Pratt Foundation and Robert Gerard of Gerard Industries have for many years provided strong leadership in development of philanthropy in Australia.</p>
<p>Marina Darling from the CapoNero Group, Jim Kennedy of the Queensland Investment Corporation and Tony Howarth of the Challenge Bank, Western Australia will provide a business and financial perspective.</p>
<p>I am also pleased to announce the appointment of a Chief Executive Officer, Ms Geraldine Skinner, to support the Partnership. From the well-known Clean-up Australia campaign, Ms Skinner brings a wealth of experience to the position, having worked in government, education, and with both community and corporate organisations.</p>
<p>The development of a new social coalition is a source of great satisfaction to me, and without doubt, will have an important impact on the future of our communities.</p>
<p>In consultation with the members of this new body, I will schedule an early first meeting, where work can begin to take this exciting initiative forward. I look forward to working with them to build new Partnerships and a stronger philanthropic culture in Australia.</p>
