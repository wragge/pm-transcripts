EMBARGOED: CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY * JjjAUSTHALIA L<br />
FOR PRESS APRIL 8, 1976<br />
EXPENDITURE COM4MITTEE<br />
The establishment of un expenditure committee marks an important<br />
step in the Government's policy of strengthening the parliamentary<br />
sys temn.<br />
It is fundamental to an effe~ ctive syst,,. m of representative<br />
Government that the peoples representatives should be able to<br />
adequately supervise and review the activities of Government<br />
administration. The Parliament should be able to subject policy, legislation<br />
and administration to close and effective scrutiny.<br />
Du ' ring. the last election campaign the Governmen-t stated its<br />
vie-w that the capacity of parliament, and particularly this<br />
House, to scrutinis the estimates of expenditure should be<br />
improved.<br />
The absence oz an effective mechanism for examining proposals<br />
may well have "-ontributed to the enormous inefficiency in<br />
expenditure in the last three years.<br />
The ultimate control of Parl. iament over the Executive and its<br />
control over, and scrutiny of, the expenditure of money.<br />
This is a fundamental prin. ciple of democracy which this Government<br />
recognises. It is a principle whose expression will be strengthened by the<br />
proposal for an expenditure committee.<br />
The proposal for an Expenditure Committee arises from a<br />
broader concern of the Government to improve the functioning<br />
of our political institutions.<br />
our historic plan to reform the Federal system by increasing the<br />
financial independence of State and Local Government arises out<br />
of our deep concern at the growing centralisation of power in<br />
the Federal Government.<br />
Our reforms will make participation in Government at State and<br />
Federal levels more effective. ./ 2 </p>
<p>Our policy of tax indexation will once more mean that tax increases<br />
will have to be justified to the public, instead of simply taking<br />
place without debate as a result of inflation.<br />
The Expenditure Committee will greatly improve the capacity of<br />
this House to scrutinize public expenditure and improve<br />
Parliament's capacity to act as an able and effective watchdog<br />
over the affairs of the Government.<br />
The work of such a Committee will have an obvious value during a<br />
period when the Government is especially concerned to minimise<br />
waste and maximise efficiency in Government expenditure./<br />
At the present time this House does not have adequate machinery to<br />
examine the crucial process of formation of the estimates.<br />
It is not appropriate that existing detailed Parliamentary scrutiny<br />
should be confined to the Senate Estimates Committee and to a<br />
Joint Committee the-Public Accounts Committee.<br />
The Senate Estimates Committee examines the Appropriation Bills<br />
but in a short time frame.<br />
The Public Accounts Committee operates within rather broadly<br />
defined terms of reference, but has a focus mainly on accounts<br />
or past expenditure.<br />
There is a need for greater in-depth examination of public<br />
expenditure in relation to effectiveness and economy in the delivery<br />
of . given Government policy.<br />
An Expenditure Committee of the House of Representatives would<br />
conduct its investigations throughout the year.<br />
It would therefore have an opportunity to explore more deeply<br />
selected areas of Government activity particularly in relation<br />
to efficiency in the implementation or delivery of policy.<br />
Over a number of years an Expenditure Committee would add to<br />
knowledge and understanding within the Parliament in . a way that<br />
has not been achieved by existing committees.<br />
The Committee would not examine the Government's policies. it<br />
would rather be concerned to investigate economy and effectiveness<br />
in the implementation of such policies and matters related to the<br />
formation of estimates of expenditure.<br />
It is not proposed at this stage to make any change in the charter<br />
of the Public Accounts Committee, though this would be kept under<br />
review as the Expenditure Committee develops recognising that<br />
there is potential for overlap. The initial work of the Expenditure<br />
Committee will necessarily be on an exploratory nature.<br />
The Committee might conduct its first examination in an area where<br />
greater support could be given in terms of data availability.<br />
The Terms of Reference for the Committee are almost identical to<br />
those of the House of Commons Expenditure Committee. / 3 </p>
<p>Close examination of the Terms of Reference of the Commons<br />
Committee led us to the view that those terms, based on the<br />
extensive experience of that Chamber, well expressed the scope<br />
of matters the Expenditure Committee here might consider.<br />
It seemed to us desirable to take advantage of this experience.<br />
The Committee's Terms of Reference require it to:<br />
Consider any papers on public expenditure presented<br />
to this House and such of the estimates as it sees fit<br />
to examine<br />
Consider how,-if at all, policies implied in the figures<br />
of expenditure and in the estimates may be carried out<br />
more economically.<br />
Examine the relationship between the costs and benefits<br />
of implementing Government programmes<br />
Inquire into and report on any question in connection<br />
with public expenditure which is referred to it by this<br />
House.<br />
It is for the Committee itself to decide the papers or aspects<br />
of papers which it will examine in depth and the nature of its<br />
reports to the House, subject to the power of the House to direct<br />
its attention to particular matters.<br />
In order to carry out detailed examination, it would probably seek<br />
to cover only a limited number of major areas of Government activities<br />
each year.<br />
It might take several years for the Committee to be able to cover<br />
in its reports all areas of Government activity.<br />
But the very fact of the existence of the Committee and lack of<br />
knowledge of the area which the Committee will investigate next<br />
will have its own salutary effect.<br />
The Committee would be expected to-give due r-egard to the restraints<br />
on expenditure faced by Parliamentary Departments, particularly in<br />
relation to specialist staff.<br />
The resolution ( Clause 2) includes the Chairman of the Joint<br />
Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts as a member ex-officio<br />
of the Expenditure-Committee. The Charman of the Expenditure<br />
Committee will be a member ex-officio of the Parliamentary.<br />
Committee of Public Accounts.<br />
The Committee having resolved that it will inquire into a<br />
particular aspect, the Committee or a Sub-Committee could request<br />
the Department( s) and/ or other Commonwealth bodies responsible<br />
to prepare for it a written submission in a form which it specifies.<br />
Where appropriate other bodies such as the Treasury and the<br />
Public Service Board might be asked to contribute written submissions<br />
also the Committee would of course be free to accept submissions<br />
from any source. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Under the Terms of Reference the Committee can examine expenditure<br />
of all Commonwealth bodies including business undertakings.<br />
If circumstances arose it would be possible to exempt by resolution<br />
particular business or other bodies from examination.<br />
There will be occasions where programmes being examined by the<br />
Committee are delivered through State and/ or Local Government or<br />
where the Committee sees a need to consider the relationship<br />
between delivery of Commonwealth programmes and of related State<br />
or Local Government programmes.<br />
Other than in exceptional circumstances the Committee should<br />
operate within the framework of data and evidence drawn from the<br />
Commonwealth's own administration.<br />
I propose to draw the attention of State Premiers to the establishmen<br />
of the Committee.<br />
If accepted, this resolution will establish the Committee. -I would<br />
hope that within the term of this Parliament its continuing<br />
existence will be assured by appropriate amendment to the standing<br />
orders. The Committee will of course control its own operations.<br />
I have during the course of my speech made a number of suggestions<br />
as to how the Committee might operate.<br />
Again not wishing to constrict., the Committee I seek leave to<br />
inc'lude in Hansard operational : guidelines amplifying the Government's<br />
views as to how it might seek to perform its important task.<br />
I have no doubt that this reform in the procedures of the House<br />
will come to be seen as an important step in the historic<br />
reassertion by the Parliament of its right to control the Government':<br />
expenditure. In recent times Parliament's role hasbeen challenged by attempts<br />
of the Executive to minimize Parliamentary scrutiny of key<br />
expenditure proposals.<br />
There should now fortunately be no doubt that the control of<br />
expenditure lies with the Parliament that is the ultimate<br />
protection of our democratic system.<br />
in this context the proposal to establish an Expenditure Committee<br />
is a significant reflection of current concerns.<br />
It marks the Government's desire to undertake a programme of<br />
constructive reform which will strengthen our democratic institutions<br />
and control by the people over the activities of Government. </p>
