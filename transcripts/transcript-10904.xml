    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE........................................................................................................</p>
<p>.... I do want to say a number of things tonight about the economic</p>
<p>   and the strategic agenda that my government has, and I want to touch</p>
<p>   upon some of the issues that no doubt you have touched upon during</p>
<p>   your conference, but it is also appropriate that I say one or two</p>
<p>   words about the very disturbing developments within Indonesia, because</p>
<p>   the relationship between Australia and Indonesia is one of tremendous</p>
<p>   significance to the future of our country.</p>
<p>In direct economic terms trade with Indonesia only accounts for</p>
<p>   about two and a half per cent of Australia's total world trade,</p>
<p>   but there's little doubt that the relationship between Australia</p>
<p>   and what is our nearest neighbour, and a very large country, the</p>
<p>   sixth most populous country in the world, is of enormous significance</p>
<p>   to our strategic future. We view what is occurring in Indonesia</p>
<p>   as a matter of very, very deep concern. It is of course for the</p>
<p>   people of Indonesia to resolve the identity of the government of</p>
<p>   Indonesia. It is not for the head of government in Australia, or</p>
<p>   representatives of the Australian government to give public advice</p>
<p>   about who should be in charge of foreign countries. It is our role</p>
<p>   to be a helpful neighbour and a good friend in a time of difficulty</p>
<p>   and Australia has certainly been that.</p>
<p>One of the things that I resolved to do when I became Prime Minister</p>
<p>   was to ensure that there was a proper balance in Australia's</p>
<p>   foreign relations between the nations of the Asia-Pacific, the nations</p>
<p>   of Europe and North America. I thought, without being ultra-critical</p>
<p>   of my predecessor, that there was perhaps too much of an obsession</p>
<p>   with what I described as an Asia only approach by the former government.</p>
<p>   And I set out in no way to reduce our links with the Asia-Pacific</p>
<p>   region, but to supplement them by consolidating our links with other</p>
<p>   parts of the world. But one of the things that we were determined</p>
<p>   to do within the embrace of that approach was to continue very close</p>
<p>   relations with Indonesia. And in her time of great economic difficulty,</p>
<p>   Australia has been a very good friend. Along with Japan, Australia</p>
<p>   is the only country in the world which has contributed to the three</p>
<p>   IMF rescue packages in the Asia-Pacific region. We've also</p>
<p>   provided other assistance to Indonesia. Because it is in our direct</p>
<p>   national interest to do so. And the amount of difficulty that the</p>
<p>   adjustment required of Indonesia by the International Monetary Fund</p>
<p>   is imposing upon the people of that country, particularly the poor</p>
<p>   of that nation, is a matter of concern.</p>
<p>But in looking at what is unfolding in Indonesia we shouldn't</p>
<p>   lose sight of the fact that that country has made remarkable strides</p>
<p>   over the past twenty or thirty years. The level of absolute poverty</p>
<p>   in Indonesia has been dramatically reduced over that period of time</p>
<p>   and the economic performance of the country has improved enormously.</p>
<p>   It is going through an enormous amount of pain and suffering at</p>
<p>   present, and I think it needs as a people the understanding and</p>
<p>   the sympathy and the practical response of the Australian nation.</p>
<p>   But by the same token we must recognise that the forces of individual</p>
<p>   liberty and the desire for political freedom are very strong forces</p>
<p>   within any nation and in the end as we know from our own experience,</p>
<p>   they are forces that can never be kept back and in the end they</p>
<p>   must be recognised and given effect to. And I just want to say to</p>
<p>   you that naturally the Australian government will follow very closely</p>
<p>   all of the events as they unfold. We have a priority of course in</p>
<p>   terms of the safety of Australian citizens in Indonesia, we want</p>
<p>   to remain a good and enduring friend of the Indonesian people, and</p>
<p>   that is something that, a view we hold irrespective of the identity</p>
<p>   of those who may be in charge of that country from time to time.</p>
<p>Your conference has been ladies and gentlemen about the challenge</p>
<p>   of leadership, and I thought coming up in the plane this afternoon,</p>
<p>   that I would share a few thoughts with you about how I see the role</p>
<p>   of political leadership, particularly in the economic policy area.</p>
<p>   And drawing upon some of the experiences that I've had in the</p>
<p>   now almost 24 years that I've been a member of the national</p>
<p>   parliament. I've seen over that period of time a number of</p>
<p>   major challenges for change and reform and forward looking attitudes</p>
<p>   in the economic management of our country.</p>
<p>There have been many big changes in the way in which the Australian</p>
<p>   economy operates over the past quarter of a century, and when one</p>
<p>   reflects on what the Australian economy was like in 1974 and compare</p>
<p>   it with what the Australian economy is now, there have been some</p>
<p>   very dramatic changes. Of course 1974 was the beginning of the enormous</p>
<p>   change that the Australian economy experienced when we moved away</p>
<p>   from that period of an almost unending boom that followed the early</p>
<p>   years of the 1950s, through to the onset of the oil shock and all</p>
<p>   the other world economic turbulence in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>And I developed after a few years in Parliament a view that there</p>
<p>   are a number of fundamental areas of reform that were needed to</p>
<p>   be undertaken and would require political leadership on both sides</p>
<p>   of Australian politics to achieve. And I think it is fair to say</p>
<p>   that we should give the system, and this includes both sides of</p>
<p>   politics, and it also includes the contribution of the business</p>
<p>   community of Australia, we should give the system some credit for</p>
<p>   having achieved a remarkable amount of reform over that period of</p>
<p>   time. When we think of how regulated and cloistered the Australian</p>
<p>   financial system was in the middle 1970s. When then had, when I</p>
<p>   was Treasurer, the establishment of the Campbell Committee of enquiry</p>
<p>   into the financial system. We had some of the reforms recommended</p>
<p>   by that Committee implemented by the former Coalition government,</p>
<p>   but a large number of them also implemented by the Labor government</p>
<p>   that replaced the Fraser government in 1983. And I might say those</p>
<p>   reforms were implemented by the then Treasurer Mr Keating with the</p>
<p>   enthusiastic bipartisan support of the then Opposition. And I'm</p>
<p>   very proud of the fact that in Opposition between 1983 and 1996</p>
<p>   I was able, and a number of my colleagues were able in the various</p>
<p>   roles that we occupied, we were able to argue for and articulate</p>
<p>   from Opposition the need for economic reform and to play a very</p>
<p>   constructive role with those in the former Labor government who</p>
<p>   were also interested in economic reform.</p>
<p>Mr Keating found it easier to implement financial deregulation</p>
<p>   because he had our assistance. The former Labor government found</p>
<p>   it easy to privatise the Commonwealth Bank and the old Australian</p>
<p>   Airlines, because he had our assistance. And it's fair to say</p>
<p>   that in the political process, Oppositions have responsibility as</p>
<p>   well as governments. Now that I think when you look back over that</p>
<p>   period of time I think we can all give ourselves some credit for</p>
<p>   the tremendous strides that were made in the area of financial deregulation.</p>
<p>Moving to the area of industry protection which has long been an</p>
<p>   area of some controversy within economic and political debate in</p>
<p>   Australia, it's fair to say that the Australian economy now</p>
<p>   is an infinitely more open and less protected economy than what</p>
<p>   it was in the 1970s. And although I acknowledge that there can be</p>
<p>   a variety of views about the level of tariff protection in particular</p>
<p>   industries, and I would be the first to acknowledge that there is</p>
<p>   no such thing literally speaking as a level playing field anywhere</p>
<p>   in the world, and that there is no such thing as perfect free trade</p>
<p>   anywhere in the world, and every nation has its own blind spots</p>
<p>   when it comes to particular industries and particular areas of economic</p>
<p>   activity. We have as a nation become a lot more open and I think</p>
<p>   we are the better and we are the stronger for that. And the programme</p>
<p>   of tariff reform that was undertaken during the 1980s has been of</p>
<p>   enormous benefit to the Australian economy and to the Australian</p>
<p>   people.</p>
<p>Of course an area with which I strongly identified myself a few</p>
<p>   years ago, indeed for many of the years that I was in Opposition,</p>
<p>   was the cause of industrial relations reform. And I think of all</p>
<p>   of the areas of institutional rigidity that was still largely left</p>
<p>   untouched when the Coalition government was elected in 1996, industrial</p>
<p>   relations was the outstanding example. And a number of us in Opposition,</p>
<p>   and I know many people in this audience, also played a role in it,</p>
<p>   fought a very long and ultimately successful campaign to change</p>
<p>   the mindset not only of the Australian community but also of sections</p>
<p>   of the business community towards the industrial relations system</p>
<p>   of this country.</p>
<p>And we now have a system which is fundamentally very different</p>
<p>   from that which obtained twenty years ago. We have a system which</p>
<p>   is built very substantially on the notion of direct relations between</p>
<p>   employers and employees at the workplace level. It is not a system</p>
<p>   which is built on a rejection of trade unions, it is not a system</p>
<p>   which says that people should not have the absolute right to join</p>
<p>   or not to join a trade union. Rather it is a system that recognises</p>
<p>   that the association at a workplace level between employers and</p>
<p>   employees is infinitely more important than membership of the institutions</p>
<p>   on both sides of labour and of capital and I think as the years</p>
<p>   go by the changes in that industrial relations area will be seen</p>
<p>   to have been of enormous benefit to our country.</p>
<p>That of course allows me to say something about the issue of waterfront</p>
<p>   reform. I don't think there is any area of industrial relations</p>
<p>   activity which has been more in need of fundamental change and reform</p>
<p>   than the Australian waterfront. Much has been said and written about</p>
<p>   the waterfront over the past few weeks, and much water is yet to</p>
<p>   flow under the bridge. Let me simply say to you that the government</p>
<p>   remains absolutely and totally committed to the cause of waterfront</p>
<p>   reform. And I also want to take the opportunity as Prime Minister</p>
<p>   of warmly congratulating and expressing my total support for the</p>
<p>   role that my Industrial Relations Minister, Peter Reith, has played</p>
<p>   in conducting the government's case and prosecuting the government's</p>
<p>   cause in the area of industrial relations reform.</p>
<p>Let me also say that our goal has been to reform the Australian</p>
<p>   waterfront and make it more efficient because that is in Australia's</p>
<p>   national interest. And we have also had as a goal the removal of</p>
<p>   compulsory unionism on the Australian waterfront because we also</p>
<p>   regard that as being in Australia's national interest. It has</p>
<p>   never been our goal, despite what some have said, to destroy the</p>
<p>   Maritime Union of Australia. It has never been our goal to remove</p>
<p>   unionists from the Australian waterfront. And by any measure, and</p>
<p>   I won't bore you with statistics tonight, the Australian waterfront's</p>
<p>   current state demands fundamental reform. And we intend to stick</p>
<p>   with it, we intend to go the distance to achieve that very important</p>
<p>   and that very fundamental reform.</p>
<p>There are of course one or two areas where reform is yet to occur.</p>
<p>   And I think there is little doubt that the area which is most in</p>
<p>   need of reform and which is an area that I have frequently described</p>
<p>   as comprising the greatest area of unfinished economic reform business</p>
<p>   in Australia is of course the cause of reforming Australia's</p>
<p>   taxation system.</p>
<p>Over the years a number of attempts have been made. I've been</p>
<p>   in it long enough to sort of be open enough to reflect on the attempts</p>
<p>   that have been made on both sides of politics over the last 18 or</p>
<p>   20 years to bring about change. I had a go or two when I was Treasurer</p>
<p>   in the former Coalition government, and didn't succeed. Mr</p>
<p>   Keating had a go when he was Treasurer in the Hawke government,</p>
<p>   and I must say that he received a great deal of support from me</p>
<p>   as the Opposition economic spokesman, but he was unsuccessful. And</p>
<p>   then John Hewson as Leader of the Opposition, quite courageously</p>
<p>   and with a great deal of support from many in the community also</p>
<p>   attempted it from Opposition before the 1993 election. And on that</p>
<p>   occasion Mr Keating ran a very negative and destructive, but in</p>
<p>   political terms albeit short-term political terms, he ran a very</p>
<p>   successful negative campaign and destroyed Fightback and was re-elected</p>
<p>   in 1993.</p>
<p>We now have what I regard as the last great opportunity in the</p>
<p>   foreseeable future to reform Australia's taxation system. If</p>
<p>   we fluff it on this occasion, if it is defeated on this occasion</p>
<p>   by essentially negative, short-sighted attitudes, then I don't</p>
<p>   think the opportunity is going to come our way again for a number</p>
<p>   of years. The circumstances at the moment for fundamental taxation</p>
<p>   reform are as good as they will ever be. We have a very low rate</p>
<p>   of inflation, we have quite solid economic growth, we have a greater</p>
<p>   recognition within the Australian community of the essential unfairness</p>
<p>   of the present system and we also have I think a more mature approach</p>
<p>   from the spokesmen representing the welfare lobby than we've</p>
<p>   had in recent years. And I want to congratulate the business community,</p>
<p>   I particularly want to congratulate John Ralph and Stan Wallis and</p>
<p>   many others here tonight who've played such a very constructive</p>
<p>   role in trying to represent the legitimate view of business to the</p>
<p>   government about the need for reform.</p>
<p>At the end of the day it will fall to my government and a small</p>
<p>   group of senior ministers within the government to decide the final</p>
<p>   shape of the package. But we have been greatly aided by what you've</p>
<p>   put to us and we've been greatly encouraged by the way in which</p>
<p>   you have sought to establish a constructive understanding with the</p>
<p>   welfare sector. Because fairness and equity is very important. You</p>
<p>   won't sell to the Australian people fundamental tax reform</p>
<p>   unless they believe it is fundamentally fair. In all the years I've</p>
<p>   been in politics, I've had a very strong view that you can</p>
<p>   sell fundamental reform, you can persuade the Australian people</p>
<p>   of the need to change something that they've had for a long</p>
<p>   time if you satisfy two conditions. The first of those conditions</p>
<p>   is that you've got to persuade them that it's in Australia's</p>
<p>   interests, because at the end of the day they are a patriotic lot</p>
<p>   and they do worry about the future of the country. And the second</p>
<p>   thing you've got to do is you've got to persuade them</p>
<p>   that it's fair. In other words that those who need protection</p>
<p>   are protected, and that those who've been getting away with</p>
<p>   rorting the system through whatever device are prevented by the</p>
<p>   change from doing so into the future. And they are the two conditions.</p>
<p>   And I believe that we can achieve both of those objectives.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that the case in the national interest for reforming</p>
<p>   the tax system is overwhelming. A new taxation system would of course</p>
<p>   greatly boost the prospect of Australian exports. A new taxation</p>
<p>   system would even-out the bumps that now exist in our totally outdated</p>
<p>   wholesale taxation system. A taxation system that reforms many of</p>
<p>   the mechanisms that now affect business operations would also be</p>
<p>   of general benefit to the business community. A reform that recognises</p>
<p>   that in 1956 when I left school you were only paying the top marginal</p>
<p>   rate of tax if you earnt something like 18 times average weekly</p>
<p>   earnings, and by the year 2000 if we leave the current system untouched,</p>
<p>   you'll be paying the top marginal rate of tax at one and a</p>
<p>   quarter times average weekly earnings, and that is a taxation system</p>
<p>   that cries aloud for fundamental reform.</p>
<p>But in the process of making the change and introducing the reform</p>
<p>   we must of course ensure that there is a proper level of protection</p>
<p>   for the less fortunate in our community. And I'm determined</p>
<p>   that the test of fairness will not only be met, but it will be passed</p>
<p>   with flying colours. And can I say ladies and gentlemen without</p>
<p>   wishing on an occasion like this to introduce too much of a discordant</p>
<p>   note, how tremendously disappointed I am that the Leader of the</p>
<p>   Opposition last night in his Budget reply chose to take such a negative</p>
<p>   approach. Chose to say to the Australian people, even if you re-elect</p>
<p>   the Coalition government on the basis of the Coalition government</p>
<p>   has unveiled its tax reform plan at the next election, which is</p>
<p>   our intention, even if you do that, we in the Opposition will not</p>
<p>   accept that verdict and we will do everything we can to prevent</p>
<p>   the introduction of tax reform.</p>
<p>I think that is a very negative attitude. It is if I may say so</p>
<p>   in stark contrast to the rather more constructive approach that</p>
<p>   we in Opposition took to a number of important Labor government</p>
<p>   measures which could never have become law without our support.</p>
<p>   And I'm often reminded of the fact that if the Liberal and</p>
<p>   National parties in Opposition had taken a blindly negative approach</p>
<p>   to the then Labor government's plans to privatise the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   Bank and to privatise Australian Airlines, neither of those events</p>
<p>   would have occurred, but in the process we would have traded-in</p>
<p>   and pawned our own credibility. And credibility in politics, as</p>
<p>   in life generally, is a very important commodity. So I do express</p>
<p>   my very deep disappointment that such a negative attitude should</p>
<p>   have been taken because the cause of taxation reform is something</p>
<p>   that goes very directly to the national economic interest. Taxation</p>
<p>   reform is needed to make Australia a stronger, more competitive</p>
<p>   and a better country in which to do business into the 21st century.</p>
<p>   And there are leadership obligations on both sides of politics when</p>
<p>   it comes to something as fundamental as taxation reform.</p>
<p>Can I just say one or two other things before I conclude. I can't</p>
<p>   of course sit down without saying something about the Budget that</p>
<p>   Peter Costello brought down on Tuesday night. I'm immensely</p>
<p>   proud of the fact that in just over two years we have brought around</p>
<p>   a quite remarkable fiscal turnaround. One of the most remarkable</p>
<p>   things about what was projected in the Budget last Tuesday night</p>
<p>   is that back in 1995 the debt to GDP ratio taking into account federal</p>
<p>   government debt was about 20 per cent. Twenty per cent of gross</p>
<p>   domestic product. On current projections, and on the assumption</p>
<p>   that we allow as I put it, the men and women of Australia to buy</p>
<p>   the remaining two-thirds of Telstra, on that basis by the year 2000-2001,</p>
<p>   we will have reduced the federal government debt of Australia from</p>
<p>   20 per cent in 1995 to one and a half per cent only of gross domestic</p>
<p>   product by the year 2000-2001.</p>
<p>And we will be able to say to the people of Australia, particularly</p>
<p>   to the younger generations of Australians, that one of the greatest</p>
<p>   legacies we have given you is the legacy of living in a comparatively</p>
<p>   debt free nation. And I don't think it would be in the experience</p>
<p>   of anybody in this room that such a low level of federal government</p>
<p>   debt would have existed. And it does represent a huge turn-around,</p>
<p>   and the great bulk of that turn-around has been achieved through</p>
<p>   the device of expenditure restraint. Because for the third budget</p>
<p>   in a row, the Treasurer was able to say that there was no increase</p>
<p>   in income tax, there was no increase in company tax, there was no</p>
<p>   increase in excise duty, and there was no increase in sales tax.</p>
<p>   So we are very proud of that particular achievement.</p>
<p>And all of this was done according to a plan. We knew that we had</p>
<p>   to take some difficult decisions in our first budget. We knew that</p>
<p>   we had to lay the groundwork for that fiscal turn-around in that</p>
<p>   first budget, and I'm very glad indeed that those decisions</p>
<p>   were undertaken in 1996 because, as the Secretary to the Treasury</p>
<p>   said to me on Budget night, this Budget has been made possible by</p>
<p>   the Budget that the government brought down in 1996 when some of</p>
<p>   the many difficult expenditure decisions were undertaken. And can</p>
<p>   I also in that context take the opportunity of </p>
<p>congratulating in this gathering the work that Peter Costello as</p>
<p>   Treasurer has done over the last two and a quarter years. I think</p>
<p>   he's done the job with flair, I think he's delivered the</p>
<p>   Budget with flair, and I think in every sense of the word he's</p>
<p>   a person who is very much in full control of the responsibilities</p>
<p>   that I have given to him as Federal Treasurer.</p>
<p>My final word ladies and gentlemen is about government-business</p>
<p>   relations. When I was elected Prime Minister, or perhaps on election</p>
<p>   night in 1996 when I knew that I was going to be sworn in as Prime</p>
<p>   Minister, I said that one of the things that I valued most was the</p>
<p>   fact that the Party I led was owned by no section of the Australian</p>
<p>   community. That the Liberal Party was a Party composed of men and</p>
<p>   women from all walks of life and supported by Australians from all</p>
<p>   walks of life. And that has remained the case in the time that we've</p>
<p>   been in government. We have very much tried to govern for the mainstream.</p>
<p>   We've tried to look to and achieve the national interest, rather</p>
<p>   than a sectional interest.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean that we don't have close links</p>
<p>   with the business community. We share many of the goals of the business</p>
<p>   community of Australia. We all believe in decent capitalism. We</p>
<p>   all believe in the profit motive, we all believe in investment,</p>
<p>   we all believe in private enterprise. We all believe that governments</p>
<p>   should stick to the things that are the real responsibility of the</p>
<p>   government, and leave commercial undertakings and commercial decision-making</p>
<p>   to people who are best able to undertake them. The longer I stay</p>
<p>   in politics the more persuaded I am that governments are very bad</p>
<p>   at trying to run businesses. And the more persuaded I am that there</p>
<p>   are skills required for business which are handy in government but</p>
<p>   not necessarily transferable and that there are also skills required</p>
<p>   in government which might be handy in business but are also not</p>
<p>   necessarily totally transferable. They are different disciplines,</p>
<p>   they intersect, they overlap, they have a lot in common. And what</p>
<p>   I have tried to do is to build over the past two and a quarter years</p>
<p>   a good and open relationship with the business community. We don't</p>
<p>   always agree. We accept that from time to time you'll criticise</p>
<p>   us. You will accept that from time to time we may express dissatisfaction</p>
<p>   with some of the things that business does. I think it is very important</p>
<p>   on big national economic issues that there be as many spokesmen</p>
<p>   for the business community out there arguing the cause as there</p>
<p>   are spokesmen for contrary points of view out there arguing the</p>
<p>   cause. Because capturing the hearts and minds of people on the need</p>
<p>   for economic change and industrial and other reforms is a 24 hour</p>
<p>   challenge. And in living as we do in a media driven and a media</p>
<p>   dominated society in so many ways, that particular part of the equation</p>
<p>   is tremendously important.</p>
<p>But I value very much the links that my government has built with</p>
<p>   the business community. I value enormously the contribution of the</p>
<p>   Institute of Company Directors. I think we do have a very direct</p>
<p>   and open relationship. It's a relationship that I hope all</p>
<p>   of us will see in the future as being one that must be moulded to</p>
<p>   the national interest and that on all occasions we will work as</p>
<p>   best we can to achieve those goals.</p>
<p>I congratulate you on having such a successful conference. I thank</p>
<p>   you very warmly for asking me to come tonight. It's a great</p>
<p>   pleasure to be once again in your company.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
