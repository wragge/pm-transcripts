<p>Well thank you very much Bill Taylor, to Ian and Karen Macfarlane,</p>
<p>   to Cameron Thompson, the Liberal candidate for Blair, to the Mayor,</p>
<p>   other distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. It is for me,</p>
<p>   a great pleasure, a particular pleasure to be back in what I regard</p>
<p>   as the most attractive inland city in Australia. </p>
<p>And if you think that's one of those campaign trail things</p>
<p>   which is adjusted for every inland city I go to, I can produce some</p>
<p>   evidence that it's not. But it really is great to be back here</p>
<p>   in Toowoomba and I do want to start by thanking Bill Taylor for</p>
<p>   the ten years of tremendous public service that he's given</p>
<p>   to the people of Groom. This electorate which used to be called</p>
<p>   the electorate of Darling Downs, has not had a harder working more</p>
<p>   dedicated member, and he's brought to his parliamentary representation</p>
<p>   very great integrity, very great commitment. He's always put</p>
<p>   the interests of his party and his country ahead of his own personal</p>
<p>   interests. And sometimes in political life you come across people</p>
<p>   who don't always behave like that, but in the case of Bill</p>
<p>   he has been a very honourable, as well as a very effective representative.</p>
<p>And I, on behalf of the Government, and all of my colleagues, warmly</p>
<p>   thank him for the contribution that he's made to our Party</p>
<p>   and I warmly thank him for the contribution that he's made,</p>
<p>   not only to the people of Toowoomba, but also to the people of the</p>
<p>   whole Groom electorate. </p>
<p>And may I also on another local note, and particularly for some</p>
<p>   of the older members who are present today, tell you that I had</p>
<p>   the enormous privilege when I visited the Hellfire Pass area of</p>
<p>   Thailand, to open the Hellfire Pass museum, which commemorates the</p>
<p>   terrible suffering of the Australian men who died in captivity in</p>
<p>   WWII building the notorious Burma Thailand Railway. I invited along</p>
<p>   with my party, three former Federal Members of Parliament and Ministers</p>
<p>    two Liberal, and one Labor  as befits an occasion that</p>
<p>   belongs to all Australians, and not to one side of politics. And</p>
<p>   all of them had been prisoners of war of the Japanese, and one of</p>
<p>   them of course was the former Federal Member for what was then called</p>
<p>   the electorate of Darling Downs, Sir Reginald Schwartz. And at the</p>
<p>   age of 87, Reg Schwartz was still in great spirits, in great heart</p>
<p>   and the privilege of talking to him and sharing with him some of</p>
<p>   his recollections of those terrible days, and the suffering involved</p>
<p>   was a very moving part of my visit and one of the moving things</p>
<p>   that I've experienced since becoming Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, I don't know when the next election,</p>
<p>   federally, is going to be held. I know there is a State election</p>
<p>   here in Queensland on the thirteenth of June. I said out at the</p>
<p>   woolshed, when we announced our contribution to the Federation Fund,</p>
<p>   I said that I stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Rob Borbidge and Joan</p>
<p>   Sheldon. I said what I believed and that is that Rob Borbidge has</p>
<p>   been an extremely good Premier of Queensland. I also said that there</p>
<p>   was really only one choice that Queenslanders had to make on the</p>
<p>   thirteenth of June and that was whether or not Rob Borbidge or Peter</p>
<p>   Beattie would be the Premier of Queensland after the thirteenth</p>
<p>   of June, because they are the only two results that are possible.</p>
<p>   There is no other result possible. It is very easy for minor parties</p>
<p>   to promise the earth, to run populist campaigns offering simplistic</p>
<p>   solutions. Government in modern society is complicated and difficult.</p>
<p>   There are no simplistic, easy, populist solutions, because if there</p>
<p>   were they would have been tried by our political predecessors years</p>
<p>   and years ago. </p>
<p>I can tell you there is one thing that I believed when I came into</p>
<p>   Government and my belief has not altered and that is that there</p>
<p>   are never in relation to the difficult problems facing the country</p>
<p>   or a State, there are never easy, simple populist solutions. And</p>
<p>   I say beware of people who offer easy populist solutions, because</p>
<p>   they could never deliver them. And I suspect they offer them because</p>
<p>   they know they will never be called on to deliver them, and that</p>
<p>   observation applies in relation to minor parties of any description</p>
<p>   and minor parties that have no real prospect of wielding power and</p>
<p>   exercising authority. Because it is only the prospect of actually</p>
<p>   having the responsibility of implementing what you say you are going</p>
<p>   to achieve that really brings about a sense of reality and sense</p>
<p>   of responsibility in political leaders and political parties. So</p>
<p>   I would simply say to the people of Queensland that the choice is</p>
<p>   Borbidge or Beattie and nobody else, and that choice ought not to</p>
<p>   be complicated by listening to the insubstantial inducements of</p>
<p>   populist solutions which in reality offer no solutions at all. </p>
<p>I mentioned that when I became Prime Minister I realised that there</p>
<p>   were no easy solutions. And so has been the case over the last two-and-a-quarter</p>
<p>   years. But I'm immensely proud of what my Government has been</p>
<p>   able to achieve during that period of time, and in the economic</p>
<p>   area, that's been achieved against the background of something</p>
<p>   that we didn't know would happen, and nobody knew it would</p>
<p>   happen, when we were elected to Government in March of 1996, and</p>
<p>   that is the economic downturn in the Asia-Pacific region. Nobody</p>
<p>   was telling us in March of 1996 that that was going to happen, or</p>
<p>   if they were telling us, they didn't take the care to write</p>
<p>   it down, so they could now prove that they were telling us. The</p>
<p>   reality is that the Asian economic downturn has overtaken our part</p>
<p>   of the world and overtaken the world without any forewarning. And</p>
<p>   despite that, despite the fact that that downturn was unexpected</p>
<p>   and despite the fact that it has imposed some strains and some pressure</p>
<p>   on the Australian economy, we have really performed in our part</p>
<p>   of the world, infinitely better than any other country. And I would</p>
<p>   say to the Australian people all over our country, that what we</p>
<p>   have been able to do, particularly through our economic management</p>
<p>   is to deliver three things. We've delivered security, we've</p>
<p>   delivered safety, and we've delivered stability against the</p>
<p>   background of an enormous amount of economic turbulence.</p>
<p>And I can just very briefly take you through some of the evidence</p>
<p>   in support of that statement. We do now have thankfully, the lowest</p>
<p>   housing interest rates that this country has had since the late</p>
<p>   1960s. We've now got the lowest small business interest rates</p>
<p>   that we've had since the early 1970s. The average homebuyer</p>
<p>   in Australia is now the equivalent of $330 a month better off than</p>
<p>   what he or she was in March of 1996. Now, that is real money. That</p>
<p>   is unassailable, after tax money. And it is the equivalent of a</p>
<p>   $100 a week payrise, for a person paying off the average loan around</p>
<p>   Australia. Now, it does represent a very significant increase in</p>
<p>   the living standard and the economic security of people who are</p>
<p>   borrowing to pay off their home. Now, I recognise that low interest</p>
<p>   rates has different effects of different sections of the population.</p>
<p>   I know that it is terrific news if you are a borrower. The news</p>
<p>   is not so flash if you are a lender, and in recognition of that,</p>
<p>   of course, the Government undertook a number of measures. One of</p>
<p>   them we promised in the last election campaign for self-funded retirees,</p>
<p>   in relation to their tax threshold, and I'm also very happy</p>
<p>   to say that in the last Budget, we announced a major extension of</p>
<p>   the Seniors' Health Card for self-funded retirees. And the</p>
<p>   impact of that is that a self-funded retired couple earning up to</p>
<p>   the very large sum of $67 000 a year between them, or about $40</p>
<p>   000 a single person that those people will qualify in future for</p>
<p>   the Seniors' Health Card, they will qualify with effect from</p>
<p>   the first of January of next year. And that is a recognition that</p>
<p>   they are a section of the population who have very carefully saved</p>
<p>   for their retirement and understandably feel on occasions that perhaps</p>
<p>   there has been insufficient recognition of the contribution that</p>
<p>   their thriftiness has made to the overall economic welfare of the</p>
<p>   nation. </p>
<p>SO, on the interest rate front, there's some very good evidence</p>
<p>   of what we have achieved. On the inflation front, we have now the</p>
<p>   lowest inflation rate in the industrialised world. And very importantly</p>
<p>   on the Budget front, we inherited a deficit on an annual basis from</p>
<p>   Mr Beazley and Mr Keating, of $10.5 billion and in just over two</p>
<p>   years, we have converted that into a surplus this year in prospect</p>
<p>   of $2.7 billion. Now that surplus won't mould away in the bank.</p>
<p>   That surplus will be used to pay off the accumulated debts over</p>
<p>   a period of years that we inherited from the former Government.</p>
<p>   I mean, without burdening you with statistics, it was calculated</p>
<p>   that when we came into office we inherited about $95 to $100 billion</p>
<p>   dollars of accumulated Federal Government debt and that represented</p>
<p>   a few years ago about 20% of our annual wealth generation as a nation.</p>
<p>   And on our calculations, if all of our policies are implemented,</p>
<p>   including the privatisation of the remaining two-thirds of Telstra,</p>
<p>   we will by the turn of the century have reduced that 20% to a bare</p>
<p>   1.5% of our annual wealth generation. Now, that is a remarkable</p>
<p>   achievement because as you all know, just as a household, a farm,</p>
<p>   a small business, or indeed a large business, cannot go indefinitely</p>
<p>   living beyond its means. So it is with a nation. And the debt burden</p>
<p>   hanging over a country is really a representation of the pawning</p>
<p>   of our children's future and our children's economic livelihood</p>
<p>   and stability years into the future. And I would like to think that</p>
<p>   my Government will be seen in time as the Government that delivered</p>
<p>   a relatively debt free 21st Century to future generations</p>
<p>   of Australians. Because a debt burden is a burden of enormous proportions.</p>
<p>   It is a burden that eats up income that you earn. It's a burden</p>
<p>   that prevents you doing things and the more debt we pay off and</p>
<p>   the higher the surlpus we generate, the more capacity we have to</p>
<p>   do two things. To spend money needy areas, be they in the social</p>
<p>   area or the infrastructure area, and also of course to deliver reductions</p>
<p>   particularly in the areas of personal income tax. SO in those three</p>
<p>   areas, we have achieved an enormous amount. We've cut interest</p>
<p>   rates, we've got a record low inflation level and we've</p>
<p>   tackled, in a very successful and a very systematic way, the debt</p>
<p>   burden that we inherited.</p>
<p>So it is fair to claim, as I do very frequently and very proudly,</p>
<p>   but against a background of unanticipated economic turbulence, we</p>
<p>   have delivered that security, that stability, and that safety. But</p>
<p>   in other areas, we have also tackled fundamental reform that we've</p>
<p>   need to address for a very long time. And one of those areas of</p>
<p>   course is Industrial Relations reform. I've been campaigning</p>
<p>   for Industrial Relations reform in this country for a very long</p>
<p>   period of time. It was probably the policy issue for which I was</p>
<p>   best known when I became Leader of the Opposition again in January</p>
<p>   of 1995. And if there was one thing above all that I wanted to achieve</p>
<p>   when I got into office and that was to implement the promises that</p>
<p>   we'd made in relation to Industrial Relations.</p>
<p>And I am very pleased that that has occurred. We now have a much</p>
<p>   better Industrial Relations system. One of the areas, of course,</p>
<p>   where we've been very active is reform of the Australian waterfront.</p>
<p>   We need a more efficient waterfront. We need change in the industrial</p>
<p>   relations of the Australian waterfront. Not because we want to destroy</p>
<p>   a union, not because we object to trade unionists working on the</p>
<p>   waterfront. That has never been our policy. We want to change the</p>
<p>   Australian waterfront because it will be economically beneficial</p>
<p>   for Australia. And I think the industrial obscenity of the present</p>
<p>   arrangements on the waterfront are best epitomised by what is now</p>
<p>   happening in relation to that ship on the west coast of the United</p>
<p>   States. It goes over there with the frozen meat and because the</p>
<p>   American Union is mates with the MUA and the ALP, won't unload</p>
<p>   it. It's got to go back to New Zealand and it's got to</p>
<p>   be reloaded by what is regarded as acceptable labour and then go</p>
<p>   back to the West Coast in the United States. </p>
<p>We all know what conditions that export is going to be in by the</p>
<p>   time it is finally taken off that ship. Now that, ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p>   is an outrage. That, ladies and gentlemen, represents in a classic,</p>
<p>   unarguable case study, that represents what we are trying to change</p>
<p>   about the Australian waterfront. That is a metaphor for all of the</p>
<p>   things that are wrong with the Australian waterfront at the present</p>
<p>   time. And I know we have encountered the distance. I know we've</p>
<p>   incurred criticism from the media and from other sections of the</p>
<p>   Australian community. But I want you to know we are absolutely determined</p>
<p>   to continue pursuing fundamental reform to the Australian waterfront.</p>
<p>   And we are going to do it not because we have some ideological hang-up.</p>
<p>We are going to do it because it is good for Australia. That's</p>
<p>   why we are doing it. It will make Australia economically more efficient.</p>
<p>   It will help our exporters. It will stop Australia's waterfront</p>
<p>   being a laughing stock for the rest of the world. And I want personally</p>
<p>   to compliment Peter Reith my Industrial Relations Minister on the</p>
<p>   very steadfast and courageous role that he played in the face of</p>
<p>   some fierce and vicious criticism, intimidation and attack. And</p>
<p>   I admire very much the job that he has done. But when I talk about</p>
<p>   doing something in the national interests that, of course, brings</p>
<p>   me to the other steps that must be taken to further deliver the</p>
<p>   safety and security and the stability of the Australian economy.</p>
<p>   And that, of course, is the reform of our taxation system. And once</p>
<p>   again the goal to reform this system because it will be good for</p>
<p>   Australia. That's the reason we want to do it. I believe very</p>
<p>   strongly and it's based on almost 25 years of experience in</p>
<p>   public life, that you can persuade the Australian public of the</p>
<p>   need for reform and change if you satisfy two conditions. You must</p>
<p>   first of all persuade the Australian public that the change you</p>
<p>   want to make is in Australia's interest. In other words, it's</p>
<p>   in the national interest of our country that we bring about the</p>
<p>   change. And secondly, you've got to persuade them that the</p>
<p>   change you intend to make is fair. </p>
<p>Now, I am applying that by theory to the cause of taxation reform.</p>
<p>   We do have an old-fashioned tax. We do have a tax system that penalises</p>
<p>   our exporters. We apply wholesale sales tax at various rates on</p>
<p>   some goods and on other goods we don't apply any rate of wholesale</p>
<p>   sales tax. Some of the rates are very high. We have a lot of anomalies.</p>
<p>   We charge 32 per cent for a television set. We charge 22 per cent</p>
<p>   for a family car. We charge nothing for caviar or if you are wealthy</p>
<p>   enough to buy a Lear jet, we don't' charge anything for</p>
<p>   that either, in sales tax that is. And so the list goes on and there</p>
<p>   is anomaly after anomaly in the system we have at the present time.</p>
<p>   But as a community that draws so much of its wealth to some of the</p>
<p>   great export industries of Australia, the economic sector most affected</p>
<p>   and most penalised by our present tax system is, of course, the</p>
<p>   export system. Because if we had a better indirect tax system we</p>
<p>   wouldn't tax the input to the goods that we send overseas and</p>
<p>   we'd be far more competitive in the trading activities of other</p>
<p>   countries. </p>
<p>Our taxation policy will be released in plenty of time for the</p>
<p>   Australian people to examine it in detail before the election takes</p>
<p>   place. It will address the concerns people have about it being fair</p>
<p>   and equitable to low income earners. And all I would say in relation</p>
<p>   to our political opponents is that, like everything else, we know</p>
<p>   what they are against but we don't know what they are for.</p>
<p>   And I have searched in vain over the past few months to find one</p>
<p>   single new policy that the Labor Party has generated in the two-and-a-quarter</p>
<p>   years it's been in opposition. Now, I am prepared to accept</p>
<p>   for a year or eighteen months that a party that had been in power</p>
<p>   for 13 years couldn't be expected to reinvent the wheel in such</p>
<p>   a short period of time. I was prepared to accept that they had to</p>
<p>   go through some period of introspection and self examination and</p>
<p>   some period of policy renewal. That happens to any political movement</p>
<p>   after it goes into opposition from a long period of government.</p>
<p>   But that period of consultation and naval gazing to the Labor Party</p>
<p>   is now finished. They now have the obligation that they are putting</p>
<p>   themselves forward as an alternative government. They have an obligation</p>
<p>   of telling the Australian public what they believe in and what they</p>
<p>   stand for. We know they left us with a deficit of $10.5 billion</p>
<p>   and then to add insult to injury where they tried to stop us through</p>
<p>   the Senate from fixing up the mess that they concealed to the Australian</p>
<p>   public and left behind. </p>
<p>We know that they tried to stop industrial relations reform. We</p>
<p>   know that they support the MUA's stranglehold on the Australian</p>
<p>   waterfront. We know that they are in favour of compulsory unionism.</p>
<p>   We also know that they are against taxation reform. Mr Beazley said</p>
<p>   last week that he wanted to keep the present wholesale tax system.</p>
<p>   So we know a lot of what they are opposed to but we have now real</p>
<p>   idea of what they are for. And part of the process to the lead up</p>
<p>   to an election is for the Government to say what it believes in</p>
<p>   and for the Opposition to say what it believes in. And then people</p>
<p>   have a look and they make a decision and they start the debate.</p>
<p>   Well only one player has come upon the stage so far and that is</p>
<p>   the Government. We are the only actor on the stage. We are the only</p>
<p>   show in town at the moment that is telling the Australian people</p>
<p>   what it believes in. We believe in making Australia strong and stable</p>
<p>   economically. We believe in fixing the industrial relations system.</p>
<p>   We believe in fixing the tax system. We believe in a sensible program</p>
<p>   of privatisation. We believe in having good relations with our neighbours</p>
<p>   based on the principle of mutual respect but thus far we don't</p>
<p>   really know what our political opponents stand for. </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, can I finish by thanking all of you as members</p>
<p>   and supporters of the Liberal Party and others of whatever basis</p>
<p>   you come here today for the support you've given to Bill Taylor.</p>
<p>   Can I take the opportunity of commending Ian Macfarlane to you as</p>
<p>   the Liberal Party candidate for Groom of the next Federal election.</p>
<p>   Ian is very well known in this part of Queensland. </p>
<p>Can I take this opportunity of commending Ian Macfarlane to you</p>
<p>   as the Liberal Party candidate for Groom at the next Federal election.</p>
<p>   Ian is very well known in this part of Queensland. He, of course,</p>
<p>   has been as I understand it a resident of this district for a long</p>
<p>   period of time. There wouldn't be anybody who has a better</p>
<p>   understanding of agri-politics in this country than does Ian. He</p>
<p>   has a very strong background because of his association with and</p>
<p>   leadership of the Grains Council. He does understand some of the</p>
<p>   difficult problems that are faced by primary producers in Australia.</p>
<p>   Although we've brought a lot of change and a lot of improvements</p>
<p>   and a lot of reforms and happily in many parts of Australia weather</p>
<p>   conditions have turned a lot better for primary producers, it is</p>
<p>   still very difficult. And later on in a few moments I'll be</p>
<p>   talking to representatives of the pork industry to listen to the</p>
<p>   concerns that they have and to listen to the views that they wish</p>
<p>   to put to the Government.</p>
<p>So it's more important than ever that we put into Parliament</p>
<p>   men and women who understand primary industries. We do need people</p>
<p>   who've got a deep background in the rural industries of Australia.</p>
<p>   There will always be a very large place in the ranks of the Coalition</p>
<p>   parties for men and women who have rural backgrounds. We must always</p>
<p>   remember that the Liberal Party represents more rural seats in Australia</p>
<p>   than any other party. And the Liberal Party's understanding</p>
<p>   of and representation in rural Australia is immense. So in every</p>
<p>   respect I think the Liberal Party has made an outstanding choice</p>
<p>   in selecting Ian Macfarlane as the candidate to run under the Liberal</p>
<p>   banner at the next Federal Election. He will have my total support,</p>
<p>   my total confidence and after the election I will very warmly welcome</p>
<p>   him as the new Federal Member for Groom. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>ends</p>
