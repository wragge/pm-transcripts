EMBARGO: AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA MONDAY, 26 MAY, 1980 X<br />
THE OPENING OF THE HIGH COURT<br />
Today marks a further step in the evolution of our nation.<br />
For today, in our national capital, in close proximity<br />
to the Federal Parliament, and to those buildings which<br />
house the executive arm of Government, we are giving a<br />
permanent home to the High Court of Australia.<br />
Now, for the first time, the three great institutions of<br />
the Commonwealth, wherein reside its legislative, executive<br />
and. judicial power, are brought together with a visible<br />
presence in our national capital.<br />
To add to this sense of history, we are privileged, your<br />
Maj4esty, and honoured, to have you perform the<br />
opening ceremony.<br />
For my Government, and for the people of Australia, it is<br />
a dlistinct pleasure to welcome you and his Royal Highness<br />
to our midst. Both of you, and your family, enjoy a deep<br />
respect and a warm affection from all Australians.<br />
Little more than 53 years ago, when Canberra was a forbidding<br />
environment compared to its beautiful setting today, your<br />
late father, then Duke of York and later King George VI,<br />
officiated at the inaugural sitting of our Parliament in<br />
this city.<br />
Since then, buildings which house the executive Goverment<br />
have inevitably been drawn to Canberra. Today, with your<br />
opening of the High Court building, the seat of the nation's<br />
supreme judicial body, Canberra becomes even more so<br />
our national capital.<br />
The High Court of Australia is of special importance to<br />
all Australians a vital element in our Federal constitutional<br />
system.<br />
This system involves a division of powers and it is a<br />
fundamental function of the High Court to pronounce upon<br />
the boundaries of these powers. The Court performs this<br />
function by express direction from the Constitution itself.<br />
It may seem strange that the High Court, which is so essential<br />
to the structure of our democracy, should acquire a permanent<br />
home only in the 80th year of our nationhood. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Over the years, sittings of the High Court have been<br />
held in State capital cities. And each year, sitUE]' ngs<br />
have been designated to be held in every State. AA6<br />
yet, even now, Sir Garfield will not be saying to<br />
his brethren: " Oh rest ye brother mariners, we will<br />
not. wander more". For the sittings of the Court will<br />
not, be entirely confined to Canberra.<br />
But the decision of 1968, by the' Government of the day, A<br />
mea~ ns that the national court will now have its home in<br />
the! national capital.<br />
In all, four Federal Governments have played a part in<br />
its establishment. But to bring the project to fruition<br />
has required a special impetus.<br />
As my predecessor, Mr. Whitlam, acknowledged, when unveiling<br />
the foundation plaque in September 1975, the driving force<br />
behind the concept has been the present Chief Justice of<br />
Australia. This building bears testimony to Sir Garfield's<br />
vision, energy and imagination, and will stand as a<br />
memorial to the high standards of Australian designers<br />
and builders; craftsmen and artists.<br />
It is a building which will attract a growing national<br />
pride as the years pass.<br />
All too often, in the design of modern buildings, we are<br />
left with a functional result with little else to commend it.<br />
On this occasion, the pursuit of function and excellence<br />
has been rigorous and successful.<br />
Indeed, " I submit", that function and excellence can co-exist,<br />
as this magnificent structure proves, " beyond reasonable<br />
doubt"; or at least, " on the balance of probabilities".<br />
Today we celebrate the completion of a home worthy of the<br />
institution it is to serve; and we are grateful to all those<br />
whose skill and dedication have made this possible.<br />
Now, the three arms of Government, in their inter-dependent<br />
arid independent roles, will be made manifest to all. And those<br />
who reflect, will recognise that the presence amongst them<br />
of the judicial power, is an affirmation of the permanence<br />
and supremacy of the rule of law. For, in the final analysis,<br />
this is but a building: a means whereby the Justices of<br />
the High Court of Australia, as their oath of office requires,<br />
shall: " Do right to all manner of people, according to law,<br />
without fear or favour, affection or ill-will".<br />
Your Majesty, this is a momentous occasion for us all.<br />
We are delighted that you and so many distinguished guests<br />
have been able to share it with us.<br />
In this way, you have secured for this day, an indelible<br />
place in Australia's history. 000---</p>
