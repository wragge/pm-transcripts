    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government deeply regrets the executions of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.</p>
<p>The Government had hoped that Indonesia would show mercy to these young men, who have worked hard since their arrests to rehabilitate themselves and improve the lives of other prisoners.</p>
<p>They committed a serious crime.</p>
<p>Lengthy prison terms would have been an appropriate punishment.</p>
<p>In jail, Andrew Chan brought comfort and hope to others and Myuran Sukumaran shared his skills to give prisoners the chance of a better life.</p>
<p>Our thoughts and prayers are with Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran’s family and friends at this extremely difficult time.</p>
<p>Australia respects Indonesia’s sovereignty, but deeply regrets that Indonesia could not extend the mercy it so often seeks for its own citizens.</p>
<p>We will withdraw our Ambassador for consultations once the men’s bodies have been returned to the Chan and Sukumaran families.  </p>
<p>Ministerial visits will remain suspended.</p>
<p>29 April 2015</p>
