FOR PRESS 11CX.<br />
-WORLD COURTI JITDGIhZNT<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
I deplore and condemn the attacks reportedly made on<br />
Australia by named African spokesmen arising from the recent<br />
World Court judgnent.<br />
The fact that they were made while the United Nations<br />
Trusteeship Council was conmiending Australia for the general<br />
econoic progress it has promoted in New Guinea underlines<br />
their lack of justification.<br />
The criticisms against Sir Percy Spender are also<br />
deplorable and unwarranted. Sir Percy's long and distinguished<br />
career in law, politics and diplomacy has been marked by a<br />
progressive liberalism of mind and a warmth of humanity. He<br />
pioneered the Colombo Plan at one time it was called the<br />
Spender Plan under which billions of dollars have been<br />
provided for aid and technical assistance in Asia. The U. S. A.<br />
alone has contributed more than Kl5 billion.<br />
Whatever view is taken of Sir Percy's decision, his<br />
would have been an honest judgment made in good faith.<br />
IJILBOUM1 23rd July, 1966. </p>
