PRIM. Eli ISTER'S TOUR OF SOUTH-EAST ASIA<br />
Press Conference given by the Prime Kinister,. o<br />
Mr. Harold Holt at Kuala Lumpur 27TH APRIL 1966<br />
Well ladies and gentlemen I didn't propose to make any<br />
extensive statement of a general kind because most of you will<br />
have had the statement I made for my visit here, which outlined<br />
where I've been, what the general purpose of the visit has been<br />
and our plans for the remainder of the tour.<br />
You will have gathered that my principal purpose when<br />
I first planned this journey was tc make contact with Australian<br />
troops wherever they rre stationed in South-East Asia.<br />
Indeed, from the time I took office as Prime Minister,<br />
this has been one of my most pressing priorities in my own view<br />
and I have taken what turned out to be the first opportunity,<br />
indeed made some rearrangements of plans to achieve this because<br />
Parliament is still in session and part of the explanation, the<br />
largest part, for the compression of this visit to so many<br />
countries into so short a space of time is to enable me to return<br />
to the Parliament for the remaining weeks of the session.<br />
The visit, however, as we have gone along and as<br />
became fairly evident when we were planning the details of it<br />
with the Governments of the countries concerned, has developed<br />
into quite a considerable diplomatic exercise, quite apart from<br />
the purpose I've outlined to you and it has been a most valuable<br />
experience to have had intimate political discussions in each cf<br />
the countries I have visited with the senior political and<br />
diplomatic personalities of that country wherever we have gone.<br />
I have already been to Vietnam where most of the time<br />
planned for the journey had been allotted.<br />
We are, as you know, actively engaged in military<br />
operations in Vietnam in support of' the forces kf South Vietnam<br />
at the request of its Govrnment and in association with the<br />
United States which has such massive iepresentation there.<br />
Not only was I able to make observations and have<br />
discussions on the spot, but it was an o. pportunity tc make a<br />
fresh assessi-ient of the prospects in that area.<br />
I f-und thec,, I say very frankly cnc.-, uraging as to the<br />
future. There are some tough times ahead, perhaps for a long<br />
time ahead, but I'm sure that the Viet Cong cannot finally<br />
succeed in South Vietnam and with that knowledge, the South<br />
Vietnamese people themselves m. ust be heartened continue a<br />
struggle which has been for then a long drawn cut crisis of so<br />
many years duration nearly 20 years duration for many of those<br />
who have been actively in the fight throughout.<br />
But with thu massive assistance now available to them,<br />
with the encouragement and heartening effect of the knowledge<br />
that there are friends arnd the world willing to co: n tc their<br />
aid until this task is resolved, there has been a lift in the<br />
morale of the S: cuth Victnamese themselves a. nd as to our c. wn<br />
troops, I found then in splendid spirit and well meriting the </p>
<p>high commendaticn which had boen expresscd often by all with<br />
whom we spoke. But apart from the Victnamese situation, the visit to<br />
Thailand and tc this country, and then later in Singapore, will<br />
enable me to have an up-to-date assessment on matters which are<br />
of mutual interest and concern to us in this area of the world.<br />
Xe, oi coarse, share your own concern with the<br />
continuation of the Indonesian policy of confrontation and our<br />
own assistance is continuing with your forces, the forces of the<br />
United Kingdom and New Zealand, in resisting this confrontation<br />
process. ihat will emerge from the changes which have been<br />
taking place in Indonesia?<br />
I think it wiser to defer judgment on that until there<br />
is clearer evidence that there has been some change of heart, or<br />
change of direction.<br />
But, quite obviously, if judged merely on the number<br />
of people of Communist sympathies who have been disposed of<br />
violently in Indonesia, there is undoubtedly a strength of' anti-<br />
Communist which, when the disorders can be finally suppressed,<br />
do open up some prospect of collaboration with the countries of<br />
the free world. However, I think it not fruitful at this point of time<br />
to speculate at any length on what might emerge there.<br />
Having said that, and with your knowledge that I will<br />
be visiting the remaining centres Butterworth the Borneo<br />
points of interest to us and various other centres around this<br />
country, I think the most useful thing I can do for you at this<br />
point is to ask if there are questions which occur to you on<br />
which you would liike an answer.<br />
I can't guarantee to answer them all, because, on<br />
domestic matters I am, as you will appreciate, a guest of your<br />
Government in this country and it's not usaal for those so<br />
situated to coimmient on matters of domestic political concern.<br />
QUESTION: ( By Straits Echo and Indian papers)<br />
iIr. Prime œ 1; inister, you said you would make. a fresh<br />
assessment in the area, that is Vietnam.<br />
In the light of your assessment, is there any likelihood<br />
that you will increase your military assistance and presence in<br />
Vietnam?<br />
iYM. HOLT: The Australian assistance has already been publicly<br />
indicated. It was made in the light of considerable knowledge of<br />
what the situation is there.<br />
It represents a trebling of our existing forcc in that<br />
area, something more than a frebling of that existing force, and<br />
you must have in mind that Australia has commitments and<br />
obligations, or even in the absencc of commitment or obligation,<br />
is making a military assistance in other parts of South-Tast Asia, </p>
<p>I've already mentioned what we are doing in relation to<br />
this country. fe have certain responsibilities in respect of Papua<br />
and New Guinea which enjoys a common border with Indonesia, and<br />
the arrangement, so far as our own troops in Vietnam are<br />
concerned is that their tour of duty will be approxijratol, 12<br />
months. So we will need to have replacement forces for the<br />
troops in that area.-<br />
In order to meet all these different tasks and<br />
obligations, we have found it necessary to introduce a system of<br />
national service, and so, at this stage, I would point to what we<br />
have alreauy undertaken to do.<br />
I have said in Parliament that the Government reviews<br />
from time to time the contribution that it is making, either<br />
overall or in a particular situation.<br />
But the strength of force wnich I have indicated to<br />
you is the only decision which the Government has taken on this<br />
matter and relates to at least the foreseeable future.<br />
Q. ( Local Rep. AAP Reuters)<br />
Can you tell us what were the topics of your discussion<br />
with Tun ñ. azak today?<br />
HOLT: ie had a talk which has ranged over quite a wide area,<br />
but as Tun Razak commented to me, we don't have problems between<br />
each other, we have matters of interest.<br />
. e have one or two matters of mutual concern, but the<br />
relations between Australia an alaysia are very friendly<br />
relations. co-operate in a number of fields.<br />
: c have bucn glad to give some assistance in directions<br />
which he was good enough to say were of help and much appreciated<br />
by him and his Government.<br />
But naturally, we had some discussion on the Indonesian<br />
situation. I dia give him an account of my own impressions of the<br />
situation in Vietnam.<br />
I was particularly interested in what your Government<br />
is doing in the fiela of rural development, because w firmly<br />
believe, and this . Ls true of the Government of South Vietnam, of<br />
the American authorities there, or our own advisers, that<br />
considerable contribution to military success, and a continued<br />
stablilty in South Vietnam will be the amount of energy and<br />
purpose put behind the programes of civil action or<br />
revolutionary development as they call them.<br />
This would supplement the military effort in much the<br />
same way as in the days of your own guerrilla activity where it<br />
was found necessary to support with economic and social welfare<br />
programmes. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Q. ( Straits Times)<br />
Sir, in view of your commitment in Vietnam, what are the<br />
chances of il1alaysia gettin,. extra troops in case she asks for them?<br />
Extra Australian troops.<br />
14R. HOLT: Well, I think this would have to be viewed against the<br />
total range of our comiuiitments, but I believe that the forces<br />
currently available are adequate to meet the military requirements<br />
of' the current situation.<br />
I don't think it's likely to worsen.<br />
hatever view one takes of the situation in Indonesia,<br />
I frankly don't think the military situation is likely to worsen.<br />
There may be some prospect even of improvement, but I<br />
don't dwiell on that.<br />
Q. How does Australia view the friction ,-which exists<br />
between L'i,, alaysia and Singapore?<br />
Has this been part of your general discussions here?<br />
MR. HOLT: Naturally vie, as friends of both *,. alaysia and Singapore,<br />
are interested in the continuation or establishment of' good<br />
relations on a firm basis between these tw.-o areas.<br />
Quite obviously it has an importance in our own eyes<br />
for military co-operation, and the successful progress of trade<br />
between our countries.<br />
The economic well being of' Singapore has a bearing on<br />
the economic well being of '.! alaysia and vice versa.<br />
For our part the economic well being of two friendly<br />
countries has some concern for us, certainly a very real interest<br />
for us. But these are problems which, quite obviously, have to<br />
be worked out between the two Governments of the areas concerned.<br />
It's not for us to try to meddle in what are the<br />
domestic affairs of those two Governments.<br />
Q. ( Far EL-astern Economic -Review)<br />
Sir, looking for a change of heart or change of<br />
direction in Indonesia, would you regard Indonesia's offer of<br />
recognition of ], ingapore as a change in direction?<br />
12. HOLT: I think it could be.<br />
I know it was accompanied. by some reference to an<br />
increase of' confrontation against ialaysia, but the situation<br />
there is capable of thc interpretation that the generals are<br />
proceeding gradually. </p>
<p>I don't think it is helpful to the situation generally<br />
for us to try to pursue the possibilities in public debate.<br />
I would prefer to see how these things work out.<br />
Q. ( Far Eastern Economic Review)<br />
Sir, you spoke of the Viet Cong: they cannot finally<br />
succeed, I think were the words you chose.<br />
WJere you referring to the situation inilitarily or<br />
politically or both?<br />
MR. HOLT: I would say both.<br />
I'm certainly confident that they will not succeed<br />
militarily. I don't mean by that that they won't do damage here or<br />
there, or be a serious m~ ilitary problem perhaps for some long<br />
time., but I do believe the military strength which has been built<br />
up is so massive and is being so well applied, is being supplemented<br />
by well thought out schemes of civic action and rural development,<br />
that the Viet Cong are not going to achieve the objectives that<br />
they have set for themselves.<br />
It may very well be that, as they find the military<br />
situation becoming more difficult for them, they will either revert<br />
to more off the guerrilla type activity w,, hich marked their earlier<br />
phases of operation, or they may it's not a question of or, in<br />
an exclusive sense, " and" they may, " or they may, whichever<br />
way things work out, turn their attention increasingly to the<br />
political situation an-j with so many different groups and<br />
different sects, different interestsY, there's a fertile field<br />
for trouble making.<br />
The other possibility too, which I think has to be<br />
thought about quite seriously, is that the Communists may shift<br />
front to other areas of South-East Asia and there are some signs<br />
that they have been iioving: in other directions, particularly<br />
Thailand, Laos. This could be intensified.<br />
Q. ( Straits Times)<br />
There have been reports that because Singapore and<br />
11alaysiQ have-been unable to draw up fornal riachiftery for<br />
defence arrnnngements, Australia havs found it difficult to put<br />
forward. some kind of defence plan for Singapore.<br />
Are those reports true, or have you anything to say on<br />
that?<br />
MR. HOLT: So far as I am aware, our Dlans have been going ahead.<br />
It may well be that because of the lack of an agreed<br />
defence arrangement between the two countries, that there has<br />
been some delay in completion of' the plan, but I would~ n't be<br />
speaking in any critical tone of that.<br />
Indeed, I would find this matter mnore closely in the<br />
province of my colleague, the Minister for External Affairs, or </p>
<p>possibly the Minister for Defence.<br />
But quite obviously the closer the teamwork, and the<br />
relationship, the collaboration, the friendship between Ialaysia<br />
and Singapore, the more advantageously we believe this operates<br />
for all of us who have common interests in this area.<br />
We certainly don't wish to complicate the problem of<br />
either negotiation or mutual discussion by including views which<br />
may not necessarily be welcome views.<br />
We watch with a sympathetic interest the efforts which<br />
both countries are making to establish a cordial and co-operative<br />
relationship. </p>
