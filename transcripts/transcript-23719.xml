    <content><![CDATA[<p>Over the last three weeks there has been a worldwide outpouring of grief for the victims of downed flight MH17.</p>
<p>Many nations have come together to condemn this atrocity, help recover remains and investigate this terrible crime.</p>
<p>This includes more than 500 Australian Federal Police and Australian Defence Force personnel deployed under <em>Operation Bring Them Home</em> and diplomats from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, their harrowing work has been carried out under increasingly dangerous circumstances.</p>
<p>The drawdown of Australian personnel from Ukraine is under way following the conclusion of the initial phase of <em>Operation Bring Them Home</em>.</p>
<p>In The Netherlands their task continues, as Australian and Dutch scientists finalise the victim identification process to bring some closure for families.</p>
<p>Accompanied by AFP Commissioner Tony Negus APM and the Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin AC, I will travel to the Netherlands tonight to personally thank Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte for his leadership of this international effort.</p>
<p>No country suffered greater losses than the Dutch when MH17 was shot out of the sky on July 17 killing all 298 passengers and crew.</p>
<p>There were 38 people on board who called Australia home.</p>
<p>The Dutch have very capably led the international recovery and repatriation mission, working in tandem with Australia and Malaysian officials and with strong support from the international community.</p>
<p>I will thank Prime Minister Rutte for his support, receive updates on the search and victim identification efforts and thank the Australian police and defence personnel for their work.</p>
<p>Following the Netherlands I will travel briefly to the United Kingdom to receive security briefings from the UK Ministers and security agencies.</p>
<p>I will return to Australia on Thursday.</p>
<p>9 August 2014</p>
