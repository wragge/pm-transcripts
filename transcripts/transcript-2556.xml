PRESS BRIEFING<br />
CONCLUSION OF MEETING OF LIBERAL PARTY JOINT<br />
STANDING COMMITTEE ON FEDERAL POLICY 7 APRIL 1972<br />
PM: Gentlemenk' I think you know that over the last few days<br />
there has been some publicity about the meeting of the<br />
Standing Committee on Federal Policy which is that section<br />
of the Organisation, or that Policy Group within the<br />
Organisation, that can make recommendations to the<br />
Government about matters which it feels should be taken<br />
into consideration, and if thought desirable, implemented<br />
by the Government.<br />
Under no circumstances can they do more than put a<br />
recommendation to us and certainly can't tell us what<br />
we should do. And consequently, whatever I say, therefore,<br />
must be considered against that background.<br />
We have had two meetings already: Each one extending over<br />
very nearly two days, that's four days in total.<br />
And we're decided that unlike most-cases in the past, that<br />
it would be wise if I, as the Chairman of the Committee,<br />
gave you a general survey of the kind of subject we<br />
discussed, and how we intend to handle them in the future.<br />
As to the subjects that-we've discussed, there are<br />
about fourteen.<br />
In each case, a paper has been prepared and they've been<br />
particularly well prepared, and have dealt with the subject<br />
in depth, both from a philosophic point of view, and from<br />
the point of view of making concrete recommendations.<br />
Each one of the submission or papers, together with the<br />
recommendations, necessarily have to go to me as the<br />
PRIME Minister, and then on to either the Minister<br />
primarily concerned, or to the Cabinet. In most cases<br />
I think they'll go to the Cabinet.<br />
And subsequent to that they will then be announced<br />
when the decision has been made, as part of the Government<br />
policy. The Standing Committee decided that we should not tryan<br />
hoard acisiong following the recommendations, but<br />
we should be ready at all times to make decisions either<br />
prior to the rising of the House and<br />
announce them prior to the rising of the House, and<br />
during the period of the Budget, or if thought desirable,<br />
to keep the decisions for policies.,<br />
But, as they believe public opinion is best served by<br />
making the decisions at the most appropriate time, they've<br />
recommended to the Government that we shouldn't be hesitant<br />
in letting the public know what we think and why we think<br />
it. </p>
<p>PM: I don't know whether you'd like me to read out the<br />
fourteen subjects to you, but I can do that if you<br />
want it.<br />
Yes please.<br />
PM: There are such matters as the ecnm and which way<br />
we should proceed in ensuring a sensible rate of growth.<br />
Development, defence, foreign affairs, the quality of<br />
life, urban development, immigration, arbitration and<br />
industrial law, the rural of law, national health,<br />
national goals, education, social welfare, and rural<br />
matters. In particular today, we dealt$ with defence, national<br />
goals, education, urban development, and rural matters.<br />
Some of the others have been dealt with before and we<br />
have about three, including social welfare and social<br />
services, that will have to be dealt with the next time<br />
we meet.<br />
And we'll be meeting again on the 21st April.,<br />
I personally believe they* are some of the best papers<br />
that we have had prepared, and they've done by groups<br />
of members of the Liberal Party, drawn from the<br />
Parliamentary Party, including the Cabinet and Ministry,<br />
members of the Organisa~ ion, and the Officials, particularly<br />
the Secretaries, and the Research officer such as Graham<br />
Starr, Federal Secretariat, and Jim Carleton from N. S. W.,<br />
together with today, the new Secretary from Victoria.<br />
There was, I believe, the fullest discussion of these<br />
problems, and I think the range of the subjects indicate<br />
pretty clearly what they see, not only as subjects which<br />
are of great national importance, but subjects that they<br />
believe a politically high in the order of priorities.<br />
And therefore they wanted to drive home their message<br />
of what they think has to be done in order to create<br />
the proper atmosphere and psychology in which we can<br />
start to develope an election programme, an electi-oh<br />
policy. I think that's about all I can say to you as to what's<br />
happened.<br />
IQ. That's all on the record?<br />
PM: All that is on the record.<br />
Q. Did you discuss the national superannuation plan,<br />
and decide to defer it<br />
PM: We had that on the paper to be discussed today,<br />
but we didn't reach it, and it's put down as the first<br />
subject for discussion, amongst other social welfare<br />
matters, for the next meeting of the Standing Committee<br />
on Policy and the Federal Executive immediately after. / 3 </p>
<p>3.7/<br />
Q. Sir, most of these things presumably, wil 1 have<br />
to be translated into Government policy. National<br />
goals is a philosophical thing Can you tell -us what<br />
deicisions were made in that area<br />
PM: No, I can't, because for most of them, there are<br />
so many of them, they will, I believe, each one<br />
of them, have to be put to the Government. Because for<br />
the most part they deal with social issues: And social<br />
issues of a kind that are of increasing importance in<br />
a public relations sense, and we did decide that<br />
each one of them would have to go to Cabinet for decision.<br />
Q. ( An you tell us some of the recommendations, Sir<br />
PM: No, I can't.<br />
Q. Sir, what's the objection of the Liberal Party<br />
telling us what their policies are<br />
PM: The reason is, and this one of the other papers<br />
that I wasn't going to mention, showing the differences<br />
between the Liberal and Country Parties and the!<br />
Opposition. The simple fact is that in our case they<br />
can ONLY make a recommendation. They can-do no more,<br />
adastfrere are Ministers present on the Standing<br />
Committee on Federal policy, we don't want to put ourselves<br />
in the position where that Committee can make<br />
recommendations which subsequently might not be accepted<br />
by Cabinet as a whole, or might not be regarded as<br />
satisfactory for the Government, which means the<br />
Coalition Parites.<br />
Q But as the Leader of the Liberal Party, Sir,<br />
don't you feel that the Australian public are entitled<br />
to know what the Liberal Party policy is, before it<br />
gets into power?<br />
PM: No, I do not. I believe that when we are<br />
looking at ' policy decisions, we must look at policy<br />
decisions which mean something, and which will be<br />
carried into effect. It is no use flying a kite wheni<br />
there is a possibility that it might not be accepted,<br />
because I think people want predictability and certainty.<br />
That is the reason why we don't announce the recommendations,<br />
and I emphasise again, they are recommendations,<br />
Q. When will Oabinet consider these recommendations?<br />
PM: I can't tell you yet. We've got so much on our<br />
plate at the moment, and I've got to now convert these<br />
into Cabinet documents. that I couldn't give you. But<br />
we will try and get them out as and when we think it is<br />
appropriate and as soon as we can. / 4 </p>
<p>Q. Will it be a matter of weeks or months<br />
PM: I couldn't give you a clue.<br />
Q. At the meeting today, did they discuss the<br />
standing of the Government in the cormmunity<br />
PM: No, they didn't.<br />
Q. Sir to'get an idea of the level on which some<br />
of the discussions took place, to pin you down<br />
the discussion on inimig ration. Did that evolve around<br />
a new immi(; tion policy for the Government, unless you<br />
already have one, or how you can exploit Labor's policy<br />
PM: Mainly, it centered round the paper that was<br />
delivered by the Minister for Immigration, over in<br />
Western Australia, an explanation of what it involved,<br />
and particularly precautions that were necessary that<br />
there could be no possibility of the idea of racism<br />
entering into considerion of our policies.<br />
Q. But this was the speech in which he talked about<br />
racism ? 0<br />
PM: Mfe made it abundantly clear that there was no<br />
racism in our policies.<br />
Q WHich Minister for Immigration, Dr. Forbes<br />
PM: Dr. Forbes.<br />
Q It would appear therefore, that your discussion<br />
on immigration was on status quo. Dr. Forbes did not<br />
put forward any new<br />
PM: I won't go any further than that because now<br />
you are starting to cross-examine me on an aspect that<br />
I'm not prepared to be cross-examined on . I said that<br />
we are here to give you an outline of what happened at<br />
the Standing Committee on Federal Policy, and whatever<br />
whaasd dtoi sguoc ssteod , a wMaisn isdtiesrc usosr edt o onCA btihme-etb, a ckagnrd outnhda t thIa t woiutld<br />
not elaborate fully on those untill the Minister or<br />
Cabinethad considered it.<br />
Q. You'd said it was based on Dr. Forbbs paper......<br />
PM:-' Based upon' is the word I used.<br />
Q. And Dr. Forbes' paper did not advance policy<br />
PM: I didn't say that at all, I eaid ' based upon'.<br />
Q. Sir,-it's been suggested that there will be<br />
a racist tone in the campaign<br />
PM,: There'll be nio racist slant to the campaign in<br />
any shape or form, and no-one, of goodwill and honesty<br />
of intention, can think, if they look at the components<br />
of our immigration programme, that racism can be involved. </p>
<p>Prime Minister, you suggested that the policy<br />
decisions if adopted by the CAbinet, and yourself, would<br />
be spaced out possibly. That is what the Standing<br />
Committee recommended. Do you see that some of these<br />
might be acted upon and brought into Parliament before<br />
the House rises, say on May 25, or thereabouts<br />
PM: I'd be fairly certain that some of them will be<br />
because they want them spaced out, and they want the<br />
people to understand that work is being done now, and<br />
put quickly into -operation so that the people get the<br />
benefit.<br />
Q. That only gives you seven weeks though<br />
PM: Yes, but that's not a bad time.<br />
Q. SIr,-. what justification is there in holding on<br />
to policies until three weeks before the election, at<br />
this stage<br />
PM: I think if you had a great deal of experience of<br />
policy-making and policy speeches, you'd have to accept<br />
that no one has ever gone into an election campaign<br />
without some policy matters. But that doesn't aniswerI<br />
the question. As I put it to you, we will * be making<br />
policy announcements as and when we can, and we will be<br />
trying to do in a pretty regular fashion, and as and when<br />
we ' re in a position to make the policy announcement.<br />
In other words, unless there is something quite precisely<br />
and definitely associated with the policy speech, we'll<br />
make them immediately.<br />
Q. Did you say that to the Policy Committee<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
Q. Could I take you a step further on that one?<br />
PM: Alan, which are you talking about. I've been<br />
putting the point of view that I have for long that<br />
you can't save anything up for the Budget or for a<br />
policy speech. You can't do that. And speaking in a<br />
background way, I've been like a bullocky driving a<br />
bullock team in order to ensure that we do, whenever<br />
we can make a decision, we make it and we announce it,<br />
and this is now generally accepted.<br />
Q. This was a change of attitude? I had the impression<br />
that policy-planning was in fact planning for your policy<br />
speech..<br />
PM: I think you can take it that it is a total change<br />
of policy.<br />
Q. You talked them around you said now ' Let's<br />
get the think out as we arrive at it' </p>
<p>6. 2-3<br />
PM: And it doesn't only apply to background. It<br />
applies to Government as well. another<br />
Q. Sir, I'd like to ask question on imlration<br />
that I hope you can clarify. Dr. Forbes' spe9c; T-h I c h<br />
you said was the basis of this discussion, was interpreted<br />
in the press publicly as an attempt to raise the issue of<br />
Labor opening the flood-gates, and I think Alan wrote a<br />
piece calling it a " grubby little speech". Was today's<br />
discussion aimed at making sure that this approach wasn't<br />
adopted at any Government<br />
PM: I've said that I will go no further because<br />
I said it was the basis on which we started to discuss it;<br />
I'm not going any further until I take the matter back to<br />
Cabinet again and we are definitive on what we're doing.<br />
What I will say is that the basis on which we act is<br />
one that we are not, and never have been, racist, and that's<br />
proved by the number of non-European that we permit to come<br />
into the country, and welcome them. And what can be<br />
recorded, if you wish to call it, the Oppermann concept<br />
which sets out our policy. For the rest, I go no further<br />
because we will be having another good look at this,<br />
particularly with regard to assisted passages, adid then<br />
we'll be able to make a decision.<br />
Q. Did you say numbers of assisted passages for<br />
widening it<br />
PM: Look, I'm not going any further on this. That's<br />
as far as I'll go.<br />
Q. I doh't want to ask about Government policy, but<br />
from what you've said, immigr.-i&amp; ton will not be an<br />
election campaign<br />
PM: I didn't say that, and I don't mean it.<br />
Q. Well, on what grounds would it be a campaign i' 3sue<br />
PM: I will not go any further than I've already gone.<br />
0 Q. PRIME iVIinister, could you tell me why you called<br />
it the loppermann concept" I thought the most recent<br />
change in Government policy was the Snedden concept where<br />
we did in fact step up our intake of non-Europeans<br />
PM. Yes, but the Oppermann concept is the three<br />
conditions on which we accept non-Europeans. But I'm<br />
not going any further on the immigration one.<br />
Q. Could I ask you a question not applying to your<br />
policy, but about I was in Parramatta last night,<br />
and I was shown the Documents had been placed in a<br />
letterbox saying ' If you want a nigger neighbour, vote<br />
Labor'. Do you have any comment on that sort of campaign / 7. </p>
<p>PM I have never seen one. I hope I don't ever see one.<br />
I think it's a disgraceful way of acting.<br />
Q. PM, I realise we are not going any further on<br />
immigration<br />
PM: Look, I'm not going any further<br />
Q. I'd like to decide a point which Mr Reid made,<br />
when he looked up in suprise when you said ' you'd be<br />
looking at this in the context of assisted passage'<br />
Now you mean assisted passage as we accept it now<br />
PM: We'll be looking at this whole question. I go no<br />
further than saying that. I'm not going to be drawn in.<br />
Q. Sir, you've already gone to a point where you've<br />
made it very major. I mean to say, at present the<br />
principle is assisted passages for Euorpeans. The<br />
Government has stated, as a matter of definitive policy,<br />
no assisted passage for non-Euorpean migrants. Now you<br />
are saying you are going to look at assisted passages.<br />
PM: In a different context altogether from the one<br />
you're trying to imply that I'm getting into. We -are<br />
not going to cut down on the number of migrants.<br />
Q. That's the point I want to make clear.<br />
PM: We are not going to cut down on the number.<br />
Q. Will you be putting most of the recommendations<br />
from this meeting through CAbinet yourself?<br />
PM: No, they tjo through the relevant Minister.<br />
Q. Just for historical purposes, Sir, why do you<br />
say the Oppermann concept and not the whole concept<br />
PM: Look, I'm not going any further than that other than<br />
the issue was raised and I was just raising the Oppeimann<br />
concept to explain what our attitude was. And that has<br />
notbeen changed.<br />
Qould we have two more quesi-icns please<br />
PM: Well, look it was a pity that we spent so much time<br />
on o~ ne subject. I<br />
Q. Are you confident that the House will rise as planned<br />
PM: I will make a decision on that because I am not going<br />
to permit the House to rise until we've finished our business. </p>
<p>Q. Does that mean Sir, that you are going to keep to<br />
your three weeks prelimary that no legislation can be<br />
introduced three weeks before the House rises<br />
PM: We will try. -, But I am not going to raise the<br />
House prematurely.<br />
Q. So it's not a fixed rising period<br />
PM: We will try to the best of our capacity we will<br />
try to raise it on that particular date. But if I find<br />
that it's going to be a rush, the House is. not going to<br />
rise,<br />
Q. Sir, could I ask when we might have a general<br />
on-record press conference<br />
PM: You find the time for me.<br />
Q. Well, Sir, in view of the fact that there hasn't<br />
been one this year<br />
PM: Look, I've had a fair amount of exposure. I will<br />
try and give you one. My trouble is how I get lthrough<br />
the work, as I explained to. you when I met you the other<br />
night: The only real difficulty I've got.* 1<br />
Q. Sir, as an alternative, we got a few minutes left,<br />
could we ask you about other subjects now.<br />
PM: No.<br />
Q. Will you make any comment on the last public<br />
opinion poll<br />
PM: No.<br />
Q. Any reason why not Sir<br />
PM: I haven't got to answer every question that is asked.<br />
And you've formed your opinions and I don't want to get<br />
into an argument between yourself and myself. </p>
