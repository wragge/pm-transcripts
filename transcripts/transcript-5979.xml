FIRST AUSTRALIAN IN SP~ ACE<br />
( Statement by the Acting Prime Minister,<br />
the Rt lion. J. D. Anthony, C. H. M. P.)<br />
Australia has accepted an United States Government offer of<br />
a place for an Australian on the Space Shuttle.<br />
The-first Australian in space is scheduled to be on board<br />
the Space Shuttle which launches Australia's domestic<br />
communications satellite in the second half of 1985.<br />
Two Australians will be selected for special training by the<br />
U. S. National Aeronautic and Space Administration ( NASA). They<br />
will be payload experts, with one to be a crew member, and the<br />
second a back-up.<br />
The Department of Science and Technology will be responsible<br />
for the selection of the astronauts and other arrangements, in<br />
association with AUSSAT, the company which owns and manages the<br />
satellite system.<br />
Australia is one of the first countries to receive such an<br />
invitation, and it is a tribute to the high standards which<br />
Australia has maintained in past co-operation with the U. S. space<br />
program. Australia will now be involved at the forefront of space<br />
research and development, and this will provide an important<br />
stimulus for the further development of high technology industry.<br />
It is particularly appropriate that Australians will. be<br />
directly involved with the launching of the Australian satellite,<br />
and it is further evidence of the -technological advances that<br />
flow from the government's decision to proceed with the<br />
Australian satellite system.<br />
