    <content><![CDATA[<p>
Prime Minister Julia Gillard today announced arrangements for an Independent Review of the Intelligence Community to start in early 2011.</p>
<p>Intelligence plays a key role in preserving Australia's national security and supports a wide range of our national interests.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said the review will ensure Australia continues to have a well-coordinated, appropriately resourced and adaptable intelligence system that supports our national interests.</p>
<p>The aim of the review is to ensure Australian intelligence agencies are working effectively together and are well positioned for challenges in a constantly evolving security environment.</p>
<p>The review will also consider working arrangements between intelligence agencies and their international partners.</p>
<p>It will take into account the significant growth in the intelligence community's resources and capabilities over the past decade.</p>
<p>The timing of the review meets a recommendation of the Inquiry into Australian Intelligence Agencies in 2004 by Mr Philip Flood AO, that the intelligence agencies undergo further external review every five to seven years. Funding for the Review was announced in the Budget in May this year.</p>
<p>The 2011 Review will be led jointly by Mr Robert Cornall AO and Associate Professor Rufus Black.</p>
<p>Mr Cornall has extensive experience at a high level in public administration, particularly as the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department until his retirement in 2008.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Black is the highly regarded Master of Ormond College at the University of Melbourne, and a notable ethicist, management consultant and theologian.</p>
<p>The Review will produce its final report to the Government around the middle of 2011.</p>
<p>The Terms of Reference for the Review and the biographies of Mr Cornall and Associate Professor Black are available at: <a href="http://www.dpmc.gov.au/publications/iric/index.cfm">http://www.dpmc.gov.au/publications/iric/index.cfm</a>.</p>
