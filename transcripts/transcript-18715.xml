<p>People with disability in the ACT will be among the first to benefit from the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) as a result of yesterday's historic agreement to have a launch site in the ACT.</p>
<p>About 6,000 people under the age of 65 with disability in the ACT will benefit under this first stage of an NDIS.</p>
<p>Under an NDIS, people with a disability in the ACT will for the first time:</p>
<p>• be assessed to receive individualised care and support packages;• have decision-making power about their care and support, including choosing their service provider;• be assisted by local coordinators to help manage and deliver their support; and• access a system they can easily navigate and will link them to mainstream and community services.</p>
<p>Speaking at Black Mountain School, the Prime Minister said that the Federal and ACT Governments would work together to provide people with disability, their families and carers with the care and support they need, when they need it.</p>
<p>This work will include developing a consistent approach to assessing people's needs; and working with service providers to build the capacity of the ACT disability care workforce.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government has delivered $1 billion over four years in the 2012-13 Budget to start rolling out the first stage of an NDIS.</p>
<p>Around $19 million will be delivered for a launch in the ACT.</p>
<p>The ACT Government is also contributing around $8 million to the costs of launch, recognising governments' shared responsibility to make this landmark reform a reality.</p>
<p>This funding will cover the costs of care and support for individuals, local area coordinators and a new agency to manage the first stage of an NDIS.</p>
<p>The ACT is one of three states that have been selected for the first stage of the scheme.</p>
<p>The first stage of an NDIS will begin in mid-2013 and will provide care and support to thousands of people with significant and permanent disabilities in locations across the country.</p>
<p>The Australian Government sought expressions of interest from all states and territories to participate in this first stage.</p>
