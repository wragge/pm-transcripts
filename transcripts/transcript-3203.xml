PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 211<br />
2 April 1974<br />
TORRES STRAIT MARINE PARK<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr whitlam said tonight that he wrote<br />
to Mr Bielkc Petersen in December 1972 suggesting that Papua New Guinea,<br />
Queensland and Australian officials hold discussions, but<br />
Mr Bjelke Petersen had said he could not see that any good purpose<br />
would be served by such a meeting.<br />
Since then, Ministerial and official discussions have<br />
been held between the Australian and Papua New Guinea Governments.<br />
There have been consultations with the Torres Strait Islanders and<br />
discussions have been arranged between the Torres Strait Is~ landers<br />
and the coastal peoiple of Papua New Guinea.<br />
Arising out of these discussions, proposals have been<br />
put forward for an agreement between the Government which would<br />
protect the environment of the Torres Strait and the way of life<br />
of the Isltinders and the coastal people. Queensland officials have<br />
been kept informed of these proposals. As the issues have not yet<br />
been discussed between the Australian and Papua New Guinea Governments,<br />
it is not possible to conclude whether such an agreement would heacceptable<br />
to the Governments and the peoples concerned. The Australian<br />
Government is hopeful that the concept of an environmentally protected<br />
area can contribute to a satisfactory settlement.<br />
The Prime Minister said that in view of the Premier's<br />
changed attitude hie would again invite the Queensland Government to<br />
take part in official discussions with the Australian and Papua New<br />
Guinea Governments with a view to reaching an agreed settlement.<br />
The Prime Minister-stressed, however, that negotiations<br />
on such a settlement could only be undertaken by the two Governments<br />
concerned that is Papua New Guinea and Australia. Papua New Guinea<br />
is not able to reach a separate agreement with Queensland and this<br />
is understood and accepted by Mr Somare.<br />
