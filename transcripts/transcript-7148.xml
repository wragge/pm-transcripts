TRANSCRIPT OF COMMENTS, PARLIAMENT HOUSE WEDNESDAY 1 APRIL 1987<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Good morning Mr Hawke, are you going to have an<br />
early election?<br />
PM: Can't we have a change of track? We've been through<br />
all that yesterday.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you made up your mind?<br />
PM: No I haven't made up my mind. As I said yesterday at<br />
that lovely press conference, it won't be long before you<br />
know. Now what else do you want to know about?<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard accuses you of being indecisive about<br />
it.<br />
PM: Mr Howard accuses me of being indecisive. Well I just<br />
remind you again of Mr Howard's track record. Just a week<br />
ago he said, my first obligation is to protect the<br />
independence and integrity of the Liberal Party. within 24<br />
hours he'd gone to water on the Equal Employment Opportunity<br />
Bill. Now don't let's have any nonsense from this fellow,<br />
he's increasingly irrelevant at any rate.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, Mi~ Brown apparently is suggesting he<br />
might take you to court over comments you made<br />
PM: Oh is he? I'd love to see him in court.<br />
JOURNALIST: You feel confident about the assessment you<br />
made? PM: Mr Brown! Let's stop talking about the jokes of<br />
Australian politics.<br />
ends </p>
