    <content><![CDATA[<p>I have been briefed on new analysis of radar data on the flight path of MH370 and the consequent shift in the search area announced by AMSA today.</p>
<p>This is a credible new lead and will be thoroughly investigated today. Ten aircraft, six vessels and satellites will focus on the new search area.</p>
<p>This is an extraordinarily difficult search, and an agonising wait for family and friends of the passengers and crew.</p>
<p>As I have said from the start, we owe it to them to follow every credible lead and to keep the public informed of significant new developments. That is what we are doing.</p>
<p>Leading experts from around the world are working to solve this baffling mystery. Civilian and military personnel from Australia, the United States, New Zealand, China, Japan and South Korea have been working around the clock in very difficult conditions. We should all be very proud of their efforts.</p>
<p>It has been a truly remarkable international effort.</p>
<p>We will continue to work closely with the Malaysian and Chinese governments and with all our international partners to locate MH370 and find answers to what happened to it.</p>
