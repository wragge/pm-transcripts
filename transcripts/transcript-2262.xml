FGR PRESS: P. M. No 76/ 1970<br />
DEATH OF MR. IAIN MACLEGD<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Go:-. ton<br />
I am sorry to learn of the death of Mr. lain MacLeo. 3019<br />
This is a sad loss to the new British Government.<br />
Mr. MacLeod had a distinguished record in the British<br />
Parliament, having been a Minister in Conservative Gover-.; ments over<br />
a period of eleven years.<br />
It is a matter of deep regret that he was not spared to serve<br />
his country in his new appointment as Chancellor of the Exchequer.<br />
I extend my sympathy to his colleagues and to his family.<br />
