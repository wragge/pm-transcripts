FOR PESNSo:. P2.6M/ 1.9 59.<br />
THE WORLD REFUGEE YEAR.<br />
Statement by the Acting Prime Minister, IRt. Hon. J. McEwen, M. P.<br />
" This year will be known as the World Refugee Year.<br />
This Sunday, 28th June, has been set aside as a day of prayer<br />
for the refugee and for the dedication of the concept of the<br />
World Refugee Year." Stating this today the Acting Prime Minister,<br />
Mr. McEwen, asked Australians to remember the refugee in their<br />
prayers. " The concept of the World Refugee Year originated in the<br />
United Kingdom in April 1958, when attention was drawn to the<br />
major international problems of the refugees who are the<br />
continuing tragedy of our time. To-day there are in Europe more<br />
than 160,000 refugees and these are being added to daily. In<br />
the Middle East there are one million Arab refugees; in China,<br />
10,000 refugees of European origin, and in Hong Kong at least<br />
one million Chinese refugees.<br />
" To focus international attention on the plight of these<br />
people, it was proposed that the World Refugee Year should serve<br />
as the medium for an all out effort to solve their problems.<br />
" Member Governments of the United Nations and its<br />
specialised agencies were urged to co-operate in promoting the<br />
World Refugee Year as a practical means of securing increased<br />
assistance for refugees throughout the world, and the Secretary-<br />
General was requested to take such steps as he saw fit to assist<br />
in the promotion of the World Refugee Year.<br />
" Australia's role in the World Refugee Year has<br />
recently been considered by the Commonwealth Government. As a<br />
result, a National Committee for the World Refugee Year Appeal<br />
has been formed under the auspices of the United Nations<br />
Association of Australia, which in close co-operation with other<br />
interested organisations, has agreed to organise a public appeal<br />
for funds. The Australian Government will contribute Å C50,000<br />
towards this appeal, whilst we are also taking appropriate steps<br />
to make public donations allowable deductions for income tax<br />
purposes as from 1st July. The purpose of this appeal is a most<br />
worthy one and I have no hesitation in commending it to you.<br />
" The Australian Government has already brought to these<br />
shores more than 234~, 000 refugees making us, on a population<br />
basis, the leading country of resettlement for refugees. The<br />
World Refugee Year presents an opportunity for us to add further<br />
to this impressive record.<br />
" I am confident that you will all wish to be associated<br />
with this humanitarian task."<br />
CANBERRA A. C. T.<br />
27th June, 1959.<br />
