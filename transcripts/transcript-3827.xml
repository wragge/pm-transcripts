I lr Speech by the -Prime Minister at Opening of<br />
. Ipswich, C ivic Hall.,. July. 19 75<br />
Mr Mayor., Madam Mayoress, Treasurer, Mrs Hayden, Ministers<br />
Mrs Campbell, Mrs Edwards, Senator and Mrs Bonner,<br />
Mr Marginson, Mrs Marginson, Mr Hales, M. L. A.<br />
Mrs Hales, Civic Fathers and Citizens.<br />
Now this is the formal opening that I am about to perform. I<br />
did the symbolic opening two hours ago at dusk in the presence<br />
of hundreds and hundreds of the rising generation. And I believe<br />
that symbolises what this occasion means for this city. Because<br />
there were representatives, it seemed to me) of all possible<br />
youth groups in the city and round about there gathered to<br />
watch me unveil the plaque commemorating the opening of the<br />
Civic Hall. The first instalment of the great new civic centre<br />
which will embellish and exalt the heart of this ancient citythe<br />
oldest free city, I'm always told, in Queensland.<br />
Because all the people who were watching there for the rest of<br />
their lives will remember this day, what it means to them. This<br />
Civic Hall provides facilities for a great range of activities.<br />
That the whole of civic centre contains two whole city blocks,<br />
we will be the heart of all the activities which a modern city,<br />
a complete community should provide. And which the rising<br />
generation expects.<br />
Now in this auditorium where I am speaking now there are many<br />
many hundreds of citizens. In the intervening two hours the<br />
Mayor and Mayoress entertained many of us in the lower ground<br />
floor. There are three rooms there, the Cunningham room, the<br />
Logan room and the Lockyer room. We were in the Cunningham room,<br />
the largest and we were very well entertained and replenished and<br />
fortified and prepared. The civic fathers did us very well<br />
indeed and we who were in the Cunningham room are grateful to<br />
them. I thought probably the Cunningham room was the most suitable<br />
place to entertain us in the intervening two hours, not only<br />
because of its size but because of its association, the fact<br />
that Alan Cunningham discovered the place. It mightn't have been<br />
appropriate to have the meeting in the Logan room because that,<br />
of course, is named after the Commandant of the Penal Settlementthe<br />
original foundation in this State. I wouldn't have minded<br />
the Lockyer room because Lockyer was a very great man and one<br />
of those whom I have always aspired to follow. His son was<br />
a very great man, a member of the old Interstate Commission,<br />
the original Interstate Commission, and he was born when the<br />
Lockyer who's remembered round here, was 71 years of age.<br />
So, of course, -we in Public life always regard Lockyer<br />
as a proper example to follow. </p>

Now this occasion is the third that my wife and I have been<br />
here last year and this. My wife was here early last year<br />
just after the floods. I was here late in the year, some<br />
people said just before the deluge But we've come together<br />
on this occasion, the date was ar . ranged between the Mayor and<br />
me through the intervention of Bill Hayden, who is, I'm<br />
certain , about to 6 ffect a successful transition from the most<br />
enlightened and benevolent Minister for Social Security the<br />
country has ever had to the greatest of Australian Treasurers.<br />
But you know, and I can never forget, he is also the M. P. for<br />
Oxley. And he deliberately arranged, I'm certain, for this'<br />
opening to coincide with the weekend immediately before we<br />
consider the Budget. Because I believe he wanted to bring<br />
home to me the demonstration of what the Australian Government<br />
should be doing because in Ipswich we can very easily see in<br />
many ways what it can do in respect to local government and<br />
civic and community facilities..<br />
A few years ago it would have been remarkable to ask a Prime<br />
Minister to open any Municipal civic facility . such as this.<br />
In fact, I receive a remarkable number of such invitations<br />
these days from Cairns to here, over the border to Murwillumbah<br />
and so on. And I think it is because my Government is the first<br />
Australian Government which has accepted a responsibility in<br />
respect to local government. And-the Mayor has already mentioned<br />
some of them. I think next Tuesday we start clearing the site<br />
for the Humanities Building $ 800,000 part of the Regional<br />
Employment Development Scheme. But last year, last financial<br />
year, for the first time the Australian Government asked the<br />
Australian Parliament to make provision for grants to local<br />
governments. And it did so on advice of an expert impartial<br />
body, the Grants Commission, and Ipswich got about $ 360,000 to<br />
spend as it wished. Brisbane got more, $ 2 million, more than<br />
any place in Australia. But you've got more than most.<br />
And then I recall that last financial year there was $ 840,000<br />
provided for the National Sewerage Program for Ipswich;<br />
$ 200,000 for Child Minding Centres; another $ 800,000 for<br />
Regional Employment Development; there is going to be a<br />
$ 1 million office block; and then there is going to be a<br />
Queensland Government Office Block which means that in these<br />
two blocks citizens will be able to have all facilities<br />
provided by local government, State government, Federal<br />
government handy to each other. Very puzzling for citizens<br />
to know where they can get assistance or advice from elected<br />
representatives. It will' be easier than most places to find out<br />
and to get the assistance and advice in Ipswich because they<br />
will all be adjacent to each other in proper buildings. The<br />
staff will be servicing their fellow citizens in a convenient<br />
spot and decent building.<br />
Then I should mention Community Health Centre in East Street<br />
and the Australian Legal Aid Office. In*, all these respects<br />
I think can be seen, that there hare been initiatives which<br />
mean that if citizens want professional advice, medical or<br />
legal, if they want Governmental advice, if they need<br />
municipal facilities, public facilities, then they are on the<br />
way to being provided. / 3 </p>
<p>V6 3.<br />
It's a very happy moment, indeed, for me to come to Ipswich<br />
first, so that one can see these things properly arranged<br />
side by side, planned ahead. This is the largest building<br />
erected in Ipswich for very many years. In the heart of the<br />
city there are other buildings to follow. A whole range of<br />
facilities which we can't provide as individuals or as<br />
families will now be provided through proper cooperation, local,<br />
State and Federal, in the heart of this old city, this city<br />
which from now on will have as modern and appropriate facilities<br />
as any city in Australia.<br />
Thank you very much indeed for asking my wife and me to be with<br />
you on this opening night. We are enjoying ourselves immensely.<br />
And looking at all the people as we come in, I'm certain we can<br />
be proud to think that as ratepayers, as taxpayers, as electorate<br />
persons, as citizens, we are building well for the future of<br />
this regional centre, this great provincial city, this oldest<br />
free city in Queensland. And as I come into your airport,<br />
Amberley itself, to go back tonight to Canberra, I realise how<br />
easy it is to get here, how pleasant it is and when you're here<br />
how hospitable the place is.<br />
Mr Mayor, Madam Mayoress thank you very much for your invitation<br />
on behalf of your fellow citizens to me and my wife to come<br />
here at the inauguration of the Ipswich Civic Centre and in<br />
particular to the opening of the Ipswich Civic Hall. I wish<br />
well to everybody who comes to this auditorium, everybody who<br />
partakes of the hospitality in the lower ground floor; all the<br />
people who come to the seminars, the exhibitions, that will be<br />
held week in, week out, in this great building the Centre of<br />
Ipswich, the revived exalted part of this city.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, I now declare officially open the Ipswich<br />
Civic Hall. </p>
