N HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
5 DECEMBER 1974<br />
A YEAR AGO I REPORTED TO THE PARLIAMENTrI ON THE GOVERNMENT<br />
S FIRST YEAR IN OFFICE. IT WAS A YEAR OF FAR-REACHING<br />
REFORM, OF UNPRECEDENTED ACHIEVEMENT, OF-LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY<br />
SURPASSING ALL RECORDS. IENDED MY SPEECH WITH THESE WORDS:<br />
" AM CONFIDENT'THAT THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE, WHE-N NEXT THEY<br />
ARE ASKED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE ALTERNATIVES BEFORE THEM, WILL<br />
ENDORSE OUR RECORD AND RENEW OUR MANDATE..<br />
THE PEOPLE DID SO. IN-APRIL THIS YEARo FOR THE FIRST<br />
TIME IN THE HISTORY OF AUSTRALIA'S NATIONAL PARLIAMENT, THE<br />
" OPPOSITION IN THE SENATE REFUSED SUPPLY TO THE ELECTED<br />
GOVERNMENT. THEY FORCED AN ELECTION BY V-IOLATING AN ESTABLISHEDACCEPTED<br />
CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE. SENATORS ELECTED' 3k YEARS<br />
AND 6 YEARS BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES$<br />
SENATORS WHO HAD ALREADY BLOCKED ESSENTIAL PARTS OF OUR LEGISLATIVE<br />
PROGRAM, FORCED US TO THE POLLS HALFWAY THROUGH OUR TERM.<br />
WE ACCEPTED THEIR CHALLENGE. WE WENT TO THE PEOPLE<br />
AND THE PEOPLE RETURNED US TO OFFICE. ON 18 MAY, AUSTRALIANS,<br />
CONFIRMED THEIR DECISION OF 2 DECEMBER 1972.. s vN a 2/ s </p>
<p>T* T.<br />
i i 2.<br />
.; THEY ENDORSED OUR PROGRAM, THEY STRENGTHENED OUR': ' C<br />
POSITION IN THE SENATE; THEY ANNIHILATED THE D. L. P. SENATORS.';<br />
: WHOo . C OLLABORATED IN THIS ABUSE OF DEMOCRACY. THEY. CONFIRMED<br />
LABOR'S VOTE IN THE CITIES WHERE THE GOVERNMENT SECURED<br />
MANDATE 17 MONTHS' BEFORE. THEY GAVE US CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS<br />
TO CARRY ON WITH THE JOB THE JOB THEY HAD ELECTED US TO DO.<br />
SWE ACCEPTED THOSE INSTRUCTIONS AND IMMEIATELY SET<br />
ABOUT TO DISCHARGE THEM. -WE HAVE WORKED UNREMITTINGLY TO..<br />
FULFIL OUR UNDERTAKINGS TO THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE. IT HAS NOTi<br />
BEEN EASY.-WE HAVE CONTENDED WITH THE SAME OBSTRUCTION WE<br />
FACED LAST YEAR. YET OUR RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT IN 1974 IS<br />
AS SOLID AND IMPRESSIVE AS IT WAS LAST YEAR,<br />
OUR LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM IN 1974 WAS CARRIED. THROUGH<br />
ON THE SAME MASSIVE SCALE AS LAST YEAR. WHEN THE 28TH PARLIAMENT<br />
ADJOURNED FOR CHRISTMAS LAST YEAR, 254 BILLS HAD BEEN INTRODUCED.<br />
A FURTHER 42 WERE INTRODUCED BEFORE THE PARLIAMENT WAS DISSOLVED<br />
IN APRIL. DURING THE 29TH PARLIAMENT, A TOTAL OF 187 BILLS HAS<br />
BEEN INTRODUCED SO FAR. THE PARLIAMENT HAS THEREFORE DEALT<br />
WITH 229 BILLS IN' 1974 A FIGURE THAT EXCEEDS ALL RECORDS FOR<br />
A SINGLE YEAR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 1973. WE HAVE SAT FOR A<br />
TOTAL OF HOURS IN 1974 COMPARED WITH 908 HOURS IN 1973.<br />
THE FIGURES FOR EITHER YEAR REPRESENT THE GREATEST NUMBER OF<br />
SITTING HOURS IN SE YEAR FOR MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY, </p>
<p>3<br />
WE HAVE CONSOLIDATED AND EXPANDED THE GREAT REFORMS , i<br />
WE BEGAN IN 1973. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR WE HAVE. CONTENDED<br />
WITH ECONOMIC PROBLEMS ON A SCALE UNKNOWN FOR MORE THAN<br />
YEARS. SUCH PROBLEMS WOULD BE DAUNTING FOR ANY GOVERNMENT<br />
FOR A LABOR GOVERNMENT, COMMITTED TO REFORM AND INNOVATION<br />
' ON THE WIDEST FRONT, THEY HAVE BEEN DOUBLY BITTER AND<br />
SFRUSTRATING. YET WE HAVE NEVER RELAXED OUR EFFORTS TO DEAL<br />
WITH INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT.' EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WESTERN<br />
WORLD HAS FACED THESE PROBLEMS. NO COUNTRY IN THE WESTERN<br />
WORLD HAS SOLVED THEM. OUR RECORD STANDS UP WELL BESIDE<br />
S" THAT OF ANY OTHER COMPARABLE NATION. S. , Io<br />
a </p>
<p>-7 7<br />
DESPITE THESE PROBLEMS, AUSTRALIANS TODAY ARE<br />
EVERYWHERE BETTER ' OFF THAN THEY WERE WHEN LABOR CAME IN.,:<br />
AVERAGE EARNINGS HAVE INCREASED IN REAL PURCHASING POWER<br />
BY MORE THAN SEVEN PER CENT UNDER A LABOR GOVERNMENT.<br />
OUR MEASURES TO STRENGTHEN AND INVIGORATE THE ECONOMY ARE<br />
CONTINUING. WE NO LONGER REGARD THE BUDGET AS THE SOLE<br />
INSTRUMENT OF ECONOMIC POLICY. THIS YEAR, FACED WITH<br />
UNPRECEDENTED AND COMPLEX PROBLEMS OF ECONOMIC IANAGEMENT,<br />
WE HAVE SHOWN OURSELVES READY TO ACT WHENEVER NECESSARY.<br />
THREE WEEKS AGO WE ANNOUNCED CUTS IN TAXATION WORTH<br />
$ 1200 MILLION IN A FULL YEAR. WE HAVE EASED CREDIT AND<br />
BOOSTED THE MONEY SUPPLY TO MAINTAIN EMPLOYMENT, EVERY<br />
FINANCIAL WEAPON, EVERY CONSTITUTIONAL POWER AT OUR<br />
DISPOSAL HAS BEEN USED IN OUR FIGHT AGAINST INFLATION<br />
AND UNEMPLOYMENT. WHENEVER IT HAS BEEN NECESSARY TO<br />
TAKE ACTION WHICH MAY HARM INDIVIDUALS OR COMPANIES,<br />
WE HAVE DONE OUR BEST TO SHIELD THOSE AFFECTED AND CUSHION THE<br />
EFFECTS OF OUR DECISIONS. </p>
<p>v i 1 rCi; I i<br />
g<br />
ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, HOWEVER, HAVE NOT BEEN OURONLY<br />
DISTRACTION;. THE WORK OF THE PARLIAMENT HAS BEEN MADE<br />
INFINITELY MORE ARDUOUS AND PROTRACTED BY THE BEHAVIOUR OF<br />
THE SENATE, THE DEFERMENT OR REJECTION OF A BILLDOES NOT<br />
AFFECT THAT BILL ALONE; IT DELAYS AND COMPLICATES THE<br />
S GOVERNMENT'S WHOLE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM. IT FORCES THE<br />
PARLIAMENT TO DEAL WITH MEASURES OVER AND OVER AGAIN. OUR<br />
FOUR REFERENDUM BILLS WERE REJECTED TWICE'BY THE SENATE<br />
DESPITE'THE FACT THAT THEIR REJECTION COULD NOT PREVENT.<br />
THE REFERENDUMS BEING HELD, AND OPPOSITION SENATORS KNEW<br />
THIS. THEY PREFERRED TO: DELAY THE BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE.<br />
THE DOUBLE DISSOLUTION WAS AN UNNECESSARY AND INTOLERABLE<br />
INTERRUPTION, NOT ONLY FOR WHAT IT SIGNIFIED, BUT FOR THE<br />
DELAY IT CAUSED TO THE GOVERNMENT'S WORK. TWENTY-TWO<br />
BILLS INTRODUCED DURING THE PREVIOUS PARLIAMENT LAPSED<br />
WHEN THE PARLIAMENT WAS DISSOLVED AND HAD TO BE REINTRODUCED<br />
AND DEBATED AGAIN. DURING THE 29TH PARLIAMENT WHICH MET<br />
IN JULY, THE SENATE HAS REJECTED 12 BILLS, DEFERRED ANOTHER<br />
4 AND AMENDED 8 NOT INCLUDING THOSE PASSED BY THE JOINT<br />
SITTING. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE FACT THAT WE WERE ABLE TO<br />
KEEP THE NUMBER OF SEPARATE BILLS TO A MINIMUM BY<br />
COMBINING RELATED MATTERS IN SINGLE BILLS, THE DELAY AND<br />
INTERFERENCE WITH THE PARLIAMENTARY PROGRAM WOULD HAVE<br />
BEEN MUCH GREATER.<br />

<p>WITH OUR MANDATE RENEWED IN MAY WE WERE READY<br />
TO RESUME THE TASK OF GOVERNMENT WITH-EVEN GREATER VIGOR<br />
AND DETERMINATIONS IF JUSTICE AND SANITY PREVAILED IN<br />
THESE MATTERS, WE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED A FAIR, GO AT LAST<br />
FOR OUR LEGISLATION&amp; WE GOT NO SUCH THING. THE OPPOSITION<br />
LEARNT NOTHING* FROM THEIR DEFEAT.' FOR THE THIRD TIME THEY<br />
REJECTED THE SIX BILLS ON WHICH THE DOUBLE DTSSOLUl ION<br />
WAS GRANTED. HONOURABLE MEMBERS WILL RECALL THE SUBSTANCE<br />
OF THOSE BILLS. THEY WERE THOSE IMPLEMENTING OUR UNIVERSAL<br />
HEALTrH INSURANCE SCHEME, OUR PROPOSAL FOR ONE VOTE ONE<br />
VALUE,' OUR PETROLEUM AND MINERALS AUTHORITY. IHEY FORMED<br />
THE BASIS OF THE DOUBLE DISSOLUTION IN APRIL AND THE<br />
ELECTION WHICH FOLLOWED. THE PEOPLE ENDORSED THESE MEASURES<br />
AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PASSED THEM FOR'THE THIRD<br />
TIME. YET THE SENATE REJECTED THEM AGAIN, KNOWING-THAT<br />
THE JOINT SITTING WOULD EVENTUALLY, INEVITABLY, PASS THEM.<br />
IT WAS A NEEDLESS AND PETTY DELAY.<br />
THE SENATE'S CAMPAIGN OF WANTON OBSTRUCTION DID<br />
NOT END THERE. WITH THE PASSAGE OF OUR HEALTH LEGISLATION<br />
OPPOSITION SENATORS PROCEEDED TO REJECT THE ANCILLARY<br />
BILLS NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT IT.. THEY HAVE REJECTED OUR<br />
LEGISLATION, THREE TIMES PASSED BY THE HOUSE OF<br />
REPRESENTATIVES, TO ESTABLISH THE AUTHORITY-OF THE NATIONAL<br />
PARLIAMENT OVER AUSTRALIA'S OFF-SHORE RESOURCES. THEY HAVE<br />
CONTINUED TO OBSTRUCT OUR PROPOSALS TO EXPAND THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION AND ENABLE IT TO ASSIST<br />
AUSTRALIAN COMPANIES AND PROTECT AUSTRALIAN OWNERSHIP OF<br />
OUR INDUSTRIES. </p>
<p>FOR THE THIRD TIME'THEY. HAVE REJECTED OUR LEGISLATION TO.<br />
ENCOURAGE GREATER INDUSTRIAL HARMONY BY FACILITATING<br />
INDUSTRIAL AGREEMENTS AND UNION AMALGAMATIONS... THEY HAVE.<br />
REJECTED OUR ELECTORAL LEGISLATION WHICH WOULD SIMPLIFY THE<br />
COMPLEX ANDTEDIOUS VOTING METHODS WHICH LEFT AUSTRALIA<br />
WITHOUT A NATIONAL PARLIAMENT BETWEEN 10 APRIL AND 9 JULY.:<br />
ONLY THIS WEEK THEY REJECTED OUR BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION<br />
BILLS AND OTHER LEGISLATION TO ENCOURAGE GREATER AUSTRALIAN<br />
PARTICIPATION IN THE FILM AND TELEVISION INDUSTRY. ALL<br />
THESE MEASURES HAVE BEEN ENDORSED MOST OF THEM ENDORSED<br />
TWICE BY THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE. THE MOST IMPORTANT OF<br />
THEM THOSE WHICH FORMED THE GROUNDS FOR THE DOUBLE DISSOLUTION<br />
HAVE BEEN ENDORSED EMPHATICALLY AND SPECIFICALLY. YET THE<br />
OPPOSITION PERSISENTLY BLOCKS THEM.<br />
THIS PATTERN OF OBSTRUCTION IS A TRAVESTY. OF<br />
THE PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM AND A TRAVESTY OF DEMOCRACY.<br />
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD THE PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM IS UNDER<br />
CHALLENGE: IN EUROPE, IN NORTH AMERICA, EVEN IN BRITAIN<br />
ITSELF. NOWHERE IS THE SYSTEM SO STRONG THAT IT CAN<br />
SUSTAIN THESE ATTACKS ON ITS BASIC FOUNDATIONS. THE<br />
OPPOSITION SENATORS I CERTAINLY DO NOT BLAME THE LEADER<br />
OF THE OPPOSITION FOR THEIR CONDUCT FOR HE IS POWERLESS TO<br />
CONTROL THEM ARE NOT JUST ATTACKING THE LABOR GOVERNMENT,.<br />
THEY HAVE DECLARED WAR ON THE PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM, ON THE<br />
ABILITY OF DULY ELECTED GOVERNMENTS TO GOVERN EFFECTIVELY<br />
AND CARRY THROUGH THEIR PROGRAM WITH THE FAITH AND<br />
CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE. I 1 I<br />
I </p>
<p>11-IMPLEMENTING OUR PROGRAM, ONE OF OUR HUIMARY<br />
4ASKS HAS BEEN TO IMPROVE THE INSTITUTIUNS SERVINGi THE<br />
GOVERNMENT AND-THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO<br />
US. WE HAVE NEVER BEEN READY ' TO ACCEPT THE METHODS OR<br />
THE MACHTNEFY VIE fNHER2ITEI) FPR( MI OUR PREDECESSORS.<br />

PRIORITIES, THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR WE HAVE CONTINUED<br />

PROGRAM-THE PROGRAM I ANNOUNCED IN 1972, THE. PROGRAM<br />

ENDORSED BY THE PEOPLE IN 1974. WE SHALL GO AHEAD<br />

EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL OUR: PEOPLE AND. A<br />
GREATER ABUNDANCE OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES.' WE ARE NOT<br />
GOING TO BE DETERRED FROM THOSE GOALS, THE GOALS<br />
ADOPTED BY THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA IN 1972 AND 1974.<br />
OUR RECORD THIS-YEAR HAS BROUGHT US CLOSER TO THEM.<br />
IEMPHASI SE THAT IN EVERY THING WE DO, IN ALL OUR<br />
PLANS AND DECISIONS, WE SHALL PROCEED ON THE<br />
ASSUMPTION THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL SERVE ITS FULL<br />
ELECTED TERM.' THAT IS THE BASIS ON WHI . CH WE WERE<br />
ELECTED AND THAT IS THE BASIS ON WHICH WE SHALL<br />
PROCEED. II </p>
