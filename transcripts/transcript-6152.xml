AUSTRALIAN SENATE<br />
CANBERRA. A. C. T.<br />
Statement by Senator Susan Ryan, Minister Assisting the<br />
Prime Minister on the Status of Women<br />
ABORIGINAL WOMEN'S TASK FORCE<br />
An Aboriginal Women's Task Force will be established<br />
within the Office of the Status of Women to consult with<br />
Aboriginal women in communities around Australia.<br />
In National Aborigines Week it is particularly<br />
important to identify areas where Aboriginal consultation and<br />
participation can be improved.<br />
The Task Force will be seeking Aboriginal women's<br />
views on a wide range of issues including land rights, culture,<br />
health, housing, education, employment, legal aid and<br />
adoption and fostering of Aboriginal children.<br />
Task Force members are Phyllis Daylight and Mary<br />
Johnstone. Ms Daylight, was born in Queensland and is an<br />
Education Officer with the Department of Education and Youth<br />
Affairs in Darwin where she has lived for six years. She<br />
will be taking up duty in Canberra soon. Ms Johnstone,<br />
originally from Yass, NSW, is already working in the Office<br />
of the Status of Women preparing the Task Force's program<br />
of consultations. She was formerly on the staff of " edibank<br />
Private in Melbourne and Sydney. They will work closely with<br />
the women members cf the National Aboriginal Conference and<br />
the Federation of Aboriginal Women. The National Aboriginal<br />
Conference has already endorsed the establishment of the Task<br />
Force. The most important objective of the Task Force is to<br />
ensure that Aboriginal women themselves identify their own needs.<br />
The Task Force's recommendations will be based on the<br />
views of Aboriginal women. This will add a vital new dimension<br />
to government planning and programs, and be a first step in<br />
ensuring that the views of Aboriginal women arc taken into<br />
account in the formulation and implementation of government<br />
policy. -oCo-<br />
