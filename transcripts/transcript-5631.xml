the grants payable under the States .( Tax Sharing and Health<br />

Mr Fraser said that the special grants for Queensland payable<br />
in 1981-82 were recor'xended by the Commonwealth Grants<br />
Commission and comprise an interim grant of $ 25 million<br />
in respect of 1980-81 and a completion grant of $ 33.5 million<br />
in respect of 1979-80. The total special grant in respect<br />
of 1979-80 will be $ 44.5 million; Queensland had already<br />
received an advance grant of $ 11 million in 1979-80.<br />
Mr Fraser also said that, in the case of the Northern Territory,<br />
the Memorandum of Understanding provides phase-in arrangements<br />
under which the Territory will receive in 1981-82 either an<br />
additional assistance grant of $ 20 million or a special<br />
grant on the recommendation of the Grants Commission ( based on<br />
comparisons with the States), whichever is the greater. The only<br />
special grant payable to the Northern Territory in 1981-82<br />
recommended by the Com~ mission is a completion grant of<br />
