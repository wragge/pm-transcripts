PM: Thank you very much. I'm joined by Minister Carr and we're here at a Clean Energy Exhibition, at an exhibition of the kind of products that we as a nation are going to rely on in the future.</p>
<p>I've been speaking to the nation for many months now about a clean energy future, about putting a price on carbon, so that we drive innovation and jobs in the future. Today we've got companies with us, companies like Boeing and a number of others that are at the forefront the innovations we need for that clean energy future.</p>
<p>There's some remarkable technology on display, businesses that are able to show you that something that they used to throw out as a waste product, they're now using to generate energy. Businesses that can show you how to create pure drinking water, how do to desalination just using the power of the sun. Businesses that can show you the new lightweight products of the future, less embedded carbon pollution and on your motor vehicle, the lighter it is obviously the less energy it needs to power it.</p>
<p>There are some remarkable things on display here. Part of our clean energy future, part of innovation by Australians, part of our economic future as they go on to use these new products and ways of doing things to create new jobs and new economic opportunities.</p>
<p>I'll ask Minister Carr, who is very familiar with each of these products to make a few comments and then we've got time for a couple of questions.</p>
<p>MINISTER CARR: Well, just quickly, what we are seeing today is a real glimpse of what's possible in this country. Take Boeing  -  Boeing have given CSIRO a special (inaudible), that is a player of the year award from amongst their 17,500 suppliers from around the world.</p>
<p>And it highlights the point that our science and our research institutes are going to be on the frontline of the great transformation that's underway in his country, as we move towards a new economy, as we build new opportunities, new jobs, high skilled, high wage jobs, for Australians into the future.</p>
<p>And what we've seen today are the sorts of opportunities that are available so that we can ensure that the prosperity that this country has enjoyed will be maintained and that we can share the benefits of a new way of doing business through innovation.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: (inaudible) discuss the allegations against Craig Thomson with you?</p>
<p>PM: I certainly talked to Mr Thomson and I made a statement to the Parliament about these matters yesterday and I'm happy to stand by and repeat that statement.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Ted Baillieu doesn't seem to agree with your clean energy future package and says that it's going to cost jobs, there will be less jobs than would otherwise be created. What will you be saying to the premiers tomorrow about all this?</p>
<p>PM: What I'll be saying to Premier Baillieu and to all of the other premiers is that we will be putting a price on carbon, we will continue to grow economically and we will create more jobs  -  1.6 million more jobs by 2020 and we will ensure that our nation is part of the clean energy future.</p>
<p>We actually, as we've talked to the people staffing these displays, brining their products and know-how and innovations to Canberra, we had one person talk to us how they missed out and our country missed out on an early wave of innovation and how determined they are to make sure we as a nation don't miss out on this wave of innovation.</p>
<p>I'm absolutely determined this nation doesn't miss out, that we've got the clean energy jobs of the future, we've got the know-how, we've got the ingenuity, we've got the expertise, what we've got to do is have a price on carbon to drive that transformation in our economy.</p>
<p>What I'll also be saying specifically to Premier Baillieu in relation to the so-called modelling that he released today, no one should be confused about the statistics put out by Premier Baillieu. He has purported to model putting a price on carbon, without factoring in any of the billions of dollars of assistance to protect Australian jobs  -  he knows are part of the package.</p>
<p>This isn't an age for political stunts; this is an age for getting on with the job.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, were you consulted when the New South Wales Labor Party provided Mr Thomson with money to cover his legal costs?</p>
<p>PM: Look, I've dealt with these matters in Parliament yesterday, I've indicated in Parliament yesterday I've got full confidence in Mr Thomson. Let me indicated again today I have full confidence in Mr Thomson.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Would you like to see Mr Thomson, Prime Minister, make a statement to the Parliament? Does he have an obligation to do that?</p>
<p>PM: Look, Mr Thomson will obviously deal with these matters as a Parliamentarian and as he sees fit. He's made the appropriate declaration. I made the comment in Parliament yesterday: he's not the first parliamentarian to declare matters late and members of the Opposition who are speaking about this matter might like to consider that. Everyone of course should abide by the rules, but he's not the first Parliamentarian to make a late declaration.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the Greens have been questioning the emissions reductions qualities of gas over the last couple of days. Are you still confident they're 100 per cent behind the package and doesn't gas have a key role to play in cutting emissions?</p>
<p>PM: Yes, gas does have a key role to play in cutting emissions. Yes, I'm absolutely confident we'll get a price on carbon through the Parliament and yes, the single biggest threat to the coal seam gas industry, standing in this Parliament House has been Mr Abbott and his ridiculous ill-thought through statements.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.  </p>
