FOR MEDIA 21 JANUARY 1983<br />
WEST INDIAN CRICKETERS' TOUR OF SOUTH AFRICA<br />
The Australian Government deplores as a clear breach of<br />
the Gleneagles Agreement the current tour of South<br />
Africa by an unofficial team of West Indian cricketers.<br />
I entirely agree with the recent statements by the<br />
Commonwealth Secretary-General, Mr Ramphal, and by<br />
Commonwealth West Indian Governments and cricketing<br />
authorities, who have made it clear that the individuals<br />
on the. team will be debarred from representing their<br />
countries in international and national cricket in the<br />
future. The South African sporting authorities sought, through<br />
offering considerable financial inducements to the<br />
individuals concerned, to defy the internation * al ban on<br />
sporting contacts with South Africa while apartheid<br />
persists in that country. The strength of international<br />
condemnation of this unofficial tour, including in<br />
Australia, demonstrates that they did not succeed.<br />
Because of the deliberate and blatant nature of this<br />
particular attempt to breach the Gleneagles Agreement<br />
and the understandings reached at the Melbourne<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting, the peo'ple<br />
involved in this particular tour will not be given visas<br />
again to visit Australia.<br />
I believe that these views are widely shared by<br />
Australians. The Government is grateful for the support<br />
its policy on sporting contacts with South Africa has<br />
received from Australian sporting organisations. </p>
