1969 FEDERAL ELECTION<br />
TALK GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. JOHN GORTON,<br />
OVER ABC NETWORK ON FRIDAY 10 OCTOBER<br />
Proper defence is the foundation on which any nation'ss<br />
security is built. If we are to run our own affairs in our own Australian way<br />
if we are in the future to be subjected neither to attack nor the threat of<br />
attack then defence is essential. It is the more essential to us now we<br />
are becoming increasingly isolated, and the adequate defence of Australia<br />
demands two approaches. One is that we should build up, over the years ahead, our<br />
own defence forces; that we should have a standing Army of at least its<br />
present size backed by a modern C. M. F. that our Navy should grow;<br />
that our Air Force should have the best aircraft obtainable; that, in short,<br />
we should look to our own efforts for our own defence.<br />
The second is that we should retain and strengthen the<br />
alliances we have; that we should play our part in such alliances,<br />
particularly with the United States, and should be prepared to give, as<br />
well as expect to receive, help.<br />
You know that we, of the Liberal Party coalition, will<br />
maintain and strengthen our own forces. But you have been told by the<br />
Opposition that they will not. They have undertaken to abolish National<br />
Service training, thereby reducing our Army by a third.<br />
They have undertaken not to acquire the F 111 strike<br />
aircraft, even though the Air Force advice is that Australia needs this<br />
aircraft and that it is the best strike aircraft in the world today.<br />
They have undertaken to equip the Navy not with what the<br />
Navy wants but with a few patrol boats only.<br />
So under Labor, our own defences would deteriorate just<br />
when they should be improving. This is bad enough but even more<br />
disastrous would be the effect of Labor's policies on our alliances. o. / 2 </p>

They propose to withdraw at once from Vietnam unilaterally,<br />
just at the time when President Nixon is calling for steadfastness, so that<br />
the enemy will negotiate a peace giving the South Vietnamese a choice of<br />
government. I can think of nothing more calculated to damage our standing<br />
or to drive America into isolationism.<br />
They propose to withdraw all our forces from Malaysia/<br />
Singapore and, in practice, to wash our hands of helping in the military<br />
defence of the region to our North. Again, there could be nothing more<br />
calculated to deter Britain and the United States coming to the help of that<br />
region, the destiny of which affects our destiny, in case of attack.<br />
They propose to quibble and cavil and renegotiate the question<br />
of defence bases in Australia, even though these bases are for common<br />
defence, to help our defence, as well as that of the United States.<br />
So their proposals boil down to reducing and rendering<br />
less effective our own defence forces and to taking international action<br />
which will weaken ANZUS, strengthen isolationism in the United States,<br />
deter Britain from helping Malaysia/ Singapore and damage severely our<br />
own standing. We will do none of these things. The Labor Party undertakes<br />
to do them all. This is perhaps the greatest issue for you to decide on<br />
October I hope and believe that for our nation's future security you<br />
will decide our policies are best for Australia and for Australia's future.<br />
