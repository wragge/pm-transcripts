4. AUSTRAII<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 11 MARCH 1986<br />
Takeovers of public companies are matters normally left to<br />
the judgment of the market subject to compliance with the<br />
takeovers code ( which is directed to investor protection and<br />
fairness) and other relevant legislation.<br />
The Government decided that, in the particular circumstances<br />
of Bell's current takeover bid for BHP, a committee of<br />
Ministers should hold detailed discussions with<br />
representatives of each of the companies.<br />
As a result of these discussions, the Government is<br />
satisfied as to the future integrity of the Steel Plan.<br />
Attached are copies of the relevant assurances provided by<br />
both parties.<br />
As to the revenue implications of the proposed takeover, the<br />
Government does not believe, on all the information and<br />
advice available to it, that there are any public interest<br />
considerations presently apparent which would justify<br />
intervention. In relation to the Trade Practices Act, nothing has emerged<br />
which would lead the Government to change its position on<br />
the amendment to section 50 which has passed the House of<br />
Representatives and is now before the Senate.<br />
It would not be appropriate for the Government to comment<br />
further while the bid is before the market and related<br />
issues are before the courts. </p>
