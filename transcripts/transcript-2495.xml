In my recent statement to the House on my overseas visit, I<br />
mentioned the representations which I made in London on the problems<br />
for Papua/ New Guinea-ariSing from British entry to the European Economic<br />
I am now pleascod to be able to inform the House about the<br />
successful conclusion of negotiations on behalf of Papua/ New Guinea.<br />
The iDritish Government has acceDted an offer from the Six under which<br />
exports originating in Papua/. sew Guinea will be able to enter the<br />
United Kingdom until 1 January 1973, under the conditions which apply<br />
at the time of British accession to the Community. The offer also<br />
provides for review of these arrangements.<br />
in making these arrangements for thie Territory. the Community<br />
has stressed the excep tiotial features of the Papua/ New Guinea position<br />
both from the point of view of it1-s international status andi from that<br />
of its economic development.<br />
In accepting the offer by the Six, the British Government<br />
expressed its confidence that thc~ Co. mnmunity would makl-e reasonable<br />
arrangemaents for Papua/ New Guinea in the context of any review.<br />
I am sure the House will join with me in expre SS nc appreciation<br />
for the special efforts made by the 7 uropean Economic Community to<br />
recognise and proviCde for the unique nee&amp; is of PaoDua/ I~ eW Guinea. </p>
