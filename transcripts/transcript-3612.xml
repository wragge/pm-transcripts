IN JANUARY 1952 SIR ROSS MCLARTY WROTE TO ALL PREMIERS ON<br />
THE OCCURRENCE OF THE FIRST CASUAL VACANCY IN THE SENATE<br />
AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF THE PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION<br />
SYSTEM OF ELECTION. IN THIS LETTER HE PROPOSED THE ADOPTION<br />
OF A CONVENTION FOR THE EXERCISE BY STATE PARLIAMENTS OF<br />
THEIR POWERS UNDER SECTION 15 OF THE AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTION.<br />
THE PREMIER OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA HAS INDICATED THE AGREEMENT<br />
OF SIR THOMAS PLAYFORD WITH THE PROPOSAL OF SIR ROSS MCLARTY<br />
