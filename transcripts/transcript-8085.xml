PRIME MINISTER<br />
16 AUGUST 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
HURST: This is really the first chance we've had to speak<br />
to you since your press conference last Friday and with<br />
events hotting up in the Middle East and Saddam Hussein's<br />
shock peace stir with Iran. How concerned are you at<br />
developments occurring there now?<br />
PM: From the very first moment of the Iraqi invasion of<br />
Kuwait I have been acutely aware of the dangers and the<br />
potential for a very serious conflict, Phil. I have<br />
consulted not only with Ministers and then had my decision<br />
endorsed by Cabinet, but we've consulted widely on this<br />
issue. While I have said, Phil, that this is the most<br />
serious decision I have had to take as Prime Minister,<br />
paradoxically in the end it was a very easy decision because<br />
the issues were very straightforward. What I want to see<br />
happen, of course, is the continuation of discussion between<br />
like-minded nations to bring about a situation where Saddam<br />
Hussein will realise that in the interests of his own<br />
people, let alone any other moral considerations, that the<br />
best thing to do, the only thing to do is to withdraw from<br />
Kuwait. If he has some issues with Kuwait, whether it be in<br />
regard to disputed territory or oil, then we're not denying<br />
the right of Iraq to have discussions and mediation on those<br />
issues. But for me and for my Government, and I believe for<br />
the overwhelming majority of Australian people, Phil, it is<br />
simply not acceptable that naked aggression should be<br />
unleashed by one country against a small neighbour and that<br />
they should then proceed to annex that territory into their<br />
own. If the world stands by and allows that to happen we<br />
are inviting a repetition of the disasters of the 1930s.<br />
HURST: Mr Hawke there's been a lot of concern expressed in<br />
talk shows across Australia, certainly on this program and I<br />
understand Gough Whitlam has expressed now concern, that<br />
Australia leapt into the fray too quickly on the heels of<br />
President Bush rather than waiting to take a stand perhaps<br />
suggested by the United Nations.<br />
PM: Well this of course is incorrect. We didn't leap in.<br />
It wasn't a question of me getting a phone call from George<br />
Bush on Friday morning and saying here we go. This matter<br />
had been raised a week earlier within the United States. We<br />
had seriously discussed it, looked at all the implications.<br />
We, of course, had given immediate support to the decision<br />
of the United Nations Security Council to impose </p>
<p>comprehensive sanctions upon Iraq. I received a direct<br />
personal communication, by letter, from the Amir of Kuwait<br />
requesting assistance and I know, and the best advice I have<br />
from our legal resources and from our Department of Foreign<br />
Affairs, those with the competence in this area, is that we<br />
have legal sanction for our action under Section 51 of the<br />
United Nations Charter which contemplates collective<br />
security action in the situation where there is a request<br />
from a member state. Having said that Phil, we have made it<br />
clear that we would like to see a situation where the United<br />
Nations moved to make a decision under Section 42 but we<br />
were not prepared, knowing that we had legal sanction for<br />
doing what we did, we were not prepared to wait for the<br />
drawn out processes that might be involved in getting such a<br />
decision. Because you can't sit by and see a small state<br />
gobbled up then another state threatened and saying oh well<br />
we'll sit by and wait and see what might happen. We weren't<br />
going to allow apprehension to become reality, to see Kuwait<br />
gone, to see Saudi Arabia gone.<br />
HURST: There seems to be a lot of confusion about just how<br />
active a role Australia will take, for instance,<br />
Senator Evans suggesting Australia wouldn't physically<br />
interdict any ships, but would in the instance of Australia<br />
making surveillance of a ship then get the Americans to go<br />
in and do the action.<br />
PM: I am glad you asked this question Phil and I want to<br />
take this opportunity of making quite clear to your<br />
listeners and through them to the rest of Australia<br />
precisely what the situation is. I know there is some quite<br />
muddled commentary in some quarters which says we've sent<br />
of f our ships without knowing precisely what they'll be<br />
doing. Let me make it quite clear as Senator Evans very<br />
articulately has already done. At this stage what has been<br />
determined as being the role of the Australian ships is four<br />
categories of action: identification, we will see that what<br />
the ship is and then when there is identification you have<br />
contact and then interrogation and warning. Now those are<br />
important processes and I can say to you that they have been<br />
identified by the United States as constituting a very<br />
useful role. See there are really three sorts of types of<br />
action which you contemplate. Just being there and sailing<br />
around in circles, as it has been put, bristling, just here<br />
we are look at us. The second is the role I have just<br />
talked about. The third and the most active is the<br />
interdiction role that you've been talking about. The other<br />
is a need for the second role, the one that we are talking<br />
about. Let me make the point that this, firstly, that as I<br />
say that has been regarded and has been indicated to us by<br />
the United States as constituting a very useful role for our<br />
much smaller force in relation to the more massive power of<br />
others that's there. The second point I make is this, Phil,<br />
that we have some 19 days now between the time of our<br />
vessels leaving where they are now, they are on their way to<br />
Fremantle and getting to the Gulf region. Now there'll be a<br />
lot of time between now and then for further consultation<br />
and the Cabinet has made it clear that if in the light of </p>
<p>changing circumstances and further consultation which go to<br />
the question of ensuring effectiveness of our forces, if it<br />
becomes clear that it is desirable to enhance this specific<br />
role which I have identified now then we will be prepared to<br />
consider that. And Cabinet has made the decision that if<br />
there is a perception of the need to heighten the role then<br />
Cabinet will consider that and then be prepared to see<br />
whether such a decision is required. In other words, and I<br />
don't apologise for the length of the answer because it is a<br />
very important question you've raised. In other words, the<br />
decision that has been taken is the eminently sensible<br />
decision, well thought through, appropriate, regarded as<br />
such by the United States which has the major force in the<br />
area and is capable of change if circumstances necessitate<br />
that change.<br />
HURST: Mr Hawke, on another issue, a budget being handed<br />
down next Tuesday night. There are rumours coming out of<br />
Canberra that it is going be a tough one particularly with<br />
rumoured cuts in pharmaceutical benefit schemes for<br />
pensioners. Have you got any comment on that?<br />
PM: Phil, this is now my eighth year as Prime Minister and<br />
I can say that nothing is new in the sense that in every<br />
previous occasion I have seen the rumour mills running hot<br />
and all sorts of things being suggested that will be done.<br />
Now quite clearly, Phil, you know that I can't disclose, and<br />
will not disclose what will be in the Budget. But let me<br />
say these things. There will be some decisions that will be<br />
relatively tough but they will be fair decisions. I have<br />
not spent all my life so far, most of it in public life, and<br />
with a commitment to the future of this country to avoid<br />
taking decisions which I and my colleagues believe are<br />
necessary and are proper and in the best interests of this<br />
country. If as Prime Minister I had avoided decisions<br />
because there would be some suggestion of criticism then we<br />
would have done nothing. Certainly for instance we wouldn't<br />
have brought in the assets test. Now remember the<br />
nationwide campaign of villification against me and my<br />
Government when that was brought in. This was going to be<br />
the end of civilisation as we knew it. If we'd listened to<br />
that we would have done nothing. But now it is accepted<br />
across the board as a sensible and fair and proper decision.<br />
The Budget will be tough in some respects but it will be<br />
fair. But above all it will be appropriate to the overall<br />
challenging task which we have got as a nation and that is<br />
to make sure that we create a competitive economy which is<br />
going to put us in the position to do the things that we<br />
need to do to look after those most in need in the<br />
community. HURST: The Libs, or the Opposition, seems to have started a<br />
march on Labor by going for full privatisation of Telecom.<br />
The Government seems to have a confused position now with a<br />
paper put out by Kim Beazley, a document revealed by him </p>
<p>PM: Not revealed by him, to be fair, I am sorry to<br />
interrupt Phil but, it's certainly a proposed submission of<br />
the Minister. But he didn't reveal it.<br />
HURST: Well, there are two separate positions, Mr Beazley's<br />
and Mr Keating's. I mean, which position do you favour?<br />
PM: Before coming to the specific question let me say this<br />
quite straightforwardly that not only within the Labor Party<br />
but within the community generally there is legitimate room<br />
for differences of opinion as to what is the ideal course of<br />
action to make our telecommunications industry as efficient<br />
and as competitive as possible. It is true I don't seek,<br />
because it would be stupid and dishonest to try and do so, I<br />
don't seek to deny that there have been differences of<br />
emphasis between some of the Ministers and particularly<br />
between Mr Beazley and the Treasurer, Paul Keating. There<br />
have been differences of emphasis. What I'm doing, as is my<br />
responsibility as Prime Minister, is to have discussions<br />
with both the Ministers and between the Ministers and I feel<br />
confident that by the time the Government in Cabinet comes<br />
to make a decision on this and to make clear not merely to<br />
my Party but to the community what the appropriate course of<br />
action is, that we will have an agreed position. This is<br />
not something to be ashamed of or frightened of that there<br />
are differences of opinion, arguments. Because when you're<br />
dealing with a critically important issue like this it would<br />
be absurd to believe that there is some revealed wisdom and<br />
only one revealed wisdom to which everyone would accede.<br />
HURST: But this seems potentially one of the most divisive<br />
issues in Labor's eight year rule. I mean we're talking<br />
about backbenchers, Party members and union members opposed<br />
to it very decisively.<br />
PM: There are some who in my view take a quite unacceptable<br />
position and that is that there should be no change at all.<br />
I regard that as antideluvian. As I said last night at this<br />
great meeting we had here in Grafton, I said to the people<br />
there, and it's a message I will be giving to all<br />
Australians. We live at a time of the most dramatic and<br />
rapid change in the whole of recorded human history and for<br />
a people to make the assumption that the practices and<br />
attitude of the past are sufficient for this new and<br />
challenging future is a derogation of duty. We must not be<br />
afraid of change. We must ask ourselves what is the best<br />
form of change? And once you get yourself into that mode of<br />
thinking, then it is true that people can have legitimate<br />
differences about what's the best form of change but change<br />
there must be and change there will be.<br />
HURST: Mr Hawke you said last night Labor can and has<br />
matched the need for growth with a responsible approach and<br />
a sustainable economy, yet four major conservation groups<br />
say in a joint submission published today that Labor has<br />
allowed green issues to fall off the political agenda since<br />
the March election. </p>
<p>PM: They are wrong. A simple statement. Wrong. And they<br />
could not be more abundantly wrong. Because they seem to<br />
equate noise and statements with action. Now that may be<br />
the credo of some within the environmental movement but it's<br />
a wrong assumption. Because in the period since the<br />
election my responsible Ministers, which includes Mrs Kelly<br />
who has a direct environmental responsibility, but others<br />
including John Kerin, we have been very much involved in<br />
developing the processes for a proper consideration of these<br />
issues. Just let me make these points which I think are<br />
relevant. Again I alluded briefly to them last night.<br />
There must not be the mistake made, in this country or<br />
elsewhere for that matter, that the responsible approach is<br />
to say it's either development or the environment. The<br />
challenge for Government is to make sure that you get an<br />
appropriate balance between growth considerations and the<br />
responsibility we have to future generations. Now to do<br />
that that's a very simple thing to say but what we have<br />
been doing in the period both before and very much since the<br />
election is to give effect to the commitment I made that we<br />
would establish processes, effective processes to enable<br />
that balance to be best achieved. The first step they'd<br />
taken, which was of course before the election, was the<br />
establishment of the Resource Assessment Commission under<br />
the chairmanship of Mr Justice Stewart. And that will<br />
enable the environmental movement and industry, State<br />
governments, people with a concern, to go before the<br />
Resource Assessment Commission on specific issues and argue<br />
the case. Now in addition to that, what I promised before<br />
the election and what we have been doing since the election<br />
is to establish processes to give effect to the concept of<br />
sustainable development. By that, we've put out a paper<br />
which fleshes out the concept of sustainable development and<br />
we're going to apply that within different sectors so that<br />
we will have representatives of industry and of the<br />
environmental movement and trade unions. They will be<br />
sitting there working together under independent<br />
chairpersons to examine how the concept of sustainable<br />
development should be applied in different sectors of our<br />
industry. Since the election we'vye been working assiduously<br />
on establishing those processes. Now that's not dramatic.<br />
It doesn't involve the Prime Minister getting up and<br />
shouting from rooftops. To say because the Prime Minister<br />
hasn't been shouting from rooftops we've given these issues<br />
away is absurdly wrong and, if I may say so with respect to<br />
my friends in the environmental movement, a very<br />
irresponsible statement.<br />
HURST: Well finally Mr Hawke, Labor's victory in Richmond<br />
at least depended significantly on a swag of votes for<br />
Independent Helen Caldicott and issues arising out of the<br />
ICAC inquiry among others. Can Labor stand on its own two<br />
feet in one of Australia's fastest-growing regions?<br />
PM: We can certainly stand on our own two feet. Let me<br />
make this point however Phil, that if you look at politics<br />
in Australia and in the rest of the world, we have to<br />
acknowledge the fact, and it's not a fact of which I'm </p>
<p>b 6<br />
frightened, but the nature of politics has changed in this<br />
last decade. One of the significant elements in change has<br />
been the emergence of environmental issues. That is true in<br />
Australia, it's true in Europe, the United States, and the<br />
established parties, including my own, have to understand<br />
that fact and recognise there may not be the same cemented<br />
realities of the past where the two major parties just<br />
gobbled up all the votes between them. Now as far as I'm<br />
concerned, I believe that we have one of the most<br />
environmentally responsible governments in the world, but<br />
it's also one which has had twice the rate of employment<br />
growth of the rest of the industrialised world. I will<br />
stand on both the record of achievement but also on the<br />
principles that we adopt. I'm more than happy to continue<br />
to go to the Australian people and particularly those who<br />
have a legitimate concern with the environment and say look<br />
at our record, look at our principles, look at our<br />
processes. I would like to get their first preference vote.<br />
If I can't get that, I am convinced that on the basis of<br />
both record, principle and processes, that we deserve their<br />
second vote. And if it's the second vote we get, so be it.<br />
HURST: Mr Hawke, thanks very much for your time this<br />
morning. PM: It's been my pleasure Phil. Thank you very much.<br />
ends </p>
