    <content><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard, Arts Minister Simon Crean and Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Senator Kate Lundy today announced a $2 million investment towards an Antipodes Centre for Greek Culture, Heritage and Language in Melbourne.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made the announcement today at the Antipodes Lonsdale Street Glendi - Melbourne's renowned Greek Festival.</p>
<p>The new cultural centre will be in the heart of Melbourne's Greek Community as part of a multipurpose building on the corner of Lonsdale and Russell Streets in the CBD.</p>
<p>The centre will recognise and celebrate the immeasurable contribution Australia's Greek community has made to our society and acknowledge the special cultural and historical connections between Greece and Australia.</p>
<p>The state of the art facility will showcase the Greek community's proud history, displaying valuable archives built up over decades and host special exhibitions and performances.</p>
<p>It will also provide support to new and existing Greek migrants through programs run by the Greek Orthodox Community of Melbourne and Victoria.</p>
<p>The Greek Orthodox Community has a long history in running successful cultural activities in Melbourne including the Greek Film Festival and the Antipodes Festival, which is the largest celebration of Greek culture outside of Greece.</p>
<p>Established in 1897, the Greek Orthodox Community has provided $6.2 million towards the project including $1.2 million from donations alone.</p>
<p>The $2 million investment from the Gillard Labor Government demonstrates our commitment to programs that build on the strength of the nation's renowned cultural diversity.</p>
<p>Australia has changed significantly over the past two decades and we now have greater diversity in our population than ever before.</p>
<p>As a Government we recognise the significant contribution made by the Greek community.</p>
<p>Our nation has been enriched by the contribution of generations of Greek families who have settled in Australia, raised their families and built strong communities here.</p>
<p>Greek Australians have played an important part in our national story and Greek culture has inspired great art, scholarship, academia and architecture.</p>
<p>As the Australian Government works towards the release of the first National Cultural Policy in almost 20 years, this new centre will help highlight and celebrate Australia's diverse cultural heritage.</p>
