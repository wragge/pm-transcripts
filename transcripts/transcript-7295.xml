FOR MEDIA 29 FEBRUARY 1988<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE MINISTER ASSISTING<br />
THE PRIME MINISTER FOR THE STATUS OF WOMEN, SE14ATOR MARGARET<br />
REYNOLDS. The Federal Government today released its Natidnal Agenda for<br />
Women which sets out steps to advance the stat~ s of Australian<br />
women to the year 2000.<br />
For the first time in Australian history, a Go'~ ernment has made a<br />
long term commitment to ensure that women can dxercise a real<br />
choice about how they spend their lives and hov) they can<br />
participate fully in Australian society.<br />
This National Agenda for Women is one of the Government's most<br />
significant and important achievements. Australia cannot meet<br />
the challenges of the future if it does not allow the full and<br />
equal participation of women in society. The Government is<br />
committed to act where it can to remove barrierts to that<br />
participation. The National Agenda for Women is the Government's response to the<br />
views expressed by the women of Australia during the National<br />
Agenda consultations of 1986. over 25,000 women from all walks<br />
of life participated in the consultations.<br />
The Agenda sets out specific action plans for the next five years<br />
in those areas nominated by Australian women a~ t important, and<br />
establishes general objectives to the year 2000i.<br />
Strategies to increase the capacity of women to participate in<br />
decision-making, to allow greater access to education, employment<br />
and training, which acknowledge the work done by women in the<br />
home, and which improve women's access to child care and other<br />
community services are included in the Agenda.<br />
The Government is also looking to consolidate its substantial<br />
achievements in removing discrimination on the basis of sex, and<br />
continuing recent initiatives in the areas of domestic violence<br />
prevention, the portrayal of women in the media, housing and<br />
health. 004669<br />

<p>The Government will remove the overall exemption for sex and<br />
marital status discrimination in superannuation funds and schemes<br />
from the Sex Discrimination Act.<br />
The major group of women who will benefit by an increase in the<br />
availability of superannuation will be women in full-time<br />
permanent employment who change jobs frequently or who take time<br />
out from the paid workforce.<br />
Financial security, particularly in retirement, is a serious<br />
concern for women. Few women are covered by, or have access to,<br />
adequate superannuation compared to men. Yet, women retire<br />
earlier than men, are more likely to live longer, and to spend<br />
part of their retirement single.<br />
The Government is committed to providing women with a greater<br />
access to superannuation.<br />
The proposed legislation will be developed in consultation with<br />
the superannuation industry and, once passed, will provide a<br />
two-year transition period to enable necessary changes to be<br />
made. It follows consideration of the report of the former Human Rights<br />
Commission inquiry into discrimination in superannuation.<br />
The Agenda is yet another step in the real advancement of the<br />
status of women. The Government regards the National Agenda for<br />
Women as a dynamic strategy which would need to be modified as<br />
time passes, as achievements are realised and as new issues<br />
arise. 004670 </p>
