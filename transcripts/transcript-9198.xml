PRIME MINISTER 32/ 94<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
APPOINTMENT OF DEPARTMENTAL SECRETARIES<br />
The government has decided on some changes to departmental secretary<br />
arrangements and I will shortly be recommending these to the Administrator<br />
of the Commonwealth in Council, to take effect from Tuesday 26 April.<br />
The Secretary to the new Department of Housing and Regional Development<br />
will be Mr Andrew Podger, currently Secretary to the Department of<br />
Administrative ervices. Mir Tony Cole, who has been acting as Secretary to<br />
both the Department of Housing and Regional Development and the<br />
Department of Human Services and Health, will remain as Secretary to the<br />
Department of Human Services and Health.<br />
The Secretary to the Department of Administrative Services will be Mr John<br />
Mellors, currently Executive General Manager, Corporate in that Department.<br />
Mr Mellors was Director-General of the Victorian Department of Planning and<br />
Urban Growth from 1988-1990 and before that held senior positions in<br />
several Departments in the Australian Public Service, including<br />
Administrative Services and Finance.<br />
The Secretary to the Department of Veterans' Affairs will be Dr Allan Hawke,<br />
currently Deputy Secretary in the Department of the Prime Minister and<br />
Cabinet. Dr Hawke was previously Principal Adviser in my office and Deputy<br />
Secretary in the Department of Defence. The vacancy in the Department of<br />
Veterans' Affairs occurs because of the government's decision to recommend<br />
the appointment of Mr Lionel Woodward as Comptroller-General of Customs,<br />
announced separately today by the Minister for Small Business, Customs and<br />
Construction. CANBERRA APRIL 1994 </p>
