PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 23 DECEMBER 1990<br />
I have sent the following message to our forces serving in<br />
the Gulf: " To all Australians serving in the Multinational<br />
Task Force in the Gulf.<br />
On beha. lf of the Australian Government and the<br />
people of Australia, I want to pass to you best<br />
wishes for Christmas and the New Year.<br />
As we prepare for the Christmas celebrations, I<br />
know that all Australians share with me the<br />
appreciation that duty and service to our Nation<br />
prevent you from enjoying this special time with<br />
your loved ones in Australia.<br />
We are very conscious and rightly proud of the<br />
outstanding role played in the Gulf by Australian<br />
Service personnel in ensuring that the United<br />
Nations Security Council Resolutions are enforced.<br />
At a time when peace and goodwill are uppermost in<br />
our thoughts, it is my profound hope that a<br />
genuine and principled peace is found in the<br />
resolution of the Gulf crisis. Your contribution<br />
towards that end is crucial. Your role is not<br />
without its hazards but I know you will discharge<br />
your duties in the truly Australian way we have<br />
come to expect from our armed forces.<br />
All the best<br />
Bob Haw. ke" </p>
