Theme: " COMMUINICATION KEY TO. GOOD GOVERNMENT<br />
O-pening Speech by the Prime Minister, the Hon. John Gorton<br />
Mr Chairman and Ladies-and Gentlemen:<br />
There are -Perhaps three things I'o ught to say to you befcre I<br />
really get launched into opening this Conference,<br />
The first one is that I have spent a great deal of time over the<br />
last two or three years in openin~ g things like science blocks and things like<br />
technical schools and things of that kind generally, and It has been an experience<br />
of mine that at the end of having delivered the address that always goes along<br />
with these activities, one is so delighted to have got through, one is so relieved<br />
at having finished, that one tends to forget entirely to open whatever it is that<br />
one came to open. If this should happen on this occasion, would you please<br />
remember that at the very beginning I indicated that the object of this was to<br />
open the conference, and just take It as read If I forget, which I hope I won't.<br />
The second thing that I would say to you is that I understood<br />
that tonight this was not a " heavy" night, this was not a night of real work for<br />
you such as will occur when people read you the carefully-prepared papers on<br />
various aspects of communications which you will then, in the course of the<br />
seminar, discuss and dissect and agree with or disagree with. This was, as<br />
far as I was concerned, more an opportunity to come along to speak for perhaps<br />
twenty minutes or so, not deeply, but as a mark of respect for the work which<br />
you do I won't say for each one of you but for the work you do, and perhaps<br />
to put forward some few views of my own on its importance.<br />
The keyn ote of this, I gather, is " Communication the Key to<br />
Good Government"; this is what the seminar is about. I don't know that this<br />
is a sufficiently accurate title because of things which I will now endeavour to<br />
develop. It is possible to have good government without communication,<br />
but it Is far less likely that there will be good government without communication,<br />
but of course it Is possible to have very bad government with very efficient<br />
communication. You will remember that one of the first things which any<br />
totalitarian government seeks to do, whether it be of the right or of the left,<br />
is to control communications, and having controlled communications, having<br />
controlled the media of the press and television and broadcasting, then the<br />
most lavish technical facilities can be poured Into communications so that they<br />
will permeate the whole of a society and will allow only those views and only<br />
those arguments which a government in power wishes to allow, and that they<br />
will suppress all dissident opinion and prevent views which the government in<br />
power does not wish to have presented.<br />
Well, then, you can have and have had examples of communication,<br />
but they haven't been the key to good government because they haven't been<br />
uncontrolled communications. So I would define a little bit the theme of this<br />
. Io.* 9/ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
conference and say and I may even be a little wrong in this perhaps we<br />
should say " Free Communications: The Best Insurance Policy to See that<br />
Good Government Continues", and with that I would have no quarrel whatsoever,<br />
an insurance policy to see that it continues.<br />
I did query a little the suggestion uncontrolled communications<br />
because there Is a tendency, or it seems to me that there is occasionally<br />
a tendency for a certain lack of control In communications, just as It seems to<br />
some of those who don't agree with me politically on occasions, that there is<br />
a certain lack of control. I am not speaking now of the reporting of political<br />
matters, but there are some papers which, of course, one wouldn't dare to<br />
name, but there are some papers who occasionally tend to be verging on the<br />
uncontrolled, particularly wihen they make the best af both worlds by taking<br />
a high moral line on how extemely bad vice and violence and things of that kind<br />
are and in order to drive home the point of how bad they are, they fill half<br />
their pages with careful reporting of the particular things. This of course, I<br />
am sure, on the behalf of the owners is designed to attain a moral end!<br />
But occasionally it might seem to be verging just a little on the uncontrolled,<br />
so that Is why I chose the word " free".<br />
Well, how are we going to get free communications, and<br />
how ought those free communications to be used by you, because there is a<br />
responsibility on government to see that information is supplied to enable<br />
free communication properly to function, and there is a responsiblity on<br />
Journalists and on the owners of newspapers and on the editors of newspapers,<br />
and, not particularly, but also on those who write the headlines for stories<br />
and cut out the middle of the story from the people who wrote them, there is<br />
a responsibility on them to see that that information is properly presented In<br />
a balanced way. Well what is the responsibility on government? I think it is<br />
pretty heavy. I believe that governments ought never to seek to suppress<br />
news or Information, whether those governments feel it is for the moment<br />
to their advantage to do it or not to their advantage to do it. I not only<br />
believe that this is useful to enable free communication to functlon but I<br />
believe it is a sensible policy and one which Is to the advantage of the government<br />
which uses it. Now, I remember my present Press Officer joining me when<br />
I was first In the Navy and we put this to the test. It's a long while ago now<br />
and -you won't remember, but we had two naval ships steaming along, one of<br />
which was firing at the other with such good effect that it hit it, and a shell<br />
went through it fortunately, it was a non-explosive one just above the<br />
water line. Well this is an unusual occurrence in a well-run Navy, and tie<br />
question arose of what one should do about it so of course what one did<br />
about it was immediately call a pre-ss conference and tell everybody and send<br />
them down there and they could interview everybody and they could see the<br />
hole and they could take pictures. After they decided that there it was and<br />
there was nothing to hide, okay, the story was there and there was no more<br />
speculation. And similarly we did it in other things that happened.<br />
This Is not only In my view a prop~ er way but a payable way<br />
for a government to behave, and therefore there is not only a rspnsbility,<br />
but if it has got any sense, a government behaves In accordance with that<br />
responsibility. Now there must be some limitations, to this. There are some<br />
fields of information which are tied up possibly with national security. There<br />
are some areas of information which it Is not desired to make public for ./ 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
perhaps another week or so for various reasons because negotiations are<br />
going on and haven't reached a point of complete fruition. These kinds of<br />
things, where there is a particular reason, I think one Is justified In not<br />
announcing, and In fencing if one Is asked about them. But those are, roughly,<br />
the only reservations that I would have.<br />
It is therefore, In my view, the purpose of a Government Information<br />
Officer attached to a Minister or to a Department, not to protect his Minister<br />
or his Department In the sense of protecting him by stopping the dissemination<br />
of Information for which his Minister or his Department can be criticised, but<br />
rather to protect him his Minister or his Department by going along and<br />
saying, " This has happened" or " Some r-eospaper Is interested In this"....<br />
" These are the facts. These facts ought to be made publc and so<br />
protect him in that way. Then It is up to the Minister, and if he has got any<br />
sense, he will make those facts public.<br />
Before I leave this area of where I think Government responsibility<br />
lies,, where it should be used I would like to touch on something which has<br />
been a matter of discussion from time to time, and that Is the dissemination<br />
of Information by public servants as opposed to the dissemination of Information<br />
by governments, by Ministers, by people working as journalists In Departments<br />
or for Ministers. You have all seen It suggested that, really, public servants ought<br />
to be able to make pronouncements on policy, ought to be able to make<br />
announcements as to fact.* I find this Impossible to accept, You have public<br />
servants who are there to carry out a policy decided on by a government or<br />
decided on by their Minister. Quite often, before that policy Is decided upon,<br />
If tt Is a properly-run Department, the Head of It, or the second In charge<br />
of It or third Is~ charge of It will be talking to the Minister, and he will say,<br />
" Look, I don't think you ought to do that. I think you are quite wrong. I<br />
think you are an absolute clot If you do this. You shouldn't do It. Sometimes<br />
he writes it on a piece of paper and sends It in. Then, again, If It Is a<br />
properly-run Department, most of the time they are right. But not always,<br />
and so a Minister will say, " Well, all right. I have taken into account what<br />
you have put to me. I have thought about It carefully. I think you are wrong.<br />
I don't accept your advice, and this is the policy I want you to carry out.<br />
And in a properly-run Department, then a public servant accepts that and carries<br />
It out. If you had a situation arising out of those sort of circumstances<br />
where that public servant would immediately rush away and say publicly, " I<br />
think the Government or the Minister is quite wrong. I told him he was wrong<br />
at the time, and these are the reasons I put forward to him," well, It would<br />
be a very good news story, but It wouldn't be very conducive to good government,<br />
and It wouldn't be very conducive to the stanfflng of public servants. One of<br />
the safeties that public servants have Is that they do carry out a policy, either<br />
devised or accepted by their political government, and if mistakes are made In<br />
policy or In practice, It is their political government and their political head<br />
who takes the blame, even though they may not necessarily directly be<br />
responsible, and that they, themselves, as public servants are not to be<br />
subject to criticism, because If they are, then they must have a right to<br />
answer and It Is better that they should follow the course of not entering Irto<br />
public controversy and therefore na bcig teto beheld responsible and<br />
attacked in public. For those reasons, although I know there are arguments on the<br />
other side, I do feel that in the discharge of a responsibility to provide e 6 / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
information by a government, that It Is the government and not its servants<br />
who must accept that responsibility.,<br />
Well, what about the responsibility that then devolves on those<br />
who work for the communications media, those who take that Information<br />
either freely offered or ferreted out and then disseminated through the<br />
country? This is of vital Importance, of just as much Importance, of just<br />
as much responsibility as lies upon a government to make the Information<br />
available. I don't speak only of Information as to fact. That Is fairly<br />
simple. Almost any course that Is adopted In a country such as ours Is<br />
a course which Is arrived at as a matter of choice. There are a number of<br />
things a government can do, and there are quite valid arguments in favour<br />
of all those things. If you walked up on to a hill here in Ca~ nberra, and you<br />
looked down from Red Hill, and yoi saw spread below you the myriad<br />
twinkling lights of this city, and you said to yourself, " Each one of those<br />
lights, or nearly ev~ ry cm of those lights is a light In the window of a house<br />
where an Australian family lives. What do they want? You would have<br />
to answer yourself in this way. They would want to have a perfect system<br />
of education; they would want to have a system of defence which would make<br />
this country so strong that not even a major power would attack It; they<br />
would want to have development proceeding apace not only in the country<br />
but In the city; they would want to have x per cent of GNP spent on providing<br />
scientific advancement; they would want the States and the Commonwealth<br />
each to be able to do all that they feel that they would like to do; they would<br />
want taxation to be reduced. They would not want a deficit because with a<br />
deficit there tends to be too much Inflation. In fact they want everything<br />
which is quite reasonable because as individuals we would all like to have all<br />
these things we would want to have too. But you can't have it all and ne ither<br />
can a country so in spite of the fact that valid arguments can be made for<br />
every one of these and a myriad other things, you come down to making a<br />
choice priority which Is the most Important, which of things that are needed<br />
shall we take. Then It Is necessary to explain, for a government to explain why<br />
they regard these things as the ones of most Importance. What arguments<br />
have led them to say, " Well, we'll take this field rather than that at the<br />
moment. Vie will defer this until some other time". There will always be<br />
arguments for and arguments against, and It Is essential for a well-informed<br />
community, a community that can make a proper judgment on whether to<br />
retain or dismiss the government, that these arguments should be presented<br />
first by a government and then presented In a balanced way by the communications<br />
media throughout Australia. If they do that, if they don't make a<br />
snap judgment, If they don't make a biased judgnent criticise of course<br />
but present the arguments for and against say " These i-re the arguments<br />
which are advanced for It; these are the arguments which are advanced against<br />
It", then whether we are Individuals writing a column or whether we are a<br />
newspaper or whether we are broadcasters, we say we don't agree with what<br />
Is being done for these reasons, at least the debate has become public, and<br />
become public in a way which enables a democracy to form an Informed<br />
Judgment. This Is the ultimate test of whether you gentlemen and ladies are<br />
doing your work properly: That an Informed judgment can be formed by<br />
the public. Well, I know the immense difficulties that you are under In<br />
doing this, particularly those who work for newspapers. You have a deadline<br />
for one thing. I have always believed, I have been told it Is true, I don't 9 e 9 9 </p>
<p>know; you can Inform me if it Isnt; that one of the cries of the editors of<br />
all major newspapers Is " You've got to get It on by a certain time; you've<br />
got to get It Into to us by five o'clock. If you car;, get It right, but if you<br />
can't get It right, at least get It written". That, I think, shows up, neces arily<br />
shows up because there isn't time. This is a difficulty which one understands.<br />
It seems to me there are also difficulties some times with those who happen<br />
to own newspapers because they happen to have particular beliefs In one ' W'ay<br />
or In another and they may be prepared to publish matter which supports the<br />
particular beliefs or policies which their paper Is at the moment advancing,<br />
and not report anything which Isn't supporting that or at least slant itono-way<br />
or another. This is, I think, a bad thing. I am not saying this Is on any,<br />
one particular side of politics. It Isn't. It Is on both sides, but I do think<br />
It is not a proper use of communications.<br />
I am not so disturbed about it really, because If It goes on<br />
long enough, then people say, " All right, -that paper, X, we know what it Is<br />
like, what line it is going to take on any particular matter. That paper, Y,<br />
we know what line It is going to take on any particular matter" and It doesn't<br />
have a very great effect on forming public opinion. But that Is another<br />
difficulty that you, as working Journalists, have to overcome. You can<br />
overcome it, even when the unforgiving minute doesn't allow you to devote all<br />
the time and all the arguments that are necessary on a particular matter.<br />
There are always special articles that can be written If your editor can provide<br />
you with the space. There are special talks which can be made over<br />
broadcasting networks, There are a number of smaller publications In which<br />
these things can be discussed in a more leisurely way, weekly publications and<br />
things of that kind. And so the way Is there though It may be difficult.<br />
However difficult it may be, It is necessary If we are<br />
properly to use the media of communications, for a government to do what<br />
I have said it ought to do, and for those who then take that information to use<br />
it or to attempt to use it In the way that I have suggested to you I think It<br />
ought to be used. There is only one other thing, I think, that I wish to say,<br />
and that Is that though It seems to me it is occasionally being lost sight of<br />
today, there Is also a need In using the media, particularly the written<br />
media properly, for some consideration to be paid to the use of good English.<br />
It is not always apparent that this Is happening.<br />
I do remember reading In a newspaper I am not making this<br />
up a story that was written that so-and-so saw Mr Smith " standing there<br />
being sick in his underpants". Now, they didn't mean he was being sick in<br />
his underpants any more than he was being sick In his hat. What they meant<br />
was he was wearing smalls while he was being sick. This may seem a small<br />
point, and it is In that particular context! But that lack of complete precision<br />
can lead to quite serious misunderstandings from time to time.<br />
The stories in military history where tbis kind of bad writing<br />
has led to disasters are legion. There was the Charge of the Light Brigade,<br />
for example. It was a complete mistake and came about because the general<br />
at the time used bad English when he wrote the order which was carried down<br />
to the Light Brigade. I could go through many other military despatches which<br />
were written with such conciseness that they were quite unable to be understood<br />
and therefore everybody did the wrong thing. I am not suggesting that you should<br />
do that, but I am saying the English langunge can be a method of expression so / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
which probably embodies the greatest precision of any le~ nguage since Latin,<br />
and I include French. Or it can be a really sloppy sort of language which<br />
doesn't really mean anything from which Smith can draw one inference<br />
and Jones can draw another.<br />
I really ought to apologise for talking to you so long about<br />
this, but It does seem to me that allied with what I said to you and It is<br />
not often I get a chance to tell the Press what they ought to do; it Is nearly<br />
always the other way round allied with what I have said to you of the<br />
proper use of the media Is the really proper use of English. It probably<br />
means going back to learning parsing in the schools, but I don't want to get<br />
into trouble with the Education Department at the present moment.<br />
Sir, I told you that this address was not one that was going<br />
to go deeply into matters, and It doesn't. It was an address designed to<br />
indicate the importance which I attach to your deliberations and more<br />
particularly to your work anid the way in which you carry it out. If I have<br />
touched upon some feelings. of my own about how a government ought to<br />
provide information, how those charged with disseminating It ought to use<br />
the information that Is used, I have done It because I feel it is of vital<br />
Importance to the proper running of a democracy4 It Is easy enough for a<br />
political party and indeed we all tend to do It In the House to argue to a<br />
brief, to put forward only the good points In favouir of some course, and to<br />
ignore the bad, not mention them or try and pretend they don~ t exist. I hope<br />
that thic will not grow In the political field. I hope it won't take root at all<br />
in those who disseminate it, because It is essential when cases are put, all<br />
the good points in favour of it should be put and all the bad points against It<br />
should be put If a balanced Judgment Is to be made.<br />
You are the people who will enable a balanced Judment to<br />
be made by the community. It is a heavy responsibility and I am sure you<br />
will discharge it well. I declare this open,: </p>
