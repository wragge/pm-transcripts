FOR PRESS P. M. No. 22/ 1966<br />
TALKS WITH PREMIER OF QUEENSLAND<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Hnlt<br />
There was a discussion today between representatives<br />
of the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments on the question<br />
of an extension of the Brigalow Scheme into Area 3.<br />
Area 5 is the Mackenzie Isaac River Basin section of<br />
the Fitzroy Basin area. It contains an area of about six<br />
million acres. It has a rainfall of about 25 inches per annum.<br />
Major operations in Areas 1 and 2 are nearing<br />
completion, and the Premier of Queensland, Mr. Nicklin, put it<br />
to Uommonwealth Government representatives that this is an<br />
appropriate time to consider Area 3.<br />
In addition to the Prime Minister, the discussion<br />
was attended by Mr. C. Adermann, Minister for Primary Industry,<br />
Mr. D. N. Sutherland, Head of the Northern Division of the<br />
Department of National Development, Mr. D. H. McKay Director<br />
of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics Mr. arrett First<br />
Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Treasury, and<br />
Mr. D. J. Munro; First Assistant Secretary of the Prime Minister's<br />
Department. the Queensland representatives were in additidn<br />
to the Premier, the Hon. A. R. Fletcher Minister for Lands,<br />
and Mr. E. C. Muir, Chief Commissioner lor Lands.<br />
The Commonwealth Government views the Brigalow Scheme<br />
as one of the most hopeful development prospects in Australia.<br />
Despite having to contend with drought conditions early in the<br />
history of the Scheme, experience in Areas 1 and 2 had been<br />
sufficiently encouraging to call for a full and early examination<br />
bv the Commonwealth overnment of the request now made to it<br />
in respect of Area 3. I assured the Premier of Queensland that<br />
the matter would be brought promptly to the Cabinet for its<br />
consideration. The Commonwealth Government would view the<br />
request against its general objective of maintaining a good<br />
rate of progress in Northern development.<br />
This morning's discussion also dealt with the effects<br />
of drought in Queensland. Mr. Nicklin expressed appreciation<br />
of the assistance already provided by the Commonwealth Government,<br />
and pointed to problems Which remained, particularly in relation<br />
tn the matter of re-stocking where serious stock losses had<br />
been experienced. I assured him that this matter had been<br />
actively under consideration and announcements could be expected<br />
shortly on this and other aspects of drought relief.<br />
