FOR MEDIA SATURDAY, 17 JULY 1982<br />
AUSTRALI: A'S PARTICIPATION IN INTERNATIONAL YOUTH YEAR<br />
The United Nations General Assembly has proclaimed 1.985<br />
as " International Youth Year" and deemed the themes of the<br />
Year as " Participation, Development and Peace". The Year<br />
will aim to emphasise and encourage the role of young people<br />
in national achievement and development. While the primary<br />
emphasis wilL be on national activities, the Year will<br />
encourage involvement at the international level, particularly<br />
in the Asian--Pacific Region. There would also be a significant<br />
focusing on activities leading up to 1985, with 1985 to be<br />
essentially a year for evaluating and celebrating achievements.<br />
Co-ordination of Australia' s participation at the national<br />
level in International Youth Year will be the responsibility<br />
of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations.<br />
A national Youth Year Secretariat has been established in<br />
the Office of Youth Affairs. I will also be asking other<br />
Commonwealth Ministers to consider how activities within<br />
their portfo: lios could contribute towards International Youth<br />
Year. I am writing to the State Premiers and the Chief Minister<br />
of the Northern Territory to seek their support in developing<br />
effective arrangements for the co-ordination of International<br />
Youth Year activities at the State and Territory level.<br />
I should strass the important role that non-government bodies<br />
will have in the International Youth Year. The National<br />
Youth Advisory Group will play a significant role in developing<br />
plans for the Year. So too will the Youth Affairs Council<br />
of Australia, which has already participated in a recent<br />
Asian-Pacific Youth Forum in Fiji to discuss activities<br />
having particular interest for the countries of the Region.<br />
The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations would<br />
welcome suggestions for possible activities and projects<br />
from non-government youth organisations, business, educational<br />
and other institutions, and particularly from young people<br />
themselves. The success of Australia's participation in<br />
International Youth Year depends largely on the willingness<br />
of the community as a whole to become involved by sharing in<br />
the development and staging of activities.<br />
I am confident that this early start to the planning for<br />
International Youth Year will have positive results for<br />
the young people of Australia. </p>
