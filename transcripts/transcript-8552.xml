PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
NATIONAL MEETING TO BE HELD JULY 22<br />
A national meeting on yihtrnngand_ employmenlt will<br />
be held in Canberra on Wednesday, July 22.<br />
I have invited about 40 representatives of business,<br />
community and youth organisations and unions to consider<br />
a range of proposals to increase work and training<br />
opportunities for Australia's youth.<br />
At the core of these proposals are several Government<br />
measures which I am keen to address.<br />
These include:<br />
a quality TAFE system, responsive to the needs of<br />
young people and industry;<br />
consideration of the Carmichael Report and the<br />
proposed youth training wage;<br />
the funding of local employment opportunities for<br />
young people on community, rural and environmental<br />
programs.<br />
Participants in the meeting will include representatives<br />
of companies which have already shown an innovative and<br />
enthusiastic approach to the employment of young<br />
trainees. The Government will be seeking ideas to assist and<br />
promote these efforts and encourage more businesses to<br />
follow suit.<br />
Young Australians will have a voice at the meeting<br />
through the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition<br />
as well as through discussions I will have with young<br />
people over coming weeks. 62/ 92 </p>
<p>The meeting will also be attended by the Treasurer, Mr<br />
Dawkins, the Minister for Employment, Education and<br />
Training, Mr Beazley, the Minister for Industrial<br />
Relations, Senator Cook, the Minister for Primary<br />
Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, and the Minister for<br />
Higher Education and Employment Services, Mr Baldwin.<br />
