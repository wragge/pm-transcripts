PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
MR 110WARD BENDS TO ANY BREEZE<br />
Mr Howard's response to the Government's proposal for an Australian republic is a very<br />
sad ctimmentary on the state of his thinking about Australia.<br />
He has bad more than two years to think about it, but his contortions of the past few days<br />
make it plain that it was too hard for him. Since last Wednesday night, he and the rest of<br />
the Opposition have been making it up as they have come under pressure for a considered<br />
response. What we have seen in the past week, with the headland speech and Mr Howard's republic<br />
response, is a leader not only unable to lead, but one who lacks policy substance on any<br />
front. On the republic, Mr Howard's position now seems to be this: he would hold a " people's<br />
convention" ( to which his Government would appoint half the delegates); and if the<br />
convention arrived at a " consensus", his Government would put that consensus to a<br />
referendum. If no consensus was reached at his convention, he would put a series of<br />
" 1options" to a plebiscite, with one of the options being the retention of the Monarchy. If<br />
the pr%. ferred option arising from the plebiscite was a republic, he would put that proposal<br />
to a referendum though he and any Government he led could not in conscience support<br />
it because he thinks the Constitutional Monarchy is best.<br />
Until yesterday, Mr Howard would not answer the question which counts above all others<br />
in this debate does he want an Australian to be Australia's head of state?<br />
In this morning's press he did provide the answer. He said he didn't want an Australian as<br />
our head of state he wants the Monarchy.<br />
Mr Howard now says: " If the Australian people want a republic, the fact that I support the<br />
present system need not be seen to be in the way." </p>
<p>All those Australians who believe an Australian should be our head of state should take<br />
note: Mr Howard says you can only have a vote on that when you have been through a<br />
convoluted process designed and steered by him, a monarchist.<br />
What chance would those Australians who want a republic have if a Howard Government<br />
only dleigned to put a republic referendum under a sense of obligation? No such<br />
referendum would have a snowball's chance in hell without the full commitment and<br />
enthusiasm of the Government of the day. Mr Howard's option therefore effectively<br />
mearns no republic.<br />
Mr Howard's attempt to justify his convolutions over the last few days on the grounds that<br />
they are more " consultative" and " pro-choice" is a manifest fraud. The Government has<br />
put a considered proposal which will be put to a referendum the most democratic of all<br />
acts of consultation. The referendum we propose will not take place for at least two and a<br />
half years, in which time there will be extensive consultation and debate throughout the<br />
community. If the referendum is defeated, the Monarchy remains, as it is now. That is the real<br />
democ* ratic choice, provided for in the Constitution.<br />
Now, in his desperation, Mr Howard apparently has seized on the erroneous idea that the<br />
Government would put its referendum proposal to the people repeatedly, until it was<br />
passed. This, of course, is a complete furphy.<br />
The Opposition's response on this issue has been an exercise in high farce. It has left Mr<br />
Howard looking pathetic. We have not seen its like since The Thingi that Matter. But<br />
this is worse. 3Th igs that Matterreally didn't matter at all the republic does.<br />
So does much else matter in the lives of Australians but of course Mr Howard has given<br />
his word that he will not have anything coherent to say on these things either.<br />
