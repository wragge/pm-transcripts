STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. P. J. KEATING MP<br />
APPOINTMENT OF DEPUTY OMBUDSMAN ( DEFENCE FORCE)<br />
The appointment of the present Deputy Ombudsman ( Defence<br />
Force), Air Vice-Marshal ( retd) Roy Frost AO, expired on<br />
8 July 1992.<br />
Air Vice-Marshal Frost served with success for five years<br />
in this position, which demands a combination of judgement<br />
and discretion.<br />
on behalf of the Government, I would like to express my<br />
appreciation for Air Vice-Marshal Frost's contribution<br />
during his term as Deputy Ombudsman and to wish him well<br />
in his retirement.<br />
The Governor-General today appointed Mr Richard Mills for.<br />
a three-year term as Deputy CommonwealtKi Ombudsman. Mr<br />
Mills will be designated as Deputy Ombudsman ( Defence<br />
Force). Mr Mills was previously the Head of Office of the Resource<br />
Assessment Commission.<br />
The Chief of the Defence * Force, General Peter Gration, AC<br />
OBE, has welcomed Mr Mills' appointment notwithstanding<br />
that he has not been a member of the Defence Force.<br />
Mr Mills served for fifteen years in the Department of<br />
Defence, including periods as Secretary to the Senior<br />
Defence Committees and as Senior Private Secretary to Mr<br />
Beazley when Minister for Defence. He was for a time<br />
Assistant Secretary Service Personnel ( Army).<br />
Mr Mills' background in the Public Service and in major<br />
investigations of the kind conducted by the Resource<br />
Assessment Commission will fit him well for involvement in<br />
major investigative work.<br />
