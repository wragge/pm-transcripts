    <content><![CDATA[<p>PM: A few comments on what has happened with the passage of the measure through the United States Congress. </p>
<p>This is a positive step forward in restoring stability to the global banking system. But there is still much, much more work to be done. And the stability of the banking system is important to all working families everywhere.</p>
<p>I spoke this morning to Roy Blunt, the Republican Whip, to thank him for his efforts in putting together numbers on the Republican side. And I had spoken earlier with Steny Hoyer, the Democratic Party Majority Leader to encourage him to put votes together on his side.</p>
<p>And can I say this on behalf of the Australian Government, we express our appreciation to the leadership from the US Administration, the Democrats and the Republicans, in putting aside these differences.</p>
<p>And I say again, this is a positive step forward in restoring stability of the global banking system, but there is much, much more work to be done.</p>
<p>Stability in the banking system is of fundamental importance to all working families everywhere.</p>
<p>Obviously the global financial crisis is having an effect on the global economy and we know that, we can see that in the real economy unfolding, both in growth and employment. And that's why the Australian Government has decided to bring forward its nation building program. Because we take seriously our responsibility to provide leadership at a time, of great global financial and economic crisis.</p>
<p>Can I just conclude by making these remarks. This has been a tough exercise for the United States. But beyond that, we now face a challenge of bringing about globally consistent financial regulations on transparency, on prudential standards, and on corporate governance in the financial sector.</p>
<p>This is very important in restoring stability to the global banking system and financial system long term. Also, important in restoring confidence to the banking system as well.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: (Inaudible)</p>
<p>PM: If the report is accurate, I'm disgusted by it. If the report is accurate I'm disgusted by it. I think parents would be revolted and horrified if this were true.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Can the Australian Government to more to help the family of Britt Lapthorne?</p>
<p>PM: Look, on this, the Australian Government, through its authorities, has been dealing with the local authorities since they were first notified of this matter.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister has been in contact with his counterpart, who has promised to provide every assistance.</p>
<p>The President of the Australian Senate met recently with the President, and the Government has indicated that they will provide every support to Australia. Beyond that we've also dispatched representatives of the Australian Federal Police.</p>
<p>I understand how hard this is for any family who has had one of their loved ones go missing. We take every case seriously because it could be our kids any day. I say this also, at any one time there are one million Australians off-shore. One million Australians off-shore. And our job is to do whatever we can to help families who find themselves in these horrible circumstances.</p>
<p>So we will leave no stone unturned, through the Federal Police, through our diplomats, through our consular officials, through our political contact with the Government, to do whatever we can do, to assist in this really, hard and difficult manner.</p>
