    <content><![CDATA[<p>  I am delighted that Steve Waugh will captain the Prime Minister';s XI for the match against India on Wednesday 28 January in Canberra.</p>
<p>An important element of Steve';s vast contribution to the game of cricket has always been his ability to promote and encourage young players.</p>
<p>His participation in the Prime Minister';s XI game will enhance this legacy, aiding in the development of some of the nation';s most talented cricketers.</p>
<p>The Manuka Oval fixture promises to be one of the most keenly anticipated games played in the national capital.</p>
<p>The touring Indian team has attracted huge support from Australian cricket fans for their spirited and competitive approach to the Test and one-day international matches played during the Australian summer.</p>
<p>India will be playing a Prime Minister';s XI team boasting some of Australia';s most promising young players. The Prime Minister';s XI announced by Cricket Australia today includes:</p>
<p>Stephen Waugh (captain)  NSW  Marcus North</p>
<p>  WA  Cade Brown   ACT  Matthew Bradley</p>
<p>ATSIC  David Hussey   VIC  Andrew McDonald   VIC  Chris Hartley</p>
<p>QLD  Mark Cleary</p>
<p>   SA  Damien Wright   TAS  Xavier Doherty   TAS  Shaun Tait</p>
<p>  SA</p>
<p>I wish to thank Cricket Australia for their support. Without their longstanding commitment, the Prime Minister';s XI fixture would not be possible.</p>
<p> Also, I offer congratulations to the ACT Cricket Association for the fantastic work they do each year in hosting this game.</p>
<p>The long tradition of the Prime Minister';s XI match combined with the competitive  attitude of the two teams ensures that it will be a terrific day for all cricket fans.</p>
