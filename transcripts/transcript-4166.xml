PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA AT THE BANQUET IN HIS<br />
HONOUR GIVEN BY PREMIER HUA KUO-FENG 20TH JUNE 1976<br />
Premier Hua Kuo-Feng, distinguished Chinese friends, Excellencies,<br />
ladies and gentlemen. I want to express my appreciation for the<br />
warmth of the welcome provided to us this afternoon, and to<br />
all those members of the Diplomatic Corps who came to the airport<br />
to greet us.<br />
I accepted with great pleasure your invitation to visit China.<br />
My visit gives us both an opportunity to consider further our<br />
developing relationship. I come to Peking with the specific<br />
objective of deepening the understanding between our two<br />
Governments and peoples. For the future well-being of our people<br />
and of the people of the region in which we are interested, it is<br />
important that we understand each other's hopes and aspirations;<br />
each other's viewpoints on the world and regional situations.<br />
It is important that we make every effort to improve our understanding<br />
of each other. A major theme of my visit to China and Japan is the<br />
need to develop understanding between people with different<br />
histories and cultures. I strongly believe that action should be<br />
taken to improve the mutual understanding of our two countries.<br />
The Major exhibition of China's historical treasures that-will<br />
shortly be going to Australia is not only greatly appreciated by<br />
Australia, but will do much to increase interest in China among<br />
Australians. China's historical experience would provide ample justification<br />
for her being suspicious of outsiders. But the world changes and<br />
a realistic analysis of current interests must determine attitudes.<br />
We approach foreign policy not on the basis of a country's ideology<br />
nor its social system, but on its international policies and the<br />
way it relates to other countries. What is required is an<br />
identification of the conmmon interests countries share with one<br />
another. I believe our mutual interests are becoming clearer, and </p>
<p>-2-<br />
more clearly realised by both of us. The importance to us both<br />
of future developments in the Asian/ Pacific region, and the<br />
future importance of that region, provides a basis for a working<br />
relationship. There is much value in frank communication and<br />
discussion. In this way, we can each take account of the real<br />
interests of the other. We look for a realistic relationship<br />
carrying mutual practical benefits. Benefits of that sort are<br />
clearly to be seen in the growth of our trading relationship.<br />
Modern technology facilitates, and makes more necessary, greater<br />
direct personal contact, which can lead to an enduring relationship.<br />
I am aware of China's view that there is " great disorder under heaven".<br />
In a period of disorder and uncertainty in international affairs, the<br />
need for realistic priorities and approaches to security cannot<br />
be questioned. The right to decide one's own destiny is perhaps<br />
the strongest moving force in all the countries of our region.<br />
Australia is determined to act in parallel and in concert with others<br />
to preserve its national independence. Australia is resolutely<br />
opposed to the attempt of any great powers to dominate others.<br />
Australia has long supported, including in many practical ways,<br />
cooperation between countries of South East Asia. In particular,<br />
we have built up a unique relationship with the five ASEAN countries<br />
and attach great importance to it. We support all the ASEAN<br />
countries in their efforts to ensure that no great power dominates<br />
their region. We seek stability and balance in the Indian Ocean<br />
on which we border. To our north-. east we seek to build relations<br />
of mutual respect and mutual benefit with the newly-emerging nations<br />
of Oceania. With New Zealand, and the United States, we are<br />
joined in the ANZUS Treaty, by which we have undertaken to act<br />
separately and jointly to maintain and develop our individual and<br />
collective defence capacity. I therefore look forward, your<br />
Excellency, to exploring with you in more detail our respective<br />
views about the challenges confronting us in the world today.<br />
I look forward to an exchange of ideas on how stability in our<br />
region may be built through cooperation and through the sympathetic<br />
support of others working for peace and cooperation.. China, like<br />
other major powers, has a great task in improving the standard of<br />
life Of her people. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
I look forward to hearing about your approach to economic development<br />
and to the objectives set by your Chairman for China to achieve<br />
by the end of the century. I look forward to the opportunity<br />
you will be so generously giving me to see that economic performance<br />
in action, particularly in the field of agriculture, which is<br />
of such basic importance to both our countries, and in which I,<br />
myself, have some interest. As China succeeds in this task, her<br />
influence on world affairs will be even greater. How China exercises<br />
that influence will be a major factor determining the possibilities<br />
for world peace, for the remainder of this century and for the next.<br />
In the end, the strength of a country is the resourcefulness and<br />
application of its people, and we as Governments must always<br />
understand that we are the servants of the people, and the people<br />
are our masters.<br />
Not the least remarkable chapter in a long and proud history, in which<br />
China has contributed so much to world civilisation, is the great<br />
efforts of her people today to build a new society benefiting all<br />
its members. It is with the importance of that great endeavour<br />
in mind, and in appreciation and gratitude for your invitation and<br />
your splendid hospitality that, on behalf of my wife and all<br />
my party, I propose a toast to Chairman Mao Tsetung, to your Excellency<br />
Premier Hua Kuo-Feng, to all distinguished guests here tonight,<br />
and to the growth of understanding between the peoples of China<br />
and Australia. oo00oo </p>
