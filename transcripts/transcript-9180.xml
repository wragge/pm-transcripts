0; Mr Prime Minister, my name Is Bruce Crompton, Gold Corporation,<br />
Thailand. Is it your Government's pol icy to continue with projects such<br />
as the Friendship Bridge, It's unbelievable the amount of good will that it<br />
has created in this area?<br />
PM: Thank you. Well the answer to that Is yes it Is. Australia each year<br />
commits a substantial proportion of its natural resources, or certainly its<br />
fiscal resources, its budget resources to foreign aid, that is development<br />
and program _ aid. Aid we try and mainlaki're'asonable share of-our<br />
budgetary appropriations to this task. We think In well-judged, wellresearched<br />
projects that we can undertake some which, are often<br />
beyond the capacity of national governments to do, particularly in public<br />
Infrastructure of the variety of this bridge across the Mekong. And just<br />
yesterday I announced inl Vientiane that we are now providing that<br />
country, Laos, with a four year tollig program of aid which will be<br />
devoted to public Infrastructure, to education and to health. So, I think,<br />
we see a role for ourselves in the region doing things like the Friendship<br />
Bridge. Things whilch often are difficult for some national governments<br />
to do, to find resources and do. The main thing is that we pick the right<br />
projects, There are always many oN offer, but some better than others<br />
to be taken up. It is certainly our intention to keep doing the sorts of<br />
things we are doing with the Bridge.<br />

PM; In the issue of?<br />
Q: Human rights and ( Inaudible)<br />
PM: Well. Australia is a true liberal democracy. Australia is a very deep<br />
rooted democracy and that democracy has expressed Itself in a respect<br />
for human values and human endeavour and human rights which I think<br />
I could say few in the world have, if not emulated, done better or are<br />
more committed to those ideals. As you know, Australia has been In a<br />
number of international conflicts over this last century, never for one<br />
square centimetre of territory. Always out of indignation at the actions<br />
of others against the liberties of other people. So Australia regards its<br />
concern for human rights as very much a natural offspring of its society,<br />
of its sense of culture and democracy and tolerance and it will put Its<br />
views forthrightly and strongly where ever we think human rights are<br />
being violated. Now, we have put these views often and consistently In<br />
places where, often in foreign policy and trade terms, has not been<br />
entirely convenient for us to put them but we have put them<br />
nevertheless. And will continue to put them. And I don't believe, and<br />
never have believed for a second, that Australia's democracy or values<br />
need be compromised or that it is a burden for Australia to share these<br />
views in various parts of the world. But, by the same token, Australia<br />
does see national relationships in the broad and the Important thing is to<br />
be effective in trying to improve human rights in some countries. We<br />
believe one can be most effective doing this in a broader relationship of<br />
many parts. So that, therefore, the cost to countries of losing parts of<br />
this relationship become more expensive. And I think we have been<br />
more effective in making our voice heard In human rights by maintaining<br />
a broad relationship with a nation that we are dealing with. And, I think,<br />
in terms of our own debate about this subject, it's a matter whether one<br />
wants to be heard ineffectively or whether one wants to be effective. If<br />
one wants to be effective, one does not have to compromise values of<br />
the kind which you have asked me and to which I have referred.<br />
Q: If I may, Bruce Clark, Avacor Company. Mr Keating, you have built a<br />
fantastic bridge in Non Khai. I have seen it and it is great. I would like<br />
to ask you whether AIDAB is contemplating anything as regards a<br />
coordinated computer controlled motor traffic system here rather than a<br />
rail traffic system.<br />
PM Well, I think that, I am quite sure that a number of members of the<br />
government of Thailand will know by now and if they don't I will tell them<br />
that one of the things that Australia has developed is a sophisticated<br />
clty traffic computerised traffic system which spirits traffic around a<br />
number of Australian cities on the basis of a central control. And this<br />
has worked very effectively because it provides a monitoring role, as<br />
well as a computerised dispersion role and so good is the system we<br />
think it has got international market ability. We don't think that we've<br />
actually sold it to a number of countries. So while I'm not exactly a<br />
travelling salesman for these things I am quite happy to give them a kind<br />
reference on the way through. Thank you very much </p>
