TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH DEAN BANKS/ ROSS STEVENSON, RADIO 3AW<br />
MELBOURNE, 5 OCTOBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: We are joined this morning by the Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Good morning, Dean.<br />
J: You are largely known to be nocturnal, as opposed to this early...<br />
PM: And I am largely that. But some invitations I can't resist.<br />
J: I was going to say, you're a week late, you know, the Grand Final was<br />
last week. The real one.<br />
PM: I know. Well, for us there's a Grand Final every 3 years.<br />
J: Oh so we're in election mode now, are we.<br />
PM: No, no you said the real one, and that's next year, the way we're<br />
going.<br />
J: Sort of seems like we're in election mode.<br />
PM: Well, I suppose it does. I mean, but people have been saying this<br />
now for 18 months. You might remember John Hewson was still<br />
Opposition leader during this Parliament, and he said we were going<br />
to an election, and then Aldxander Downer said the same, and Mr<br />
Howard. But I, well, we're now into October, so it's not going to be<br />
early.<br />
J: Is it true you don't like travelling?<br />
PM: I don't like travelling? </p>
<p>J: Yeah I read something in one of the papers the other day.<br />
PM; No, no. I like travelling I like getting about. I was in South Australia<br />
the day before yesterday, and Melbourne yesterday and today.<br />
J; We don't seem to see you down here much, though.<br />
PM: I come here lots often. But I'm in and out, you know. I do things,<br />
and I generally shoot back home.<br />
J: But it's not really a public performance when you come to Melbourne?<br />
PM: Well, it depends how much coverage I get, I suppose. But I come<br />
here very often I'm here every couple of weeks.<br />
J: Tell us, we do get reported comments of yours from time to time that<br />
sort of seep out of they seem to seep out of dinner parties to the<br />
effect that you say things like in Australia if you are not living in<br />
Sydney, you're camping out?<br />
PM: No somebody falsely attributed those words to me. I, love<br />
Melbourne the garden city of Australia.<br />
J: Tell us in your heart of hearts when you get with your mates your<br />
real mates, the ones where confidentiality is at a premium....<br />
PM: There's no such thing as confidentiality.<br />
J: But even when you get with them at a dinner party behind closed<br />
doors, do you ever give Melbourne a nice old bucketing?<br />
PM: No. I'm a great fan of Melbourne's. And I have tried to do some<br />
things here particularly when things were low a couple of years ago<br />
and they have basically happened, I think, a few of the things we<br />
have been involved with. And I have been very keen to see Victoria,<br />
you know, get its act together and to move on. Because this is a<br />
lovely city the Treasury building for instance,, is one thing that I was<br />
involved with. We did that in One Nation cleaned it up, and<br />
provided the funding to turn that into, again, another building of<br />
important status that could be used for public purposes. And we<br />
have also been great supporters of Southbank...<br />
J: Home of the new casino?<br />
PM: Well, home of the new Casino, but a good development. The value<br />
in the city jumped the River. I have been vocal about Melbourne's<br />
skyline, about its architecture, about its town planning, I'm opposed to<br />
100 storey buildings... 2 j. </p>
<p>J: You've convinced me know that you are the greatest fan that<br />
Melbourne has in the world!<br />
J: In fact, that's where that quote came from, wasn't it those years ago,<br />
that you said the disappointing thing about Melbourne now is that<br />
there aren't a lot of buildings that you can have a good perve at?<br />
PM: Oh, I could have said something like that, but it's a bit crass for me,<br />
that, isn't it? But Melbourne has got a great architectural heritage<br />
about it. It's taken the sort . the people have taken the natural<br />
topography and made something of it. If I look at Sydney where I'm<br />
from where there has always been that great advantage of the<br />
Harbour, which is the natural asset the city had, Sydney has never<br />
done as much with the rest of the place as the people of Melbourne<br />
have done with Melbourne. I mean, I think this . you can see vista<br />
upon vista here of city-scapes, and really particularly suburb<br />
development, and suburb and views, they are by and large<br />
superior to most of Australia's cities.<br />
J: You mention that word " election" a little bit earlier on do you get a<br />
sense that, these days, with the parties being so close, that this next<br />
election may be an election without issues?<br />
PM; Oh, it will be an election with issues. I said the other day, it will be a<br />
referendum on ideas.<br />
J: But that's big picture stuff, isn't it?<br />
PM: Well, I don't think so. I mean, ideas matter for the future, they matter<br />
for the sort of world and the country our children will live in. I mean,<br />
my children are now just becoming teenagers it wasn't so long ago<br />
they were just little kids, and in 10. years' time, they will be well and<br />
truly into their adult lives, so we have got to think now about what sort<br />
of country we are going to be...<br />
J: Is that sort of creating the issues for when the election runs?<br />
PM: No, I think, but, say, some of the things we have been speaking about<br />
or I have been involved with such as APEC [ where] I'll be going up<br />
to Osaka in November threading together a free-trade area in the<br />
Pacific to give Australia a place in the big markets for the first time<br />
ever, and a seat at a very big table. Now, some people might think<br />
it a bit abstract, but it isn't. It matters to us now, but it will matter<br />
more to our children in a decade. I mean, these sorts of issues are<br />
the sort of country that we live in, the view we have of ourselves, the<br />
values we have all these things I think are important.<br />
J: They might be just a bit too big to be able to convey in 30 second<br />
sound grabs, though? </p>
<p>PM: I don't know if you look at the OJ Simpson trial yesterday what you<br />
saw yesterday was...<br />
J: Do you think he's guilty?<br />
PM: Well, what you saw there was a division of opinion around a division<br />
of values. Now, I think in this country . this is a multi-cultural<br />
country and I made this point last night we're certainly not... . we are<br />
doing the opposite to homogenising the culture, but we are certainly<br />
homogenising the values. And I think it is very important that we<br />
have a set of core values as a community where we mean something<br />
to each other, and we mean something to one another, and we don't<br />
take that sort of view which is very typified now of America that the<br />
strong take the best, and the devil takes the hindmost. And I think<br />
that is sort of a callous view of the world that the strong prosper and<br />
the weak fall off the back of the truck is something that the Labor<br />
Party, and I in particular, have always resisted. And a lot of this<br />
coming election will be about those sorts of thongs about whether<br />
you do have a safety net for wages, whether you do have a social<br />
wage, whether you do keep Medicare.<br />
J: Talking of Medicare, are you going to revamp it, according to a report<br />
in The Australian this morning it seems you are?<br />
PM: Well, we're constantly looking at it, because it is constantly changing,<br />
because the quality of health services have changed, I think, for the<br />
better in a decade. The main thing is that we are getting any<br />
outcomes, I mean....<br />
J: Is that a yes? You are going to give us a revamp<br />
PM: We'll be doing some things with it but again, I have said the other<br />
day, and I have just said to you-here this will be a referendum of<br />
ideas, and the Government has got plenty of ideas in the market<br />
place, and that Cabinet of mine is always brimming over with ideas<br />
we have always got more things there than we can use. And I think<br />
this is the same in health. But, it is important that we keep the tone<br />
on Medicare so that it does serve the community well.<br />
J: Do you think, Prime Minister, that you made a mistake some years<br />
ago when you were Treasurer to accept the advice of John Howard,<br />
and when Mr Howard told you that you should live in Canberra,<br />
instead of commuting all over the place? In other words, you have<br />
been stuck there for such a long, long time do you feel that you're<br />
away from the Australian people? There's so many retired politicians<br />
say to us that, you know, that's cloud cuckoo-land up there?<br />
PM; Well, I'm in Sydney or Melbourne virtually every week if I'm in<br />
Sydney one week, I'll be in Melbourne the next, or Adelaide the next.<br />
I mean, 1get around this country alt fm -all dthe bme And the other </p>
<p>thing is, we're not just sitting in a cell in Canberra people come<br />
through the door, I mean, business people, community groups you<br />
are constantly seeing a range of people. As well as, of course,<br />
dealing with the media. So, I love getting around Australia I mean, I<br />
love the country, and I love looking at it, seeing it, talking to people,<br />
and I think I'm as in touch with it as any Prime Minister could have<br />
ever have been.<br />
J: Have you cast your eyes to what you might do after politics it<br />
occurred to me, I wonder whether having to make these repeated<br />
protests to the French is cruelling your post-Prime Ministerial job<br />
prospects in Paris?<br />
PM: You mean for the Paris Option?<br />
J: Yes.<br />
PM; No, well, I think I have got a bit of time to do here, before I do any of<br />
that.<br />
J: Well, having won the last one which was described as the<br />
impossible win is the next win optional for you?<br />
PM: Oh no they are never optional. No, you have got to go in hard after<br />
them no-one gives you these things on a plate, you have got to earn<br />
them. The public are quite smart about all this they say look, we<br />
make these characters earn our support we get value from them that<br />
way. And when they see a tug-of-war going on, they say this is good<br />
we are going to get some value here. So they like the contest they<br />
like, you know they like to hear the ideas. I mean, one of the strikes<br />
I am making against John Howard is Andrew Robb says he has got<br />
98% of their policies finished. To which I say, well, why are you<br />
hiding them from the Australian people?<br />
J: Because it's good politics?<br />
PM: No it's not. I don't think it is good politics. I think the public are<br />
entitled for their leaders to give them the directions which the country<br />
ought go. To give them the shape of the sort of Government they<br />
would lead.<br />
J: But you get a situation like Martin Ferguson bashing up the Coalition<br />
about the privatisation, and yet you have flogged off Qantas and the<br />
Commonwealth Bank and ANL and so on or attempted to?<br />
PM: Yes, but we have still put our policies in the market place. And I think<br />
that if you do that, you say to people well, this is what we stand for,<br />
but saying ha ha, look, we are going to be tricky here [ andjwe are<br />
now just going to give you a glimpse of them, like a sort of a dirty<br />
postcad,. and pull it out of the sleeve, and give you a quick look at it<br />
S </p>
<p>before you go and vote, this is the Howard view of the world, It's a<br />
view without integrity, in my opinion. I think honesty and credibility in<br />
public life is only about policies it certainly starts with policies. And<br />
you know, they should be in the market place, and in getting them<br />
there, people can make a judgement. And they see where the value<br />
is, and they can make a decision.<br />
J: Just the very thought of John Howard pulling a dirty postcard out of<br />
his jacket.<br />
PM: Well, a policy postcard. ( inaudible)...<br />
J: Do you ever look at some of your former colleagues who have now<br />
retired and envy them their position you know, you pick up The<br />
Bulletin every week, presumably you read Richo's article you know,<br />
where he is getting paid $ 400,000 by Kerry Packer to churn out that<br />
stuff?<br />
PM: I know, but they're all trying to get back in the game, aren't they? I<br />
mean, they're all victims for a microphone or a television camera.<br />
J: Do you read Richo's column every week in The Bulletin?<br />
PM: No. I don't read The Bulletin, much. The Bulletin has died as a<br />
magazine years ago, I think. I mean, The Bulletin was a must-read<br />
thing 10-15 years ago, but it's a must-forget magazine these days.<br />
J: What do you read?<br />
PM: I read the newspapers, in the main.<br />
J: Yep. Preferred paper?<br />
PM: No, I read the Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, The Australian and<br />
The Financial review most mornings, and then when I get to work, I<br />
pick up the Courier Mail, and the Adelaide Advertider and West<br />
Australian.<br />
J: What do you expect from the Packer outlets whenever this next<br />
election is called? What do you anticipate from the Packer organs?<br />
PM: Oh, well, I don't think it ends up being much different, whatever they<br />
think about you what ever the proprietor's view is.<br />
J: But do you think that the proprietor's view is going to, at some stage,<br />
filter through one of his outlets?<br />
PM: In some respects. I mean, they will do the... .60 Minutes will sort of get<br />
the message to do a softie on Howard, or something like that. But<br />
again, they're one segment Proprietors are very it's very hard for a </p>
<p>7<br />
proprietor to program the news. It's like the proprietors of this station<br />
saying to you guys look, this is what you should be asking the Prime<br />
Minister. You would say oh come off it, wouldn't you?<br />
J: Absolutely.<br />
PM: Absolutely.<br />
J: Peter Nixon asked me if I could ask you...<br />
PM: He's an old mate of mine.<br />
J: Nicko said it's interesting you raised that 60 Minutes thing that was<br />
about the closest we got to learn a little bit about this fella called Paul<br />
Keating. You have been in public life for what 26 years, yet we have<br />
had your sister sitting in that chair where you're sitting we probably<br />
learned more about you from Annie than we have ever found out from<br />
you yourself?<br />
PM: Well, I have had so many of these so-called colour pieces written<br />
about<br />
J: You don't like any of those, do you?<br />
PM: No. Basically, if I could do the job completely privately, I would. I<br />
don't really like the razzamatazz. That is, the so-called celebrity<br />
status of it. But, there's nothing about me that isn't written there<br />
somewhere, or said in some television program, or in some profile. I<br />
mean, there's been so many written over the years, that when<br />
someone comes and says look, we would like to do a profile on you,<br />
we say oh cut it out cut it out, we have done so many.<br />
J: Do you feel the Australian community knows you, though?<br />
PM: I think they know me, back to front.<br />
J: You puzzle me in that sense, because I remember Ros Kelly saying<br />
for example there are two of you the one the public knows, and the<br />
one that she knows.<br />
PM; Well, they certainly know the public me I think they have seen me<br />
for a long time, now. Privately, we are all different privately I think<br />
probably I mean, you're different privately than you are on radio, I'm<br />
sure of that.<br />
J: Like you wouldn't believe.<br />
PM: That's right. Well, I think we all are. We all are. We're a bit... . we are<br />
different And, of course, you're not in that sort of competitive<br />
environment, and so you behave differently. And I suppose it would </p>
<p>be good of the community saw more of that, but how do you do that?<br />
You can hardly invite the TV camera's in for brekkie, can you?<br />
J: No. Here's a question for you I have been dieing to ask, Prime<br />
Minister. Is there any danger of getting Laurie Brereton to get the<br />
time of an air flight from Melbourne to Sydney down under about a<br />
day and a half?<br />
PM: Well, I don't know. I mean, certainly if John Howard shuts that Third<br />
Runway down, it will be two and a half days.<br />
J: But it is, I mean...<br />
PM: You would grow old on the trip.<br />
J: But I know just talking to people who travel from Melbourne from<br />
Sydney on an aeroplane, but it's just getting longer and longer.<br />
PM: Well, just imagine if you cut 35% of Sydney's capacity out. I mean,<br />
this is what this thing with Howard was about last week. It wasn't so<br />
much about the runway, or about the travel time, it was to say this<br />
he's been at me and others saying " we have got to take Australia to<br />
the next phase of micro-economic reform. The Labor Party can't do<br />
this we're the blokes that will crack the tough nuts of the waterfront,<br />
and the airlines and the labour market. Okay, the government's done<br />
not a bad job, but they have come about as far as they can go, you<br />
had better give it to us". The greatest micro-economic change in Civil<br />
Aviation infrastructure in the last 20 years is the 3rd runway at<br />
Mascot in Sydney. And first whiff of grapeshot, first bit of pressure,<br />
and Mr Howard is about buckling under and cutting its capacity back.<br />
So what would he do on all the really hard things, like ports, wharves<br />
and the labour market? And the-answer is buckle. That's the point<br />
it wasn't a discussion about the airport so much, but the airport is still<br />
central. It's been the gateway to Australia, Mascot. It has the most<br />
international flights, and just to get the East Coast group working<br />
properly at Brisbane-Sydney-Melbourne.<br />
J; It was working properly, though wasn't it?<br />
PM; To get it working properly, you have got at least to have the capacity.<br />
See, a few years ago the Government de-regulated the airline system<br />
we took away the 2-airline agreement. As a result, air fares<br />
dropped 25% roughly<br />
J: Yeah am I right in saying we wound up with 2 airlines?<br />
PM: But you have got a competitive system. A 25% fall in airfares, and<br />
plus increase in traffic 60%. In the last 3 years, 60% more<br />
people are travelling. Now, what that has done is put huge pressure<br />
on Sydney and Melbourne, but particularly on Sydney. And without </p>
<p>that 3rd runway, without those parallel operations, we would I<br />
mean, God knows how long it would take you to get everywhere else.<br />
J: Let me ask you a question are you going to come to the Melbourne<br />
Grand Prix at Albert Park, which I remind you is on March 10, or have<br />
you got something else planned for that weekend?<br />
PM: Well, Jeff has not invited me. He's keeping this one to himself.<br />
J: We got a couple of tickets, if you want to come?<br />
PM: Maybe you will let me have one?<br />
J: Yeah, you're more than welcome. Score our Premier out of 10 for<br />
us?<br />
J: Is he the biggest ally you have got in your hopes for re-election?<br />
PM: Well, he . yes, he is a complex character, is our Jeffery. He will do<br />
some things that's what the public like about him, he'll get in and do<br />
some things. That's what I like about him. What I don't like about<br />
him is the sort of ideological cast of the Government -it's still basically<br />
the hard-hearted view, and if you see it writ large in the Federal<br />
arena, that means, you know, cuts in Government spending, it means<br />
cuts in payments to families, it means all those sorts of things.<br />
J: A 6 maybe?<br />
PM: Hmmm?<br />
J: A6?<br />
PM: Oh yes, I'll give him a 6.<br />
J: You pass him. And one word -we're out of time we're out of time,<br />
one word answer OJ Simpson, do you think he is guilfy or not?<br />
PM: Well, I think what is guilty is the circus which-it was has meant that<br />
justice could never have really been done, one way or the other.<br />
J: Prime Minister, thank you for joining us maybe every 2 weeks, now,<br />
given your frequency in Melbourne.<br />
PM: ( inaudible)<br />
ends. </p>
