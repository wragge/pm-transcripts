23 Januaiy 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
LAUNCH OF AUSTRALIA POST<br />
AUSTRALIAN LEGENDS STAMP SERIES<br />
SYDNEY CRICKET GROUND<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
Thank you very much Mr John to the MC, Alan Jones, to Maurice Williams the<br />
Chairman of Australia Post, to Sir Nicholas Shehadie the Chairman of the Sydney<br />
Cricket and Sports Ground Trust, Denis Rogers the Chairman of the Australian<br />
Cricket Board, Alan Davidson the Chairman of the NSW Cricket Association. And I<br />
notice amongst the many sporting personalities here today the one person who played<br />
with the man who is going to be named as the carrier of the title of the first Australian<br />
legend in the postal series, that's Neil Harvey, so a particular welcome to Neil.<br />
Ladies and gentleman, I want to say a couple of things about Australia Post, Australia<br />
Day, but also of course a number of things about the significance of the inauguration of<br />
this series in postage stamps titled Australian Legends. Australia Day in my experience<br />
has been one of those celebrations which, in the quite spontaneous fashion, has grown<br />
in stature and lustre and public support over the years. When I was a school boy in<br />
Sydney in the late 1 940s and early 50s, Australia Day was I think still called<br />
Anniversary Day and people didn't celebrate it with quite the enthusiasm and the<br />
affection and the reverence that they do these days. And over the years in a quite<br />
unselfconscious, spontaneous way Australia Day has gathered support.<br />
We have major celebrations all around Australia and, contrary to popular comment in<br />
some of the newspapers in recent days, the idea that the Prime Minister of this country<br />
should actually announce the Australian of The Year in a city other than Sydney is not<br />
a heresy. It has never been the situation that Sydney has some kind of mortgage on<br />
that particular event and the work of local Australia Day Councils and Barry<br />
Unsworth, a former Premier of New South Wales, who is now the Chairman of the<br />
Australia Day Council here in New South Wales those organisations do a marvellous<br />
job in focussing our public celebration of our national day and I am very happy to say<br />
as Prime Minister of Australia how delighted I am at the growing public affection for, </p>
<p>-2-<br />
and public support for Australia Day it is an occasion which belongs to all of us<br />
irrespective of our political beliefs, irrespective of our ethnic or other backgrounds and<br />
irrespective of views we may have on other subjects Australia Day is an occasion<br />
where those differences dissolve and are replaced by the things that bind us all together<br />
as Australians. And Australia Post has played a major part as a big sponsor of<br />
Australia Day and Australia Post itself is, as it's Managing Director has said, it is<br />
something of an Australian icon and it has made a great contribution over the decades<br />
to getting rid of what Geoffrey Blainey described as the ' tyranny of distance' which<br />
was a reality of the formation of Australia and has been a reality of Australian life for<br />
so very long.<br />
So I want to thank Australia Post for inaugurating the series of Australian Legends.<br />
And I understand that over the next five or more years each year there will be an<br />
Australian Legends postage stamp. And it is of course in my view, and I am sure in the<br />
view of all Australians, entirely appropriate that the first Australian legend should be<br />
the greatest living Australian and that is Sir Donald Bradman. It is entirely appropriate<br />
that in choosing Sir Donald as the first in the series of Australian legends, Australia<br />
Post recognises the special contribution that he has made to the Australian character,<br />
to the Australian identity. He wasn't only the greatest cricketer ever to play that<br />
wonderful game. He didn't only achieve the most extraordinary test average of just<br />
short of 100. He didn't lead what most people still regard as the greatest cricket team<br />
ever to have left Australian shores and that is the famous 1948 Ashes Team that went<br />
to England.<br />
But more than that, or equal to that, he gave hope and encouragement and inspiration<br />
to a generation of Australians particularly during the depression years when the<br />
memories of the terrible slaughter and loss of young Australian manhood in France and<br />
on the beaches of Gallipoli was still very much part of the Australian psyche. When the<br />
spirit and the hopes and the sense of well-being of the Australian people were at a<br />
particularly low ebb, he gave all of Australia then enormous hope and enormous<br />
inspiration. And he gave them something very tangible and something very enjoyable<br />
to believe in, to identify with and they saw him as a repository of what was valuable<br />
and what was positive about the Australian character. He had great ability, he had<br />
great tenacity, he was infinitely courteous and he had great humility. And they are very<br />
fine qualities and they are qualities that Sir Donald has carried through his entire life.<br />
The first time that I came to this ground in my life was in 1949 and that was to see Sir<br />
Donald play his very last innings at the Sydney Cricket Ground in the Kippax Oldfield<br />
Testimonial. And I came there as a 10 year old boy with my father and I sat on the<br />
Sydney Hill where so many people did in those days, and it was much part of the<br />
practice and the institution of coming to watch cricket in those days and into the 1950s<br />
and for part of the 1960s. So I have a particular memory of that and it is an<br />
extraordinary thing that it is now only a few years short of 50 years since he stopped<br />
playing first class cricket and apart from what I understand, one Prime Minister' s XI<br />
that one of my predecessors persuaded him to turn out in in 1963, it's just on 50 years<br />
since he had played the game. And yet he remains in the hearts and the minds of<br />
Australians as still The Don. He's straddled the generations of Australians like no<br />
other Australian has ever been able to do. And when you talk about cricket to children<br />
under 10 now they still talk about Bradman. I am told that if you go around the Indian </p>
<p>sub-continent the name Bradman, when you are asked about Australians, is still the<br />
name that is first delivered and the name that is most vividly remembered. So for all of<br />
those reasons I could not think of a finer, more appropriate and entirely perfect choice<br />
that Australia Post has made in choosing Sir Donald Bradman as a subject of the<br />
Australian Legend series. It is the first time that Australia Post will have a living<br />
Australian on the postage stamp and the idea over the coming years of having a<br />
famous Australian figure on the postage stamp as part of this Legend Series is just<br />
another way in which a great Australian organisation is making a contribution to an<br />
understanding of Australian history and a contribution towards honouring not the<br />
performance only of people on the sporting fields but also the contribution that those<br />
sports men and women have made and continue to make to the Australian character.<br />
I have to say that it is a great personal pleasure to have been asked to be here today<br />
and to launch this series. This is a slightly easier meeting than I had yesterday and it is<br />
a great personal pleasure to be associated with a game and of course the greatest<br />
personality in that game for which I have an immense personal affection.<br />
Australia Post today recognises Sir Donald's contribution in two unique ways. Firstly,<br />
Sir Donald will appear on two stamps, the first living Australian featured on an<br />
Australian stamp there will be a portrait on one of those stamps and his classic cover<br />
drive on the other. Secondly, it will be struck in gold the stamps will be presented to<br />
Sir Donald and he is sorry that he can't be with us today, but in a separate function in<br />
Adelaide this morning they are going to be accepted on his behalf by Mr Mark Taylor,<br />
the Captain of the Australian Cricket Team and I will add to the written text that I was<br />
asked to deliver verbatim can I simply add that all of us wish Mark and his colleagues<br />
the greatest of good fortune when they do battle with the West Indies commencing in<br />
Adelaide on Saturday morning.<br />
And it is now my very great pleasure to release the stamps publicly.<br />
