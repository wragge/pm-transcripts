TRANSCRIPT OF COMMENTS, GREENSBOROUGH SHOPPING MALL, MELBOURNE,<br />
7 APRIL 1987<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mir ! Hat.' ke, are you concerned about the Libyan<br />
presence in the South Pacific?<br />
PM: Yes, I am. And I didn't wait until I saw it in the<br />
Age newspaper today to know about it. I have expressing<br />
my concern about this for a considerable period of time.<br />
And not just expressing our concern but for some time with<br />
the United States I have told them that they would be making<br />
a serious mistake in the South Pacific over a number of years<br />
and leaving their foreign policy situation in the South Pacific<br />
to the American Tuna Boat Association. Unfortunately, that<br />
created a vacuum and you had there where the Soviet Union<br />
was able to move into Kirabati with their fishing agreement.<br />
They are now doing it with Vanuatu. And now, fortunately,<br />
the United States has finalised this $ 60m arrangement fisheries<br />
paymenL over a 5 year-period. That is going to start to<br />
remedy the situation. But the problem is that in that sort<br />
of vacuum the Soviet moved into some extent and so have the<br />
Libyans. We are very much aware of what has happened in<br />
the firms of people going from Vanuatu to Libya, the connection<br />
between the Libyans and Vanuatua, the OPM. And now, very<br />
worringly, the suggestion that there is going to be a linkage<br />
into New Caledonia with the Libyans. We are monitoring it<br />
very closely. I have expressein the South Pacific Forum<br />
in the last 2 years as strongly as I could, concern that<br />
the nations of the South Pacific should not get entangled<br />
with the Libyans because it is just preposterous there<br />
is this little country of 3 million people in North Africa<br />
3 m~ illion people enveloped in conflict with its immediate<br />
neighbours, and in conflict with France. By what measure<br />
of anything that starts to be intellectually reasonable can<br />
their presence in the South Pacific be justified. They have<br />
a monstrous record in terms of their relations with other<br />
countries. They embrace the tactic of terror. And I say<br />
quite firmly and deliberately that any countries in this<br />
region that enter into dealings with them are making a very<br />
grave mistake. Libya is not here for any altruistic reason.<br />
They are here to promote terrorism, unrest, and obviously<br />
most recently, because Libya is concerned with the conflA,) t<br />
it is having with France, then they are going to try and<br />
foment armed terrorist situations here to embarrass the French.<br />
No-one is more stronger than I am in terms of criticising<br />
the French for the way they are handling the present French </p>
<p>Pci~ Mi, f ~, E0EB4.~~ UC48~ 70I 8 10 03 F .0 3 2.<br />
PM cont: Government is handling the transition in New<br />
Caledonia. But I say quite straightforwardly that I would<br />
stand shoulder to shoulder with France in condemning the<br />
injection into this terribly volatile situation of any Libyan<br />
presence. They bring, they have never in recent history.<br />
been identified with bringing to any situation mollifying<br />
influences, peaceful influences, cohesive influences. Their<br />
whole record has been one of terrorism, of destabilisation.<br />
We don't want and we don't need them in the region.<br />
JOURNALIST: Any sort of action you can think of taking,<br />
any talks you can<br />
PM: The countries in the region are sovereign countries.<br />
Vanuatu is a sovereign, indepedent nation. We can make it<br />
clear as we have that we believe it is unwise for a nation<br />
to get into a close association with Libya. I have made<br />
that clear directly in meetings of the South Pacific Forum<br />
countries. I have made it clear in many public statements.<br />
But in the end these are sovereign, independent nations.<br />
And I can Just but continue to warn them. As far as we are<br />
concerned we have increased and you would have noticed<br />
that the Minister for Defence announced Just in the last<br />
few weeks we have increased the extent of maritime surveillance<br />
exercises by the Royal Australian Navy in the South Pacific<br />
Region. We want the countries in the region to underst~ d<br />
that we will help them with the real concerns they have about<br />
being able to patrol their EEZs the Exclusive Economic<br />
Zones. And it behoves countries like us to give that sort<br />
of assistance so that they can have no reason at all for<br />
trying to have recourse to a country like Libya, which I<br />
repeat has got no conceivable, legitimate, peaceful interest<br />
in the region.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible question<br />
PM: * It was to-support a magnificent local member, Mr Peter<br />
Cleeland. To support this man who is one of our very, very<br />
best members to support him. And I am having a campaign<br />
to go around the country-supporting members like him in our<br />
relatively marginal seats but more importantly, as the weeks<br />
go on; because he is going to win with an increased margin.<br />
It won't be marginal after the next election he is going<br />
to increase his majority. I am going around to more and<br />
more of the seats which are held by narrow majorities by<br />
the Liberals and by the National Party because we are going<br />
to win a number off those in the next election.<br />
JOURNALIST: Has the campaign begun, effectively, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: I don't know what You mean by campaign. Not officially,<br />
but I will certainly between now and whenever the election<br />
is held, I will be going around the country explaining the<br />
performanzce~ of this Government and asking the people to make<br />
the contrast between the stability of this Government and<br />
the chaos and the bitterness and internal hatreds of the<br />
Liberal Party and the National Party.<br />
ends<br />
