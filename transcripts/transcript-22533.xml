    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I will go to the Pacific Islands Forum meeting in Fiji this morning, I am looking forward to the meeting.  It's important that the continuation of the RAMSI mission in the Solomon Islands be very strongly supported because it's in the best interests of the people of that country. Australia is a friendly neighbour in the Pacific, we want to continue to provide significant amounts of aid.  Our only request is that that aid be accompanied by improved standards of governance in the countries that receive the aid and also a better approach to economic development and economic management.  The Australian public does not want to see Australia's overseas aid wasted, there's a lot of support for helping the Pacific in Australia, there's also a lot of support for us asking and requiring that standards of governance and economic performance improve in return for the aid that we provide.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Mr Howard how are you going to resolve this tension with the Solomon Islands and PNG?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Oh, I am sure life will go on after the meeting.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Are you concerned that you are going into a hostile situation?  So you are not worried about the security there?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Security?  No.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  What will you say to the leader of the Solomon Islands?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Oh I think it's a good practice not to try and detail in advance what exchanges are likely, but we have a policy.  I've made it very clear we won't be altering our policy as far as Mr Moti is concerned, that's a matter of allowing the law to run. It would be quite wrong for the Australian Government to interfere in the workings of the criminal law, that's something you never do in our kind of societies.  The police are independent, it's an independent prosecution.  It wasn't initiated by me and I have no right to intervene in it.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Do you think the raid on the office of the Prime Minister was a bit too heavy-handed?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Look that's not a matter for me to comment on.  That was conducted by a police officer employed by the Solomon Islands, he happens to be an Australian, it doesn't alter the fact that he's answerable to the Solomon Islands Government.  He had a good reputation in Australia and people tell me he's done a very good job, but it is not appropriate for me as the Prime Minister of Australia to give a running commentary on the administration of the justice system in another country.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Are you expecting a mixed welcome, a mixed reception when you get there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> I am sure I will be very warmly welcomed in the long-standing and loveable Pacific way and Pacific tradition.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister you said that Australia is a friendly neighbour as far as the Pacific is concerned, there have been reports over the weekend that may not necessarily be reciprocated by some other nations in the area, do you think that's a problem we're going to have to face up to when you get there or not?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What matters is the attitude of the people, and the people of the Pacific are very warm in their feelings towards Australia and our aid is directed to improving the well-being of the people of the Solomon Islands.  My concern is about the public and about the population of that country, not about some individuals or officials in the political system. Thank you.</p>
