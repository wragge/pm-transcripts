FOR MEDIA 18 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
I welcome the efforts of the Australian Medical<br />
Association to develop a practical proposal for the<br />
establishment of a National Road Trauma Authority.<br />
The efforts of the AMA President, Dr Bryce Phillips, and<br />
Sir Dennis Paterson, of the Adelaide Children's Hospital,<br />
are worthy of the full support of all levels of<br />
government. My Goverment will implement this proposal on<br />
re-election and congratulates the AMA on its ability to<br />
pull together the support of the States on this issue.<br />
When I discussed this proposal with Dr Phillips and Sir<br />
Dennis last month, it was clear that they viewed this<br />
proposal as complementing the efforts this Government has<br />
made in support of nationally consistent road laws. I<br />
will have more to say on this subject at the Road<br />
Transport Industry Forum in Sydney tomorrow. </p>
