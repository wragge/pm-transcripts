PR. IMiE EST-ABlA TER<br />
FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF SPEECH GIVEN BY PRIME MINISTER AT<br />
PRESIDENT CHUN'S DINNER ON 6 FEBRUARY 1984.<br />
,4R PRESIDENT, DISTINGUISHED GUESTS,<br />
IT GIVES ME GREAT SATISFACTION TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THIS, MY<br />
FIRST VISIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA.<br />
THE TRAGEDY IN RANGOON WHICH PREVENTED YOUR INTENDED VISIT LAST<br />
YEAR TO AUSTRALIA CONTRIBUTED TO MY DECISION TO COME HERE NOW. I<br />
COMMUNICATED TO YOU AT THE TIME AUSTRALIA'S SYMPATHY ON YOUR LOSSES<br />
AND OUR REVULSION AT THE BOMBING OUTRACE. YOU WILL ALSO BE AWARE OF<br />
THE SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS MY GOVERNMENT TOOK IN RESPONSE.<br />
THE BOMBING, AND THE KOREAN AIRLINES INCIDENT A MONTH EARLIER,<br />
BROUGHT HOME TO THE WORLD THE FRAGILITY OF THE SECURITY SITUATION IN<br />
YOUR REGION, AND THE NEED FOR US ALL TO CONSIDER WtAYS OF REDUCING THE<br />
TENSIONS THAT EXIST HERE.<br />
IN THE 35 YEARS SINCE THE FOUNDATION OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA IN<br />
1948, AUSTRALIAN SUPPORT FOR THE ROK HAS BEEN CONSISTENT AND<br />
PRINCIPLED.<br />
WHEN, IN 1950, WE CONTRIBUTED FORCES TO THE UNITED NATIONS COMMAND IN<br />
KOREA, W1E DID SO OUT OF A FIRM RESOLVE TO SUPPPORT YOUR SOVIEREIGN<br />
RIGHTS. IT IS A MATTER OF SATISFACTION THAT THE 1953 ARMISTICE HAS PROOVED<br />
EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING A RESUMPTION OF WAR ON THE PENINSULA.<br />
VIOLENT INCIDENTS NEVERTHELESS PERSIST AND UNDERLINE NOT ONLY THE<br />
NEED FOR FLEXIBILITY AND GOOD FAITH AMONG THE PARTIES, BUT ALSO THE<br />
NEED FOR RENUNCIATION OF FORCE AS A MEANS OF DETERMINING POSITIONS.<br />
THE REALITY, WH. ICH AUSTRALIA HAS RECOGNISED FOR MANY YEARS, IS THAT<br />
THERE EXIST ON THE PENINSULA TWO STATES AND TlWO GOVERNMENTS. BOTH<br />
GOVERNMENTS ARE KOREAN, THE PEOPLE ARE OF THE SAME STOCK AND SPEAK<br />
THE SAME LANGUAGE. BUT THERE ARE PROFOUND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE<br />
TWO SOCIETIES IN THEIR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT.<br />
RECONCILIATION OF DIFFERENCES IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IS OBVIOUSLY<br />
EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT.<br />
CONTINUED STABLE POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT HERE IN THE<br />
ROK IS OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT.<br />
WE WISH YOU SUCCESS IN YOUR EFFORTS, AND, MR PRESIDENT<br />
LOOK FORWARD TO THE TIME 1' HEN THE DIVERSITY OF POLOTICAL<br />
OPINION IN THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA MAY FIND FULLER<br />
EXPRESSION IN YOUR POLITICAL SYSTEII. </p>
<p>IHERE HAS BEEN A WARMTH AND AFFECTION IN OUR RELATIONSHIP<br />
WHICH HAS DERI'ED FOM OUR ASSOCIAlION IN WAR, THE<br />
CLOSE LINkS " HICH DEVELO') ED BETWEEN THE CHRISTIAN<br />
CHlUi'CHES OF AUSTRLIA AND KOREA, AND THE INTEREST AND<br />
SUPPORT WHICH AUSTRALIA HAS FELT FOR THE KOREAN PEOPLE<br />
IN THEIR EFFORTS TO BUILD IN THE KOREAN PENINSULA A SOCIETY<br />
BASED ON SOUND AND STABLE FOUNDATIONS.<br />
MR PRESIDENT,<br />
GIVEN THE ARRAY AND CHARACTER OF DPRK FORCES DIRECTED AGAINST YOU,<br />
AUSTRALIA UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR CONCERN AND VIGILANCE.<br />
WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY SUPPORTED THE KEY ELEMENTS IN THE REPUBLIC<br />
OF KOREA'S NEGOTIATING POSITION, BECAUSE IT ACKNOWLEDGES THE<br />
EXISTENCE OF THE DPRK AND IT EMBODIES A READINESS FOR GOVERNIMENTTO-<br />
GOVERNMENT DISCUSSIONS.<br />
THE APPROACH FOLLOWED IN THE PAST BY THE DPRK OF REJECTING THE<br />
LEGITIMACY OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA IS TOTALLY UNREALISTIC.<br />
WE HAVE BEEN SHOCKED AND DISMAYED BY THL-DPRK'S UNCONSCIONABLE<br />
OVERSEAS ACTIVITIES.<br />
WE HAVE INFORMED THE DPRK THAT UNTIL IT SHOWS THAT IT 1: PREPARED TO<br />
ABIDE BY INTERNATIONALLY ACCEPTED STANDARDS OF BEHAVIOUR, WE WILL BE<br />
UNABLE TO CONSIDER ANY PROPOSAL FOR A RESTORATION OF ITS RELATIONSHIP<br />
WITH AUSTRALIA.<br />
NEVERTHELESS, WE LOOK FORWARD TO A TIME I. 4HEW, TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE<br />
WHOLE REGION AS WELL AS FOR THE WELL-BEING OF ALL KOREANS, THE DPRK<br />
CAN ENTER INTO A PRACTICAL AND SENSIBLE RELATIONSHIP WITH US ALL:<br />
INCLUDING YOUR GOVERNMENT.<br />
WE HOPE THAT THE FIRMNESS AND STEADINESS W4ITH WHICH YOUR GOVERNMENT<br />
HAS. RESPONDED TO RECENT CRISES, AND THE BROAD INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT<br />
YOU HAVE RECEIVED, WILL CONVINCE THE DPRK OF THE FUTILITY OF ITS<br />
NEGATIVE APPROACH, AaID ENCOURAGE IT TO NEGOTIAT2 ON AN EQUAL BASIS<br />
WITH YOU.<br />
THERE HAVE BEEN RECENT INDICATIONS OF A DISPOSITION ON THE SIDE OF<br />
THE DPRK TO CONSIDER NEGOTIATIONS ONCE AGAIN. AUSTRALIA HAS FOLLOWED<br />
THESE DEVELOPMENTS WITH INTEREST. WE HAVE DONE SO, NOT AS A COUNTRY<br />
WITH INTERESTS DIRECTLY ENGAGED IN THE KOREAN PENINSULA, BUT AS ONE<br />
STRONGLY IINDFUL OF THE RISKS POSED TO REGIONAL PEACE AND STABILITY<br />
BY CONTINUED TENSION AND CONFLICT BETWEEN THE PROTAGONISTS. THERE<br />
ARE CLEARLY MANY QUESTIONS TO BE RESOLVED, BUT W,. E W OULD HOPE THAT A<br />
IAY COULD BE FOUND BY WHICH BOTH THE DPRK AND THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA<br />
MIGHT BE ABLE TO COMMENCE FACE TO FACE NEGOTIATIONS.<br />
UNTIL THIS HAPPENS WE ARE DOUBTFUL THERE CAN BE ANY REAL PROGRESS.<br />
MR PRESIDENT,<br />
THE SITUATION" l ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA HAS A BROADER DIMENSION. IN<br />
THE PAST, BECAUSE A RANGE OF GREAT POWER INTERESTS ARE ENGAGED, IT<br />
HAS CONTRIBUTED TO TENSIONS BETWEEN THE SUPERPOWERS. </p>
<p>THIS GIVES FURTHER URGENCY TO THE NEED FOR RESOIUTION OF THE<br />
SO-CALLED '' KOREAN PROBLEM'<br />
IN SAYING THIS I AM PARTICULARLY MINDFUL THAT WE HAVE RETURNED TO AN<br />
ERA OF DISTRUST AND SUSPICION BETWEEN THE SUPERPOWERS.<br />
ARMS CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE SUPERPOWERS<br />
HAVE STALLED: THE BASIS FOR CO-OPERATION BETWEEN THEM HAS BEEN<br />
SIGNIFICANTLY ERODED AND THE NUMCER OF CHANNELS FOR COMMUNICATION AND<br />
DIALOGUE SEEM TO HAVE NARROWED SIGNIFICANTLY.<br />
PRESIDENT REAGAN'S RECENT ATTEMPT TO FREE THE SITUATION UP AND TO<br />
INDICATE POSSIBLE AVENUES FOR CO-CPERATION REFLECTED NOT ONLY AN<br />
APPRECIATION OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE POSITION NOW EXISTING BETWEEN<br />
THE SUPER-POWERS, BUT ALSO A GENUINE INTEREST IN COMING TO GRIPS WITH<br />
THE UNDERLYING ISSUES AT STAKE.<br />
HIS INITIATIVE DESERVES A MORE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED AND CONSTRUCTIVE<br />
RESPONSE THAN THAT INITIALLY GIVEN BY THE SOVIET UNION.<br />
THE ISSUES INVOLVED, PARTICULARLY IN THE FIELD OF ARMS CONTROL AND<br />
DISARMAMENT, ARE SO LARGE THAT 10 TURN ONE'S FACE AGAINST EVEN THE<br />
SLIGHTEST HINT OF PROGRESS WOULD BE A BETRAYAL NOT ONLY OF THE<br />
COUNTLESS MILLIONS WHO ARE WITHOUT POWER TO INFLUENCE WORLD AFFAIRS<br />
DIRECTLY, BUT OF UNBORN GENERATIONS WHOSE FUTURE ALL NATIONS HOLD IN<br />
TRUST. YOUR PEOPLE, MR PRESIDENT, KNOW ONLY TOO WELL THE DEVASTATION OF WAR.<br />
PERHAPS MORE THAN MOST COUNTRIES YOURS WOULD APPRECIATE THAT<br />
GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD MUST ACCEPT THE OBLIGATION TO WORK<br />
INDIVIDUALLY AND IOGETHER FOR A REDUCTION IN THE STOCKPILES OF<br />
WEAPONRY WHICH PLACE INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AT RISK. NUCLEAR WEAPONS<br />
STATES ALONE DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO DETERMINE THESE ISSUES. THEIR<br />
CALCULATIONS THEIR MISCALCULATIONS COULD AFFECT US ALL OR<br />
ELIMINATE US ALL.<br />
AUSTRALIA IS VERY MINDFUL THAT AS A CONSEQUENCE OF OUR SECURITY<br />
ARRANGMENTS UNDER ANZUS, JOINT AUSTRALIA/ UNITED STATES FACILITIES ARE<br />
PRESENT ON AUSTRALIAN SOIL. THESE PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE IN<br />
MAINTAINING WESTERN SECURITY. THEY ALSO MAKE A USEFUL CONTRIBUTION<br />
TO THE VERIFICATION OF ARMS CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT AGREEMENTS.<br />
MORE GENERALY MY GOVERNMENT HAS MOVED RAPIDLY TO ESTABLISH OUR<br />
INTEREST IN THE SUPPORT FOR BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS<br />
FOR DISARMAMENT.<br />
WE ARE WORKING FOR THE REVITALISATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL<br />
NON-PROLIFERATION REGIME AND FOR THE CREATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL<br />
CLIMATE THAT COULD LEAD TO AGREEMENT ON A COMPREHENSIVE AND FULLY<br />
VERIFIABLE BAN ON NUCLEAR TESTING.<br />
WE RECOGNISE THAT THERE IS NO FOOL-PROOF MIEANS OF PREVENTING THE<br />
PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR EXPLOSIVES, BUT AUSIALIA IS AMONG THOSE WHO<br />
BELIEVE THAT THE PROCESS CAN AND SHOULD BE SLOWED AND THE COSTS TO<br />
THE PROLIFERATOR INCREASED. </p>
<p>AS A PRODUCER AND EXPORTER OF URANIUM WE RECOGNISE OUR OBLIGATIONS<br />
UNDER NPT ARTICLE IV TO FACILITATE AND PARTICIPAlE IN THE EXCHANGE OF<br />
EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS AND INFORMATION FO THE PEACEFUL USES DF ATOMIC<br />
ENERGY, WITH DUE CONSIDERATION FOR THE NEEDS OF THE DEVELOPING AREAS<br />
OF THE WORLD. IN LINE WITH THIS, AUSTRALIA ALSO ACCEPTS THAT IT HAS<br />
A PARTICULAR RESPONSIBILITY TO SECURE IMPROVED INTERNATIONAL<br />
SAFEGUARDS AGAINST DIVERSION OF NUCLEAR MATERIAL FOR PEACEFUL USES.<br />
WE ARE OF THE STRONG VIEW THAT ANY EAST/ WEST AGREEMENTS TO LIMIT<br />
DEPLOYMENT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS MUST BE GLOBAL IN NATURE.<br />
THE TENSIONS CREATED IN THE ASIA/ PACIFIC REGION AS A RESULT OF TH4E<br />
SOVIET DEPLOYMENT OF $ 520' 5 IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE USSR PRESENT A<br />
THREAT TO US ALL.<br />
PRESIDENT CHUN: IN SPITE OF THE TENSIONS AND THREATS OF WAR TO WHICH<br />
YOUR NATION IS EXPOSED, THE PEOPLE OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA, YOUR<br />
GOVERNMENT AND THAT OF YOUR PREDECESSOR HAVE BUILT A REMARKABLE<br />
MODERN NATION-: TATE.<br />
WE PAY TRIBUTE TO THAT.<br />
MR PRESIDENT,<br />
DESPITE THE OBVIOUS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR TWO SOCIETIES, THE MOST<br />
INSISTENT ELEMENTS IN THE RELATIONSHIP TODAY ARE THOSE WHICH DRAW US<br />
TOGETHER. ECONOMICALLY# WE ARE ALREADY VERY IMPORTANT TO EACH OTHER.<br />
POLITICALLY, TH4E ROK IS BEGINNING TO HAVE A P. EGIONAL ROLE MORE<br />
APPROPRIATE TO ITS POPULATION AND ECONOMIC STRENGTH.<br />
AS YOUR ECONOMY HAS DEVELOPED, THROUGH THE A. PPLICATION OF IMAGINATIVE<br />
GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION, DARING ENTERPRENEURSHIP AND THE EFFORTS OF<br />
YOUR INDUSTRIOUS AND SKILLED PEOPLE, IT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY<br />
APPARENT THAT WE HAVE MUCH TO OFFER EACH OTHER.<br />
AUSTRALIA'S VAST'INERAL RESOURCES, DEVELOPED INFRASTRUCTURE AND<br />
COMPARATIVE NEARNESS TO YOU HAVE MADE AUSTRALIA A COMPETITIVE AND<br />
FUNDAMENTALLY RELIABLE SUPPLIER OF RAW MATERIALS OF KOREA'S RAPIDLY<br />
EXPANDING INDUSTRIES.<br />
AUSTRALIA HAS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE RISE IN YOUR LIVING STANDARDS<br />
BY ITS EXPORTS OF COMPETITIVE AND NIGH QUALITY AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.<br />
IN RETURN, KOREAN EXPORTS TO AUSTRALIA OF MAINUFACTURED GOODS HAVE<br />
ENHANCED OUR STANDARDS OF LIVING ALSO.<br />
WE LOOK FORWARD TO A CONTINUATION AND EXPANSION OF THIS<br />
MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL RELATIONSHIP.<br />
INDEED, I SHOULD EXPECT THAT THE OPPORTUNITIES PROVIDED BY MUTUAL<br />
LIBERALISATION OF TRADING ARRANGMENTS BETI. WEEN US IN THE COURSE OF<br />
ECONOMIC GRO'. THI WILL BE CONSIDERABLE. </p>
<p>MR PRESTDENT: WE WELCOME THE ROK ' S READINESS TO TAKE A BROADER<br />
INTEREST IN THL AFFAIRS OF TI'E ASIA/ PACIFIC REGION.<br />
THE REGION AS IT AFFECTS YOUR COUNTRY HAS CHANGED AND DEVELOPED.<br />
THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA IS NOW A SUBSTANTIAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC<br />
PARTNER IN THE REGION, A FACT RECOGNISED AND APPRECIATED BY MOST<br />
OTHER REGIONAL STATES.<br />
AUSTRALIA'S FOREIGN POLICY HAS ALSO INCREASINGLY BEEN STRUCTURED<br />
TOARDS DEVELOPING A FULL, PROPER AND EQUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR<br />
NEIGHBOURS. WE ENJOY SUBSTANTIAL TIES WITH THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE.<br />
BUT OUR TRADING AND POLITICAL INTERESTS HAVE SEEN THE EMERGENCE OF<br />
CLOSE AND IMPORTANT LINKS BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND THE ASEAN COUNTRIES,<br />
AS WELL AS WITH CHINA, JAPAN AND THE NEWLY-INDEPENDENT COUNTRIES OF<br />
THE PACIFIC.<br />
AUSTRALIA NOW HAS A NELL-ESTABLISHED ROLE IN THE REGION.<br />
IT IS A ROLE WHICH, IN ASIA, REFLECTS NOT ONLY THE EMERGENCE OF<br />
EXTENSIVE AND GROWING ECONOMIC LINKS BUT ALSO A GROWINL; SENSE OF THE<br />
POLITICAL AS WELL ELL AS ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO BE DERIVED FROM<br />
CO-OPERATIVE RELATIONS BETW4EEN AUSTRALIA AND COUNTRIES OF THE REGION.<br />
AUSTRALIA 14AS ALSO SOUGHT TO PLAY A SUPPORTIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE PART<br />
IN SOUTH PACIFIC AFFAIRS WITHOUT INTRUDING UPON THE SOVEREIGNTY OF<br />
OTHER STATES.<br />
THE DEVELOPMENT NEEDS OF THE PACIFIC WILL COMMAND OUR CONTINUING<br />
ATTENTION. THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION, IS THE PART OF THE WORLD WITH THE GREATEST<br />
POTENTIAL FOR ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND POLITICAL GROWTH.<br />
WE NEED TO CONSIDER CAREFULLY HOW WE MIGHT BEST MOVE TO ENSURE<br />
THAT POTENTIAL IS FULLY REALIZED.<br />
I KNOW, MR PRESIDENT, THIS IS A MATTER YOU HAVE GIVEN YOUR PARTICULAR<br />
ATTENTION. I AM ALSO AWARE THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN SOME CIRCLES,<br />
IN THE PROSPECTS FOR A PACIFIC COMMUNITY.<br />
WE DON'T SEE THIS AS SOMETHING FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE IF<br />
A RANGE OF FORMAL MECHANISMS AND<br />
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES OF THE REGION, IS ENVISATED.<br />
INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE RECENTLY IN BALI<br />
NONETHELESS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED SOME POTENTIALLY PRODUCTIVE THEMES OF<br />
CO-OPERATION WHICH COULD USEFULLY BE EXPLORED FURTHER.<br />
THE PROPOSED PACIFIC ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION CONFERENCE IN SEOUL IN<br />
1985, AS A FOLLO;.'-UP TO THE BALI MEETING, SHOULD BE OF PRACTICAL<br />
ASSISTANCE IN CARRYING THESE MATTERS FORWARD. </p>
<p>-MORE IMMEDIATELY THE SUGGESTION I PUT FORWARD iN BANGKOK LAST<br />
NOVEMBER THAT THERE WOULD BE ADVANFAGE I I REGIONAL CONSULTATION AND<br />
CO-OPERATION IN T'E LEAD-UP TO A NEW OLOBAL TlADE ROUND SHOULD SUCH<br />
A ROUND HATERIALISE OFFERS AN IMMEDIATELY VALUABLE MEANS OF<br />
SECURING ATTENTION TO THE PARTICULAR TRADING INTERESTS OF COUNTRIES<br />
OF THE ASIA/ PACIFIC REGION.<br />
MR PRESIDENT,<br />
THE OPPORTUNITY AFFORDED BY MY VISIT FOR BROAD DISCUSSIONS OF THESE<br />
MATTERS OF 11UTUAL INTEREST HAS BEEN GREATLY APPRECIATED.<br />
I KNOW4 THAT THE PERSON1AL TIES WE HAVE FORGED WILL CONTRIBUTE<br />
TO THE FURTHER GROWTH OF RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO NATIONS.<br />
I HOPE THAT W4E WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY BEFORE LONG TO CONTINUE<br />
THESE DISCUSSIONS IN AUSTRALIA.<br />
TOAST DISTINGUISHED GUESTS,<br />
PLEASE JOIN HE IN A TOAST TO THE HEALTH AND WELL-GEING OF<br />
HIS EXCELLENCY CHUN DGO-HWAN, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF<br />
KOREA AND TO THE FUTURE OF RELATIONS BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND<br />
THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA. </p>
