PRIME MINISTER<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTERS<br />
OF AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND<br />
ON THE OCCASION OF THE CONCLUSION OF THE 1988<br />
REVIEW OF THE AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND<br />
CLOSER ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP<br />
In November 1987 at Waitangi in New Zealand we established a<br />
framework for reviewing the Australia New Zealand Closer<br />
Economic Relations-Trade Agreement of 1983. At that time, we<br />
decided to consider accelerating the implementation of free<br />
trade in goods, harmonising relevant business laws and<br />
administrative practices in the trans Tasman market and widening<br />
the bilateral economic relationship by liberalising trade in<br />
services.<br />
We have had before us a series of recommendations agreed by the<br />
responsible ministers of the two Governments in Christchurch in<br />
June. we pay special tribute to the efforts of the Ministers<br />
concerned.<br />
Today we have set the final seal on a package of measures which<br />
will accelerate, deepen and widen the economic relationship<br />
between our two countries. From 1 July 1990 we will have<br />
removed virtually all the impediments to achieving a single<br />
trans Tasman market. In recent weeks and today the two<br />
Governments have concluded and signed all of the agreements and<br />
arrangements relating to this historic achievement.<br />
At Waitangi we noted both countries, desire, as formally<br />
expressed in the CER Trade Agreement, to achieve greater<br />
economic welfafe for our peoples through the liberalisation of<br />
trans Tasman trade in accordance with each country's<br />
international rights and obligations. In view of the visible<br />
benefits which the CER Trade Agreement has brought to both<br />
countries, we resolved then that determined efforts should be<br />
made to further strengthen the trans Tasman economic<br />
relationship. In particular, the CER Trade Agreement has benefited consumers<br />
in both countries through the availability of a greater range of<br />
competitively priced goods and producers have responded strongly<br />
to the challenge of new market opportunities which the CER Trade<br />
Agreement has provided for them. As a result, there have been<br />
notable efficiency gains from CER which have been consistent<br />
with the overall direction of Government policy in both<br />
countries. CER is outward-looking and the impressive growth in<br />
two-way trade between our two countries has not been achieved at<br />
the expense of our other trading partners. Australia and New<br />
Zealand are now, and will remain, global trading countries<br />
committed to the realisation of the principles of the GATT and<br />
their improvement in the course of the Uruguay Round of<br />
multilateral Trade Negotiations.<br />
1254 </p>
<p>We have today considered the package of measures which emerged<br />
from the ministerial meeting in Christchurch and have signed<br />
three Protocols which contain binding commitments to move<br />
towards the creation of a single trans Tasman market from 1 July<br />
1990. The market so created will cover both goods and services.<br />
These are:<br />
a Protocol to the CER Trade Agreement on Acceleration of<br />
Free Trade in Goods covering the arrangements to bring all<br />
product sectors to free trade by 1 July 1990, the abolition<br />
of anti-dumping procedures on goods originating in the free<br />
trade area and a further general review of CER in 1992,<br />
including consolidation of the current range of treaty<br />
instruments;<br />
a Protocol on Trade in services which brings services within<br />
CER on the basis of clearly stated rules and provides<br />
arrangements to further liberalise trade in services between<br />
the two countries;<br />
a Protocol on Quarantine Administrative Procedures which<br />
will result in additional harmonisation and cooperation.<br />
other instruments have been agreed and signed by our Ministers<br />
covering: the harmonisation of business law and regulatory practices;<br />
further cooperation and harmonisation of Customs policies<br />
and practices;<br />
increased cooperation to achieve the elimination of<br />
technical barriers to trade;<br />
support by the Australian Government for equality of<br />
opportunity for New Zealand in the government purchasing<br />
processes of Australian States;<br />
the elimination of production bounties payable on exports to<br />
each other and the avoidance of financial support measures<br />
for domestic industries which have adverse effects on<br />
competition between the two countries;<br />
the removal of export prohibitions which have been<br />
maintained for protective reasons.<br />
Each of these undertakings is significant in itself, and<br />
together they build an economic relationship unequalled by any<br />
other two sovereign countries. By July 1990, a full five years<br />
ahead of the original timetable set in the 1983 Agreement, we<br />
will have removed all frontier barriers to trade in goods. We<br />
have taken steps to ensure that this trade shall be fair.<br />
Consistent with this objective we are also agreed that we will<br />
further harmonise our competition laws. 1255 </p>
<p>These commitments, which cover all goods including manufactured<br />
and agricultural, provide for free trade and fair competition.<br />
In this context we welcome the arrangements worked out between<br />
our governments which provide for the free and fair conduct of<br />
trans Tasman trade in dairy products.<br />
On industry assistance, we reaffirm that bounties and subsidies<br />
providing long-term protection for Australian and New Zealand<br />
industries from trans Tasman competition can no longer be<br />
regarded as viable instruments of industry policy. We have also<br />
set ourselves the task of making our respective industry<br />
policies more responsive to CER objectives.<br />
We acknowledge that greater efficiency in domestic and trans<br />
Tasman transport must be achieved in order for producers and<br />
consumers to fully realise the benefits of free trade. This is<br />
the thrust of our respective domestic policies.<br />
Recognising that the world economy is increasingly characterised<br />
by strong growth in trade in services, we have agreed to bind<br />
our two countries to free trade principles in respect of trans<br />
Tasman services.<br />
We therefore welcome the major achievement of an agreement<br />
covering trans Tasman trade in services. Not only is the<br />
agreement a notable breakthrough between the two countries but<br />
it is also at the forefront of international efforts to provide<br />
agreed rules to liberalise trade in services. It removes<br />
regulations applied to bilateral trade in services, underpins<br />
the viability and dynamism of this large and expanding sector of<br />
our two economies, and provides for further liberalisation as<br />
our respective domestic policies allow. we regard the freedom<br />
of movement between our two countries as an essential element of<br />
free trade in services.<br />
The comprehensive range and coverage of the other agreements and<br />
arrangements settled by ministers at Christchurch will<br />
facilitate the conduct of trans Tasman trade and commerce. They<br />
will bring about great harmonisation in our business regulations<br />
and practices where appropriate and thereby facilitate easier<br />
and more efficient economic interchange between our two<br />
countries. We' welcome also the benefits which will arise from<br />
closer cooperation on quarantine and Customs procedures anW from<br />
reducing technical barriers to trade.<br />
Following the achievement of free trade without exception in<br />
goods across the Tasman and the application of each country's<br />
competition laws to relevant anti-competitive conduct affecting<br />
trans Tasman trade, anti-dumping measures are to be removed from<br />
1 July 1990. We are committed to the removal of anti-dumping<br />
provisions for goods originating in the free trade areas by this<br />
date and to changes to our competition laws to ensure that the<br />
objectives of CER are not frustrated by anti-competitive<br />
conduct.<br />
2 ti </p>
<p>4.<br />
We affirm our strong support for the continued development of<br />
closer economic relations between our two countries on an<br />
outward-looking basis. The package we have finalised today<br />
heralds a new chapter in our economic relationship and a trading<br />
environment which, as far as possible, is unencumbered by<br />
Government regulation and direction.<br />
Investment flows have grown in both directions across the Tasman<br />
since 1983 and under current arrangements applications are<br />
generally processed quickly and favourably in both countries.<br />
Having regard to CER, the question of an investment agreement to<br />
preserve and enhance this environment is a matter for ongoing<br />
consideration. It has been agreed that in the year ahead the<br />
two governments will engage in discussions to explore the scope<br />
for such an agreement. Progress will be reviewed by 1990.<br />
In the documents signed by us today, provision is made for a.<br />
review of trans Tasman trade in services in 1990 and of the<br />
overall economic relationship in 1992. These reviews will<br />
provide further opportunity to examine the scope to further<br />
extend the closer economic relationship between our two<br />
countries. The steps we have taken through this Review represent the<br />
governmental contribution to creating a more vigorous trans<br />
Tasman economy. We could not have contemplated changes of this<br />
magnitude had the business communities in both countries not<br />
supported our efforts. We look again to the private sector to<br />
take up the opportunities inherent in our decisions.<br />
The new chapter we have opened in our bilateral economic and<br />
trade relationship will strengthen our ability to participate in<br />
the dynamic growth of the world economy and particularly in the<br />
Asia/ Pacific region, of which we are part. in this context the<br />
decisions we have reached today keep us on the path towards a<br />
dynamic and competitive trans Tasman economy.<br />
