P. M. No. 23L1961<br />
EXPANSION OF BEEF PRODUCTION FOR EXPORT<br />
Statement by the PFlime Minister, the Rt. Hon, R. G. MenzIes<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, announced today that<br />
the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments have agreed that<br />
construction of a road from Julia Creek to Normanton should<br />
form part of a broad plan for development of roads to<br />
facilitate increased export of beef from the North. To<br />
facilitate early commencement of the work on the road the<br />
Commonwealth has offered to contribute up to Å“ 650,000 towards<br />
expenditure on this road to the end of the financial year<br />
1961/ 62. The two Governments will consider the basis upon<br />
which the cost of a wider scheme of road development might be<br />
shared when the planning has further advanced.<br />
The Prime Minister added that he had replied to a<br />
letter from Mr. Nicklin in which the request had been made that<br />
officers c. f t20e Commonwealth Government confer with officers of<br />
the Queensland Government with a view to exploring various<br />
aspects of the question of expanding beef production in<br />
Queensland. Mr. Menzies said he had told Mr. Nicklin the<br />
Commonwealth Government is very interested in expansion of beef<br />
production which could lead to increased export earnings, and<br />
has decided to appoint a committee of officers which could<br />
provide it with a more complete picture of the likely extent of<br />
the market for beef and possible means of securing an expansion<br />
of beef cattle production. These investigations will be part<br />
of the comprehensive examination being undertaken by the<br />
Government of avenues for increased export earnings.<br />
Mr. Menzies said that arrangements would be made for<br />
this committee to confer with officers of the Queensland<br />
Government so that both Governments could study information<br />
provided from their talks together. CANB MA y<br />
