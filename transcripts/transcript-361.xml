PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE<br />
RT. HON. R. G. MENZIES ON MONDAY, 28TH AUGUST,<br />
RT. HO 1961, AT 4 P. iM.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, could you tell us, perhaps, for South Australian<br />
interest, how far back South Australian rail<br />
standardisation has been set by the decision to go ahead<br />
in 4estern Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know. That process is the subject of<br />
litigation in the High Court, commenced by the State of<br />
South Australia so it is sub judice; so perhaps one ought<br />
not to talk about it too much.<br />
The , est Australian rail project, that part of it<br />
that runs from Koolyanobbing down to Southern Cross, then<br />
down to Kwinana, of course, is directly related to the<br />
development of the iron and steel industry in that State<br />
and is related to the Agreement that the iJest Australian<br />
Government made with the an agreement which has<br />
been ratified by them by Act of Parliament in Jostern<br />
Australia. The condition, of course; of the agreement<br />
becoming effective was that the necessary railway<br />
facilities should be provided from Koolyanobbing to<br />
Kwinana a very large enterprise and that couldn't be<br />
done unless the Commonwealth itself, particularly in the<br />
initial stages, provided financial assistance because<br />
Western Australia would have had a very large cash problem<br />
unless it could get large amounts of initial finance from<br />
the Commonwealth. Well that is a very great new industry in the JWest<br />
and I would think, perhaps, as a basic industry, it would<br />
probably lead to an expansion of ancillary industries in<br />
that State. I think it is the biggest single development<br />
in ilestern Australia in my time and we showed ourselves<br />
willing to discuss the terms and conditions on which we<br />
could help on that matter. It was, to a large extent<br />
of course, an industrial venture, one of those things that<br />
will pay for itself very well over a period of time by<br />
increased freights and better railway revenues. It is<br />
estimated it will be quite a profitable line in that<br />
segment. To that degree it has somu points of<br />
resemblance to the Mount Isa-Collinsville railway in<br />
Queensland. But we thought that it had an element of<br />
standardisation and we have allowed for that in the<br />
arrangemonts that we have made with the Govz. rmniont of<br />
' J-stern Australia.<br />
As for the rest of the line from Southern Cross up to<br />
Kalgoorlie, . well it , rould have been quite ridiculous to<br />
have a standard gauge line running to Southern Cross and<br />
then get back on to the old one and have the change of<br />
gauge transferred from Kalgoorlie to Southern Cross. So<br />
we decided, and so did Jestern Australia, that it would be<br />
as well to do the lot when we were at ito Thoportion<br />
from Kalgoorlie to Southern Cross, being essentially a<br />
standardisation project, is being financed on the same<br />
standardisation terms as applied in the case of the<br />
iWodonga to Melbourne line. Under that the State accepts<br />
an ultimate liability of 30% of the cost spread over a<br />
period of 50 years. 4e weighed all this up the<br />
primarily developmental line, from there on the primarily<br />
standardisation section that I have just been referring t,<br />
and we arrived, broadly, at the conclusion that if you<br />
called half the expenditure on the total matter<br />
standardisation, and half development, that would give<br />
broad justice to the position. That was very acceptable<br />
to the Government of ' Western Australia, and hence the<br />
terms that have been announced, </p>
<p>QUESTION: I think that this is a remarkable developmento<br />
lWestern Australia has been considerably handicapped by<br />
being short of secondary industries, to that extent<br />
having an unbalanced economy; it has meant that e. ostern<br />
Australia has had to be a claimant State on a considerable<br />
scale. I don't moan that they will cease to be a claimant<br />
state overnight, or even when the railway is comploted,<br />
but it ought to improve very considerably their overall<br />
financial and economic position when it is in full<br />
operation, because the total expenditure on both the<br />
railway works and rolling stock and the blast furnaces<br />
and so on, the iron and steel end of it, will be about<br />
It is estimated that the railway works will be<br />
completed by the end of 1968.<br />
Has B. H. P. given any timetable for when they start<br />
operations and also for completing their sectioh? Are you<br />
aware of any time limit on that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Uell I can't give you that precisely; but I think<br />
that there will be very little, if any, interval between<br />
the completion of the line and the opening up of<br />
Koolyanobbing and the beginning of the transportation of<br />
ore and the completion of the B. H. P.' s first stage, at<br />
any rate. You see there will be three stages: first cf all<br />
they will be able to ship some of the iron ore to the<br />
East. There is a limit to the extent to which they can<br />
ship iron ore without processing, without producing pigiron<br />
at any rate, after the establishment of the blast<br />
furnaces. Although I haven't their precise date in mind<br />
I think it is in the agreement that the Western Australian<br />
Government made. But you can take it that there will be<br />
a steady development of the process, first of all<br />
receiving iron ore, then the blast furnaces coming into<br />
operation and the production of pig-iron, and then,<br />
finally, the production of steel.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, you said you expected this project would pay<br />
for itself in a certain time. Was that expectation based<br />
just on the economics of the Koolyanobbing trade, the<br />
developmental end of it; or on the expectation of higher<br />
traffic because it is part of an eventually standardised<br />
transport...?<br />
PRIME MINISTEI~: No, that is primarily on the Koolyanobbing-Kwinana<br />
traffic. This will run upo. well in the first instance<br />
they estimate it will be about a million tons, then it<br />
will become two million tons by the time the blast<br />
furnaces are operating. They are the estimates made by<br />
the West Australian railways and the Commonwealth<br />
Railways think they are well-founded. They show that the<br />
line will, as from the time the iron ore goes into<br />
transport, be a profitable line.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Menzies when you said at first they will have to<br />
ship some iron ore to the east, were you thinking of<br />
Whyalla?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It may be Whyalla, I don't know. They have got good<br />
iron ore suppliers there on the spot. I would have<br />
thought, myself, primarily to Port Kombla and Newcastle.<br />
But I am not speaking for then. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Sir, are you able to give an indication how long the<br />
legal drafting of the agreement and the Bill is likely to<br />
take, and when you think the Bill might be introduced into<br />
Parliament?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: ; e arranged on Saturday that the officers would get<br />
together for the drafting within a week; and that must<br />
be completed and the Agreement executed in time for the<br />
Commonwealth Parliament to ratify it by legislation. That<br />
means that the Bill must be in a position to go into our<br />
House not later, I would have thought, than the end of<br />
September. So there will be no delay. Late October is<br />
the deadline for all of us, including the West Australian<br />
agreement with the B. H. P. and our own with Western<br />
Australia. So there will be no delay on that. I expect<br />
that we will be looking at the legislation by the end of<br />
September, and that it will be in the House immediately<br />
thereafter. It is not anticipated that there will be any<br />
drafting difficulties.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Whitlam on his recent visit to Queensland<br />
* criticised the difference in terms for the financing of<br />
the Mount Isa railway as compared with those for<br />
Southern Railway work and now in Western Australia.<br />
Could you give us the Government's thoughts on that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Jell that is more than the Queensland Government has<br />
ever done I must say! The Mount Isa Railway has got<br />
nothing to do with the standardisation problem. The Mount<br />
Isa Railway scheme began as part of the entire development<br />
of the nines at Mount Isa. It will have incidental<br />
benefits in the north, of course. But when that line was<br />
originally investigated by some railway experts, Ford<br />
Bacon Co. the then Queensland Government got them<br />
out it became quite clear that that line would be most<br />
profitable and, as a matter of fact, would pay for itself<br />
over a period of 20 years.<br />
In the case of Western Australia part of the line is<br />
pure standardisation, and the rest is primarily, but not<br />
entirely, a developmental and industrial developmental<br />
job, rather like Mount Isa. So we blended the two<br />
Stogether. There was no inconsistency, either with<br />
Wodonga-Melbourno, or Mount Isa-Collinsville; it merely<br />
means that we have taken the same principles and tried to<br />
work out, as sensibly as we could, how the two could be<br />
blended for the purposes of this mixed venture in Western<br />
Australia. We had very good discussions about this. We<br />
discussed a lot of details. But in the end result, they<br />
were about the only negotiations I have conducted in which<br />
both sides appear to be content.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Menzies, in your communication to Sir Thomas<br />
Playford about the dioselisation of the Port Pirie-<br />
Cockburn line, have you given any undertaking about the<br />
standardisation of that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. Well as you know he has got a Writ out on the<br />
standardisation issue and I don't need to go into what is<br />
involved in a Urit. Sir Thomas has chosen to have<br />
litigation. All right, I don't mind. That case will,<br />
no doubt, be determined by the High Court in due course.<br />
But whatever comes or goes on that matter: if he's<br />
right in saying that we have to do the standardisation<br />
right away, or if we are right in saying that this is a<br />
matter for judgment under the circumstances of the case, </p>
<p>whatever happens, it will be, on the view that he put to us<br />
some time ago advantageous to dieselise ( to use that<br />
horrible word) this line -s it stands, because it would<br />
mean some substantial reductions in the cost of haulage.<br />
His original proposal was that these diesels, and the<br />
rolling stock, should all have their bogies so constructed<br />
as to be adjustable to a standard line, if and when the<br />
line was, in fact, standardised. So that it is not part<br />
of standardisation it is ahead of it. But it is<br />
something that we think presents obvious adrantages.<br />
Therefore putting the standardisation argument on one<br />
side that will be determined by other people we have<br />
made an offer to provide the finance for this dieselisaticn<br />
venture on the basis that the State would repay to the<br />
Comronwealth over a period of 50 years, 30% of the<br />
expenditure for this purpose, together with interest, of<br />
course, at the long term bond rate.<br />
W! ll I haven't heard yet of course I couldn't<br />
have from Sir Thomas as to what the view of his<br />
Government is on that matter. But we think it is a pretty<br />
good offer.<br />
QUESTION: Whatever happens in the matter of the Writ, Sir, the<br />
West Australian project will go on?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, there is nothing sub judice about our arrangemnnts<br />
with then. The only thing that could prevent that<br />
one from g-ing ahead is for the Commonwealth Parliament to<br />
toss it , ut.<br />
QUESTION: Has B. H. P. given the Commonwealth any indication that<br />
it will use the new West Australian facilities in an<br />
endeavour to increase Australia's export oarnings?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We have had long discussions with then. We are<br />
satisfied that they are going to press on with this job<br />
and that they are going to expand their production as a<br />
result. This will certainly either reduce the present<br />
importation of iron and steel, or, in the long run we<br />
believe, will increase our exports. In other woras, from<br />
our point of view, the attraction of this thing was that<br />
it bore on export income, or on the balance of paym-ents<br />
to put it more accurately. That was what attracted us<br />
abJut this matter; that is what makes this a rather<br />
special case and gives it some special urgoncy Because<br />
it would be a great pity if they had to hold up all their<br />
plans for iron and steel in the Jest bh cause there was no<br />
agreement on the subject of the railway. . Je believe that<br />
the B. H. P. have a completely good attitude on this matter.<br />
QUESTION: Have the Commonwealth talks with B. H. P. resulted in<br />
the B. H. P. promising to, or have the B. H. P. decided to<br />
speed up this West Australian development?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Look you are asking me as if we had made some<br />
specific bargain of some kind. What we have been<br />
eliciting is the general approach, Mr. McEwon had a good<br />
number of discussions with them and I sum that up myself,<br />
by saying that I am sure that they are not going to waste<br />
any time about this matter. It nay very -well be that they<br />
can speed up the operation, particularly with this railway<br />
work being put in hand and being due to be completed by<br />
the end of 1968. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Sir, the Treasurer in his Budget speech made it<br />
clear that the grant for il/ stern Australia and the<br />
Queensland beef roads would be considered at the end of<br />
the year. As your statement yesterday indicated the<br />
amount for Western Australia, does that mean that will be<br />
for the beef road scheme for this year, or will you still<br />
consider further<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, no, this is our arrangonent with Western Australh.<br />
But in Queensland there are discussions going on now on<br />
the official level in order to identify some other road<br />
project about which we could agree. We are already, as<br />
you know, finding œ 650,000 for the Julia Creek-Normanton<br />
road. What the Budget speech ueans is that if wo can<br />
agree and I hope we can quite quickly on another one<br />
which has a high order of priority, we are perfectly<br />
willing to come to their financial aid on that matter. So<br />
that I an anticipating a second road proposal in Queenslind<br />
just as we have had the one that I announced in the case<br />
of Western Australia and the one that we have already<br />
included for the Northern Territory.<br />
QUESTION: This financial year, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, this financial year.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, the arrangement with U. A. on beef roads is for<br />
this financial year?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That's right, that's right.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Menzies, Mr. Holt is reported as saying he would<br />
be quite happy to fight the election campaign on the<br />
Budget<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would go better than that: I would be quite happy<br />
to fight it on anything.<br />
QUESTION: Can you say when the election will be held, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, no. Everybody knows except me.<br />
QUESTION: Do you feel, Sir, that the upturn in the omployment<br />
statistics the other day indicate that an upturn in the<br />
economy is already taking place?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, I think that there is. I don't delude myself<br />
into thinking that it is going to be sudden and violent.<br />
But I am sure that there is an upturn. And of course the<br />
speed with which the upturn can affect employment is a<br />
different problmn, because there has been a good deal of<br />
building up of stocks and they have to be cleared out of<br />
the pipelines to a reasonable extent. Then there has been<br />
a little choking along the line of trade credits, from the<br />
retailer to the wholesaler, to the manufacturer, When<br />
they are cleared up there will, I think, be a marked<br />
effect on employment all down the line. But until that<br />
happens I am not looking for anything exciting about this<br />
upturn expressed in terms of employment, I think the<br />
position will go along quietly.<br />
Q1CSTION Sir, has there been any retreat on the Government's<br />
policy, or modification, of its now ,1-year old policy of<br />
full employment?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, none whatever. I think, you know, there is a<br />
good deal of misapprehension about full employment. The<br />
man isn't born who can bring about a state of affairs in<br />
which there are always exactly the same number of jobs as </p>
<p>there are non wanting thcn. He's not born; he doesn't<br />
exist on either side of Parlialent. So what you do is to<br />
get full employment without spilling over if you can<br />
help it, into over-full employment with all the bidding up<br />
and inflationary pressures that are the result. At the<br />
morent we are short of full employment, fractionally. One<br />
of our great aims in our current activities is to break up<br />
that, so that we jet back once more. You have got to<br />
remember that if you look over the period of the last 11<br />
years, as you rightly say, the extent to which full<br />
employment has been maintained is quite remarkable. We<br />
have no apologies to make about it.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, do you see any problem arising at the end of<br />
this year because of the extra number of boys and girls<br />
leaving school?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, in all the calculations that have been put to us<br />
that figure has always been broug. ht forward and is well in<br />
mind. There are a rather higher number of school-loavers<br />
than usual.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, you have announced that the Duke of Edinburgh<br />
will open the Commonwealth Games in Perth next year;<br />
there has been a Buckingham Palace spokesman quoted as<br />
saying that the Duke will come only for three days and<br />
that he is not likely to make any country tours or visit<br />
any other State. I am wondering if you can indicate the<br />
sort of mechanics of negotiating the tour from the point<br />
that there is an acceptance in limitation.<br />
PRIME MINISTE: Yes. W/ hat happens is this, that we either have some<br />
one of our people in London go and discuss with his staff<br />
the details of what is to be done and those haven't<br />
been fixed yet anyway or, if it became necessary we<br />
would send a man from here. In the case of longer tours<br />
we would always send somebody from here so that they<br />
organise what there is. Then if you have a tour you have<br />
people engaged in a sort of broad organising committee<br />
representing each State concerned, and also the Commonwealth.<br />
But if it turned out that the Duke came out and<br />
opened the Games and stayed around there for a while and<br />
then went straight back, the organisation problem is very<br />
much simpler. It might not be necessary to send somebody;<br />
it perhaps could be readily worked out in London. But<br />
whether he will do anything else I don't think that he<br />
will take on any particular public form of engagement, I<br />
don't think so, I don't know of it but whether he will<br />
just go to Western Australia and then go straight back<br />
remains to be seen. This is a matter I take up with him<br />
in correspondence.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Monzies it has been reported that you have begun<br />
talks with the U. K. Governnont on a new Agroemont covering<br />
Woomera in relation to the proposed European space work.<br />
Could you tell us something about that, or give us some<br />
background?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Mr. Thorneycroft has been noeotiating with European<br />
countries, as you probably know, about a " Space Club".<br />
They have got to a certain point. We have been told what<br />
that point is; we have been asked for our cor. rlents; and<br />
we have made some. They are going to have a conference<br />
about this matter on the official lovel I think it is in<br />
London fairly shortly. JWe will be represented at that,<br />
not necessarily to conclude an agroo.: ent because there are<br />
a lot of questions that we have on it which have yet to be </p>
<p>QUESTION: answered. You can take it that Australia is at present<br />
not co-iitted to any proposal. But as the proposal would<br />
involve the use of the ' oomnera facilities, we have, of<br />
curse, a very large interest in it. But there is no<br />
conclusion. But it will involve a now agreoment, a separate<br />
agreement as distinct from the Weapons Research<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It doesn't necessarily involve any change in our<br />
Weapons Agreement because, of course, there is a great<br />
volume of that still going on, irrespective of Blue<br />
Streak. There is more nuney being spent now than there<br />
was five years ago I mean on the general weapons<br />
development. But if there were a Space Club established<br />
and Australia was in it, in virtue of the Rocket Range,<br />
and terms had been arrived at, which they haven't yet,<br />
then there would presumably be a multi-lateral agreement<br />
about that in which we would be a party, and Great Britain<br />
and France, and Italy, whatever it may be. But that would<br />
be in parallel with the i/ oapons Establishment Agreement.<br />
QUESTION: Has the Governnent any plans for enlarging the<br />
Tariff Board further to expedite its hearings, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, no plans, no plans. There are always<br />
discussions, you know, going on about that because it is<br />
very important to expedite its hearings without lowering<br />
the quality of the work done. But that is one of those<br />
things that we occasionally have informal discussions<br />
about, but there are no plans.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, have you hpd any reaction from abroad yet to the<br />
scheme mentioned by Mr. McEwen for an orderly marketing<br />
of world primary commodities?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have had none, no.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, talking about Mr. McEwen, what is the latest on<br />
the threat of the Liberals to contest his seat?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I seem to be the only fellow who hasn't made a<br />
statement on this so far. I have the greatest confidence<br />
in the world that Mr. McEwen will be back here after the<br />
elections.<br />
QUESTION: Are you going to send him away, before the electin,<br />
on the Common Market, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I hope not, but who knows? I mean, we don't<br />
know what is going to develop in the course of these<br />
Commonwealth discussions that are going to occur in<br />
London. He wouldn't want to go away at this stage; nor<br />
would I want him to. But it may be that he will have to<br />
go. But I don't know.<br />
QUESTION: Do y. u think a Liberal will be contesting the seat<br />
against him Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't. But I don't run the Liberal Party you know.<br />
You are just asking me now, as an innocent bystander.<br />
Well, as an innocent bystander, I don't think that he will<br />
be.<br />
QUESTION: How innocent were your ruearks to certain people,<br />
then, about the Liberals contosting the seat, Sir? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: I don't know. You ought to ask then that. I don't<br />
run the organis _ tion of ny Party. The rolations between<br />
ne and the Liberal Party Organisation soon to be somewhat<br />
diffrent from the rolati-ns between my opponents and<br />
their Party organisation.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, your Party has endorsed the establishment of a<br />
Northern Australian Developnent Commrission, but your<br />
National Developient Minister is opposed to it. Could we<br />
have your personal views on it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. I don't know what you mean when you say " my<br />
Party" has endorsed it. Tell no about this; I always<br />
like to learn a bit of news.<br />
QUESTION: The Federal Council of the Liberal Party, Sir, at the<br />
Conference just prior to the last election, endorsed a<br />
' Jest Australian scheme that it should be treated as a<br />
natter of national emergency.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, no, I've no comment on that. I don't think we<br />
are doing too badly by the north at the noment.<br />
QUESTION: Has the proposal cone up, or been discussed in<br />
Cabinet Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This thing he is talking about?<br />
PRESSMAN: Yes: the Northorn Australian Dc relopment Comrission.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, I daresay somebody has mentioned it at one tine<br />
or another. We haven't set one up. You can draw your own<br />
inferences from that.<br />
QUESTION: Has any sort of pattern developed, so far, for<br />
Commonwealth aid to the States for special development<br />
projects, or do you favour dealing with each matter as it<br />
comes up?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, it is a combination of the two things. The<br />
pattern, broadly, has been, as we have indicated in<br />
statements that have been made, that we are interested in<br />
proposals which lead to a material improvement in exports.<br />
It is for that reason that we were interested in the Mount<br />
Isa line, because that speaks big in terms of export<br />
earnings; it is for that reason that we have been taking<br />
a hand in these beef cattle roads because they will<br />
increase the outturn, or the turnout, I don't know what<br />
the word is, of cattle, primarily for export; it is for<br />
that reason that we have been in touch with the New South<br />
Wales Government about coal ports, improved coal port<br />
facilities, because there is a prospective growing market<br />
for coal. But that has been the thing that attracts our<br />
minds in the first place. Then we deal with then ad hoc.<br />
Je think, as a matter of fact, we probably do better<br />
by discussing concrete proposals individually with the<br />
State Governnents than by leaving all this to some nonparliarentary<br />
authority. In the long run these things<br />
usually end up by us having to find some money. You rather<br />
like to be the master of your own fate on those things.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Monzies, Sir Garfield Barwick said the employment<br />
situation got a lot worse than the Government ever<br />
intended. Was he speaking for the Government when he said<br />
that? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: Oh, I read about that, something about that in the<br />
paper. I didn't hear him speak. I have road some rather<br />
amusing comments on it. We have made our position quite<br />
clear on those things.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, has the Government any knowledge of President<br />
Kennedy having indicated to the Indonesians, a change of<br />
Anerican policy over Ieost New Guinea, or a willingness to<br />
modify the American attitude to Indonesia's claims?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well we have heard suggestions made and all that kind<br />
of thing. But I wouldn't tell you that they had nade any<br />
change in their policy. I don't know. So far as I can<br />
make out there have been some rather exaggerated rumours<br />
in that field. That problem is always being discussed;<br />
we are always having exchanges with other Governments<br />
about it, including the Administration of the United<br />
States. But I have no reason to suppose that the<br />
Americans h.: ve developed some new approach on this matter:<br />
they may have thought of a few. But I imagine you want to<br />
know whether they have propounded something.<br />
SQUESTION: ir. Macmillan is reported to have said on the weekend<br />
that no one would fight over Berlin. Do you agree<br />
with him on that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, for heaven's sake dn't ask me about a statement<br />
of his which is in the cables. My experience of Mr.<br />
Macmillan is that he is quite capable of expressing his<br />
own views. And when I have tabled some papers about Berlin<br />
and made a statement I will express mine. Wait and see.<br />
QUESTION: Your other week-end statement about the Univrsities<br />
Committee, Sir, can you enlighten us any more about these<br />
University-type institutions which you suggested earlier<br />
might emer: e from this? What sort of institutions did..<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, now, look, this is the very thing that they are<br />
going to exaimine. It is not for me to say bec-use I lack<br />
the competence to say. But it is quite clear that we have<br />
reached a stage here, just as they have in England, where<br />
they have appointed a similar coramittee, where you have to<br />
* think very hard about whether you . o on just increasing<br />
the number of Universities on the stock pattern; or<br />
whether there ought to be a greator variety of instruments<br />
of tertiary education some simpler than others; some<br />
may be less costly than others. But, of course, the<br />
financial probler. for the Comr. onwealth, and even more for<br />
the States, is growing and can become formidable. And,<br />
just as in 1ngland, they said, " Well we had better have a<br />
look at this thing and see whether the answer to it is to<br />
develop more technological institutions", if you want<br />
technology developed, or do this or that. That is why we<br />
have got a pretty broad-based committee that can have a<br />
look at it.<br />
But it will take it a long time because it is a<br />
tremendously complex problem. It doesn't need to make a<br />
report overnight because the present triennium lasts for<br />
two ori-years, but they need to give us their ideas in a<br />
pretty precise form by 1963 either us or our successors<br />
because it is a problem which you wouldn't allow to drift<br />
into a third triennium. It would perhaps affect the way<br />
in which you were working out the money to be found and the<br />
way it is to be spent. But it is very important, always<br />
remembering that we have gone along for a long time now on<br />
what I call Universities on the 19th century model. The<br />
whole thing needs re-looking at. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Sir, Mr. Holt in the 3ud: et speech, I think<br />
mentioned that you woro working towards agreoment, or<br />
hoped to roach agreement soon, or some such thing., with<br />
the Now South Wales Government on the coal ports project.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That is what I was just mentioning. Didn't you hear<br />
me mention that just now? It has great possibilities I<br />
think.<br />
QUESTION: A recent report, Sir, said that the United States<br />
would oppose any special arrangements being made about the<br />
Cormmonwealth if the U. K. should enter the Common Market<br />
because of their concern over the ability of the Latin-<br />
American countries to export. When you were in Washington<br />
recently, Sir, did you have any discussions on the Common<br />
Market question with Mr. Kennedy?<br />
PRIME MINISTE'R: No. When I was in Washington last the state of the<br />
Common Market discussion was that the last statement by<br />
Great Britain was that she wasn't proposing to enter the<br />
Common Market unless agriculture would be kept out. It<br />
is only in the last few weeks that that position has been<br />
modified. </p>
