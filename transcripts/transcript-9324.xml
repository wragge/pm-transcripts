PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, DARWIN, 19 AUGUST 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: You want some general comments, I think, about the meeting and its<br />
prospects. Well, let me begin by saying, I think, we've now been for<br />
most of the last decade embarked on a program of opening Australia<br />
up and inducing a productive ethic into the way in which the Australian<br />
economy operates. The Commonwealth Government this Labor<br />
Government took huge decisions in the 1 980s, removing exchange<br />
cpnj~ qjs in 1953 and starting to knock the tariff wall over in 1 968-t6the<br />
point where we'll have tariffs down by about five per cent by 1997.<br />
The competitive breezes which then come with that through input,<br />
competition, through a free flow of goods in the economy, a free flow of<br />
funds all needs to be complemented by productivity change at the<br />
workplace, by productivity change in all of the areas of commerce<br />
including that of the big state utilities.<br />
So, one of the principle matters under discussion here today is the<br />
competition principles which are part and parcel of the Trade Practices<br />
Act which under the recommendations of Professor Hilm-er should-be<br />
extended to States authorities. In other words, we-got the same<br />
competitive elements into those parts of the economy which formerly<br />
have had them locked out. Because we know to keep the Australian<br />
economy growing, to not run up against a Balance of Payments<br />
constraint in the future, to produce more goods and services, we are<br />
going to need to have the Australian economy supple and that means<br />
electricity authorities, it means rail authorities, port authorities, just as<br />
It has meant for the Commonwealth telecommunications and airlines.<br />
Now, at our officials discussions we are at the point where there can<br />
be a full embrace of the program which we adopted in principal in<br />
Hobart at the COAG meeting. Now, there is some trepidation on the<br />
part of some S5tates about this. I mean, in a sense, as there was with<br />
the Commonwealth Cabinet when we decided to start knocking the<br />
tariff wall over in the 1 980s. But, competition matters and competition<br />
works and I hope it is not too ironic that a Labor Prime Minister has to<br />
say to a collection largely of Coalition Liberal and National Party<br />
Premiers who are always telling us about the virtues of the market, that </p>
<p>2<br />
there is actually a virtue in marketplace competition. Now, I think,<br />
they're saying ' well look, we can swim, but you are now asking us to<br />
dive into the deep end of the pool. Now, I'm sure we're going to make<br />
it, but let's think about it first.' So, they are coming to the edge and<br />
standing back a bit, then coming to the edge and standing back a bit.<br />
But I think, there is a tremendous opportunity to be seized here and<br />
one that's really going to mean that for consumers we are going to see<br />
lower prices, for businesses lower electricity charges, better water<br />
charges, better gas access, all of these sorts of things.<br />
Now, this is not a revenue matter. When the Commonwealth started to<br />
pull tariffs down there was a tremendous cost to the Commonwealth<br />
budget in lost customs duty. So, we didn't say ' oh well look, we are<br />
going to lose custom duty here we'd better not do it.' We did it<br />
because we wanted a new industrial society and that's what we have<br />
got as a consequence. We've now got high technology companies<br />
being born all over the country. We've got a massive shift in the<br />
nature of our domestic producers who are now finding export markets,<br />
you've seen the McisyRpr on the 700 exporters, all of that has<br />
come because largely w've knocked over protection and we did it not<br />
because of Influences on the Commonwealth budget.<br />
Now, the States are saying to us now ' well look, there is going to be..<br />
they have a number a $ 5 billion budgetary benefit for the<br />
Commonwealth here and you should split that with us and this is<br />
basically a money matter.' Well, it's not a money matter because<br />
largely what is going to happen here, most of the benefit ought to go to<br />
consumers. It is not a budgetary thing, it's not going to go to the<br />
Commonwealth or the State budgets. It's really about getting some of<br />
the monopoly profits back into the hands of business with lower prices<br />
and consumers with lower prices. Now, the change is worth doing for<br />
those competitive and efficiency reasons and not for any<br />
consequential revenue effects.<br />
Let me just for a moment give you an indication of how this $ 5 billion<br />
number, for what that's worth, is way wide of the mark. The States say<br />
there Is a $ 5 billion benefit to the Commonwealth in this. Well, as<br />
Professor Hilmer said on the radio this morning, even if you add up all<br />
of the States authorities water, gas, electricity, ports their Income to<br />
States, it doesn't amount to $ 5 billion. But, were the Commonwealth to<br />
collect $ 5 billion on it through its corporation tax you know the<br />
corporate rate is 33 per cent to collect S5 billion at the rate of 33 per<br />
cent we would have to be taxing $ 15 billion of profits. Now, what does<br />
the State authority get? Would it get 10 per cent on turn over? So, if<br />
they have got $ 15 billion worth of profits, what is the turn over? $ 150<br />
billion. Now, the whole economy is only $ 400 billion. The whole<br />
Australian national economy Is only $ 400 billion. So, nobody is going<br />
to accept the notion that a behavioural change or a competitive<br />
change is going to add $ 150 billion of economic value which would </p>
<p>translate to profits of $ 15 billion taxed at the Commonwealth rate of 33<br />
per cent to a $ 5 billion benefit to the Commonwealth. It is just an<br />
absurdity. Any benefit to the Commonwealth would be lucky to be<br />
per cent of the $ 5 billion the States are speaking of and for our part, if<br />
it is of those orders of magnitude, and it is, we don't mind to let the<br />
States have a substantial proportion of that back.<br />
But, there Is another agenda here, can I just say this. The other<br />
agenda is that a number of Premiers have said ' look, this is an<br />
occasion to sit down and give us a chop at the Commonwealth's tax<br />
base, let's get, you know in the bonhomie and fellowship of the human<br />
race and the rest of it, why don't we decide how much of the<br />
Commonwealth's tax base goes to the States?' Now, no one can quite<br />
say the phrase ' revenue sharing', but that's what they mean. Now, let<br />
me just say this about revenue sharing. If the States were revenue<br />
sharing with the Commonwealth in the last three years, they would<br />
have lost $ 2.3 billion. So, now the recession is past and growth is<br />
back again, they are saying ' well look, we wouldn't have shared with<br />
you in the recession, but we will share with you in the up side.' I would<br />
say well, that's very interesting. Whereas we said look, look what we<br />
have done, you gave some ground in February at COAG in adopting<br />
the Hilmer competition policies in principle. At the Premiers<br />
conference in May we showed our bona fides by giving you a new<br />
financial deal for three years. That was real terms guarantee per<br />
capita. That is the maintenance of your revenues with inflation<br />
adjustment in real terms plus a population factor. This has given the<br />
States more certainty than they have ever had, certainly since 1983<br />
and I believe before that. I said, so, you gave a bit in February, the<br />
Commonwealth has given some in May, now is the time to drive the<br />
Hilmer reforms home and when we sit at the next Premiers conference<br />
we can have a sensible discussion again about these things.<br />
So, from my point of view there is no reason why all the States can't<br />
agree to the elements of the proposals outlined in our draft<br />
communique. That is, for competition principles, extending the Trade<br />
Practices Act, the access regime, the pricing and cnie surveillance<br />
regime, the competition council to look at the way in which mon-opaIes<br />
might be treated in the future and with the transitional provisions there<br />
is all the protection in the world in there for the States. And, really,<br />
what we've got here is a bit of fear about the marketplace. A little bit of<br />
fear about competition. Now, that is understandable, but it shouldn't<br />
be enough to deter States from actually picking this up.<br />
J: In the spirit of give and take that you talk about then, can you<br />
genuinely proceed with Ralph Willis' threat to legislate the competition<br />
measures without the States co-operation. It may be legal, but is it<br />
practical? </p>
<p>PM: Well, one of the notions that is around they are saying, well, let's say<br />
for what's called State Mandated Conduct, this is where a State agrees<br />
to a particular activity be it an egg marketing arrangement or a sugar<br />
marketing arrangement or something like that, that the States should<br />
have an over ride of the Trade Practices Act. But, they can mandate<br />
any activity. For instance, someone could mandate the Coles Myer<br />
take over of Foodland and then we would be suspending the Trade<br />
Practices Act, so we wouldn't be moving on from here in a progressive<br />
way to reform with good competition principles, we'd be actually taking<br />
the Trade Practices Act back before 1975. Now, one thing for sure<br />
here, we are not going to go backwards. If the Commonwealth already<br />
has these powers in this Act, then seeking to co-operatively extend it is<br />
the way to go. But, we are not going to co-operatively go backwards<br />
and I think that is the point.<br />
J: But without co-operation will you go forward. Will you legislate<br />
whether or not you have the States approval?<br />
PM: Well, I think that there is enough respect for some market disciplines in<br />
this meeting to get a degree of agreement, but I think States have got<br />
to face this fact and particularly Coalition States. They can't go<br />
embracing free enterprise and the marketplace and the moment a<br />
Labor Government says ' well, what about trying a dose of it' they say<br />
' oh, no, no, we won't have that.'<br />
J: But, every Premier, even the Labor Premier coming in today has said<br />
that they want a fair share of the benefits of this and they all talked<br />
about billions of dollars. Now, is that just not on the table?<br />
PM: Well, I've given you the answer to that. The value of the revenue<br />
change here is not the issue. The Issue is whether the consumers of<br />
Queensland and NSW and Victoria, say in electricity, get lower<br />
electricity prices. Whether the business, the aluminium smelters and<br />
other people get lower electricity prices. Whether the water<br />
authorities, whether businesses which use water, including consumers,<br />
get better prices. I mean, that Is the issue.<br />
J: But, do you accept that revenue may not be the issue for you, but it<br />
certainly is to them. They see you getting more money.<br />
PM: Their budgets at the moment are growing much more rapidly their<br />
revenues than the Commonwealths. That Is, state stamp duties on<br />
property, on shares. Their budgets are responding, their revenue<br />
growth has outstripped ours enormously in the last two years. So, the<br />
States are now in a very look at Premier Fahey's spending in the<br />
last six weeks a railway line to Parramatta, $ 400 million for a railway<br />
line to the airport. Premier Kennett is telling us about the surplus in<br />
the Victorian budget. I mean, the Commonwealth carries the cost of </p>
<p>the economy in the recessions. It takes the shock absorbing affect. It<br />
has got to have the capacity to get back into surplus in the good times.<br />
J: What about the argument for transitional assistance from the<br />
Commonwealth as Professor Hilmer suggests. Any financial money<br />
there and if so how much?<br />
PM: Well, that's what we are talking about. I think we are prepared to talk<br />
about that, but again, taking some notional GDP effect and then trying<br />
to divide that into Commonwealth revenue is, you know, the games<br />
that shouldn't be played on an old war horse like me.<br />
J: Are you going to talk to Mr Fahey about Circular Quay, Prime Minister,<br />
today?<br />
PM: No, well, maybe I will, but that would be a side event.<br />
ends </p>
