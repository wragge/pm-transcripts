P. M. No. 15/ 1959.<br />
CO IIONWEALTI{ BANKING CORPORATION<br />
Statement in the House of Representatives by the Acting Prime<br />
Minister. The Rt. Hon, J. McEwen, M. P.<br />
While the Commonwealth Banking Corporation will not be<br />
formally established until the legislation has been proclaimed,<br />
which will not be until about the end of the year, it is necessary<br />
to proceed at once with the appointment of the Board of the<br />
Corporation, so that the re-organization necessary to give effect<br />
to the legislation and to constitute the Banking Corporation can<br />
be carried through. This action will include planning of such<br />
things as staffing and accommodation, arrangements for the<br />
commencement of business by the Commonwealth Development Bank and<br />
the integration of the Commonwealth Trading Bank, the Commonwealth<br />
Savings Bank, and the Commonwealth Development Bank into the<br />
framework of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation.<br />
Cabinet has decided to appoint Mr. Warren D. McDonald,<br />
to be Chairman of the Board of the Comr. monwealth Banking<br />
Corporation, which is being set up under the Banking Legislation<br />
recently passed by the Parliament.<br />
Mr. McDonald is Chairman of the Australian National<br />
Airlines Commission which operates T. A. A. He will in due course<br />
retire from that position, but, because of the various problems<br />
confronting T. A. A. during the coming months by reason of the<br />
introduction of its new fleet of Fokker Friendship and Electra<br />
aircraft and associated matters, he has consented to carry on his<br />
work with T. A. A. at least until these particular problems have<br />
been dealt with. Cabinet has also decided to appoint Mr. E. B. Richardson,<br />
as Managing Director of the Commonwealth Banking<br />
Corporation and Mr. A. N. Armstrong as Deputy Managing Director of<br />
the Corporation. Mr. Richardson is at present Deputy Governor of<br />
the Commonwealth Bank and Mr. Armstrong is General Manager of the<br />
Commonwealth Trading.-Bank.<br />
I should add that under the legislationthe Board of the<br />
Commonwealth Banking Worporation will comprise eleven members,<br />
of whom it is required that eight shall be neither directors nor<br />
officers of the Bank nor members of the Commonwealth Public Service.<br />
The legislation provides that the other three members shall be the<br />
Secretary to the Treasury, the Managing Director of the<br />
Commonwealth Banking Corporation and the Deputy Managing Director<br />
of the Corporation. With the appointment of the Chairman, therefore, seven<br />
other members of the Board have still to be appointed.-The<br />
Government intends to make these appointments at an early date.<br />
