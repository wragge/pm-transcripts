    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government has decided to provide additional relief assistance to enhance the current Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements to help people, businesses and communities recover from devastating natural disasters.</p>
<p>Enhanced assistance will be provided through:  (1) three special community recovery programs:  (i) a community recovery fund;  (ii) recovery grants for small business; and  (iii) recovery grants for primary producers.  (2) financial counselling for affected individuals;  (3) funding to upgrade essential infrastructure to more resilient standards; and  (4) small grants for disaster-affected voluntary non-profit bodies and needy persons.</p>
<p>  Assistance under the small business recovery grants program is designed to ensure that a disaster affected community does not lose essential business.  Grants of up to $10,000 to eligible small business can be provided for clean up and immediate restoration costs.</p>
<p>Similar assistance will be made available to eligible primary producers.</p>
<p>Funding under the community recovery programs can be provided for activities such as small grants to community service organisations providing recovery services; community information initiatives; employment of a community development officer to support and facilitate the disaster affected community to manage its own recovery; funding of commemorative events, advocacy and monitoring services, business advice and support; and economic and tourism development initiatives.</p>
<p>  The special community recovery programs will be triggered by agreement between the Australian Government and the states and territories, and will be funded on a dollar for dollar cost sharing basis. The Australian Government will give sympathetic consideration to any request from the Premiers to invoke these enhanced assistance arrangements.</p>
<p>The enhanced arrangements are in addition to the Australian Government's Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements which provide a comprehensive framework of assistance to states and territories affected by natural disasters.</p>
<p>  The arrangements provide for reimbursement of between 50 and 75 per cent of state costs above agreed thresholds for personal hardship and distress payments; concessional interest loans to farmers and small business; and restoration of essential public infrastructure.  Since 2001, the Australian Government has provided some $320 million to states and territories under these arrangements.</p>
<p>The bushfires ravaging New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania are threatening communities, livelihoods, property and livestock.   I commend the efforts of all those who have provided their fire-fighting and relief services. They have the full support of Australian Government and the Australian people.  </p>
