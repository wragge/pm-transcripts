TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, MADANG RESORT, PAPUA NEW GUINEA, 15 SEPTEMBER<br />
1995 E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: What has been happening in the Forum this morning?<br />
PMV: Well this is the round up, basically, the presentation of the Chairman's<br />
report from yesterday and just general items on the agenda. But<br />
before 1 do that, why don't I just give you perhaps an overview. I think<br />
the important thing to say about the Pacific Forum, and this one, is<br />
I think it has proved its value.<br />
* changed the format for the Forums last year in Brisbane and that<br />
change has been maintained by Prime Minister Chan and, as a<br />
consequence, we have been abre to tackle matters which do materially<br />
affect, importantly affect, Pacific island nations. For many of the<br />
smaller Pacific island states, the Forum is the principal body they<br />
attend and their principal contact in terms of, you know, governance<br />
and issues of government. It's their principal place for advice and for<br />
taking another view.<br />
Now, I think, in the last year we have been able to move forward<br />
substantially on a number of important things turning around the<br />
airline deficits of the regional airlines of the Pacific, which is a cause of<br />
great concern to the national budgets of some Pacific island countries.<br />
Secondly, proposing a logging code of conduct so that Forum states<br />
may say to logging companies, we subscribe to the Pacific logging<br />
code, to the Forum code, and there is then a Forum code. That having<br />
been unanimously adopted yesterday, I think, Is a strong point for I<br />
hope better forestry practices and better prices, better returns from<br />
forestry products and this is part of the problem that countries are not<br />
getting adequate returns on a lot of the products they are selling. This<br />
is both for forestry and for fisheries. </p>
<p>TEL: 14 23: 38 No 029P02, O<br />
2<br />
Thirdly, of course, fisheries themselves. Fisheries are an important<br />
part of the economy of the Pacific and the decisions we took over the<br />
course of the year, I think, are going to improve the prices that people<br />
receive for fish stocks and also their organisation of fisheries.<br />
Tourism remains an important area of income and is a growing source<br />
of income for many Pacific island countries and the initiatives we have<br />
taken in tourism, I think, will help there. Of course the airline<br />
rationalisation just helped by themselves. Getting a better scheduling<br />
of airlines is going to help and we just again announced a support<br />
package that is Australia, today for tourism for training and support<br />
of about $ 600,000, which is aimed at trying to lift the core<br />
competencies of tourism agencies and tourist operators so as to be<br />
able to draw a little more of the Asia Pacific and North American<br />
tourism market.<br />
As well as those things, there has been a clear message to the French<br />
Government about nuclear testing, The expression of extreme outrage<br />
on the part of Forum member states and the Forum in general, I think<br />
attests to the strength of feeling which countries have towards this<br />
issue. And I hope that the strength of these views will be noted by<br />
President Chirac and his Government.<br />
We have had other useful discussions on a range of issues, most of<br />
them I have mentioned, aviation, trade and investment was another<br />
one, tourism of course. And, of course, I go on from here for the<br />
anniversary celebrations of PNG's independence in Port Moresby.<br />
I think this is another important moment in the history of both of our<br />
countries, that Australia's relationship with Papua New Guinea and<br />
Papua New Guinea's own progress 20 years after independence. This<br />
is an auspicious occasion to be here and I have been very pleased<br />
with the visit.<br />
J: Prime Minister, has there been any discussion about what the nations<br />
will say to the French Minister in the post-Forum talks besides the<br />
actual wording of the declaration?<br />
PM: No, there hasn't because by and large, I mean, once a Forum is over,<br />
then as you know some of the states then stay and meet be they either<br />
heads of government, otherwise a head of mission, level the dialogue<br />
partners. Well that will happen on this occasion and it may be that<br />
I think Gordon Bilney will be representing Australia on this occasion.<br />
J: Carmen Lawrence, Prime Minister, and what did you think of her<br />
performance before the Royal Commission?<br />
PM: Well I haven't got all the details. I have only seen a few press<br />
clippings. But I mean as she has consistently said throughout this, the<br />
point is you have Royal Commissions when there are complex issues,<br />
problems of illegality, government mismanagement, waste, fraud, all </p>
<p>LL: 1 . ep Pz Hi0 o . z, . Ut<br />
3<br />
these sorts of things. You don't have it for a political exercise, a sort of<br />
tawdry political exercise, of the kind that Richard Court had in mind.<br />
So It Is just, you know, a $ 5 or $ 6 million waste of Western Australian<br />
taxpayers' money and a waste of our valuable time.<br />
J: Do you believe the political problems are now behind her?<br />
PMV: Well, you know, I don't know whether she had deep political problems.<br />
I mean there was a bit of a feeding frenzy about this to begin with<br />
owing to the sequence of the appearances before the Commission.<br />
But I think as it has gone on the public are quite wise about these<br />
things, they know when there is a stew on and they know there is one<br />
on here.<br />
inaudible) memory recall do you think Cabinet Ministers should have,<br />
Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Well probably better than Richard Court's and John Howard's when<br />
they were asked about the questions about what they said to each<br />
other about setting it up. Probably better than that, but who knows.<br />
J: [ inaudible] this week, she has appeared before the Royal Commission<br />
and she also did a bit of a media blitz last night. Do you think she has<br />
won the Australian public over?<br />
PM: Well, I think, the public again are quite wise about the things that<br />
matter to them employment, economic prosperity, the future of the<br />
nation, health, social security. They are the things that matter. These<br />
sort of political sideshows go on, which are interesting to all the<br />
players, the people in the political system, to the journalists. But<br />
I don't think they are that engaging for the public. I think they sort of<br />
say " oh well this is another, it'll go to the keeper and let's get on with<br />
life".<br />
J: Prime Minister, have you and the other leaders been surprised at the<br />
less than happy response to the logging arrangements that were<br />
agreed to yesterday?<br />
PM: What do you mean?<br />
J: Demonstrations have been planned here in New Guinea, also<br />
demonstrations I understand have been planned in the Solomon<br />
Islands. It doesn't seem that the public has embraced the decision<br />
with a great deal of enthusiasm.<br />
PMV: Well you would hardly expect them to, would you? I mean a year ago,<br />
we proposed this idea so that Forum countries could say look, rather<br />
than simply relying upon what we believe Is a competent logging<br />
regime, we will have a Forum logging regime. In other words, there is<br />
a reference point. So when governments are pressured by logging </p>

4<br />
companies, or operators, they can go back to the frame of reference<br />
that comes from the code of conduct. Now they will adopt the code of<br />
conduct and this will, I think, provide a much better regime for<br />
sustainability of forest management. We have invested, ourselves, a<br />
very big effort in this over the last twelve months. And, also, into<br />
places like Papua New Guinea where we have Australian forestry<br />
expertise and have had over the course of the year. And, more<br />
broadly, in those countries where forestry is an issue Vanuatu, the<br />
Solomon Islands. I think as a result of all this we will have something<br />
which is coherent and countries can adopt it. For instance take<br />
Papua New Guinea, It endorsed the code and will adopt It. This Is a<br />
large country, with large forestry areas.<br />
J: When will they adopt it?<br />
PM: Well I think they will adopt it over the course of the next six months.<br />
J: Will you be pulling Australian forestry officials, that have been funded<br />
through Australian aid, out of the Solomon Islands?<br />
PM: No, I don't think so. No. Not unless the Solomons they feel they want<br />
to go their own way.<br />
J: I understand that they have made that clear to the government already<br />
in the previous..<br />
PM: Not that I know of. But I mean, again, we help where we can and we<br />
don't press our bureaucratic people on governments, unless they wish<br />
to have them.<br />
J: Prime Minister, you are heading to Indonesia tomorrow afternoon,<br />
there is a poll out today in the newspapers in Australia, an AGB<br />
McNair poll, showing that most Australians would like the government<br />
to protest more strongly over East Timor. Will you be raising human<br />
rights?<br />
PM: When I am asked these questions I always give the same answer, that<br />
I don't give notice of what I will raise with President Soeharto or any<br />
other head of government because I think it is inappropriate and<br />
rude and I think it is counter-productive. But I have very strongly<br />
raised in the past human rights issues and I have had never a problem<br />
in raising them. The last time I raised them, of course, was with Mr Do<br />
Muoi from Vietnam, where we had a discussion on the human rights<br />
aspect for probably a couple of hours.<br />
J: Are you concerned with reports that are coming out of East Timor of<br />
riots this week and people are under detention?<br />
PM: I haven't seen any reports about East Timor this week. </p>
<p>TEL<br />
J: What about the recent reports on Irian Jaya, then?<br />
PM: Well, I mean, these are issues that I think concern all of us. But,<br />
again, the charge of these matters is in the hands of Indonesia.<br />
We can talk about them and we do and have and we have talked<br />
about them very clearly. I think Indonesia is under no<br />
misapprehensions about the difficulty these sort of instances cause its<br />
reputation around the world. I think it feels the natural pressure there.<br />
J: Mr Keating, how do you feel about your investiture tomorrow as the<br />
Chief of the Kokoda people?<br />
PM. Well I take that as a great compliment to Australia that there is such<br />
good feeling in the new region of Kokoda to Australians and fond<br />
memories of our associations during the war and since. And, you<br />
might recall, I went there in 1992 and proposed to the Papua New<br />
Guinea Prime Minister, Rabbie Namilau, at the time that we would<br />
perhaps make it a memorial village. In some way recognise the fact<br />
that It is a place of significance and meaning to Australians and to<br />
Papua New Guineans. As I think you will see tomorrow, we are going<br />
to be opening a regional hospital there and some other civic facilities<br />
which, of course, the village itself wouldn't be likely to receive in any<br />
other way but this. So perhaps it is just a way of saying thank you and<br />
to preserving the memory of those young Australians, boys most of<br />
them, who fought the strongest combat force the Japanese army could<br />
put together. And, of course, did it with great strength and heroism.<br />
J: How do you characterise after 20 years of independence our<br />
relationship with our former colony, now?<br />
PM: Pretty good I say. We are doing things with them that I am sure..<br />
I think we are a very good neighbour for Papua New Guinea, we invest<br />
a lot of money here every year, we take a lot of pride in the<br />
relationship. But underpinning it is a great interest in the people of<br />
Papua New Guinea and what I found whenever I have come to Papua<br />
New Guinea, and this is borne out during the 1992 visit when we<br />
went out to Ela, to the cemetery there, there were 20,000 or 30,000<br />
people there and the warmth towards Australia is always so<br />
profound. And it is that relationship, it Is the people to people<br />
relationship I think that really matters. Governments come and go, you<br />
know the bureaucracy changes, programs come and go. It is that<br />
people to people relationship that I think is the foundation stone of the<br />
Papua New Guinea/ Australia relationship. But I think, as well as that,<br />
the government relationships have been good, they have been<br />
constructive and I am sure they are going to be endearing.<br />
inaudible] shift towards tied aid, or are you willing to slow that down a<br />
bit? T: 14 .' Oep. 23 : 38 No . C29 P 05/ 06 </p>
<p>TEL: 14. Sep. 95 23: 38 No. 029 P. 06/ 06<br />
6<br />
PM: No, we have taken the view that Papua New Guinea's strength as an<br />
economy, as such, so that it will be able to maintain the growth of its<br />
budgets and carry a shift from Australian budget aid to program aid<br />
and it means that we get, in a sense, out of their way with the budgets.<br />
But we can go and do some of these other things which are useful to<br />
the community.<br />
