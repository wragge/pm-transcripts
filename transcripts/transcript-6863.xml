FOR MEDIA 7 March 1986<br />
Senator Don Grimes, the Deputy Government Leader in the Senate<br />
and Minister for Community Services, will represent the<br />
Government at the funeral of the late Swedish Prime Minister, Mr<br />
Olof Palme. The funeral will be held in Stockholm on 15 March.<br />
Senator Grimes was a personal friend of the late Prime Minister,<br />
having met him on a number of occasions at meetings of the<br />
Socialist International. He is also known to Mr Palme's widow,<br />
Lisbet.<br />
The attendance of Senator Grimes at the funeral is a mark of the<br />
deep respect which the Australian Government has for Olof Palme's<br />
achievements in the cause of world peace and social justice, and<br />
of the friendship which Australia feels for the Government and<br />
people of Sweden. </p>
