PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR. HAROLD HOLT, FOR MEMBERS OF THE PARLIAMENTARY<br />
PRESS GALLERY. AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE,<br />
CANBERRA. 21ST APRIL. 1966<br />
Q. Can yuu tell us Sir, whether you are goino to make<br />
any statement today, before you P-o away, on the call-up<br />
of aliens for National ervice?<br />
MR. HOLT: Well I can rrive you some comment on both those<br />
matters the alien call-up and the question of the votinace.<br />
I can rive you comment in the sense that work hae been<br />
proceeding but no cinality has been reached. On the voting<br />
aspect, Cabinet has considered the matter and has come to a<br />
view which it wishes to discuss with its own party room<br />
supporters. It is clearly desirable to have the widest area<br />
of aoreement 6n a matter of this sort and I would expect to<br />
be in a position to take this up with members of the Government<br />
parties shortly after my return.<br />
On the alien matter, I did indicate a general view of<br />
my own in the House some time ap-o, and at the same time said<br />
that there were some complications about the matter arisinp<br />
from our international relationships and practice on these<br />
matters between countries. Work has been proceedino at<br />
Departmental level. There has been some further consideration<br />
on it in Cabinet, but at the moment we are awaitinp, the outcome<br />
of discussions which have been takinp place through our<br />
Department of External Affairs and some of the countries which<br />
would be affected so far as their nationals are concerned,<br />
if the Government were to proceed with a scheme alcng these<br />
lines. I was told when I last enquired that there would<br />
probably be three or four weeks of time involved in bringing<br />
this matter to a sufficientl advanced sta-e for Cabinet t2<br />
have another look at it. But we shall press on with it when<br />
the information reaches us.<br />
Q. Any particular countries heavily involved overseas<br />
countries?<br />
MR. HOLT: Well, I think most of you know where our main sources<br />
of migsration come from. It is not difficult to list them.<br />
Q. Any indicating any opposition?<br />
MR. HOLT: Well I am not well enough informed on it myself to<br />
comment on that at this sta-e and I don't think it desirable<br />
to make piecemeal comment about it. When we are in a position<br />
to say firmly what the policy is to be and what problems, if<br />
any, persist with that, I shall do so. I would hope that it<br />
will be possible te do this before the end of the Session.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, reparts have been floating around<br />
that the United Stsites Government has consulted Australia on<br />
the possible bombing of Hamoi, and the reports say also that<br />
we have told imerica at this staoe that we are not very keen<br />
on it. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
MR. HOLT Well, as I said in the House the other day no<br />
particular sirnificance should be read into this in relation<br />
to the matter you've mentioned that there are virtually daily<br />
exchanges between Australian Governmental representatives at<br />
some level or other in relation to some aspect or other of the<br />
conflict in Viet Nam. I don't think it is desirable to make<br />
running comments on the substance of these discussions. We<br />
are both involved in military operations in the area and<br />
naturally, matters of a tactical kind or a strategic kind<br />
are discussed from time to time between us, and I don't want<br />
to get into a practice of commenting on possible tactical<br />
moves which mip&amp; ht be made in the military field. But the<br />
President of the United States has stated quite emphatically<br />
that it is not the intention of the United States Government<br />
to destroy the economy of North Viet Nam or to prevent it<br />
from maintaining a viable existence and we have supported<br />
that view. I have said this publicly myself.<br />
Q. Can you say what our attitude is to the bombing<br />
of Hanoi, Sir? Do we elieve in it or don't we?<br />
MR. HOLT: No, I'm not Poins to comment because your question<br />
has to be read against the background of what has been said<br />
about our objectives. Our objectives are not to destroy the<br />
economy, the livelihood of the people of Hanoi or to prevent<br />
North Viet Nam continuinP as an economic entity.<br />
Some of you were interested, I understand, as to<br />
whether I would be participating in the Queensland elections,<br />
and I can tell you quite firmly that at the invitation of<br />
the members of my own party in Queensland the Parliamentary<br />
party and the eryanisation I have arreed to participate.<br />
I did have a talk with Mr. Nicklin about this before finally<br />
making up my mind on it, and he made it clear to me that I<br />
would be welcome so far as he was concerned,<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, your talk with the Indonesian<br />
Ambassador yesterday has aroused some interest. I wonder if<br />
you would care to tll us what your hopes are for closer<br />
relations and also for the removal of the points at issue?<br />
MR. HOLT Well, I had a very friendly talk with the<br />
Indonesian Ambassador. He was gracious enough to express on<br />
behalf of his Government very warm appreciation for Aujtralia's<br />
gesture in pivine some assistance recently at the time of the<br />
floods in Java and it is quite apparent from what he said<br />
that the promptness with which Australia acted and the<br />
genuine frienaliness behind the move on our part was received<br />
with pleasure and appreciation by the people of Indonesia.<br />
We both expressed the hope that the relationship between eur<br />
two countries would improve in the period ahead. He made it<br />
clear to me that I would be welcome in his country if I found<br />
an opportunity to visit it. It was known to us both that,<br />
havinr regard to the timetable and the fact that I was<br />
limitinp my visit on this occasion to those countries in which<br />
Australian serricemen were stationed, this would not be an<br />
opportune or practicable time from my point of view. But<br />
we had a very cordial discussion and I know that his Government<br />
is well aware that Australia has a continuing desire to<br />
maintain a course of friendship with Indonesia. We look to<br />
a future in which there will be practical opportunities for<br />
us to develop, not only mutually advantageous relations but<br />
mutually advantageous trade, and for our part in Australia,<br />
we regret the continuance of the policy o confrontation which<br />
hinders the full development of this relationship. </p>
<p>Q. Was there any invitation to go to Indonesia, Sir,<br />
or vice versa?<br />
IVIR. HOLT: I didn't interpret the discussion as a specific<br />
invitation to visit Indonesia in the course of this visit<br />
but I don't think any particular significance should be<br />
read into that. It was well knowTn tohim that my opportunities<br />
were limited, that the timetable had been fixed. But he<br />
did, I repeat, make it clear that I would be welcome if I<br />
found it practicable in the future to make a visit, and I<br />
would hope to do so.<br />
Q. Have we a standing invitation to Sukarno to come here?<br />
MR. HOLT: I understand there was an invitation..........<br />
Q. Would you be ready to go when the time was suitable?<br />
MR. HOLT: I am always ready to travel in the service of the<br />
nation where it can be of value to Australia, and I vould so<br />
regard a visit to Indonesia, but this is not within the realm<br />
of present planning. I also have a desire to visit, of<br />
course, the Philippines and Taiwan and other countries in<br />
the area of particular interest to Australia, but<br />
opportunities have not so far arisen.<br />
Q. Japan, Sir?<br />
MR. HOLT: dell I have had two visits in recent years to Japan<br />
but, of course, a country of such importance to Australia<br />
would certainly call for frequent exchanges of visits from<br />
Heads of Government or senior ministers of the governmnt.<br />
Q. Sir, just to complete the Queensland election answ: rer.<br />
Do you know cxactly ahen you hope to go there and where<br />
MR. HOLT: I understand they are planning a couple of meetings<br />
in or around Brisbane, one in Brisbane itself, one at<br />
Ipsvich and another meeting in North Queensland, probably<br />
Townsville. This would be on the Thursday and Friday of<br />
the week prior to the final week of the carpaign, whenever<br />
that is.<br />
Q. WYould you hope to go to Bingil Bay?<br />
MR. HOLT: Don't put temptation in my path. It is getting<br />
awfully close in relative terms when you got up that far.<br />
This would depend on what der-ands there are on me down hero<br />
at that time, but I suppose even a Prime Minister is<br />
entitled to have a weekend off some time. If not off, at<br />
least, someplace that is agreeable to him.<br />
Q. There is still some speculation, Sir, that there<br />
will be a snap election follouiing your forthcoming visit.<br />
MR. HOLT: Well I don't think that is terribly sensible ' 1,! hen<br />
regard is had to the fact that there is an election in<br />
Quconsland. Vie don't like having overlap ing elections<br />
in this country. The word " snap" I don't think you<br />
can have an election undc-r five or six fecks from the time<br />
that you announce that you are going. / 4 </p>
<p>Q. On the matter of visits, if I could just refer to them.<br />
Is there any intention of holding a Prime IMinister's<br />
Conference in London this year, do you know?<br />
MR. HOLT: Well, I am not able to speak with any authority on<br />
that. Arising from the Lagos Conference, there was, as I<br />
recall it, an expressed intention of having some further<br />
meeting to discuss issues which had been raised ther~ e in<br />
July in London, but whether that was a firm. arrangement or<br />
not, I am unable to say. I imagine that Mr. W rilson, with<br />
an election to be faced himself, was keeping his own mind<br />
fairly open as to what should. be the planning thereafter.<br />
I am not in a position to give any definite informa. tion.<br />
Q. SiDo you propose to go to London in the winter recess,<br />
MR. HOLT: Well, that-is a strong possibility but it will be<br />
affected perhapsb. 6he auestion of a Prime Ministers'<br />
Conference and it could be affected by the course of events<br />
in Australia, but I think it is clearly desirable that there<br />
should not be too delayed an opportunity taken to contact<br />
the leaders of governments of such importance to Australian<br />
interest, and the United Kingdom and the United States<br />
certainly stand in that category. President Johnson has<br />
been good enough to indicate to me that ho would very much<br />
like to see me there and this would, of course, be considered<br />
in any planning I might do for overseas Journeying later<br />
in the year. Incidentally, while on that, I had a visit<br />
yesterday from the Ambassador for India who conveyed tome<br />
a fomal invitation from the Govcrnment of India<br />
You mean the High Commissioner.<br />
MR. HOLT: Yes, I'm sorry, the lligh Commissioner to visit<br />
that country and this, of course, will also be a matter of<br />
considerable interest and value, but I can't see the<br />
opportunity arising in the early future. I took the<br />
opportunity on behalf of the Government to issue -at the<br />
same time a most cordial invitation to the Prime Minister<br />
of India to visit Australia wihenever that mnight seem<br />
practicable to Mvrs. Gandhi.<br />
On the French nuclear tests, Sir, has Australia given<br />
landing rights to French military planes to fly across<br />
Australian territory?<br />
M. HOLT: I would like to refer you on the detail of that to<br />
Senator Gorton. The matter was raised and there were<br />
certain assurances given, I understand, .1hich were regarded<br />
as satisfactory by our adviscr3 in the External Affairs<br />
field and by the MAinis ter, but I don't claim to be abreast<br />
of the detail on it.<br />
Q. Broadly, we do let them, Sir, subject to those<br />
conditi ons?<br />
Mk~. HOLT. This was the arrangement, as I understand it. / 2 </p>
<p>Mr. whitlam, Sir, wants you to release Gunner O'Neill.<br />
from the unpleasant predicament in which he now finds himself.<br />
Are you likely to be sympathetic?<br />
MR. HOLT: I am sympathetic to most of my fellow men. Many of us<br />
run into trouble of one kind or another at some sta,-e of our<br />
lives, but I did say in the House yesterday that I would<br />
examine this matter with my collearues, the Minister for<br />
Defence and the Minister for the Army. I have raised the<br />
matter with the Minister for Defence and it is currently<br />
receiving his consideration, and no doubt he will in turn be<br />
in consultation with the Minister for the Army, but these are<br />
matters in which a great deal of weight must be given to the<br />
view of the Service people who themselves know the situation<br />
in their own Service and the conditions which give rise to<br />
good order and discipline needed to sustain morale. We<br />
would, of course, be very much influenced by their judgment<br />
after our own dispassionate examination of the facts.<br />
Q. Sir, do you wish to say something about your trip today?<br />
MR. HOLT: Iell, I think you know the details. I will be in the<br />
House until the end of Question Time. It will be a quick<br />
journey from there. We have had to use the Civil Aviation<br />
plane to catch the 12 o'clock aircraft leaving Mascot, so<br />
assuming the fog has lifted there there was some fog there<br />
this morning, I understand I shall, because of the time<br />
factor, just go from one aircraft to the other. That's one<br />
reason why we are meeting you people here this morning.<br />
It won't be practicable to do that in Sydney. I have on<br />
board with me several of the official party the Chief of<br />
the General Staff, the Chairman-designato of the Chiefs<br />
of Staff Committee, General Wilton, will meatus in Perth,<br />
and we proceed from there to Singapore. Tomorrow morning,<br />
I think it is, we set off for Saigon from Singapore, so<br />
that by lunch-time tomorrow wo should be right in the heart<br />
of the matter.<br />
Q. Sir, the W. A. Premier after his recent talks with you<br />
suggested that he expected a decision on the Ord this session.<br />
Ib you think this would still. lld?<br />
MR. HOLT: Well, I would have thought that this was one of the<br />
matters that would be considered in a Budgetary context<br />
so that it would be a matter considered not later than in<br />
a Budgetary context...<br />
Q. So you would suggest little hope of seeing it this<br />
Session?<br />
MR. HOLT: Vell, I don't think that adds up to anything much.<br />
It has to be a Budgetary matter, so even if a decision wore<br />
taken on it beforehand assuming it were a favourable<br />
decision you would have to mako some Budgetary provision<br />
for it, There is no desire on our part to delay consideration<br />
of it. It may well be that Cabinet will be looking at it<br />
ahead of the Budgot but this matter is currently in the hands<br />
of the AMinister for National Development and when ho brings<br />
it to Cabinet is a matter which at this stage is in his hands.<br />
e../ 6 </p>
<p>Q. Will you be officially meeting Premier Ky in<br />
Viet Nam?<br />
MR. HOLT: Oh, yes.<br />
Q. Do you think this could be taken by the Vietnamese<br />
as a sort of de facto interference in their internal<br />
politics.<br />
MR. HOLT: ~ ell I would most certainly hope not and I would make<br />
it quite clear in my own statemens, if that seemed necessary,<br />
that this was not so. I have made it abundantly clear,<br />
I would have hoped, and this would ? have been reported in<br />
Saigon and other capitals which I shall be visiting that<br />
the principal purpose of my visit is to make contact with<br />
Australian Servicemen in the field, and to dcvcloo in this<br />
way a more intimate awareness of their problems and the<br />
conditions under which they are tc serve. But quite<br />
obviously, it is desirable when visiting thse countries,<br />
to take such opportunities as I can find of talking to<br />
people who are either the Heads of Government or in a<br />
position of authority in the Service or governmental field.<br />
The other aspect which must not be overlooked is that<br />
Australia is increasiinly and this is how it is seen in<br />
the eyes of the countries we shall be visiting a<br />
country giving assistance in a variety of forms; not merely<br />
military assistance as we are in respect of , Mlaysia and<br />
Singapore and South Viet Nam, but technical assistance and<br />
material assistance through the Colombo Plan and other<br />
agencies, a major contribution to the about-to-bc-formed<br />
Devolopment Bank for Asia. In these and other ways, Australia<br />
looms fairly large in the eyes of the people of these<br />
countries, the more so because so frequently our assistance<br />
is related to personalities who go there to do a job for<br />
Australia and it is quite heart-warming to find how well<br />
they are received, what a splendid impression they make.<br />
I don't know if any of you saw a documentary recently on<br />
Cambodia in w hich a motor repair shop run by a couple of<br />
Australians was one of the popul: ar features of the industrial<br />
life of the place. They had been given a mass of buses of<br />
various kinds from various countries. You know, the large<br />
volume of aid from countries like Russia, the United States<br />
and elsewhere. But nobody knew how to make the buses run<br />
if anything went wrong with them and our boys have been<br />
training people there and doing a very good job and in the<br />
process apparently making a lot of friends for Australia.<br />
When the Prime Minister . f Thailand ,; as here, he was telling<br />
me of the technical training school that we have established<br />
in his country, designed for peopo. L" g. oing into the Services,<br />
but has become so -wll and favourably knovnthat apparently<br />
employers bombard the place and popleo who are being trained<br />
to lure them away before they -ver got to the army, but at<br />
least the economy of the country derives some benefit from<br />
this. W1ell, I think that is about all.<br />
Good luck, Sir' </p>
