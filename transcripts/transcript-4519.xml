FOR PRESS 18 OCTOBER 1977<br />
ADDRESS TO THE SYMPOSIUM OF ACADEMY OF TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES<br />
I would like to congratulate the Australian Academy of Technological<br />
Sciences on holding its first invitation symposium.<br />
The Academy' s inauguration in February 1976 was a significant<br />
step forward for Australian technology, bringg tchiiologists<br />
from all fields together at a time when the need for technological<br />
skills and the challenge to apply them is greater than ever before.<br />
The Academy of Technological Sciences, because of its membership,<br />
its stature and its aims has a major role in ensuring that<br />
sound judgement and foresight are corner-stones of technological<br />
activity. We look to you to alert the Government and the<br />
community to.. potentjal i -ti-es of technology and its pitfalls<br />
in sufficient time to enable us to make an effective response.<br />
This Symposium accords with the Academy's primary objective<br />
of promoting Australia's application of scientific knowledge<br />
to practical purposes, and providing a forum for advice and<br />
discussion from which both Government and community may benefit.<br />
I greatly welcome your decision to hold your first symposium on<br />
energy. Energy is one of our most basic resources. It enables<br />
materials to be transformed into the products upon which our culture<br />
and economy is based. There are few matters as crucial to<br />
Australia as the need to secure our future energy requirements.<br />
The jobs, the incomes, the wellbeing of all Australians depend<br />
in very large part on the capacity of technologists to respond<br />
to this need.<br />
Since coming to office we have set about building a national<br />
energy policy many measures have been taken and there are more<br />
to be taken. These measures are being integrated into a national<br />
energy policy, mainly through the work of the National Energy<br />
Advisory Committee, ASTEC and with the Statet through the<br />
Minerals and Energy Council.<br />
Measures we have taken include: foreign investment guidelines<br />
which ensure that the search for and recovery of our fossil resources<br />
is not hindered; the introduction and extension in time of a<br />
forty percent investment allowance; phasing out of coal export levy;<br />
extension of a significant range of income taxation incentives<br />
designed to offer assistance in the financing of mining projects; </p>
<p>development of a suitable crude oil pricing policy to encourage<br />
development of our known crude oil reserves and the exploration<br />
for more oil; the decision to go ahead with the mining, milling<br />
and export of uranium for peaceful purposes; the decision to<br />
permit the export of substantial quantities of from the<br />
North West ShelfJ, and other measures designed to ensure that this<br />
development will be economically feasible; a development of<br />
a nationwide cooperative energy conservation plan, particularly<br />
with respect to liquid fuels;* the development of a realistic national<br />
energy research and development programme; the development of plans<br />
and programmes to ensure self-sufficiency in liquid fuels.<br />
Four years ago, the OPEC countries increased the price of their oil.<br />
The result was the so-called energy crisis, which delivered a<br />
shock to the world, and particularly to western Europe and Japan<br />
which rely so heavily on imported oil. The crisis was also a<br />
warning that oil is a limited resource to be conserved not<br />
squandered. To an extent, Australia has been insulated from all-this. We are<br />
abundantly endowed with energy resources., particularly coal,<br />
uranium, and natural gas. Nevertheless, we . are dependent on<br />
imported crude oil and this dependence will increase, affecting<br />
our balance of payments and our standard of living. Although<br />
it is quite possible that by the late 1980' s Australia could be<br />
earning $ 1 billion from the sale of uranium we would be spending<br />
ttL ieS. that on 2urchasing increasingly expensive and ever<br />
larger quantities of crude;<br />
Our transport, and our defence system, are<br />
firmly based on oil fuels for which at present there are no<br />
ready substitutes.<br />
The long term availability of liquid fuel or an acceptable<br />
substitute is essential to our national independence and<br />
prosperity. One way of achieving this is to find more oil, on-shore<br />
and off-shore, and to conserve existing oil reserves, and Mr Anthony<br />
who will be speaking this evening, will be giving details of what<br />
the Government has done and intends to do about this problem.<br />
Another possible long term solution to the problems posed by<br />
dependence on imported oil is the large scale production in Australia<br />
of motor spirit from coal. The Commonwealth, New South Wales,<br />
and Victorian Governments in association with the Federal Republic<br />
of Germany and German industry have recently agreed to a<br />
joint study of the production of motor spirit from coal.<br />
At the same time, CSIRO is proceeding with. its work with other<br />
metuiods of liquefaction. Converting coal to liquids is costly to<br />
develop to the commercial stage and there are some important<br />
questions which need to be-answered: to what degree should the<br />
Commonwealth support one process or the other? To what degree<br />
should indigenous technology be favoured over foreign? </p>
<p>What are the relative social and environmental impacts of<br />
the various processes? Should we be seeking alternatives to<br />
the internal combustion engine rather than spending our limited<br />
capital on coal liquefaction?<br />
I have asked ASTEC to report to the Government on energy research<br />
and development, the first of NEAC's series of reports on energy<br />
to the Government has already been tabled in the Parliament<br />
and I would be very interested to know this Academy's views.<br />
The issues-are so complex that Governments need the best advice<br />
from several sources. We should be in a position to ensure<br />
that no part of the Commonwealth is disadvantaged by an energy<br />
shortage. One question which arises is whether more effective<br />
national energy and planning would achieve it. For example,<br />
would a more effective capacity to transfer energy from one state<br />
-to another have prevented extremist unionists in Victoria<br />
from holding that state to ransom?<br />
Many of you wear more than one hat and I am pleased to note that<br />
some members of this Academy are also members of ASTEC or the<br />
National Energy Advisory Committee. This means that there is<br />
communication at a very high level between technologists and<br />
scientists, between Government, academia and industry.<br />
We need this high level coordination to solve the problem of<br />
liquid fuels for transportation, and other crucial technological<br />
problems that nay -ari-se.<br />
It is generally accepted that the sun is the least polluting<br />
and exhaustible source of energy, whether it is direct sunlight<br />
or wind, waves or hydro. Except for hydro there is no ready,<br />
relatively cheap way of using the sun's energy to produce<br />
electricity as a prime source of power. There is, however,<br />
some interesting experimental work being undertaken throughout the<br />
world including Australia, on solar electricity.<br />
While we do have large supplies of low sulphur fuels, should we<br />
not as a technologically sophisticated nation be using our<br />
highly trained engineers and scientists to help find the best way of<br />
achieving solar electricity? In any case, should not Australia<br />
be advancing more rapidly the development of technology for export?<br />
Are we not exchanging German coal liquefaction technology for<br />
Australian resources but why not export Australian technology?<br />
Should not Australia be a society that produces new processes<br />
and products for export? This could assist our manufacturing.<br />
industry, allow full utilisation of the Australian workforce<br />
and enable us to compete more successfully on the world market.<br />
So what. is the best way toachieve innovation? How do we get that<br />
bright idea into the market place? To encourage and develop<br />
innovation in Australian technology is of fundamental importance.<br />
Potentially, Australia, with its highly trained manpower, its<br />
increasing cadre of scientists and engineers, its<br />
sophisticated technological base and abunda -nt natural resources<br />
has the capacity to be onie of the miost tccriiologica. iy el" Fective<br />
nations. / 4 </p>
<p>Are we lacking in drive and enthusiasm? Have we been too lucky<br />
too long? Are we too lethargic to utilise our capacities<br />
effectively? I know your Academy is very conscious of the<br />
technological challenges which face Australia and our capacity<br />
to meet them, and the Government is most receptive to the<br />
Academy's views about how to bring this about.<br />
The Fellowship comprises distinguished technologists in all<br />
major sectors of industry, foremost being your President with his<br />
long and distinguished career in the mining and manufacturing<br />
sectors. The Fellowship also comprises distinguished Government<br />
scientists, and scientists with extensive experience in advising<br />
Government on policies for the development of technology in Australia<br />
It is very encouraging to observe the growing cooperationii between<br />
those concerned with developing a coordinated and integrated<br />
effort to meet Australia's energy requirements. The manner in<br />
which this Symposium has been organised is a direct reflection<br />
of this.<br />
I look forward to the Academy playing a significant. role<br />
in Australia's future, and I hope you have the will and heart<br />
to play this role. You obviously have the necessary fellowship<br />
to do it. Mr President, I wish the Academy every success. </p>
