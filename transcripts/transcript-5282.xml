PRIME MINISTER FRIDAY, MARCH 1 1980<br />
from the Press Office -V<br />
SUMMARY OF NEWSVOICE CANC-R~ rAA<br />
LIBRARY J<br />
A". nass meeting of tanker drivers in Sydney this rxng ed to.<br />
end their strike from tomorrow, but in Melbourne mq be<br />
going back to their jobs until Monday. Despite the msaption of<br />
work, the issue of: secondary boycotts and Se ction 45D of the<br />
Trades Practices Act could lead to further industrial turmoil<br />
in the oil industry.<br />
Mr Varnum:<br />
We have stated our position in relation to secondary boycotts,<br />
and we have made it more clear today. We-have considered that the<br />
issue in relating to secondary boycotts, in fact, was secondary<br />
to this dispute. We believe that the first issue, in fact, and<br />
the only issue, has in fact been an industrial where the livelihood<br />
of our members has been threatened. The position in relation to<br />
secondary boycotts from our point of view indicates that it is<br />
an unjust, the ACTU is opposed to it, it has been exploited by<br />
an employer organisation who are hiding behind it so they can<br />
continue to employ or engage employees in inferior conditions<br />
as if they were engaged under the federal oil stores award.<br />
Question: is still before the court. What will happen if the union is<br />
fined?<br />
Mr Varnum:<br />
Well, our policy is quite strong in relation to that. We have resolved<br />
not to comply with any deci sions, orders or awards made by an civil<br />
courts on industrial issues. And tihe ACTU has a strong policy on it.<br />
We Isupport it. The NSW Labour Council, endorsed a similar policy last<br />
night, and that of course would have the full backing of this union,<br />
In Victoria, the petrol tanker drivers are going back on Monday,<br />
but the State Secretary of the TWU, Mr Davis, said it represented<br />
an uneasy peace. Mr Davris says he is not happy with the proposals<br />
accepted by the Sydney tanker drivers. Says his members are sick<br />
and tired of other people deliberately attacking them all the time.<br />
The Trades Hall Council in Victoria has decided to call a 24 hour<br />
public transport strike in its-campaign against the Workers'<br />
Compensation Act.' The strike is set for the 24th of March. The<br />
strike is intended to hurt employers in an effort to convince them<br />
to lobby the State government into , holding new talks which could<br />
result in a compromise. The Trades Hall believes the new act reduces<br />
the number of workers entitled to workers' compensation, while the<br />
State government says it will cut down on the number of false claims<br />
and increase benefits to genuine cases. / 2 </p>

Talks in Canberra aimed at finding a way to overcome bans on the<br />
move! ment of wool are still going on. The Prime Minister, Mr Fraser,<br />
and four government ministers, . are meeting with representatives of*<br />
the wool industry. Barry Cassidy reports: " The meeting has been<br />
going on in a crowded cabinet room here in Parliament House since<br />
10.15 this morning. As it became obvious it was going to be a long<br />
day, both the Prime Minister,' and Deputy, Mr Anthony cancelled<br />
afternoon engagements in Victoria. The only representative to emerge<br />
from the meeting so far has been the President of the National<br />
Farmers' Federation, Mr Don Eckersley. He left Parliament House<br />
for a quick trip to his office and he has since rejoined the talks.<br />
He, in a sense, inspired today's talks when he described the Government~ s<br />
role in the dispute so far, as spineless and timid. But, as he emerged<br />
today he was saying nothing, except that there might be a statement<br />
later on.. There are 16 representatives of the wool brokers at the<br />
meeting alone, an indication that strategy mapped out today could<br />
be binding on the industry when it goes into private conference<br />
in the Arbitration Commission in Melbourne tomorrow morning.<br />
Given that wool brokers have already made an offer, however small,<br />
to the striking storemen and packers, part of the reason for the<br />
length of the talks could be due to disagreement among brokers<br />
as to whether-they should tough it out or go to the Commission<br />
tomorrow with a new p roposal."<br />
We have just heard from our Canberra office that the meeting could<br />
last for another two hours.<br />
There were . furcther moves of support for the reorganisation of the<br />
ALP in Queensland today. The Leader of the State Parliamentary<br />
Labor Party, Mr Ed Casey, announced he was joining the interim<br />
administrative committee being set up by the national executive.<br />
Report:" It was all smiles and good will when Mr Casey handed his<br />
letter of acceptance to the Federal ALP Secretary, Mr David Coombe<br />
at Brisbane airport today. Casey told; . reporters he had accepted the<br />
battle was lost and vowed he would concentrate on uniting the party<br />
behing its new image. Mr Casey," I have s aid all along, and the<br />
Parliamentary Labor Party has also stated that there is only one<br />
Labor Party and that is the Australian Labor Party. Now, the Federal<br />
Executive has made a decision. Even though I was an opponent of the<br />
original suggestion , that there was any need for intervention in<br />
Queensland, that particular argumen t was lost a fortnight ago<br />
in Canberra." Mr Coombe praised Mr Casey and his Parliamentary<br />
colleagues for playing a constructive role in'the current transition<br />
in Queensland, and he forecast an early end to the remaining<br />
resistance.* Mr Coombe, " I guess almost a week ago we thought that<br />
the transition was going to be a bit smoother than anybody expected.<br />
Now, we are faced with the reality that there will be a little more<br />
resistance, but I don't anticipate that that will last for long<br />
because what you now have in Queensland is an enormous enthusiasm<br />
with. the democratisation with the party here. Party members and<br />
supporters overwhelmingly are expressing the des; ire to get on with<br />
the job of making Ed Casey the Premier of this State, and : 0ill Hayden'<br />
the Prime Minister of Australia." t<br />
TAAsays bookings ' for.-their super apex discount airfares have<br />
increased by nearly. 500% since the scheme was extended to a year<br />
round basis recently. International Sales Manager interviewed.<br />
An Aboriginal Lands Council Leader who came from north western<br />
Australia to a demonstration today in Pitt Street, Sydney, warned<br />
that several families could die if sacred land in the Kimberleyswas<br />
drilled for oil. Interview with leader../ </p>
<p>Sir Charles Court today made . a strong call for more Commonwealth<br />
road funds, and claimed the Federal Government was not fulfilling<br />
its responsibilties to the States. Sir Charles was speaking at an<br />
Australian Automobile Association symposium in Canberra. He said<br />
he supported calls by motoring associations for a large portion of<br />
the petroleum excise revenue to be redirected to road funding.<br />
The Australian and New Zealand governments have been asked to<br />
make firm commitments to closer long term economic ties. In<br />
a lengthy submission to both governments, the Australian New Zealand<br />
Businessmen's Council said it wanted all transTasman trade barriers<br />
to be eventually abolished. </p>
