FOR MEDIA JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AND THE PREMIER OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA<br />
The Commonwealth Government is to make a gift of<br />
$ 2 million to South Australia as a contribution to the<br />
State's Sesquicentennial celebrations in 1986.<br />
The grant follows discussions between the Prime Minister<br />
and the Premier. It is in line with the Commonwealth<br />
Government's firm support for the Sesquicentennial<br />
celebrations in Western Australia which were celebrated in<br />
1979 and those in Victoria which are to be celebrated<br />
in 1984-85<br />
The Commonwealth wishes the grant to be associated with<br />
a suitable project which would be identified as its gift<br />
to the people of South Australia. Further discussions are<br />
to be held to determine the nature of the project.<br />
