AS DELIVERED<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA MONDAY, 8 MARCH 1982<br />
LOWE CAMPAIGN DINNER<br />
It is certainly a very pleasant thing to come to Lowe to support<br />
Phillip and Pat Taylor in this by-election because I suppose<br />
there are candidates, but Phillip Taylor, if you were trying to<br />
write out a copy-book candidate for Lowe, I think you would<br />
have taken Phillip Taylor's specification and that would have been<br />
it. I said a little earlier this afternoon that Phillip<br />
Taylor, the electors of Lowe are going to be getting two for one,<br />
because Pat has been working very hard with him and obviously<br />
Lowe is going to be very well represented after Saturday.<br />
I would like to thank Dr Stuart Smith, the club president for<br />
allowing us to use his premises tonight, thank you very much.<br />
I would like to speak to you for a few moments about a number<br />
of issues of current importance to Australia. We live in a<br />
changing world and while our policy objectives remain firm and<br />
resolute, quite obviously the settings of policy, the approaches<br />
that we might need to adopt to achieve our objectives change<br />
as circumstances change.<br />
We need to remember the Liberal Party since its foundation has<br />
been instrumental in bringing to Australians and Australian<br />
families the great advances which have been achieved in<br />
living standards and in our way of life over the last 30 years.<br />
Those of us who do remember the ordinary average house of the<br />
average family in the late 1940s and the kind of house people<br />
expect and so very often have taken for granted in recent times,<br />
the difference in that house, the difference in its equipment<br />
is just a mark and one mark of the changed living standards<br />
of Australian families. Living standards in real terms have<br />
doubled over these times and things that were the exception<br />
are very much regarded as the norm and something that all<br />
people come to acc6pt and this again represents the march of<br />
Australia over those three decades.<br />
It has always been the Liberal<br />
objective to keep building Australia up for the future, to bring<br />
growth and investment to Australia, to encourage private enterprise<br />
and initiative, because this is the only sure foundation of<br />
continuing prosperity for ourselves and our children.<br />
This is the great legacy of the Liberal Party to Australia over<br />
the last 30 years and I would believe for the next 30 years.<br />
The Liberal Party is the only nation-wide party committed to<br />
the well-being of all Australians. There was that famous / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
occasion going back when a Labor Prime Mlinister, it was John<br />
Curtin or Ben Chifley, was in New Zealand during a christmas<br />
period, so he sent a telegram to all the Labor people in Australia,<br />
Christmas greetings. Well an Australian Prime Minister is meant<br />
to represent all Australians and not just people of one kind.<br />
Our Party has a profound responsibility to keep advancing<br />
the policies on which Australia's continued prosperity depends.<br />
That does not mean taking an easy part, it does not mean coming<br />
out with a basket full of goodies to try and buy support in a byelection<br />
for Lowe. It means explaining, doing what we believe<br />
to be right, doing what we believe will really lead to an<br />
improvement in the lives of Australians from one corner of this<br />
country to another. That sometimes means taking difficult<br />
decisions, but if people know politicians at all, they ought<br />
to know they don't like taking difficult decisions for the<br />
fun of it. We would all much sooner take the nice, easy pleasant<br />
decisions, but if the country is to be well-governed that is not<br />
always the way of it.<br />
It is important that we realise that the future cannot be<br />
taken for granted, important that we carry tcr* the community the<br />
message that Liberal policies alone will carry Australia strongly<br />
through the difficulties and uncertain conditions overseas<br />
which inevitably affect us.<br />
On the international front, there are obvious threats and<br />
tensions, we see them not only in Poland and Afghanistan, but<br />
also in Communist influence in Latin America and Africa.-New<br />
threats can emerge with almost no notice and in these circumstances,<br />
the Australian Covernment plainly needs to be giving its support<br />
to our allies, and taking its share of the responsibilities<br />
which arise under the western alliance.<br />
In economic terms, the world scene is equally disturbing and we<br />
do the Australian people no service at all by trying to turn our<br />
back upon it, by trying to pretend that the world scene is other<br />
than it in fact is. World trade has remained sluggish. Predicte<br />
revivals, predicted at almost regular periods of six months<br />
over the last six years have not taken place. Commodity prices<br />
have fallen substantially in the last year and this of course,<br />
inevitably hurts Australia. Wle are a great trading nation and<br />
we live by our capacity to get access to and sell to the markets<br />
of the world. There is little or no growth in the economies<br />
of many of our trading partners and the unemployment situation<br />
in some of those countries, is vastly disturbing. In Germany<br />
it is over in the United States approaching in the<br />
United Kingdom approaching 12%. But we think unemployment is<br />
bad here, try and imagine what it is like in those countries.<br />
And by the second half of this year, total unemployment in<br />
the developed ( OECD) countries is expected to rise to a<br />
massive total of 28 million people..<br />
These difficulties overseas are not new, indeed Australia, has<br />
through the determined application of policies, through<br />
the energy initiative of Australians and Australian enterprise,<br />
managed to swim against the adverse world tide for a number of<br />
years. We have problems, and I don't try to suggest that there<br />
are not. But if you take two examples in the United States,<br />
four years ago their motor industry was producing 15 million / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
automobiles, this year they are going to produce 8 million if<br />
they are lucky. Imagine what that means to unemployment in<br />
Detroit arx the motor industry throughout the United States<br />
and unemployment of a kind that Australia certainly has not<br />
known for decades and maybe not even in the 1930s.<br />
If you take the home building industry, where we know there are<br />
some problems and our minds are being addressed to those probelms<br />
at the moment, in the United States home starts are running at<br />
bout 40% what they were 2 years ago. What is it down here,<br />
or 12% and we recognise the nature of the problem, we believe<br />
it is significant for us. But would our reaction be if we had<br />
a problem of the kind there is is in the United States right<br />
at this moment.<br />
Australia has been growing economically at more than twice the<br />
average rate of other advanced western countries over the last<br />
few years. This year international organisations predict that<br />
Australia will grow at three times the rate of those countries<br />
and that of course, means better living standards for Australian<br />
families and that is what it is all about, not some statistic<br />
on the board, but how it translates and the kind of lives<br />
that Australians can lead in all parts of this country-and in the<br />
kinds of opportunities that we are able to create for young<br />
Australians.<br />
Business investment in Australia in the last financial year<br />
had its highest rate of increase for 30 years, and a further<br />
substantial increase is expected this financial year.. This not<br />
only reflects the confidence of investors in Australia's<br />
future, it will also'provide the underpinning for improvements<br />
in living standards in years ahead. Of course, again, this is<br />
what it is all about. I think sometimes people believe that<br />
we want business investment for the sake of business investment.<br />
I don't think businessmen believe that that is the end objective,<br />
it is what you are enabled to do with that investment once it<br />
is in place. It does translate into more wealth, more opportunities.<br />
better living standards, more jobs, for Australians. But without<br />
the strongly based business investment in many different<br />
industries, primary, secondary, and mining. Without that the<br />
opportunities ahead of us are going to be much less than they<br />
can be and will be under our policies.<br />
Real incomes have risen substantially over the last 18 months<br />
and I think this is not really adequately understood. In the<br />
last financial yeat;' very nearly $ 3 billion and after tax,<br />
after the terrible taxman, not before the taxman and that is<br />
quite a lot in anyone's terms was added to real household<br />
disposable incomes, representing a real increase in the standards<br />
of life of Australian families. Whatever figures are used, that<br />
plain, basic fact cannot got be around. Putting it in another<br />
way, in the two years to the September quarter average weekly<br />
earnings have increased by over $ 13 a week in real terms. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
We seek higher real wages through higher production. That is the<br />
way to improve living standards right around this country. We seek<br />
higher employment through investment in the private sector, and<br />
under our policies over 380,000 new jobs were created in the<br />
three years to January. Compare that with what has happened<br />
in the United States, what is happening in Britain, what is<br />
happening in Germany, what is happening in France. Name any<br />
other country where private secotr employment has been growing<br />
as strongly as that over recent years. I suggest you will<br />
have to look very long and very hard and Australia is virtually<br />
leading the band in relation to employment growth. Australia's success since<br />
we came to office shows thatour-. approach works, and this is why,<br />
in a deteriorating world situation, it is more important<br />
than ever that we maintain the overall thrust? of our approach,<br />
while remaining flexible to changing circumstances.<br />
What a contrast there is between what we have achieved, the<br />
way we have built Australia up, and the way that Labor's<br />
irresponsible policies between 1972 and 1975 drove the economy<br />
into the ground and destroyed confidence and the incentive to<br />
invest.' This is a country where we want to build and expand our population<br />
and after the war there began a great migration program and one<br />
of the greatest achievements of Mr Whitlam and Labor-of those<br />
years and of Mr Hayden who was his Treasurer, one of the greatest<br />
achievements was to establish the one year in 1975 in which more<br />
Australians left this country than came to this country. That<br />
is how people thought of the Labor Government after 2 to 3 years.<br />
They just did not want to be here any more and they were leaving<br />
and of course in the years since the-migration programme has been<br />
built again and the country is growing strongly-as a result of<br />
migration. We have been building this country and we are<br />
determined to keep on doing justthat.<br />
It is plainly vital in the present situation that nothing should<br />
happen in Australia that weakens our competitive position in<br />
world markets, or for that matter in our own domestic-market<br />
because with recession or even depression, quite obviously with<br />
12% unemployment, it is not surprising if Britain gets 6%<br />
of wage settlements, their industries will be becoming more<br />
competitive and we will have to make sure that we can match<br />
that competition. In the present circumstances, excessive wage demands,<br />
and especially demands for a further general wage increase at this<br />
time, are certainly against the interests of wage earners and<br />
indeed, against the'-interests of all Australians.<br />
It is also important to avoid damage to our competitive position<br />
and our reputation as a reliable supplier in world markets<br />
which are threatened by strikes and industrial disruptions.<br />
How often have we heard over the last several months, I am sorry<br />
I cannot deliver those goods at the moment because the container<br />
is still on the wharves. I called this Wran's navy the other day.<br />
I was told I should have called it Nifty's navy, or Nev' s navy<br />
or something, and I think it is all the same thing. I thought<br />
there was one purpose to which he could put those ships. They<br />
have probably all got generators. Well you got that message quite<br />
quickly, but I think the Parliamentary Oposition should ask him if<br />
it is true that he has bought 50 miles of underwater cables<br />
for taking all this Dower, so that at least the ships can have<br />
their generators running, in case nothing else can run in NSWI. </p>
<p>The high level of strikes in recent times has not only put at<br />
risk our position and our reputation in world markets, it has<br />
caused massive inconvenience and discomfort to average Australians<br />
and especially in this State as you well know. It has destroyed<br />
job prospects for a number of young people.<br />
In the face of this industrial situation, the Government<br />
is bringing forward a number of key legislative intiatives<br />
and they will be introduced into the Federal Parliament in a very<br />
few weeks. We are going to provide employers with'automatic<br />
right of stand-downof workers who cannot be employed because<br />
others are striking. We well know what the position. There hs<br />
been a provision in the Arbitration Act and the C&amp; A Act, but<br />
employers who did not have that right of stand-down written<br />
into their award probably had to argue beyond the length of<br />
the dispute to get it and some time ago we gave the Commonwealth<br />
that right in relation to our employees. We have used it on<br />
a number of occasions and we have used it successfully on a<br />
number of occasions so that is not a shot in the dark, it is<br />
a proven measure and I believe it wilo equalise opportunities<br />
and equalise bargaining positions between management and labour<br />
and that certainly needs doing.<br />
Also of course, that legislation will encourage the development<br />
of industry unions and seek to protect the right of employees<br />
through voluntary unionism and preference to unions and<br />
mofifications to those present aspects of the law. We are also<br />
acting in co-operation with the states in relation to aspects<br />
of demarcation disputes and here we are looking at the<br />
possibility of establishing a special panel or a division of the<br />
Arbitration Act, but backed by powers, backed by legally<br />
enforcable powers if other innocent parties are hurt as a result<br />
of demarcation and that is being closely examined by the states<br />
and we are looking for a report for the Premiers' Conference<br />
in June. The waterfront is forth most in our discussions<br />
with the states because they are heavily involved. They run<br />
ports and harbours and to solve the problems we are facing in<br />
that area, we need not only the cooperation of the industry,<br />
but the co-operation of state governments also.<br />
Labor always claims to have a special relationship with the<br />
trade union movement. The words that I have got down here<br />
say that the facts tell a different story, but in fact,<br />
they do have a special relationship with the trade union<br />
movement and we really need tounderstand that absolutely.<br />
It is a relationsh4p in which the politicians who depend<br />
upon trade unions for their money are subservient to the trade<br />
union movement and the trade union movement expects the politicians<br />
to do what they, the trade unions want in the interests of<br />
militant trade union leaders and that is the special relationship<br />
of the Australian Labor Party with the trade unions.<br />
There was a comment by Mr Wran the other day which can be<br />
paraphrased as saying well I have been nice to the union<br />
movement, they should be nice to me. They have not been nice<br />
to him or nice to the people of NSW and legislating to give<br />
into the union movement is not to way to establish industrial<br />
peace. / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
There was a time when the Labor Party had an unprecedented<br />
opportunity to establish industrial pea ' ce. They ahd a Prime<br />
Minister, Mr Whitlam and then they had two Mr Hawkes. One<br />
as President of the Labor Party and one as President of the<br />
Australian Council of Trade Unions. Now who could possibly,<br />
Mr Hawke being as good as he obviously is, surely could have<br />
established industrial peace even if he was only in one of those<br />
positions. Being in both of those positions, he should have<br />
been able to guarantee industrial peace for all time..<br />
Now, manufacturers, industrialists, commercial people here<br />
will know what happened in those days. Bad as industrial<br />
relations were in the last part of last year, bad as they have<br />
been in this state over the last months whatever they were<br />
much worse when you had Mr Whitlam and Mr Hawke and Mr Hawke in<br />
a record 6 6 million working days were lost in one year<br />
alone. That again, is an example of the special relationship<br />
which Labor had with the trade union movement. All you have seen<br />
in NSW is that same special relationship translated into the<br />
state arena. Even with recent high levels of strike activity,<br />
there is nothing that approaches that Whitlam record of 1974/ 5.<br />
In NSW Mr Wran has demonstrated that he is unable to solve strikes<br />
and none of you will forget recent battles to find food and<br />
petrol, or the'lack of trains and buses, and all those ships<br />
anchored out to sea. Power, that is just a question of<br />
legislating to give power workers reduced working hours, of<br />
making commitments to'the whole state that would not lead to<br />
blackouts, would not increased to increase costs, trying<br />
to hide it by cutting down on maintenance, so 3 out of 4 Lydell<br />
generators are out of business and 50 people have had to come<br />
out of Britain to rewind them. That is going to be a long<br />
job and you probably have noticed that daylight saving is<br />
continuing in this state a month longer than it should have<br />
and a month longer than in Victoria and that is because Mr Wran<br />
cannot produce the power that is necessary. If somebody is<br />
going into the candle business, but watch out Lindsay Thompson<br />
is hooking up more and more Igenerating capacity in Victoria,<br />
1,400 million megawatts hooked up in the last 12. months* in<br />
Victoria, the largest increase in the states grid at any<br />
12 month period and that is why a lot power. is coming up from<br />
Victoria at the present time. No doubt Victoria will continue<br />
to do that and do everything it can to help NSW.<br />
I would like to very briefly refer one or two other issues which<br />
I think are on peoples' minds. Home ownership which is an<br />
objective for which the Liberal Party has always worked and<br />
will work. In 1950 home ownership in Australia was about<br />
It has built up to around 70% under Liberal policy. We are<br />
now in a higher interest rate environment. Past policies<br />
are I think unlikely to work adequately in this environment,<br />
but we want to make quite certain that when policy changed<br />
that they aregoingto be adequate, they aregoing to be appropriate,<br />
they are going to keep home ownership within the reach of<br />
average Australian families. / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
Because these are fundamental matters and these are important<br />
matters and they involve significant institutions in this<br />
country, some under state legislation, some under Commonwealth.<br />
The matters obviously need to be thought through very carefully<br />
and not rushed into the public light just to see some other<br />
kind of political timetable. The purpose is to get the policies<br />
right and once we have done that and feel ourselves in that<br />
position a statement will be made about it.<br />
I think probably as a resultof-the last few days, the question<br />
of pension eligibility has been adequately dealt with, but<br />
there are plans within the Government, within Senator Chaney's<br />
provence or no proposals coming forward now or in the budget<br />
context to alter the eligibility provisions in a way which<br />
would put pensioners at a disability. I was asked on one<br />
occasion, would I guarantee that there will be no changes in<br />
the next budget and I said no. I would guarantee that there<br />
would be no changes because that would rule out changes for<br />
the-better. Senator Chaney will be bringing some matters<br />
before us in the budget discussions where he knows there is<br />
some general concern about the inadequacy of one or two<br />
provisions. I cannot give any commitment, but these matters<br />
are obviously very seriously going-to be discussed and the<br />
Liberal Party has done what it can to make sure that the<br />
letter from me has been circulated to I think all households<br />
in Lowe to make sure that the current position is understood.<br />
I am sorry if some elderly people who were dependent upon<br />
pensions and benefits had been disturbed by someof the public<br />
debate that ha s gone on. I think the political process should<br />
owe those people better than causing them concern in the<br />
pursuit of political objectives.<br />
Saturday's by-election there is no doubt that Phillip Taylor<br />
is the outstanding candidate and the race is not yet finished,<br />
it may be getting into the home straight and that is when<br />
that extra energy, that extra skill, extra determination is<br />
needed to make sure that the votes are there for Phillip<br />
Taylor when Saturday comes around and when voting stops on<br />
Saturday. So much depends on the energy, the efforts and<br />
the enthusiasm of local people. One of the things that gives<br />
me enormous confidence in this by-election is the enthusiasm,<br />
not just of the candidate, candidates are always enthusiastic,<br />
buthe enthusiasm of people around Phillip Taylor, the Party<br />
workers right out in the branches, enthusiasm from people here,<br />
people I have met during the course of the day and the othe-r<br />
occasions when I hc~ ive been in Lowe. That enthusiasm is good,<br />
that enthusiasm is infectious. It is that kind of confidence<br />
that persuades people who might be wondering one way or the<br />
other what to do, to say right, I should got with Phillip Taylor<br />
and the liberals.<br />
So, the more people you can speak to between now and Sd~ turday<br />
the more people you can impress with Phillip Taylor's qualities,<br />
capacity to represent the people and the more people that you<br />
can persuade that this Government is here to serve all the<br />
people of Australia and we are going to continue to do just that<br />
to the very best of our ability, then the more votes you will<br />
have for hillip Taylor and the more certain the result will be,<br />
and the better the Liberal victory will be.<br />
