<p>Australian singer-songwriter Gotye has created Australian music history at the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, winning three awards, including for Best Record for his hit song Somebody That I Used to Know featuring Kimbra.</p>
<p>Gotye, real name Wouter (Wally) De Backer, is the first Australian to win multiple Grammys for the same release and only the second to win Best Record after Olivia Newton-John with â€˜I Honestly Love You' in 1975.</p>
<p>His album Making Mirrors took home the award for Best Alternative Music Album, while single Somebody That I Used to Know featuring Kimbra, won Best Record and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.</p>
<p>After taking Australia by storm in 2011, the Federal Government provided Gotye with a $10,000 Australia Council grant to showcase his talents at the CMJ Music Marathon in New York.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Arts Minister Simon Crean congratulated Gotye on his Grammy wins, as recognition of the overwhelming success and popularity of his winning single and album.</p>
<p>Gotye is an outstanding example of the quality of the artistic talent in Australia today and highlights the need for continued investment in young artists and musicians.</p>
<p>In recent years he has achieved much-deserved global recognition for his work, with Somebody That I Used to Know going platinum in Australia and the US, and achieving number one status in more than 18 countries.</p>
<p>At home he was recognised with six ARIA Awards in 2011.</p>
<p>Gotye will land in Canberra on Friday to join Minister Crean and officially open the Fractured Heart interactive sculpture at the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia.</p>
<p>The event brings together school students to discuss film and music in a virtual roundtable using high-speed broadband.</p>
<p>Gotye will also launch Fractured Heart which he created with arts collective illuminart for his 2011 ARIA Awards performance of Somebody That I Used to Know.</p>
<p>Fractured Heartis on long-term loan to the National Film and Sound Archive.</p>
