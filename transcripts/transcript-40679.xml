    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today I have asked the  Secretary of my Department of Prime Minister &amp; Cabinet for advice in  relation to the Statement of Ministerial Standards relating to travel claims  made by the Minister for Health, Aged Care and Sport, the Hon Sussan Ley MP. </p>
<p>
  The Secretary will  thoroughly investigate the travel claims and the Minister has assured me that  she will promptly provide all information and assistance sought by the  Secretary for the purpose of this investigation.</p>
<p>
  Australians expect the  Government to deal with these serious matters very thoroughly and in accordance  with the Statement of Ministerial Standards.</p>
<p>
  I expect the highest  standards from my Ministers in all aspects of their conduct, and especially the  expenditure of public money. </p>
<p>
  The Minister has agreed to  stand aside without ministerial pay until this investigation is completed by  the Secretary.</p>
<p>
  I have asked Senator the  Honourable Arthur Sinodinos AO to act as Minister for Health and Aged Care, and  Minister for Sport. </p>
