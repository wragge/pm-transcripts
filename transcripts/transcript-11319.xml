<p>To my friend and colleague Richard Court, to Mr Peter Middleton, my</p>
<p> other state and federal parliamentary colleagues, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>As always it's a huge delight to be in Western Australia. And as always</p>
<p> as Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, I acknowledge</p>
<p> very genuinely the immense contribution, particularly at this time,</p>
<p> because of the importance of export income to Australia, I acknowledge</p>
<p> the tremendous contribution of the State of Western Australia to Australia's</p>
<p> aggregate national wealth. And I particularly acknowledge the leadership</p>
<p> over decades that has been displayed by coalition governments in relation</p>
<p> to the development of the resource sector of Western Australia. And</p>
<p> the announcement to which Richard referred a few moments ago is yet</p>
<p> the latest in a long list of resource projects which if they had not</p>
<p> been developed and there had not been the visionary leadership in</p>
<p> this state on our side of politics to develop, the Australian nation</p>
<p> today would be the poorer and all of its citizens would be more vulnerable</p>
<p> to the uncertainties of a hostile global economy.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen there are a number of reasons why it's always</p>
<p> a delight to be in Western Australia and why it's important as Prime</p>
<p> Minister of the entire country that one regularly visits every part</p>
<p> of the Commonwealth. One of the reasons of course as many of you will</p>
<p> remember is that my predecessor systematically insulted the State</p>
<p> of Western Australia by going for a period of I think of almost twelve</p>
<p> months between visits. And one of the things that I resolved to do</p>
<p> when I became Prime Minister was to visit this State on a very regular</p>
<p> basis to meet the business community, to hear their concerns, to take</p>
<p> their advice - or at least listen to it - and sometimes to take it.</p>
<p> And to meet the people of Western Australia. And also if I had any</p>
<p> spare time to do the odd bit of campaigning for my federal colleagues</p>
<p> who hold such a high proportion of the seats in this State.</p>
<p>I want today to say something about the economic fundamentals of Australia.</p>
<p> For reasons you will understand I am not going to explore future levels</p>
<p> of anything. But I am going to say something about the fundamentals</p>
<p> of the Australian economy because it's very important we understand</p>
<p> how strong our economy really is. And when I make the claim and when</p>
<p> Peter Costello makes the claim that our economic foundations are stronger</p>
<p> now than they have been for twenty five years that is no idle piece</p>
<p> of political rhetoric.</p>
<p>We do have the lowest inflation rate in the western world. We do have</p>
<p> a strong level of business investment. We do have a situation where,</p>
<p> having inherited a budget deficit courtesy of Mr Beazley of $10.5billion,</p>
<p> in just two years in three Budgets we have turned that into a surplus</p>
<p> of $2.7billion. And I take the opportunity of congratulating Peter</p>
<p> Costello as my Treasurer for the excellent job that he's done in the</p>
<p> economic management of Australia.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen some people at the moment are making comparisons</p>
<p> between Australia now and Australia in 1986 when my predecessor as</p>
<p> Prime Minister, then as Treasurer, made that chance remark from the</p>
<p> kitchen somewhere in Victoria when he was talking on the telephone</p>
<p> to John Laws, it was later elevated into a very carefully designed,</p>
<p> politically shrewd remark - in fact it was an off the cuff observation</p>
<p> - about Australia becoming a banana republic. Now I think it's worth</p>
<p> me running through a few comparisons between Australia then and Australia</p>
<p> now. And I think it's very relevant to the economic debate which is</p>
<p> taking place at present. In mid 1986 our inflation rate was 8.8%,</p>
<p> our underlying inflation rate is now 1.5% and the headline inflation</p>
<p> rate is the remarkable minus at .2%. The current account deficit is</p>
<p> forecast now to be 5.25% of GDP - it was well above 6.5% in the mid</p>
<p> 1980s. In the mid 1980s we had a budget deficit of 2% of GDP, we now</p>
<p> have a surplus of 0.5% of GDP. Our debt servicing ratio - a very very</p>
<p> important measure of long term economic strength internationally -</p>
<p> our debt servicing ratio was 15.3% in the mid 1980s - it is now 10.8%.</p>
<p> And our terms of trade in 1998 are significantly better than what</p>
<p> they were in the mid 1980s.</p>
<p>Now I mention those figures ladies and gentlemen not to burden you</p>
<p> with a lot of statistics but merely to make the observation that the</p>
<p> underlying strengths of the Australian economy now are the soundest</p>
<p> that they have been for a very long period of time and they are infinitely</p>
<p> more sound and more durable and more beckoning to the rest of the</p>
<p> world than what they were in the mid 1980s. It is obvious that if</p>
<p> we had not taken the measures we took when we came to office in March</p>
<p> of 1996, the Australian economy now would have been infinitely more</p>
<p> at risk than it is. And I do invite you for a moment to contemplate</p>
<p> what would have happened to economic management in this country if</p>
<p> we had not taken the measures that we took in 1996.</p>
<p>Can you imagine where we would be now if we had persisted with running</p>
<p> a budget deficit of $10.5billion a year, if we had not tackled the</p>
<p> accumulated debt of $95-100billion a year. Can you imagine where we</p>
<p> would be if we had to set out to reform our industrial relations system,</p>
<p> that if we had pretended that the Beazley/Keating approach of constantly</p>
<p> running up debt was the only way forward for Australia. And in view</p>
<p> of everything that has happened, particularly in the Asia Pacific</p>
<p> Region, I can't stress too strongly how weakened and vulnerable and</p>
<p> enfeebled the Australian economy would have been under that kind of</p>
<p> leadership and indeed how much stronger and better placed it is under</p>
<p> the sort of leadership that it's been given over the past two and</p>
<p> a quarter years.</p>
<p>And of course in that context one has to contemplate the prospect</p>
<p> of handing over the management of the Australian economy to the treasuryship</p>
<p> of Gareth Evans. Of handing over the management of the Australian</p>
<p> economy to people who fought tooth and nail every measure that my</p>
<p> Government took to restore the strength of the Australian economy</p>
<p> after it was elected to office. Not only did our Labor predecessors</p>
<p> create the problem and leave it behind for us to fix, but they set</p>
<p> about systematically trying to stop us fixing the problem. Because</p>
<p> if you go through the records of the current Parliament, you will</p>
<p> find that virtually every single measure that we took to get the budget</p>
<p> into surplus was in fact fought by the Australian Labor Party and</p>
<p> if they had had their way they would have perpetuated the economic</p>
<p> legacy that they bequeathed to us in March of 1996.</p>
<p>Now I mention these things ladies and gentlemen because in the nature</p>
<p> of political combat people are going to be making judgements about</p>
<p> economic performance over the next few months. Of course we have an</p>
<p> election in this country sometime between now and when the election</p>
<p> is constitutionally due. Now I hope all the ladies and gentlemen of</p>
<p> the press got that because that's the story out of today. We will</p>
<p> eventually have an election. When that is of course is something that</p>
<p> is yet to be resolved. But it is important, as we draw close to that</p>
<p> election whenever it is, that we do remember what the situation was</p>
<p> in March of 1996, we contemplate what my Government has done to turn</p>
<p> that situation around and we also properly ask the question, what</p>
<p> would have happened if the former Government had stayed in office</p>
<p> and what might happen if it were returned to office at the next election.</p>
<p> Labor would be a huge economic risk. It's track record demonstrates</p>
<p> that and nothing which is being said in the two and a quarter years</p>
<p> that we have been in Government alters my view on that and I notice</p>
<p> that Mr Beazley today said that he had been Prime Minister over the</p>
<p> last couple of years unemployment would have been down to 6%. It's</p>
<p> funny that in the time that he had a go he got a post-Depression level</p>
<p> of 11.2% and at average 8.7% over the whole time that his party was</p>
<p> in Government.</p>
<p>But ladies and gentlemen, having said something about the fundamentals</p>
<p> of the Australian economy I want to narrow my focus of my speech to</p>
<p> two very important issues. And one of those is the issue of taxation</p>
<p> reform. We need self evidently as a nation to build our competitiveness</p>
<p> to the maximum extent possible. The past few weeks, the past few days,</p>
<p> the past few months, have driven home like perhaps no other set of</p>
<p> circumstances have driven home the reality that we live in a globalised</p>
<p> economy. Some of us might wish it otherwise. Some of us might like</p>
<p> to believe you could turn the clock back and you could return to a</p>
<p> nostalgic era when we weren't in a global economy. Whether we like</p>
<p> it or not that is just not possible and in order for this country</p>
<p> to survive and to prosper and to build the living standards of Australians</p>
<p> all over our continent what we have to do above everything else is</p>
<p> to be competitive. And every single measure that my Government has</p>
<p> taken over the past two and a quarter years has been designed to build</p>
<p> the strengths of the Australian economy and to improve its competitiveness.</p>
<p> That is why we set about curing a budget deficit. That is why we have</p>
<p> set about reforming the industrial relations system. But there is</p>
<p> one great untouched area of economic reform which is crying aloud</p>
<p> for attention. It is crying aloud for attention like no other area</p>
<p> of economic reform and that is the overwhelming need to reform Australia's</p>
<p> increasingly outdated and old fashioned taxation system. This is a</p>
<p> cause that I have spoken about on many occasions in the past in the</p>
<p> various positions I have held other than that of Prime Minister. It's</p>
<p> got a lot of form, it's got a lot of track record and it's got a lot</p>
<p> of history - the taxation debate in this country. It was attempted</p>
<p> in the early 1980s by the then Treasurer in the Fraser Government</p>
<p> and he was unsuccessful. It was attempted by the then Treasurer in</p>
<p> the Hawke Labor Government and he was also unsuccessful. It was attempted</p>
<p> by John Hewson as Leader of the Coalition in 1993 and it was also</p>
<p> unsuccessful so far as the electorate was concerned. Now I guess with</p>
<p> that sort of track record the hypothetical man from Mars would say:</p>
<p> 'why on earth would anybody be stupid enough to attempt it again?'.</p>
<p> Now that's not a bad question - on the surface. Well let me examine</p>
<p> it for a moment. Let me put to you very seriously that if you care</p>
<p> about the future of this country and if you care about its future</p>
<p> economic security and competitiveness, this is really the last great</p>
<p> opportunity, perhaps in the political and business experience of most</p>
<p> in this room to achieve taxation reform.</p>
<p>We have a rather rigid political system at the moment where it's every</p>
<p> difficult for one side of politics to get control of both Houses of</p>
<p> Parliament. In fact that hasn't been the case since the middle of</p>
<p> 1981 and the prospect of that changing under the current electoral</p>
<p> system is just about zero. Now some people say to me "oh, John,</p>
<p> forget about this taxation reform, what you ought to do is to go the</p>
<p> election on your policies on your record, talk a bit about Labor say</p>
<p> how bad they are and invite the public to put you back and if anybody</p>
<p> says anything to you about taxation promise them a meeting."</p>
<p> Now that of course is what Bob Hawke did in 1984. But ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p> I can't do that and what's more I won't do that and the reason that</p>
<p> I can't and won't do that is that the Australian public would treat</p>
<p> it with justifiable contempt.</p>
<p>They would say that this man and his Treasurer have gone around the</p>
<p> country over the past few months and told us that taxation reform</p>
<p> was necessary and desirable and now when they get a bit close to the</p>
<p> event and the heat is on they go to water. But there's another reason</p>
<p> why you can't solve it by having a meeting and that is that there's</p>
<p> absolutely no prospect that you'd get agreement at the meeting. At</p>
<p> the end of the day governments are elected to make decisions, they</p>
<p> are elected to govern, they are elected to give a lead on fundamental</p>
<p> political and economic reform. And what is more if we did have a meeting</p>
<p> and we came up with some mish-mash out of that meeting we'd then have</p>
<p> to have an election because there is no way that the Opposition parties</p>
<p> in the Senate would vote in favour of the proposal that might come</p>
<p> out of that meeting.</p>
<p>So however you look at it, politically, economically and strategically?</p>
<p> The imperative is that we present to the Australian people - as we</p>
<p> will - a comprehensive taxation reform plan before the election. Now</p>
<p> I know it is difficult and I know there will be a scare campaign and</p>
<p> I know that Kim Beazley, despite the fact that he wholeheartedly supported</p>
<p> Paul Keating's 12.5 consumption tax in 1986 and Gareth Evans threw</p>
<p> down his glasses and his papers after two days of discussion and said</p>
<p> that nobody had been able to punch a hole in the Keating idea in 1986.</p>
<p> Despite all of that, they will campaign with all the vigour at their</p>
<p> disposal in a negative, despoiling fashion to stop the cause of tax</p>
<p> reform. And Peter Costello and I and our colleagues will need all</p>
<p> of your help and all of your goodwill and all of your support and</p>
<p> all of your commitment to win that great debate. And I don't underestimate</p>
<p> the battle that lies ahead but there is really no alternative. If</p>
<p> you are to have a decent taxation system in this country, if we are</p>
<p> to break out of the unfairness and the uncompetitiveness of the present</p>
<p> system there is really no other moment and there is no other way.</p>
<p> However you look at it, putting it off is not going to solve the problem</p>
<p> and therefore it is absolutely essential that we embark upon the course</p>
<p> to which we are committed. And I believe that if you appeal to the</p>
<p> Australian people in the right way and if you fulfil two very important</p>
<p> criteria in that appeal then you will be able to win support for something</p>
<p> as fundamental as taxation reform.</p>
<p>There are two things that we have to do above all else. We have to</p>
<p> persuade the Australian people that delivering a different taxation</p>
<p> system is in the national interest. It is not enough to say it's in</p>
<p> the interest of the business community or it is in the interest of</p>
<p> families, important though those groups are. It's not enough to say</p>
<p> it is in the interest of the farmers or the city people or whatever.</p>
<p> What we have to do is to demonstrate that Australia will be a better</p>
<p> country economically, a fairer country economically and a more competitive</p>
<p> country economically with a new and fairer and better taxation system.</p>
<p> Because at the end of the day Australians are great patriots, they</p>
<p> may understate their patriotism. They may not be as demonstrable as</p>
<p> Americans or others but deep down all Australians wherever they live</p>
<p> worry about the reputation of this country, worry about the sort of</p>
<p> future which is going to be left to their children and grandchildren.</p>
<p> And they worry about the strength of the Australian economy around</p>
<p> the world.</p>
<p>So if we can pitch our campaign, which we definitely will, towards</p>
<p> the cause of delivering a taxation system which is fairer and better</p>
<p> in the national interest then that will win wide appeal. The other</p>
<p> thing we need to do is that we have to demonstrate that the changes</p>
<p> we have in mind are fair and they are fair to all sections of the</p>
<p> community. That they are not a giveaway to the rich but equally they</p>
<p> are changes that recognise the importance of the wealth generating</p>
<p> and the wealth creating sector of the Australian community. And they</p>
<p> must be reforms and changes that protect the vulnerable and the weak</p>
<p> and the poor within our community because none of us, particularly</p>
<p> those charged with political responsibility, should ever forget the</p>
<p> fact that there are genuinely vulnerable and weak and poor people</p>
<p> economically within our community. And that has always been a very</p>
<p> important part of the Liberal legacy to care for those people as part</p>
<p> of our broader policies of national and economic development. Taxation</p>
<p> reform is very dear to my heart. I know it is very dear to the heart</p>
<p> of the Treasurer and it is very dear to the heart of many people on</p>
<p> our side of politics. We've had the courage to tackle the deficit</p>
<p> problem. We've had the courage to tackle industrial relations. We've</p>
<p> had the courage to tackle many other issues that have come our way</p>
<p> over the last two and a quarter years. And I regard tackling taxation</p>
<p> reform as the next logical step of strengthening and buttressing the</p>
<p> Australian economy in an increasingly uncertain world. And what is</p>
<p> happening in the Asia Pacific region and what is happening globally</p>
<p> at the present time makes it more, not less necessary, to pursue the</p>
<p> cause of taxation reform. Don't be misguided by anybody running around</p>
<p> an saying: 'oh there is a bit of difficulty on the world currency</p>
<p> markets, there's a bit of turmoil, there is a bit of a meltdown in</p>
<p> the Asia Pacific region, therefore in these uncertain times you ought</p>
<p> to put taxation reform on the shelf.' That would be completely the</p>
<p> wrong thing to do. It is precisely at a time like this that a Government</p>
<p> should retain its nerve and its determination to pursue the next logical</p>
<p> element of economic reform and that is taxation reform.</p>
<p>My friends, the last specific issue that I want to address is one</p>
<p> that was referred to by Richard Court and that is the issue of native</p>
<p> title reform. I am very aware that the Native Title Act in its present</p>
<p> form has a more adverse effect on the people of Western Australia</p>
<p> than any other State in the Commonwealth. I am very aware of the clog</p>
<p> that it represents on the development of the resource industry in</p>
<p> this State. And I am very aware of the loss of wealth that has already</p>
<p> occurred as a result of the negative operation of that legislation.</p>
<p> That is why we set about after the Wik decision to create a balanced</p>
<p> plan, a fair plan that provided the basis of lasting and effective</p>
<p> reform to the Native Title Act. And one of the most aggravating and</p>
<p> unreasonable and inaccurate claims that is made about the Government's</p>
<p> Native Title Bill is that it represents in some way a sell-out of</p>
<p> the interests of all people in the Australian community other than</p>
<p> the farmers and the miners - it doesn't.</p>
<p>It does, of course, represent a proper accommodation of the interests</p>
<p> of the farming and mining communities, not only in Western Australia</p>
<p> but throughout the whole of the country. But it does take into account</p>
<p> the proper and legitimate interests of the indigenous community. And</p>
<p> it is the product of a genuine attempt on my part, helped by a number</p>
<p> of my colleagues, to build a compromise which respected the basic</p>
<p> principle of the Mabo decision but also gives security, both in terms</p>
<p> of title and process to the farming and mining communities. And the</p>
<p> proposition that the only way you can settle the issue is for us to</p>
<p> further compromise completely ignores the fact that in arriving at</p>
<p> the position where we are now, we have already compromised a great</p>
<p> deal in the eyes of many people within the Australian community. And</p>
<p> I say that very deliberately at present because there is some debate</p>
<p> about whether or not now might not be the time to see whether the</p>
<p> minor parties and others in the Senate would again address the native</p>
<p> title issue.</p>
<p>Well, can I say that if I got an assurance that the Native Title Bill</p>
<p> was going to be passed through the Senate if it were presented again</p>
<p> in its present form, of course I would present it again. But until</p>
<p> I receive any such assurance, the idea that the Government should</p>
<p> further compromise is absolutely ridiculous. I went through months</p>
<p> of difficult negotiation with States, with the mining and the farming</p>
<p> communities and with representatives of Australia's indigenous people.</p>
<p> And I arrived at a situation which was not entirely satisfactory to</p>
<p> any one group but did represent a decent and honourable compromise</p>
<p> and it's that legislation that is now lying twice rejected by the</p>
<p> Federal Senate. And it's that legislation which constitutes the only</p>
<p> proper basis on which we can satisfactorily resolve this issue. And</p>
<p> this proposition that by some way brokering a compromise of the Native</p>
<p> Title legislation will shut people out of potential election to the</p>
<p> Federal Senate is completely misguided. Indeed, if the Liberal and</p>
<p> National parties were to negotiate away their position on this issue,</p>
<p> that would provide a very fertile breeding ground for more rabid propositions</p>
<p> that would say to Australia's rural communities, those parties that</p>
<p> have traditionally represented your interests are no longer willing</p>
<p> to do so.</p>
<p>So I want to make it very clear to you, I make it very clear in the</p>
<p> presence of your Premier, that I was very serious when I said in May</p>
<p> of last year, when with Tim Fischer I met a group of pastoralists</p>
<p> and debated this issue at Longreach in Queensland that having arrived</p>
<p> at a commitment to my 10 point plan, we were not only determined to</p>
<p> put that into legislation but we were determined to pursue that legislation</p>
<p> until it was approved in accordance with the Constitutional processes</p>
<p> of the Australian Parliament.</p>
<p>Can I finally say to all of you, ladies and gentlemen, that when I</p>
<p> was elected as Prime Minister I made what I regarded then and I still</p>
<p> regard as the most important commitment that any Prime Minister on</p>
<p> any side of politics can make to the people who choose to elect you</p>
<p> and that is, I said, that I would endeavour to the best of my ability</p>
<p> to govern for all Australians. That although we campaign on our own</p>
<p> political platforms when we are given office we have a responsibility</p>
<p> to govern for the entire community. And that commitment I have taken</p>
<p> seriously and I will continue to take seriously whilever the Australian</p>
<p> people choose to have me as their Prime Minister. But I also take</p>
<p> very seriously the links that my Party and the National Party have</p>
<p> with the business community of Australia. We, of course, are not owned</p>
<p> by the business community in the way that the Labor Party is owned</p>
<p> by the trade union movement. There are occasions when the business</p>
<p> community disagrees and disagrees very strongly with measures that</p>
<p> we have taken. And in my dealings in the last 24 years I can recall</p>
<p> occasions when the business community has been critical of decisions</p>
<p> taken by the Liberal Party and I am sure that will be the case in</p>
<p> the future. But we do share a broad spectrum of agreement on a large</p>
<p> number of issues. We do believe that the wealth generating sector</p>
<p> of the Australian economy is crucial. We do believe that the bulk</p>
<p> of the jobs in this country come from the wealth generating sector.</p>
<p> We believe in decent levels of profit. We believe in decent compassionate</p>
<p> capitalism. We believe in attracting business investment. We believe</p>
<p> in the minimum levels of Government intervention consistent with maintaining</p>
<p> a proper social security safety net. And we believe very much that</p>
<p> this country has to play a very pro-active role both in terms of exports</p>
<p> and imports in the world economic environment. And over the last two</p>
<p> and a quarter years I have been very grateful to the advice and the</p>
<p> communication that I have received and had with the business community</p>
<p> all over Australia and not least here in Perth.</p>
<p>And I want to say how important it is that the linkages established</p>
<p> by such groups as the 500 Club not only be maintained but also developed.</p>
<p> Being in Government in modern times is an extremely challenging task.</p>
<p> No one country in the world is the complete master of its own economic</p>
<p> destiny. Even a nation as powerful as that of the United States must</p>
<p> live by the constraints of a global economy. And we see in relation</p>
<p> to Japan, the second most powerful economy in the world, a very powerful</p>
<p> living out of that proposition that we are all part of the global</p>
<p> economy now and whether we like it or not we can't escape it. And</p>
<p> it is, therefore, very important in the process of governing, the</p>
<p> Prime Ministers and governments that hold the essential values of</p>
<p> private enterprise of investment and all the things that flow from</p>
<p> it maintain their close links with the business community. So I thank</p>
<p> you for the support you have given. I thank you for the contribution</p>
<p> that you have made to building a better Australia. I am an optimist</p>
<p> about our country's future. I think we have the prospect before us</p>
<p> of entering the next century</p>
