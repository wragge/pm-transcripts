PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, HMY BRITANNIA, LIMASSOL, FRID) AY, 22 OCTOBER 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Was it a friendly meeting?<br />
PM: I've never had anything but the most friendly and cordial meetings with<br />
the Queen ever. As you know I hold her n the highest regard and I<br />
always enjoy her company as we all had the privilege of enjoying her<br />
last night.<br />
J: What did you make of her speech last night?<br />
PM: I thought it was an entertaining speech, but it also shows I think, that<br />
Her Majesty is herself making her own commentary on the changes<br />
which have occurred in the Commonwealth in the last 40 years, as she<br />
did last night. And also making everyone aiware that she understands<br />
it is a continuing dynamic and that the cha3nge she has seen is only<br />
evidence of the fact that there will be more change and that she<br />
understands and can accommodate those changes.<br />
J: Do you see it as a public affirmation of your Balmoral discussions?<br />
PM: I thought in a sense she was as she authorised me to say there, she<br />
herself then was saying last night something similar. That is, countries<br />
have constitutional discussions, she wished the nation the best in<br />
those debates taking no particular side in them and saying that the<br />
monarchy has in respect of these things, the Constitutional Monarchy<br />
has a certain position, entirely certain of its position and that countries<br />
should in their own interests go and have these debates.<br />
J: Did those remarks give you encouragemrent for heading Australia<br />
towards a republic? </p>
<p>PM: It is not a matter of any encouragement, it is the Queen as<br />
Constitutional Monarch defining what she ; ees as changes or possible<br />
changes and drawing on the evidence of change over the 40 years of<br />
her realm. As she was saying, one wouldn't have believed in 1955 or<br />
1953 for instance that a CHOGM meeting would be here for instance<br />
in Cyprus. Or she said that Fiji wouldn't be here. She was making<br />
obvious the fact that a lot of changes have already occurred and some<br />
may still occur, that she understands these things.<br />
J: Prime Minister, do you get the feeling that she is comfortable with that<br />
process of change?<br />
PM: I'm not here to reveal any context of any disicussion I have had with the<br />
Queen, but to say that I think Her Majesty understands these historical<br />
changes probably better than any of us talking here at the moment.<br />
ends </p>
