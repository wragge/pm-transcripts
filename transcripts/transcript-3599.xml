Speech by the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany,<br />
Mr Helmut Schmidt, at a dinner in honour of the Prime Minister of<br />
Australia in Bonn on 17 January 1975<br />
Three years ago I was a guest of your country<br />
and I am therefore delighted to be able today to<br />
reciprocate your hospitality in our little capital.<br />
On that occasion in Australia I had talks with<br />
you as the Leader of your Party. You were still in<br />
opposition. We have had a number of talks in<br />
the last decade, some in Bonn. Today it is gratifying<br />
to renew and deepen our personal contacts,<br />
this time in your capacity as Prime Minister<br />
of Australia.<br />
Your visit to some degree is overshadowed by<br />
the catastrophe recently inflicted upon the<br />
people and the town of Port Darwin. Allow me<br />
once again to express my deep sympathy, Sir. Our two countries are separated by oceans and<br />
continents, yet they are closely and firmly<br />
linked by a network of relations and common<br />
basic political concepts: internally a democratic<br />
order based on the rule of law and a federal<br />
structure, externally the political and economic<br />
potential or our countries is aimed at international<br />
division of labour and aimed at cooperation.<br />
Under your leadership, Prime Minister,<br />
Australia is making intensive efforts to help<br />
resolve the world's political problems confronting<br />
us. You set an example of the attitude that is<br />
needed to secure humanity and justice in our<br />
time by using our common sense and by appreciating<br />
reality.<br />
Mr Whitlam with Mr Scheel, the President of the Federal Republic of Germany. </p>
<p>Your visit to our country comes at a time of<br />
change. The old international economic order<br />
has been called in question more and more. But<br />
we must find a relationship between the industrialised<br />
states and the countries of the third<br />
world and as well between the raw material<br />
countries, oil-exporting countries on the one<br />
hand, the industrial countries on the other. Also<br />
a new relationship between Europe and extra-<br />
European countries like yours and like, for<br />
instance, New Zealand, is to be established.*<br />
And there is no mistaking the fact that nations in<br />
their economic performance are becoming<br />
increasingly interdependent. Nobody can secure<br />
lasting advantages for himself or for his<br />
own national economy by taking unilateral<br />
measures or by embarking on mercantilistic<br />
autonomous economic policies.<br />
World economic problems are a central theme<br />
of our talks today. I would feel that in this very<br />
year of 1975 there is hardly any problem of<br />
such overriding importance in terms of foreign<br />
policy, in terms of world policy, as is the complex<br />
of economic problems in which we find<br />
ourselves entangled.<br />
The main prerequisite for restoring stability and<br />
achieving progress is, we feel, and I think I can<br />
say this not only for the German Government<br />
but also for the great mass of thinking people in<br />
our country, irrespective of their political lean<br />
ings, co-operation and partnership between the<br />
industrialised countries; between the producers<br />
and the consumers of oil, raw materials; between<br />
the third world and the industrialised<br />
world.<br />
The past few months, I might as well say the<br />
past few weeks, have shown that it is not<br />
impossible to find a basis for common action.'<br />
The danger of solutions to these problems being<br />
found in unilateral protectionist measures<br />
seems to be a little smaller now since everybody<br />
has recognised the negative effect they will<br />
have on the world economy and thereby on<br />
national economies and on the individual.<br />
Prime Minister, we have the impression that<br />
Australia has seized the opportunity of the<br />
present time and that Australia is making a contribution<br />
both in the Pacific and also on a worldwide<br />
basis which natural resources and the<br />
achievements of its people permit it to make. We welcome in particular the contribution<br />
which Australia is making in her own regions<br />
towards the development of neighbours in need<br />
of help in other Asian states. I also very warmly<br />
welcome your effort in strengthening<br />
European / Australian ties by your present tour<br />
of the Old Continent, and, of course, we very<br />
heartily welcome you on the soil of our country.<br />
The history of your country enables you to<br />
understand our European problems. I thank<br />
you, Mr Prime Minister, for this understanding,<br />
and I would like to endorse what you-at least<br />
by the reports I have seen-seem to have said at<br />
the beginning of the month here in Europe. You<br />
are reported to have said you believed the West<br />
would in general be much stronger, happier and<br />
more successful if Western countries cooperated<br />
with each other and that included cooperation<br />
between-I dare say-Great Britain<br />
and its neighbours on the Continent. In spite of<br />
all strains the spirit of European co-operation<br />
has so far withstood the tests.<br />
We have found our way to pragmatic solutions<br />
and have not capitulated in the face of problems.<br />
We will continue to intensify our political<br />
co-operation and proceed along the road to<br />
European integration.<br />
Prime Minister, we agree that the foreign policies<br />
of our two countries have one overriding<br />
aim, namely to safeguard peace. The Federal<br />
Republic of Germany on her part will continue<br />
the present policy of detente steadfastly and<br />
consistently. This policy seems to us to be the<br />
best way to achieve a stable peace in Europe<br />
and throughout the world in which the German<br />
people too can regain-even if we have a long<br />
way to go-can attain or regain their unity in<br />
free self-determination. Detente policies in the<br />
multilateral sphere are a necessary supplement<br />
to our bilateral efforts. We also know that the<br />
political solidarity and the defence potential of<br />
the West are indispensable prerequisites for any<br />
process of detente. We appreciate your coming<br />
here at a time of such crucial importance for<br />
both world peace and the world economy. Your<br />
visit marks an important phase of relations between<br />
our two countries, and I am confident<br />
that you take home the impression that<br />
German -Australian co-operation continues to<br />
develop on the basis of lasting friendship. </p>
<p>Speech by the Prime Minister of Australia at a luncheon given in his<br />
honour by the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany in<br />
Bonn on 17 January 1975<br />
I have been touched, Mr Chancellor, by the<br />
warm welcome and the generous hospitality<br />
you have extended to me and my party during<br />
our stay in the Federal Republic. My visit to<br />
Germany is the culmination of an extensive visit<br />
I have made in recent weeks to several countries<br />
of Europe. It is fitting that I should conclude my<br />
European tour in the nation that best symbolises<br />
two of the broad themes I have sought to<br />
develop and explore. The first of these is<br />
Australia's wish to strengthen her trade and<br />
economic links with the European community.<br />
This message has a special significance in Germany.<br />
As the richest and most powerful nation<br />
in Western Europe, you have a strong, and<br />
perhaps decisive, voice in shaping the future<br />
prosperity of Europe and the Western World.<br />
My second theme has been the interdependence<br />
of nations, the overriding need for cooperation<br />
and understanding in solving our<br />
common problems. No nation has set a better<br />
example in this than Germany, a vigorous and<br />
co-operative member of the European Community,<br />
and the nation whose wise and farsighted<br />
initiatives did much to set in train the<br />
great movement of detente, on which depend<br />
so much of the hopes of mankind for a better<br />
and more peaceful world.<br />
Germany, then, has a central and crucial role in<br />
the shaping of a more rational world order. I<br />
know you will accept the responsibilities for<br />
which your great economic and industrial<br />
strength have prepared you. The achievements<br />
of the German people in rebuilding their nation<br />
during the past thirty years have been an example,<br />
an inspiration, to the world. I believe<br />
Australia is well placed to work with you in<br />
strengthening the economic foundations of the<br />
Western Nations. We are both highly<br />
developed, highly industrialised countries.<br />
Australia is rich in resources and raw materials,<br />
and I have been at pains to stress, during my<br />
visit to Europe, our readiness to make these<br />
resources available on fair terms to the nations<br />
that need them. I repeat that assurance today. At the same time Australia needs Germany's<br />
exports and manufactured goods to develop her<br />
own industrial economy. We also need and<br />
welcome your capital investment.<br />
The interdependence of our two economies is a<br />
source of strength to both of us. It is equally<br />
important that we recognise and encourage the<br />
same interdependence among all nations.<br />
Economic co-operation must be thorough, it<br />
must be universal, if the world is to overcome<br />
the complex and daunting problems that confront<br />
it. In every Western country I have visited<br />
national leaders face the same problems of unemployment,<br />
inflation, energy shortages, social<br />
unrest and incipient recession. There has never<br />
been a time when international consultations<br />
and co-operation were more necessary. There<br />
has never been a time when generosity and farsightedness<br />
were more necessary There has<br />
never been a time when it was more important<br />
for nations to keep their nerve and keep their<br />
faith in calm and rational solutions. It is a<br />
crowded world. It is a complicated world. It is a<br />
dangerous world. Nothing will be gained if<br />
nations live for themselves. Nothing will be<br />
gained by the wealthier nations-like Germany,<br />
like Australia-if our policies on trade or<br />
resources or foreign aid fail to take account of<br />
the needs of less fortunate peoples.<br />
In particular, I believe there is scope for greater<br />
co-operation between producers and consumers<br />
of raw materials to build a better framework<br />
for the orderly and rational development of<br />
production and trade. There is a greater need for<br />
freer, more open trade policies among all<br />
nations. Australia in the past two years has<br />
sought to promote these conditions through her<br />
own policies. We warmly and wholeheartedly<br />
support the ideal of European unity and the<br />
spirit of international co-operation embodied in<br />
it. We applaud Germany's constructive and<br />
creative role in Europe. We seek to be a partner<br />
of a vigorous and outward-looking Europe-a<br />
Europe with the widest possible membership, a </p>
<p>Europe offering the widest and fullest access to<br />
its total market.<br />
During my visit to Europe I have sought the<br />
understanding of Australia's friends for the new<br />
independent role Australia is following in the<br />
world. I believe we have a rather special and<br />
fortunate place in international affairs. Relatively<br />
remote from the scenes of historic rivalries<br />
and conflicts, we are trying to see political questions<br />
objectively, free from the passions of<br />
alignment, though remaining loyal to our traditional<br />
alliances and staunch in our friendships.<br />
As major exporters of food, fibres and<br />
minerals, we have much in common with the<br />
developing countries. We share their concern to<br />
secure a just return for producers and stable<br />
terms of trade. We believe in the right of states<br />
to sovereignty over their natural resources.<br />
Yet, as an industrialised country, we understand<br />
the needs of the exporter of manufactured<br />
goods. We seek to play our full part in the main<br />
tenance of international peace and security.<br />
Like Germany we support the efforts of the<br />
United Nations in the pursuit of justice and<br />
world order. Guided in large measure by the<br />
Federal Republic's contribution towards the<br />
promotion of detente and the achievement of<br />
peace in Central Europe, Australia will cooperate<br />
towards the same end in the Indian<br />
Ocean and in our region of South-East Asia.<br />
Our common interest in peace and world security<br />
is inseparable from our common interest in<br />
stable economic growth and the rising prosperity<br />
of all nations.<br />
There are good reasons, Mr Chancellor, why<br />
Australians and Germans are well fitted to work<br />
together and develop their friendship. Our<br />
countries are both federations. We understand<br />
each other's problems of economic management,<br />
of federal -state co-operation, of regional<br />
development. Our bilateral trade is growing.<br />
Australian manufacturers exhibit more and<br />
more frequently in your remarkable trade fairs.<br />
The already close links between German and<br />
Australian industry will, I hope, be further<br />
promoted by an agreement on co-operation in<br />
science and technology. The flow of German<br />
migrants to Australia continues, though at the<br />
reduced level made necessary by the uncertainty<br />
of employment. I pay tribute here in your<br />
Federal Capital to the hundreds of thousands of German migrants who have helped to<br />
strengthen and diversify our cultural traditions;<br />
and develop our important industries. In recerN<br />
years the Stuttgart Ballet has come to Australial<br />
and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra has<br />
played in German cities. We want to increase<br />
the range and frequency of these cultural<br />
exchanges. Mr Chancellor, my visit to Germany is only the<br />
second which an Australian Prime Minister has<br />
paid to the Federal Republic. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
made a short, informal visit to your country in<br />
19g59. Another visit was overdue. I am grateful<br />
for the warmth and cordiality of our talks and for<br />
the frank understandings we have reached<br />
together. I have sought in recent weeks to dispel<br />
the impression-a common impression in Australia-<br />
that Europe no longer matters to<br />
Australia, that our interests, our destiny, lie exclusively<br />
in Asia and the nations to our north. All<br />
I have seen and heard convinces me that<br />
Australia's future and prosperity are<br />
inseparable from yours. The Common Market is<br />
our second largest trading partner. I shall leave<br />
Germany knowing that our two countries can<br />
make an important contribution together to the<br />
solution of our problems and the strengthening<br />
of our f riendsh ip.<br />
I shall leave Europe convinced that Australia can<br />
never turn aside from this ancient centre of<br />
power and ideas, that with reason and goodwill-<br />
and above all with peaceful co-operation<br />
-the nations of the West will triumph over their<br />
present difficulties and embark on a new phase<br />
of progress and enlightenment. 111 16/ 75-L R74/ 1 589 </p>
