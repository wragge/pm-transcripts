4AUSTRALIA L<br />
FOR MEDIA 5 August 1983<br />
The President of the Republic of Korea, Mr Chun Doo'Hwan will<br />
visit Australia on 16-20 October, 1983 at the invitation of the<br />
Governor-General. President Chun will be accompanied by his<br />
wife, Mrs Chun. President Chun will be the first Korean<br />
Head of State to visit Australia since President Park Chung<br />
Hee in 1968.<br />
President Chun's visit, which follows Mr Hayden's recent<br />
visit to the Republic of Korea, reflects the importance both<br />
Australia and the Republic of Korea attach to their relationship.<br />
I look forward to meeting President Chun in Canberra, and<br />
discussing with him a wide range of international regional<br />
and bilateral issues. The meetings and discussions will<br />
contribute to the strengthening of the links between our<br />
two countries.<br />
Relations between Australia and the Republic of Korea have<br />
grown very rapidly over recent years. Australia has of course<br />
always taken a close interest in Korean and regional security<br />
questions. More recently the two countries have developed<br />
a substantial, mutually beneficial and expanding economic<br />
relationship. President Chun's itinerary will include visits to Perth,<br />
Canberra and Sydney. Further details will be announced<br />
shortly. Senior Republic of Korea government Ministers, officials and<br />
business leaders will be travelling with the President and<br />
will hold discussions with their Australian counterparts. </p>
