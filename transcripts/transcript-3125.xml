MESSAGE FROM THE PRIME MINISTER TO THE PRIME<br />
MINISTER OF CANADA ON THE DEATH OF MR LESTER PEARSON<br />
Following the death of the former Prime Minister of Canada, the<br />
Right Honourable Lester B. Pearson the Prime Minister, Mr E. G. Whitlam,<br />
has sent the following message to Prime Minister Trudeau:-<br />
" I have learned with regret of the death of the Right<br />
Honourable Lester B. Pearson. Canada has lost a most distinguished<br />
citizen and statesman whose passing will be greatly mourned<br />
throughout the world.<br />
During his long public career Mr Pearson worked tirelessly<br />
in the cause of world peace. The award to him of the Nobel<br />
S Peace Prize was a richly deserved recognition of his unique<br />
contribution in this field. His efforts on behalf of the<br />
lesser developed nations were no less remarkable and afford<br />
an eloquent testimony of his deep and abiding interest in<br />
making the world a better place for his fellow men.<br />
I would like to extend on behalf of the Australian<br />
Government and people my sincere sympathy and condolences<br />
to Mr Pearson's widow and family in their bereavement."<br />
Mr Whitlam also sent a message of sympathy to Mrs Pearson on<br />
behalf of the Government and people of Australia. </p>
