    <content><![CDATA[<p>
I plan to pay a brief visit to the United Kingdom on 24-25 September for talks, principally on key international security issues.  This will follow my visit to Nigeria for the meeting of the Commonwealth troika on 23 September.<br />
In London, I will discuss with the British Prime Minister and Foreign Minister developments regarding Iraq, and initiatives under way in New York aimed at ensuring compliance with UN requirements for the permanent elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programmes.<br />
I will also take the opportunity to brief UK ministers on the outcome of the troika meeting on Zimbabwe.</p>
