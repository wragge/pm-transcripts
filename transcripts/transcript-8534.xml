PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />
INTERVIEW WITH STAN GRANT ' REAL LIFE', 3 JUNE 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
SG: Prime Minister, welcome.<br />
PM: Thank you Stan.<br />
SG: John Howard thrown out of Parliament today, but<br />
isn't-hiiessentially right, that politicians should<br />
stay out of the APPM issue?<br />
PM: He got thrown out for being duplicitous. He was<br />
telling us that we should not be involved in an<br />
industrial dispute while he was around the back door<br />
talking to the owners of the business to APPM.<br />
This is the sort of industrial mayhem that Dr Hewson<br />
and Mr Howard would give us if there industrial<br />
relations policy were to be the policy of the<br />
country. That is, the ' battle for Burnie', as it<br />
has been called, would be a feature of the<br />
Australian landscape.<br />
SG: But you could hardly say the policy at the moment is<br />
working. I mean the Industrial Relations Commission<br />
ordered the workers back and that's been ignored.<br />
PM: By the company doing Hewson and Howard's bidding in<br />
terms of their policy. This has been the quietest<br />
period in industrial relations probably in 20 years.<br />
Industria] di-pu-tes aie--a-fraction of what they were<br />
in the early 1980s and the Accord model, the<br />
consensus model has worked like a charm. These<br />
silly fellows want to wreck it all by refusing<br />
unions the right to talk to employers, only an<br />
ordinary worker they say can talk to the employer.<br />
What chance has one working person got with an<br />
employer? None.<br />
SG: It doesn't help Prime Minister does it if your own<br />
Minister, PeterCook, starts talking about blood on<br />
the streets tSouli7 dBoes it?<br />
PM: Well they have got picket lines, it's all because of<br />
this confrontationist approach. The truth is what's<br />
Dr Hewson got to present the Australian public with?<br />
A GST tax a 15 per cent tax, on their goods and<br />
services, their food and clothing and an industrial </p>
<p>relations policy which cancels federal awards,<br />
knocks of f their holiday pay, cuts their rates of<br />
pay and conditions and the only recourse they have<br />
is that they individually can negotiate with the<br />
company, not the union. This is what APPM is about.<br />
SG: On another issue Prime Minister, your failure to<br />
lodge a company fax return, a company return in<br />
time, that's not ideal is it? Shouldn't we expect a<br />
bit more from the Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Well that's right. It's a company information<br />
return and they should be on time. But as I made<br />
the point today Dr Hewson again, who has promised us<br />
supposedly a higher order politics in a day when the<br />
Government has just revolutionised television in<br />
this country and yesterday revolutioniseid the<br />
airlines system, he spent the night having a<br />
S9enator, senator Baume, up talking about my company<br />
return. And what did I find today? That Dr<br />
Hewson's company return was late for three<br />
consecutive years and so was Mr Reith's.<br />
SG: You're talking about your moves in policy though<br />
Sir, but today you were not talking about policy,<br />
you were more interested in attacking the man.<br />
PM: Come on you weren't there. The first question<br />
during Question Time I announced the Government's<br />
new revolutionary television policy to allow Pay TV,<br />
to allow all Australians a chance to pay andwia-tch<br />
blockbuster movies and sport, Hollywood and world<br />
movies the moment they are released on television.<br />
That change was announced today at Question Time and<br />
what did I do I got a question from Mr Peacock for<br />
Dr Hewson asking me about my company return and the<br />
questioner, Dr Hewson, has actually not put his in<br />
for three consecutive years.<br />
SG: Yes, but two wrongs don't make a right.<br />
PM: No, but the duplicity of him, the double standards,<br />
and the conceit of it is he has Senator Baume<br />
raising this lousy issue in the Senate last night,<br />
he has Mr Peacock do his dirty work today and what<br />
we find is on the very topic he's asking me his<br />
returns have been late for three years. Meanwhile,<br />
what was I doing last night? Putting together a new<br />
Pay TV policy for Australia.<br />
SG: On that issue of Pay TV, you announced it on Sunday,<br />
today there has been a big change to the policy that<br />
you announced on Sunday, making policy on the run is<br />
that the right sort<br />
PM: No, come on Stan. This is an area where there's<br />
been a policy mess for twenty years. What we saw<br />
today is a policy where we'll have a new entrant </p>
<p>into the media of Australia in Pay TV who does not<br />
belong to the newspaper groups, the television<br />
groups or the telecommunications group.<br />
SG: But clearly what you outlined on the weekend has<br />
been changed today.<br />
PM: It has changed today, but today is better. What I<br />
outlined on the weekend was a way where the<br />
television networks were to be included in the first<br />
round of the Pay TV satellite transmission company.<br />
It's much better with them out of it and them having<br />
the option of going 100 per cent into a network of<br />
their own, and that's what we came up with today.<br />
SG: The image here though Mr Keating, over the last<br />
couple of weeks you must have been squirming as you<br />
saw the Marshall Islands affair, Ros Kelly signing<br />
something that she hadn't even read.<br />
PM: We had a couple of bad weeks, but again look at the<br />
Government ' s recovery. Look at the vast change in<br />
airlines yesterday. Qgantas acquiring Australian<br />
Airlines and it being sol-d to the publric. Ansett<br />
becoming a duel domestic and international carrier,<br />
a total revolution in Australian air travel.<br />
SG: So as far as your concerned there wasn't so much<br />
damage done over the last couple of weeks, it seemed<br />
to be going from one bungle to the next.<br />
PM: You know the policy here, the dogs, may bark, but the<br />
caravan moves on and the caravan moved on to a<br />
revolution in air travel and, really, a revolution<br />
in television. I mean we've adopted today a policy<br />
which will allow fibre optic cable, cable television<br />
as well as satellite pay television, to be<br />
distributed to the people of Australia. That will<br />
mean that Australians over time, will not only be<br />
able to see blockbuster movies at home, sport, news,<br />
but as well as that they will be able to operate the<br />
system back. They will be able to deal with their<br />
bank at home, they will be able to order their<br />
shopping from home, they'll be able to get<br />
information through the fibre optic cable. All of<br />
those technological possibilities were opened up<br />
today in this policy while reserving for the<br />
satellite pay television, a system to give<br />
Australians good entertainment without having the<br />
networks involved.<br />
SG: Mr Keating, just finally, the polls, is the gap too<br />
great?<br />
PM: No, not at all. You'll notice also yesterday Stan,<br />
again on the substance, the National Accounts came<br />
out. The economy has now been growing for three<br />
consecutive quarters. </p>
<p>SG: Sure, but it's a matter isn't it of getting that<br />
across to the people. Now the polls.<br />
PM: Yes, but they see the news. Don't underestimate<br />
them, they see the news, they hear programs like<br />
this, they know the economy is back into recovery.<br />
SG: And you see the polls.<br />
PM: And as that changes it will change the political<br />
perception. As Dr Hewson is sort of playing the man<br />
and not the ball, taking our political system down<br />
to worry about company returns and the rest instead<br />
of worrying about the big issues like technical and<br />
further education, like television, like airlines,<br />
like the economy, as he traffics in that low order<br />
politics you'll see the polls switch around.<br />
SG: Prime Minister, it hardly seems like you to be<br />
complaining about playing the man?<br />
PM: Well who asked me today the lousy, dirty question?<br />
Mr Peacock.<br />
SG: Who called Dr Hewson a fraud and a cheat?<br />
PM: I did. Do you know why? Because he was telling<br />
Australians in the House of Representatives that<br />
politicians shouldn't be in an industrial dispute<br />
when he's been talking to them privately. What else<br />
would you call him?<br />
SG: So as far as your concerned you're prepared to get<br />
out of the gutter?<br />
PM: That's not the gutter. Use your sense Stan, that's<br />
not the gutter. When a major political leader says<br />
to its constituency, the public, we believe that the<br />
political party shouldn't be involved in this<br />
dispute and yet we catch them having dealt with the<br />
principles of the APPM company in secret, don't you<br />
think that is sort of double standard and duplicity<br />
should be referred to by me? Of course it should.<br />
That's not the gutter, that's just simply making<br />
clear. But who asked the lousy personal question,<br />
as always the Liberal Party. In this case Dr<br />
Hewson didn't have the decency to do it himself, he<br />
had Mr Peacock do it. And then what do I find on<br />
the very same issue he hasn't put his company<br />
returns in for three years, well.<br />
SG: OK Prime Minister we'll leave it there. Thank you<br />
very much for your time.<br />
PM: Good Stan.<br />
