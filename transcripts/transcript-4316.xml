MESSAGE TO THE KING OF JORDAN<br />
I was shocked and saddened to learn of the death of Queen<br />
Alia in the tragic accident. She won many hearts during<br />
her visit to Australia with her grace and charm.<br />
I convey to you and your. family and to the people of<br />
Jordan the deepest sympathy of myself and my wife,<br />
and the heartfelt condolence of the Australian Government<br />
and people. </p>
