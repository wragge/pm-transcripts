    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce today that the Government will provide $50,000 to the Dorset Council to undertake a Business Development Plan for the tourist project, "The Trail of the Tin Dragon."</p>
<p>On the successful completion of the Business Plan, and subject to the project being viable, the Government is prepared to provide up to $1.7 million towards the development of the project.</p>
<p>The Trail of the Tin Dragon will celebrate the history of tin mining and the contributions of Chinese tin miners to the cultural, industrial and economic development of Tasmania's North-East.</p>
<p>The Trail of the Tin Dragon project is an excellent example of the type of innovative projects envisioned by the Government's $235 million Tourism White Paper.</p>
<p>  The Trail of the Tin Dragon will provide new and exciting tourist attractions that create important economic and job opportunities for Tasmania.</p>
<p>  This project is an excellent example of strategic planning by a regional area to diversify its economic base.  It will encourage Australian and international tourists alike to travel to regional Australia and to learn more about our heritage and cultural links to countries like China.</p>
<p>I congratulate Liberal Candidate for Bass, Michael Ferguson and the Mayor of Dorset Council, Peter Partridge for their advocacy and support of this proposal.  </p>
