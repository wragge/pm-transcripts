SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER Emag8.0pm C<br />
THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
AT THE OPENING OF THE<br />
WOMEN AND POLITICS CONFERENCE<br />
CANBERRA, 31 AUGUST 1975<br />
For most of this country's history women have<br />
lived without visible political power; they have been excluded<br />
from almost all levels of government in our society. The<br />
momentous decisions of war and peace, of finance and technology,<br />
as well as the everyday decisions which affect how all people live,<br />
have been made by a minority of individuals who happen to be<br />
born white and male. Women whether they be conservative, liberal<br />
or radical should be fully represented in the political power<br />
structure simply as a matter of right: not just because they are<br />
women, but because they are capable human beings with skills,<br />
aiities and creativity from whom the world has much to gain.<br />
We all of us live in this man-made, man-defined<br />
and man-controlled world. But if women are to change it they<br />
need to understand the complex processes of this world. They<br />
need to understand how economic, political, educational and<br />
organisational power interacts with and affects their daily lives.<br />
Determination to have a say in matters affecting the lives of<br />
women is not sufficient. Women must learn how to make their words<br />
effective. Women must learn how to bring about those changes they<br />
want, be it in their own lives or in the institutions in our<br />
society that affect them.<br />
It was a genuine determination to bring true<br />
representative government to all levels of government in Australian<br />
society and to allow women full access to all those institutions<br />
whose decisions are of as much concern to them as to men that<br />
prompted the Australian Government to hold this conference. The<br />
aim of the conference is to understand the lessons that the past<br />
can teach us in this area, to bring about a greater awareness of<br />
the political processes and to increase the participation of<br />
women in political activities. It is, in other words, our<br />
intention to bring about, in the course of this conference, a<br />
greater understanding of the means by which women can participate<br />
in the making of political decisions and the difficulties that<br />
will confront them in so doing.<br />
Many of the women who have fought and worked so<br />
hard in the past, in the parliament, in the parties, in the<br />
trade unions and outside in the community are here with us tonight<br />
and during this conference. We have much to learn from them and<br />
are deeply grateful to them for being prepared to share their<br />
wisdom with us. We have also invited women from other countries to<br />
help us in this task that we have set ourselves. I take this<br />
opportunity to welcome these distinguished and outstanding guests<br />
both to this conference and to our country. It is a pleasure<br />
and an honour for us that you have accepted our invitation to<br />
attend. The claim that the rights of men and the rights of<br />
women are one and the same, particularly in the political arena,<br />
is a time-honoured one though, sadly, too often either disputed<br />
or dismissed. </p>
<p>one of its outstanding defenders was Mary<br />
Wolistonecraft who in 1792, 3 years after the outbreak of the<br />
French Revolution and 4 years after the establishment of the<br />
British colony in Australia, published her Vindication of the<br />
Rights of Women. Her theme is that women are first and foremost<br />
human beings, that the mind has no sex, and that society is<br />
wasting its assets if it retains women in the role of convenient<br />
domestic slaves and alluring mistresses, denies them economic<br />
independence and encourages them to be docile and attentive to<br />
their looks to the exclusion of all else.<br />
She claims that the full achievement of social<br />
equality will not come about until women begin to take an interest<br />
in politics and in particular in parliamentary representation.<br />
The Sydney suburb of Wollstonecraft is named after<br />
her nephew, Edward, who fled to Australia from the notoriety of<br />
his aunt, an unrepentant and outspoken unmarried mother.<br />
The fight for the right to vote and the right to<br />
sit in parliament left Australian women relatively untouched<br />
and unaware. In England the King and the Prime Minister could<br />
not even go to the races without facing a demonstration by<br />
suffragettes. In 1908 in Hyde Park, London, women gathered from<br />
all over the United Kingdom to listen to the preachers of the<br />
cause. the Times next day estimated that there were half a<br />
million people there. ( For comparison, even the great civil rights<br />
demonstration in Washington in the summer of 1963 at which Martin<br />
Luther King made his " I have a dream speech attracted fewer<br />
peo~ ple than this.) There was nothing like this in Australia although<br />
in Victoria a suffrage petition one mile long was collected by the<br />
women and refused lodgement by the parliament.<br />
The issue in Australia which in fact brought women<br />
into the political and social arena and forced them to become<br />
politically active was the anti-conscription campaign during the<br />
First World War. Adela Pankhurst, who had migrated to Australia<br />
some years earlier, fought, marched, and was imprisoned along<br />
with our own women over this issue. For the first time women<br />
were seen by governments, political parties, and trade unions,<br />
as a force to be contended with rather than mere political domestics:<br />
brewers of tea, bakers of cakes and very efficient raisF-rs of money.<br />
The dilemma is that women have actively sought<br />
election to our parliaments and have actively fought to have<br />
women's issues seriously discussed within them. Yet over the<br />
decades success at either of these endeavours has been at best<br />
only sporadic. The political activity of women began first with the<br />
establishment of women's unions in the 1880' s and 1890' s, in<br />
Victoria in the clothing trades, in Queensland amongst the women<br />
shearers and in South Australia as a direct protest against the<br />
sweatshop working conditions-of the majority of women workers.<br />
The first woman trade union organiser, Emma Miller, was appointed<br />
in Queensland in the 1890' s. Women's unions were seen as a<br />
necessary step in the fight to win economic equality and </p>
<p>3.<br />
subsequently political equality.<br />
Women were on the whole agreed, as Vida Goldstein<br />
herself said, that through not having women in parliament the<br />
energy and valuable time of individual women and women's organisation<br />
had to be spent on the often herculean task of educating members<br />
up to a point of seeing the injustices affecting women.<br />
Groups formed with the aim of increasing the<br />
poli , tical representation of women. At times these were affiliated<br />
to a political party as, for example, were the Women's Central<br />
Organisat * ing Committees of the A. L. P. and the Australian Women's<br />
National League, but time and time again women's groups such as<br />
the Australian Women's Party, the Women for Canberra Movement, the<br />
Women's non-Party League, the Women's Political Association and<br />
the Women's Electoral League prided themselves on their<br />
independence from the existing political parties.<br />
These groups supported women candidates in spite<br />
of the overwhelming historical evidence that few independents<br />
are ever elected to parliament and despite the knowledge that in<br />
the practical conduct of political life there is on the whole<br />
a limit to what an indpeendent parliamentarian can achieve. Doris<br />
Blackburn, the second woman to be elected to the House of<br />
Representatives, was one of the few independents to have ever<br />
sat in it. This is not to say that women have not stood for<br />
the Federal and State Parliaments. Indeed up until 1943 when<br />
the first women were elected to the Federal Parliament Dame Enid<br />
Lyons to the House of Representatives and Senator Dorothy Tangney to<br />
the! Senate at least 53 women had stood for the Federal Parliament.<br />
Of these, 33 stood as independents and 2 were sponsored by the<br />
Australian Women's Party. But during these 42 years only 7 women<br />
were pre-selected by a major party. The story was much the same<br />
or worse in the state parliaments. The first woman to be elected<br />
to any parliament in Australia was the Honourable Edith Cowan,<br />
who was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly in<br />
1921, the year after women were first given this right in Western<br />
Australia. She, along with Catherine Spence, who was one of<br />
Australia's greatest champions of the cause of proportional<br />
representation, has been honoured in our recently released set<br />
of stamps of famous women.<br />
Within the ranks of those women who havEi worked<br />
throughout the decades to bring about the, changes needed by<br />
women there was a similar division between those women who felt<br />
that women's issues were best served by remaining outside of party<br />
politics and those who insisted on the necessity of working from<br />
within the political parties. The first stance has been best articulated,<br />
perhaps, by Rose Scott, whose retirement message was: " Have<br />
friends in all parties, that is the only way to win anything..<br />
Once women go into party politics they become the catspaws of men.<br />
The women's and children's cause should stand alone until absolute<br />
equality is obtained." </p>
<p>As, however~ the women around Rose Scott increasingly<br />
involved themselves in issues relating to women and children they<br />
became more and more caught up in party politics. The Women's<br />
Labour Leagues and the Women's Liberal Leagues were formed. The<br />
same thing happened to Vida Goldstein in Victoria when, in 1903,<br />
Lilian Locke and many other women withdrew from-the Women's<br />
Political Association to organise the women's vote for the Labour<br />
Party. Once pre-selected or elected there still remains<br />
a host of problems which women face and which they no doubt will<br />
continue to face until a woman politician is as everyday a<br />
phenomenon as a man politician.<br />
Women campaigning for election in Australia have<br />
often found their male opponents only too willing to use slogans<br />
such as, " Do we have to suffer another term of ineffectual prattle,<br />
or do you want a strong man in Parliament?", or " I am just your<br />
man, and will answer you man to man." These examples are not drawn<br />
from the 1900' s but from the 1960' s.<br />
In 1959 when the first women were nominated for the<br />
South Australian Legislative Council, a writ was taken out to<br />
restrain the returning officer from accepting their nominations<br />
on the ground that the South Australian Constitution Act used male<br />
pronouns. Of course, it's only in 1975 that that particular legislative<br />
body has accepted " one man, one vote".<br />
Another insight can be gained from Dame Enid Lyons'<br />
autobiography: " Two months before the new baby was born I was<br />
asked to speak at the opening of the Federal election<br />
campaign. At five o'clock on the day of the meeting<br />
I was totally unprepared. I had had a particularly trying<br />
day, with no time to make a note or even to collect my<br />
thoughts. " And now, it was nearly the children's bedtime.<br />
I felt desperate. With the bath water running and the<br />
milk for the children's tea heating on the stove I<br />
sat down at the dining table with pencil and paper.<br />
" I was tired to death. The baby on my knee was<br />
crying with fatigue, the other children were quarrelling<br />
noisily. Suddenly I burst into tears. This was hot<br />
fair. No man was expected to endure such things. When<br />
Joe prepared a speech I silenced the whole house so that<br />
he could concentrate on his * task."<br />
It cannot be said, however, that women in politics<br />
have no sense of humour. In 1943 Mrs Jessie Street stood for<br />
the Labor Party against Mr Eric Harrison and Mr William Charles<br />
Wentworth IV. She deciddd to take advantage of her name: strips<br />
of paper were printed and pasted on the walls, coping stones and<br />
street signs throughout the electorate. Soon the most prestigious<br />
roads, avenues, lanes and cul-de-sacs in Australia all bore the<br />
name Jessie Street. But from the lessons and the fascination of the past<br />
we must turn to the present. </p>
<p>My government has long recognised that discrimination<br />
against women is incompatible with human dignity and the wellbeing<br />
of society. our policies and programs in this area have, to date,<br />
been based on two basic principles: justice and humaneness.<br />
The aim of these policies and programs has been to give women the<br />
pre-conditions necessary for them to be able freely to choose the<br />
lives they want to lead. To do this women must have the possibility<br />
of a-little peace of mind as well as the possibility of financial<br />
and emotional independence. It is only just and fair that women enjoy equal<br />
pay for work of equal value, access to training and retraining<br />
schemes, equal opportunities in recruitment and promotion and decent<br />
working places. It is also only just that women should not be<br />
expected to bear full responsibility for the rearing and care of<br />
our future generations. Many women will, of course, choose to<br />
accept the-brunt of this responsibility but for these women, as<br />
well as for those women who cannot or who are contributing to our<br />
society in other ways, there still remains the need for access<br />
to a wide range of services for their children.<br />
in order to correct these past injustices, to<br />
respond to the demand for equality, the government's actions<br />
have included the establishment of anti-discrimination committees<br />
in each State as well as at the national level, ratification of<br />
the 1953 United Nations Convention on the Political Rights of<br />
Women and the I. L. O. Equal Remune-ration Convention, 1951, and<br />
Discrimination ( Employment and Occupation) Convention, 1958,<br />
submissions to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for<br />
equal pay for work of equal value and an adult minimum wage and<br />
the establishment of a sub-committee of the Schools Commission to<br />
investigate and make recommendations on the education of girls<br />
and women. We have introduced a program of childhood services<br />
designed to respond to the needs of young children and their parents<br />
whether these needs are for occasional care, regular care,<br />
education, counselling, creative development, emergency care,<br />
before or after school care: or holiday care. For this financial<br />
year $ 74 million has been allocated to this program.<br />
In Australia more than in most countries decisions<br />
and advice on political matters have been made and given by statutory<br />
bodies and royal commissions. In 1948 the last Labor government<br />
amended the Broadcasting Act to require that at least one of the<br />
Australian Broadcasting Commissioners shall be a woman. My<br />
government has deliberately sought talented and qualified.<br />
women for appointment to such entities. For the first time, for<br />
example, women have been appointed to the Arbitration Commission,<br />
the Industries Assistance Commission formerly the Tariff Board),<br />
the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Wool<br />
Corporation, and women have been appointed from the outset to the new<br />
education commissions, Hospitals and Health Services commission,<br />
Children's Commission and Australia Council, Justice Elizabeth<br />
Evatt, who has been chairman of the Royal Commission into Human<br />
Relations, was last week appointed Chief Judge of the new<br />
Family Court of Australia. A woman is expected to be appointed as<br />
chairman of the Consumer Protection Authority which is about to be </p>
<p>-6<br />
established. In the 1940' s the Foreign Minister, Dr Evatt,<br />
ordained that one third of the diplomatic cadets should be<br />
recruited from women but that requirement was revoked by his<br />
successors. My government appointed the first career diplomatist<br />
as an ambassador and has permitted women diplomatists who marry to<br />
pursue their careers These posts are within the-gift of the government.<br />
The government, however, cannot appoint public servants other than<br />
heads of departments. Accordingly, the Royal Commission on<br />
Australian Government Administration, which includes a woman, is<br />
inquiring into the opportunities which must be given to women<br />
in the Public Service. It has also been of deep concern to us that we<br />
lessen the distress and suffering that women face and respond<br />
sensitively to social problems affecting them. We are concerned<br />
about the problems facing all women in Australia, be they young<br />
or old, Aboriginal or newcomers, married or unmarried, English<br />
speaking or non-English speaking.<br />
It is the second principle, that of humaneness,<br />
that has prompted us to fund women's refuges, women's health<br />
centres, rape crisis counselling centres, family planning centres<br />
and multi-purpose centres where the health, welfare, educational,<br />
training, workforce, legal, recreational and child-care needs of women<br />
can be met. We have removed the sales tax from the pill and for<br />
the first time in the history of Australia have recognised that<br />
supporting mothers form one of the largest groups below the<br />
poverty line and introduced a supporting mothers' benefit.<br />
The Royal Commission into Human Relationships has<br />
the task of informing and educating us about the extent and<br />
the effects of these social problems. It is an overwhelming task<br />
for ours is a society which is loath to admit that problems such<br />
as these even exist. Marriages do break up; women do die at the<br />
hands of back-yard abortionists; children are battered; people;<br />
particularly women, do live in extreme poverty; unwanted children<br />
are born; men and women do commit suicide; women are raped;<br />
children are homeless. Before we can act in this area we must<br />
know why all this is so and what can be done to change it.<br />
We have removed many areas of discrimination and<br />
injustice, but we feel very deeply that governments must take<br />
some responsibility in removing the cause of this discrimination,<br />
of these injustices, the Cause lies invariably in the deeply<br />
ingrained cultural assumption that every woman's primary role is<br />
that of daughter, wife, mother, mother-in-law, or grandmother;<br />
nurse, secretary, teacher or shop assistant: the deeply ingrainea<br />
assumption that women are here to serve or assist. The<br />
well-being of men and children within our society must not be<br />
at the expense of the wellbeing of their wives and mothers.<br />
For this is too high a price to pay. </p>
<p>-7<br />
Women are as diverse, as different from each<br />
other, as are men. We must create a society which acknowledges<br />
this. This is not to say that within that society women may not<br />
freely choose to be wives and mothers and teachers. It is<br />
impossible for us to foresee what such a society would look like.<br />
But it is to say that women must be allowed to develop their<br />
diverse and multi-faceted potential.<br />
International Women's Year has-~ given us an opportunity<br />
to focus on this aspect of our society. It is an opportunity to<br />
make explicit the attitudes which our society has about women,<br />
an opportunity to question and re-think the assumptions, beliefs,<br />
prejudices and opinions about women, their so-called " proper"<br />
roles and their capacities. Each woman and man in our society must<br />
become aware of these attitudes and myths, for it is these that are<br />
the root cause of s-o much of the distress and suffering<br />
experienced by women in our society today. To change these<br />
attitudes, to offer women new possibilities and new life patterns<br />
is our task for International Women's Year and beyond.<br />
To take just one area of concern to this conference there<br />
is a wealth of cliches oft repeated by politicians and researchers<br />
as to why women vote the way they do. Women, they say, are<br />
personality voters, that is they vote for the candidate with the<br />
sexy smile or the fatherly air. Women, they say, vote as their<br />
men tell them. Women, they say, are mindless voters. Women, they<br />
say, do not vote for women. Women, they say, are innately<br />
conservative voters. It is obvious that these " truisms" cannot<br />
all be true, and it may well be that none are. But it certainly<br />
is true that it is time that these assumptions and myths were<br />
questioned. The claim, for example, that women are conservative<br />
voters is often interpreted to mean that they are more likely<br />
than men to be conservative on policy issues. But gallup polls<br />
taken in Australia over the last couple of decades show that<br />
this is not true. Women hold much less conservative views on,<br />
for example, capital punishment or conscription, though they often<br />
hold more conservative views on issues such as legal reform,<br />
prostitution and the permissive society. Hence women's voting<br />
patterns cannot be the result of a general conservatism.<br />
It could rather be seen as a reaction to the sort of<br />
life that women lead, to their day to day experiences. The<br />
permissive society has not benefited women at all. Womien are<br />
all too often exploited in sexual relationships, women all too<br />
often find themselves taking second place to their husband's<br />
mates. If women are conservative voters, this could well be a<br />
response to a society that they do not particularly like and<br />
within which they all too often come of f second best.<br />
Women lack a sense of political efficacy. Playing the<br />
role of voter does not in itself give rise to political awareness.<br />
It hardly suffices to bring'politics to the centre of the voter's<br />
consciousness. More voters-are influenced or changed by personal<br />
discussion than any other means, and women lack such opportunities. ./ 8 </p>
<p>8<br />
It is often said, and truly, that the home limits<br />
women's exposure to political experience and information. But<br />
one of the most enlightening changes that has recently occurred<br />
is that women are insisting more and more that concerns of the<br />
home be the concerns of politics, that the personal be the<br />
political. Child care, family planning, housework and so on<br />
are now becoming issues for the political arena. To this extent<br />
women are in the process of trying to re-define and to re-describe,<br />
the political. I am not here however to lecture women about the<br />
responsibilities of citizenship or the need to join political<br />
movements or to be politically active. Women are in politics.<br />
They know how to organise. They recognise their needs. But<br />
now is the time to define and formulate their demands and to<br />
seek a full share in political power and leadership. It is my<br />
deep belief that what is good for women will in turn be good for<br />
the entire society.<br />
