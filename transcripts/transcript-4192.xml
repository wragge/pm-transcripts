SHERATON HOTEL<br />
PERTH<br />
Saturday, 24th July, 1976 </p>
<p>a visit to Romania and the Soviet Union. I've already made<br />
some comments about my disucssions in those two countries, both<br />
of which will', I believe, assume increasing importance for us<br />
as trading partners.<br />
As I said on my return, it is very hard in a centrallyp].<br />
anned economy to know what they are thinking; to know to<br />
what extent trade and politics become intermingled. Ho-.: ever,<br />
I think it is extremely important that we build up close contacts<br />
with the people in these countries who make . the decisions on<br />
trade. Without that contact, the job of trading is made so much<br />
harder. People in countries like Romania and the Soviet Union<br />
find it difficult to fully grasp our free enterprise system where<br />
the Government is involved to a minimum extent, while we find it<br />
strange dealing with countries whose governments virtually own and<br />
control everything. The more personal contact we can have with<br />
them, the greater the opportunities for bridging this. gap, and for<br />
promoting trade.<br />
It has to be understood, of course, that when a minister<br />
visits another country for discussions, he does not go there as<br />
a travelling salesman, with a bag of samples and an order. book.<br />
lie goes there to try to establish the relationship and environment<br />
that will encourage and facilitate trade. We negotiate trade<br />
agreements for that purpose. We set up joint ministerial commissions<br />
for that purpose. We talk with ministers and officials to assure<br />
them of our desire to trade, and to be a stable, dependable trading<br />
partner. We establish the framework. But -then it is up to the<br />
private sector, or to the trading authorities with our active<br />
encouragement and support to do the business.<br />
For example, while I was in Moscow I naturally raised<br />
the question of our desire to make further sales of beef.. We<br />
already sell a number of primary products to the Soviet Union, and<br />
we have made good sales of beef in the past. At present, of<br />
course, there is a very large stockpile of beef in Europe which<br />
overhangs the world market and makes trade very difficult.<br />
Nevertheless, the Soviet authorities assured me that Australia<br />
would continue-to be considered as a source of meat. There is a<br />
shortage of meat in the Soviet Union due to last year's widespread<br />
drought but, as I said, there are large stocks of meat in Europe<br />
which have a bearing on our chances of selling meat to the Soviet<br />
Union at present.<br />
Nevertheless, the chairman of the Meat Board, who was in<br />
Moscow with me, and who stayed on for further discussions, will<br />
be pursuing this matter and I hope we will see some worthwhile<br />
results before too long. A buying mission fro. . Romania will be in<br />
Australia shortly to look at the possibilities of buying meat,<br />
dairy products and sugar from us.<br />
A very important point about trade, of course, is that<br />
countries must be able to sell things before they can buy things.<br />
They have to earn the foreign exchange to pay for their imoorts.<br />
That's why it's important that we give countries like Romania<br />
and the Soviet Union opportunities to sell to. us, and a large part<br />
of my discussions was devoted to this aspect of the matter. S../ 2 </p>
<p>As soon as the Prime M inister returns to Australia on<br />
6th August, I will be holding discussions with another country<br />
Iran in a part of the world which also will becorme, I believe,<br />
very significant to Australia. I : will then be making brief<br />
visits to Britain and Germany to discuss matters related to my<br />
responsibilities in both trade and national resources.<br />
S Coalition difficulties in Western Australia<br />
You have been through a year which, to say the least, has<br />
not been without interest as far as your experience of coalition<br />
has been concerned. You have been reminded that successful coalitior<br />
which can bring very great benefits to a State and a nation, demands<br />
constant work and attention if it is to remain successful. There<br />
must be a continuing effort by each side to understand each other's<br />
point of view. There must be no tendency for one side to try to<br />
dominate-the other, otherwise strains and stresses will be created.<br />
In arriving at decisions, the views of each party, and the<br />
responsibilities of each party, must be taken into account. The<br />
experience of-the Liberal and National Country Parties in<br />
Canberra over sonething like 27 years proves that successful coalitic<br />
can be achieved and maintained provided there is a basic, underlying<br />
unity of purpose, and a continuous, conscious determination<br />
by the leaders and others to make coalition succeed.<br />
I'm delighted that, after the difficulties you have<br />
experienced in the last year or so, the coalition in this State<br />
has been restored. But I am very concerned about developments<br />
which seem to me to raise a real threat to the future successful<br />
existence of the coalition here. I do not believe a coalition can<br />
survive if ministers in the Government are opposed by candidates<br />
endorsed by the other partner. For many years there have been<br />
pressures for this sort of thing to happen in the federal coalition,<br />
but the party leaders have strenuously and successfully resisted<br />
these moves. We have resisted them often despite very strong<br />
feeling within our own party ranks because we know that th. iis<br />
kind of situation would make proper functioning of a coalition<br />
cabinet almost impossible. I think it must be clear to anyone<br />
that a minister trying to serve his Government well, and trying<br />
conscientiously to be loyal and responsible to his colleagues,<br />
must find himself in a very difficult situation if those colleagues<br />
are allowing him to be censured, in effect, by being subjected to<br />
an electoral contest with his coalition partners.<br />
I don't think it is good enough simply to say that no<br />
understanding or arrangement about these matters exists. That<br />
might well be true. But surely ifit is foolish zL do a thing,<br />
then it shouldn't be done. If both partners believe coalition is<br />
important and worthwhile, and if they believe coalition is good<br />
for the State, and if they really want it to work, then perhaps<br />
it's time an arrangement was worked out.<br />
I don't think it's good enough to si.: ply say this is a matter<br />
for the party organisations. Strictly speaking, no doubt, it is<br />
a matter for the organisations. But that does not mrean that party<br />
leaders are absolved from giving guidance and wise counsel, even<br />
though such advice might not always be well received by the party<br />
organisation. It is the party leaders, and the parliamentary<br />
members, who carry the major part of the burden of Cc. oaakliintgi on<br />
./ 3<br />

work and of providing good government. If their party organisations<br />
contemplate action which seems likely to jeopardise those objectives,<br />
then leaders must do w.-hat they can to see that a wiser course is<br />
followed. All I can say about your situation here is that I hope wiser<br />
Scounsel will prevail, and that people will see the dangers that<br />
lie in the path to which I hope only for the moment they<br />
have committed themselves.<br />
S I hope both parties here will work to establish an agreement<br />
as to the basis of coalition. And I hope both parties will accent<br />
the need for very careful consideration of the way they act towards<br />
each other; that members of both parties will keep very much in<br />
mind the requirements for harmonious working relationships. If<br />
these things can be achieved, then this State can look forward<br />
-with confidence to. a continuation of good government.<br />
Party's role and purpose<br />
And in our own minds, there should be no doubt about our<br />
own importance on the political scene, about our role and our<br />
purpose. I say that because there are people who suggest today<br />
that with the Liberal Party in such a strong position in the<br />
Federal Parliament, the National Country Party is superfluous.<br />
A few moments' thought about the Senate situation and the<br />
. realities likely to exist after future House of Representatives<br />
elections should quickly dispel that kind of thinking.<br />
But there are much more fundamental reasons why this nation<br />
needs a strong, vigorous, effective party like ours. Surely<br />
the three years' of Labor Government demonstrated beyond all<br />
doubt what can happen when a party with the great bulk of its<br />
support concentrated in the metropolitan areas is elected to<br />
office. Those three years saw the most serious neglect of and<br />
vindictiveness against the non-metropolitan areas of Australia.<br />
Policies we had fought for over the years, as a Party, were<br />
abandoned, and the whole economy so damaged by Labor's reckless<br />
spending in other directions that the new Government is very<br />
much inhibited, for the present, in what it can do to once again<br />
assist and encourage the great export industries and the people<br />
in many cases country people associated with those industries.<br />
There is a need, a -very real need, for a party such as<br />
ours which is dedicated to looking after these industries, and<br />
people, who are so important to the nation. LaTely we've been<br />
seeing a spate of articles and editorials saying as they have<br />
been for as long as I can remember that this Party is on the way<br />
out; that it's losing its supporters. I wo:. er if the people who<br />
write these things ever look at the results of elections? Or at<br />
our membership? Or at our 23 members and eight senators the<br />
most we have ever had? I wonder if they ever lock at the way<br />
our strength grows not the kind of spectac'lar grow. th that's<br />
likely to just as quickly evaporate, but real, solid, lasting<br />
growth, and a stability that's the envy of other parties?<br />
As far as I'm concerned and my Federal and State<br />
colleagues will back me this Party knows where its strength<br />
comes from, where its real. support lies, and where its future<br />
will be, and we will not lose sight of any of these zhings. I! </p>
<p>Labor rejected by the people<br />
Mr. C'hairman, on December 13 last year Australia to<br />
borrow a phrase from Churchill gave a heave of its shoulders<br />
and shook off the burden of the solialism which the Whitlam<br />
years, as brief as they were, had begun to load on them.<br />
Some people still do not understand what happened in that<br />
election. They still confuse two separate happenings: first,<br />
the-action by which the Governor-General resolved a Parliamentary<br />
deadlock which threatened the most dire consequences for the<br />
nation, and second, the action by which the people themselves<br />
decided who they wanted to govern their country.<br />
That deadlock saw a Prime Minister defying the Parliamentary<br />
system and betraying his own principles to cling to power a<br />
point which Mr Whitlam now carefully refrains from mentioning.<br />
The Whitlam Government wasn't destroyed by the Governor-<br />
General. It was destroyed by the Australian people, because<br />
they'd had enough of it. The people, in response to Mr. Whitlam's<br />
impassioned and repeated invitations, did express their judgement<br />
on the Governor-General's actions, to the extent that the<br />
Australian people not Sir John Kerr turned a Labor majority of<br />
five into a Liberal-National Country Party majority of<br />
Big majority not a licence<br />
Mr. Chairman, some people might say that this big majority<br />
gives us the power to do what we like: to run wild: to ignore<br />
the needs of minorities: to let our overwhelming strength weaken<br />
our judgement and our responsibilities. To me, the opposite is<br />
true. Our big majority is not a licence to do what we like. It<br />
is an instruction, a direction, a command to. do the job the<br />
people gave us to do and to do it with resolution.<br />
What is that job? It is to bring the national economy under<br />
control; to clean up the mess; to rebuild. As I report to you<br />
on the results of our work, on the progress we have made in our<br />
first six months, I ask you to remember this: when you have a<br />
train running downhill at top speed on the wrong line, it's<br />
not a simple matter to pull it up, to reverse it back up the hill,<br />
and then to get it heading in the right direction. That's the<br />
kind of problem we face in getting the economic train under<br />
control, and back on the right track.<br />
What did we find when we woke up on the morning of December<br />
14 last year? It certainly was no surprise to us to find this:<br />
Sinflation running at 14%<br />
Sthe worst unemployment for more than 4L years<br />
San enormous budget deficit, and the prospect of<br />
an even bigger one<br />
Government spending getting to the point of being<br />
completely out of control. </p>
<p>These were the elements of the problem we faced and<br />
S'which we had been instructed by the Australianrpeople to get our<br />
teeth into the night before. w, ee'llv, e taken the first bites.<br />
We've got our teeth into the problem. And we're not going to<br />
be easily persuaded to let go.<br />
I think it's fair to say that, by the firm econo-ic measures<br />
S it has already taken, the Government has let it be kno..: n that it<br />
means business. We have moved to regain control of the national<br />
S economy; to reassert control over fiscal policy. The loss of<br />
S control which we now seek to redress should never have occurred.<br />
The fact that it did occur explains why, as a nation, we are<br />
in such a difficult situation. The economic measures we have<br />
introduced are designed to begin, in a very substantial way, the<br />
process of bringing inflation under control<br />
Both before I left for overseas and since my return I.<br />
have been engaged in discussions on the Budget which the Treasurer<br />
will bring down on 17 August.<br />
The task facing us was to draw up a Budget that would<br />
continue to take account of the need for restraint in government<br />
spending, but at the same time stimulate the restoration of<br />
confidence which is . so urgently needed throughout the cormmunity,<br />
and especially in the business and industry sectors. I believe<br />
the Budget next month will show that we have been able to achieve<br />
these two objectives in a very responsible way. But inflation<br />
remains the fundamental probrem.<br />
We simply cannot hope to permanently correct our very<br />
serious unemployment problem, or the basic problems of our<br />
export industries, until we bring inflation under control. Inflation<br />
is the root cause of unemployment, and this needs to be fully<br />
understood. So to fight the inflation menace, Mr. Chairman, we have<br />
embarked on a program to reduce the budget deficit, to halt<br />
the massive increase in government spending, and to persuade the<br />
community of the need for moderation in , wage demands and price<br />
rises. At the same time, we have shown ourselves committed to<br />
looking after the less fortunate members of society. Indexation<br />
of taxes and the new system of family allowances represent two of<br />
the most far-sighted steps ever taken by a Government in this country.<br />
Not only will they be of great assistance to individuals and families<br />
but, even more significantly, they will do much -o increase our<br />
chances of success in the battle against infla-icn and all its<br />
evils. Inflation threat to exports<br />
Historically, Mr. Chairman, the party to which we all<br />
belong has placed great emphasis on the importa: nce of the export<br />
industries. We have said that exDorts ar-e he lifeblood of<br />
the nation; that they are the found atio on wic our rising<br />
living standards are built because they earn the _ freign exchange<br />
we need to pay for the things we import. Exports are vital to<br />
the progressive development of our industry our primary industry, </p>
<p>6.<br />
both agricultural and .? inng and our secondary industry. Without<br />
*:. the capacity to export to the world, our industries are denied<br />
the benefits of large-scale production, and the economies it<br />
can bring. All this is well known to you. What you also : not<br />
although the full seriousness of it has not yet bee. understood<br />
by many people is that the whole basis of our expor: industries<br />
is gravely threatened. This is the major point I want to make<br />
to you today.<br />
For many years I, and-others, have been issuing warnings<br />
on the consequences of allowing our export industries to become<br />
uncompetitive. If we allow that to happen, i is bad not just<br />
for industries themselves it is bad for the whole nation.<br />
Yet it is happening.<br />
The cost structure of Australian industry, at all levels,<br />
is getting so far out of line with -the cost structures of industry<br />
in ' other countries that our own people simply cannot hope to compete.<br />
Every day I'm hearing of export sales lost because our prices<br />
are too dear. Our wage' levels are the highest in the world.<br />
Wages in this country have risen faster and hi. her than in any<br />
other country in recent times. This has put very great strains<br />
on the competitiveness of our. industry<br />
The situation is so serious that the viability of many of<br />
Australia's farms, mines and factories is under real threat.<br />
You all know what rising costs have done to the rural industries.<br />
When you turn to the mining and manufacturing industries,<br />
again there is cause for real concern. Not only is inflation<br />
hurting these sectors in the same way it is hurting primary<br />
producers: it is also frightening away the investment we need to<br />
establish new projects, and to keep existing developments<br />
profitable and competitive.<br />
Unless inflation can be controlled, the international<br />
competitive position of the minerals industry already in many<br />
cases on a knife's edge will certainly be very seriously<br />
damaged. One of our most efficient sectors, and probably the<br />
one which has the greatest growth potential, could be severely<br />
harmed. If it is, Australia will be the loser.<br />
Getting mining moving again<br />
Mr. Chairman, could I say something, in this great mining<br />
State, about the Government's policies on minerals and energy<br />
matters, for which I have some responsibility.<br />
There seems to have been some unrealistic ex: ectation<br />
that, almost overnight, the frustration and of three<br />
years of Labor administration could be cleared away. . ot one<br />
major mineral project got underw-ay during t-. cse th-ree years. IF<br />
anything, during that period, several promising proje-Ts had<br />
impediments put intheir way. / 7 </p>
<p>7.<br />
I think one of -the : most powerful forces inhibiting<br />
development then and now is the fact that, during those same<br />
S three years, the economy, of this Vaas managed in such a<br />
reckless . and profligate way that the c.. r. ercial viabii y of<br />
many proposed and even: existing projects has been placed in<br />
question by excessive inflation.<br />
:: Our approach in the first-few months of-office has been<br />
. to. remove the. impediments and roadblocks to clear. The way for<br />
future growth. We have been seeking to re-esT -i sh the<br />
foundations for business . confidence. . But aft--he ravages<br />
rought over the three years of the former<br />
administration, this cannot be accomplished o. rnight.<br />
Even so, progress has been made. As you know, there are<br />
a number of necessary steps before the constr'ction phase of a<br />
project is reached. Quite apart from the planning of the project<br />
-and the organisation of the construction, there are feasibility<br />
.:-.-studies to be carried out, contracts. to be negotiated and funds....<br />
to be. marshalled. Even the projects that have been marking time<br />
for the past few years need to be re-examined and re-assessed.<br />
Since we have come to office, companies have set about the work'of.<br />
bringing their projects to the stage where they can get underway.<br />
In-a few moments I'll give you a very quick list of the<br />
things I've been doing in an effort to get the mining industry<br />
back on the road to recovery.<br />
But first let's look at one or two specific . areas,<br />
Foreign investment for example. Our foreign investment guidelines<br />
make it clear that we want to see foreign investment here. The<br />
guidelines recognise Australia's need for foreign investment.<br />
If foreign investors remain unconvinced on this point,. it is not<br />
for want of assurances o; n my part or on the part of my<br />
ministerial colleagues. I wish I could say the same for all<br />
within the community. Every time some public figure, in this<br />
State or elsewhere, attacks the guidelines he is simply compounding<br />
the likelihood that investment will be scared off.<br />
What the Commonwealth wants is this: First we want to see<br />
our mineral resources once again being developed. Second, we<br />
want to see Australians given the opportunity To participate<br />
in that development to invest in it. Third, . we want to encourage<br />
the foreign investor to join in the develop. ent of our resources<br />
for several reasons: because we simply haven't got enough capital<br />
of our ownbecause we need the skills and The market outlets<br />
that come with foreign capital; because we desperately need the<br />
new jobs that foreign capital can provide, and the new development<br />
it can bring.<br />
Our guidelines are designed to. achiev. e -th-se objectives,<br />
and to achieve them without placing any hinr-.: ne in the<br />
way of development. We have set up an inrep.:. e.--t board of<br />
review which includes men with the experi._-e T_ know and<br />
appreciate the problems of business to advise us on foreign<br />
investment proposals. / 8 </p>
<p>The inability of Australians to take the opportunity<br />
to invest in new projects w.; ill not, in itself, mean that those<br />
projects will not go ahead. But the Government believes<br />
Australians. should have the chance. We've said we wi l,<br />
as a general rule, only approve new projects if they have at least<br />
percent Australian equity. But if foreign companies genuinely try<br />
to raise half their equity capital in Australi a c't, then<br />
the projects will not be prevented from going ahead wizh more<br />
than 50 percent foreign ownership.<br />
With uranium, the situation is different. Uranium is a<br />
unique, highly-sensitive material in every way. It would be<br />
quite unrealistic to believe that the great rajority of the Australi;<br />
people would accept substantial ownership or cc-rol of this very<br />
important and strategic resource by foreign cc-. anies or foreign<br />
governments. So in the case of uranium, we have laid down a firm<br />
rule that there must be at least 75 percent Australian ownership.<br />
And I'm quite certain there will be no trouble at all in finding<br />
Australian capital to meet that rule.<br />
When I'm in Europe and Britain shortly, one of my most<br />
important tasks will be to reassure investors there that we need<br />
their capital, we want it, and that it will be welcome here under<br />
our investment guidelines. In so doing, I shall be lending emphasi<br />
to the message already conveyed by the Treasurer in his visit a<br />
month or so ago. In this way I hope I can repair some of the<br />
damage that is being done by people who have put the grinding of<br />
their own axes before the interests of the nation.<br />
Now let's look at another area that seems to preoccupy the<br />
thoughts of some people: the Government's export control powers.<br />
Export controls are now being administered in a completely differer<br />
way from the way they were applied under the Labor Government. Und<br />
Labor, export controls were almost a weapon to be used against<br />
our own producers. For my part, these controls constitute a reserv<br />
power to be used only where there is an over-riding need to protect<br />
Australian producers, and to protect Australia's interests.<br />
Let me illustrate. I have only once used the export control<br />
powers to intervene in the activities of companies. That was in<br />
the case of salt. Salt producers here in Western Australia had<br />
argued for many months with the Japanese over the need to obtain a<br />
reasonable price for their product. On the weight of evidence<br />
relating to their own costs and to the prices being paid elsewhere,<br />
they had a reasonable case. In the end, have failed to reach a<br />
settlement, some of the companies asked me to intervene. What's<br />
more, the West Australian Government asked re to intervene, and<br />
gave me full backing when eventually, and reluctantly, I did so.<br />
Let's look at iron ore. I've had extensive discussions with<br />
all the iron ore companies to make sure there are no Commonwealth<br />
obstacles in the way of new development. I've = t1d the Premier of<br />
Western Australia that the Commonwealth will ee setting<br />
priorities for new development projects. W: e elieve this to be a<br />
matter for commercial negotiation. This ha the Australian<br />
companies and the overseas consumers know they c-n confidently<br />
proceed with their negotiations. This is something the previous<br />
Government would never contemplate.<br />
Naturally, the Government will wish to ensure that development<br />
proposals to increase Australia's iron ore cap city recognise the<br />
need to keep a reasonable balance between supply and demand, and do </p>

by the State, was held with.-both State and compan'y representatives<br />
al the end of May. Since then -the State has been in consultation<br />
with the companies, and the Commonwealth is still aw0. aiting the<br />
outcomTe of those consultations. I mention thi4s te hav<br />
been suggestions in some quar-ters that -the de.-a: inComing to<br />
decisions has been caused by the Coi-imionealtnh. 3y D can see,<br />
this is not the case.<br />

&gt; 7, I said earlier that I would run through a quick list<br />
f w ahaht as been done in this area since. we -ere.. elected about<br />
seven months ago. Here it is:<br />
We have mIoved to divest ourselves cf the r. e'. 3us<br />
Government's involive'ent in areas th rightly<br />
belong to private enterprise.<br />
An initial investment allowance has be ~ rduced.<br />
The coal export levy and the questisn-' cf : aion<br />
treatment for the mining and petrole. -ir. i-sries are<br />
under study iT the correct context ch. a the Budget<br />
Three major new projects in coal have been approved.<br />
. Those in iron ore have been assisted through<br />
discussions in Japan to help restore confidence in<br />
Australia as an assured and stable long-term source<br />
of supply.<br />
The Commonwealth has said it will not set priorities for<br />
i1on ore projects in Western Australia, regarding this<br />
as -an area for commercial negotiation provided that fair<br />
and reasonable market prices are obtained.<br />
The way in which export controls are used has been changed<br />
so as to respect, rather than usurp, the role of private<br />
enterprise.<br />
The Commonwealth, in contrast to previous government<br />
policy, has not found it necessary to intervene in coal<br />
and iron ore price negotiations.<br />
S Sensible guidelines on foreign investment have been laid<br />
down guidelines which will give Australians full<br />
opportunity to participate in resource development, but<br />
which will not hinder development.<br />
The limited export of natural gas from the North-West<br />
Shelf has been approved in principle.<br />
The question of oil pricing has been referred to the IAC.<br />
We are working with the State Governments in the revived<br />
Minerals and Energy Council and with the West Australian<br />
Government on the development of the . corth-West Shelf.<br />
Visits to Japan by myself and the Pri.-. e "-Mnister have<br />
reassured the Japanese of Australia's iesi-e to be a<br />
secure, reliable source of supply, a.-c 7c offer a stable<br />
market.<br />
Communication between the Government -: ining industry<br />
has been again opened up, and the of National<br />
Resources is keeping in close touch indcstry. / 11 </p>

-Mr Chairman, in -this address I ' have emhsslthe Government' s<br />
efforts to deal with inflation. I have donei~ s: o tw~ o reasons:<br />
to'alert you.' and the community Lis a w-. hole, to xe extremely serious<br />
-Situat ion we face; . and t'Lo he I the co?. munatvj zuncrs ta nd w,. hy the<br />
Governiment is making the fi-ght against infla-io~-. itsfispioty<br />
In doing th11i S, We are making it extrem.-ely hard or o-urselves todo<br />
many of Thre things we -would--like to do, and which need to be done.<br />
-We must exercise the most stringent controls ov. er Covernment s p cnd ing,<br />
and this does nothing to maintain or increase cur po-pularity. D t<br />
t-here are timas and this is one of them w-hen governmentLs must<br />
* put responsibility before popularity.-<br />
My appeal -to you today is ' to stand with us in -this difficult timen,<br />
and in these difficult tasks. I ckyou to* rerr~ eimol-er that when w-, e s<br />
hard and ungenerous, We are sim-, ply responding to the urgent nieeds of.:<br />
this nation in the way most appropriate ' to those needs at this tim~'<br />
What has to be understood is that inflation is at the very heart<br />
of-our problems. Those problems and I have mentioned especially<br />
unemployment. and the damage being done to our export base w-ill not<br />
be solved until inflation i~ s brought under control. So we are<br />
applying ourselves with as much resolution as we can to the job the<br />
peopl] e have given us. to do. I hope this Party, to which we are call<br />
so proud to bel. ong, will stand squarely behind its members in the<br />
Government as they put their shoulders to a pretty heavy wheel.<br />
Throughout its history, this par-ty has faced many challeng ' es.<br />
Today we face what is perhaps the hardest challengre of: al. hard<br />
because it' s a challenge which all our ins-L ine s, and our dceo) concern<br />
for the plight of so rrany of our ow.-n people, tel s we should run<br />
away from. It's the challenge to restraint-, to =-o-Ieration, to denial,<br />
to self-con-trol, to discipline in our 6emands. And it' s a challeng7e<br />
not just to us, but to the com", munity and thenai.<br />
If the crippling inflation bosetting this nat--on is to be bro'ken.<br />
and beaten, this challenge jmrust be faced and c:: td I wan! this<br />
r-ty to so conduct itself in response to thils : ie that e wJll<br />
: n;: to the people of this nation such Pih of-responsib-1_ LYt<br />
adsuch concern before all else for the go~ ecountry we all<br />
, th~ at our reputation w-ill bDe enhanced t ienever before<br />
anieved. I w-: ant this party -to be seen -s weilling to<br />
