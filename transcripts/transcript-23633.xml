    <content><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Tony Abbott is pleased to welcome to Australia, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Mrs Akie Abe from 7 to 10 July as guests of the Australian Government.  The visit by Prime Minister Abe follows the very successful visit of Prime Minister Abbott to Japan in April 2014 as an official guest of the Japanese Government.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Abe’s address to the Australian Parliament on 8 July highlighted the long-standing and deep friendship between Australia and Japan, our enduring economic relationship, shared strategic interests in peace, stability and prosperity and strong people-to-people links.  Prime Minister Abe thanked Australians for their steadfast support in the aftermath of the tsunami in 2011 and highlighted the many areas of cooperation between our two nations.</p>
<p>At their meeting on 8 July, the two leaders affirmed the special relationship between Japan and Australia, based on common values and strategic interests including democracy, human rights, the rule of law, open markets and free trade. They confirmed that they would meet annually, alternately in Australia and Japan, to take forward the special relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Economic relations</strong></p>
<p>The two leaders signed the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement (JAEPA), the most significant economic accord between the two countries since the 1957 Agreement on Commerce.  The JAEPA will underpin the expansion of bilateral trade and investment for decades to come, taking bilateral economic relations to a new level.  They confirmed that the two countries will seek to bring the JAEPA into force as early as possible.</p>
<p>Discussions between the two leaders with Australian and Japanese business leaders confirmed Australia’s place into the future as one of the most important suppliers of minerals and energy to Japan, driven by continuing Japanese investment including in liquefied natural gas and coal.  Business leaders noted the JAEPA will be a springboard for growth in the commercial relationship including in manufacturing, agriculture and financial services.</p>
<p>The two leaders highlighted the G20’s crucial role in boosting the global economy, freeing up the private sector and creating jobs.  With just over four months before the G20 Leaders Summit in Brisbane, the two leaders shared the view it was time to turn aspirations into actions that will boost trade and encourage investment, such as in infrastructure.  Prime Minister Abbott praised the important contribution of Japan’s national growth strategy to this G20 agenda. Prime Minister Abe welcomed the Australian Government’s economic reform agenda, including the abolition of the carbon and mining taxes. They committed to working together to lift ambition and ensure the Summit delivers concrete results for our people: economic growth, jobs and a global economy that can weather future shocks.</p>
<p>The two leaders welcomed the deepening regional economic integration being driven through APEC and measures to enhance free trade in the region including the negotiation of high-quality liberalising trade and investment agreements.  They confirmed their commitment to concluding a comprehensive, ambitious and balanced Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement as soon as possible, to promote free trade, investment and economic growth in the region, and to strengthen the trade system based on rules.  They will also work together to achieve a modern, comprehensive, high-quality and mutually beneficial Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.</p>
<p>The two leaders shared the view that promoting the introduction of higher efficiency coal-fired power plants is a realistic measure in addressing climate change considering the fact that many countries opt for coal-fired power generation due to coal’s affordability and availability, and recognised the importance of sharing such a view in international fora.</p>
<p>The two leaders confirmed the continued importance of stable and secure trade and investment in liquefied natural gas (LNG) at competitive prices based on market principles, and the importance of the further promotion of flexible gas markets.</p>
<p>The two leaders will strengthen cooperation in the areas of space and Information and Communications Technology (ICT), establishing an officials' ICT policy dialogue. They will also strengthen cooperation for the promotion of Geospatial Information Project using the Japanese Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS).</p>
<p><strong>Security and defence cooperation</strong></p>
<p>The two leaders welcomed the recent growth and deepening of the bilateral defence and security relationship in support of international peace and stability.  This builds on the 2007 Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation to ensure Australia and Japan can work effectively together in the region and beyond.  Prime Minister Abbott expressed support for Japan’s recent efforts on its security policy of “Proactive Contribution to Peace” based upon the principle of international cooperation and the updating of its legal framework for security, including through the exercise of its UN Charter right to collective self-defence.</p>
<p>The two leaders were pleased to endorse the recommendations from Australian and Japanese Foreign and Defence Ministers to enhance practical defence cooperation.  The recommendations will deepen the bilateral security and defence relationship through enhanced training and exercises, increased personnel exchanges, and deepened cooperation on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, maritime security, peacekeeping, capacity building and trilateral security cooperation with the U.S. The two leaders decided to commence negotiations with a view to making an agreement that would reciprocally improve administrative, policy and legal procedures to facilitate joint operations and exercises.</p>
<p>The two leaders signed the Agreement Concerning the Transfer of Defence Equipment and Technology.  The Agreement will facilitate deeper cooperation between Australia and Japan through joint research, development and production of defence equipment and technology in areas of mutual interest, including hydrodynamics.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Abbott looked forward to welcoming a Maritime Self-Defense Force vessel in November this year to participate in the centennial celebration of the first convoy of ships, escorted by HIJMS Ibuki that carried ANZAC troops to World War I.</p>
<p><strong>Regional and international issues</strong></p>
<p>The two leaders reaffirmed the contribution of their respective Alliances with the United States to peace and security in the region.  They welcomed continued strong multifaceted US engagement in the region and reiterated their strong support for the US rebalance to Asia. The two leaders reaffirmed the value of the Trilateral Strategic Dialogue and undertook to further strengthen practical trilateral cooperation.  They also underscored the importance of the East Asia Summit as the premier forum for addressing the strategic, political and economic challenges facing the region and undertook to work together on strengthening its role.</p>
<p>The two leaders reaffirmed the importance of promoting the rule of law, of peace and stability, unimpeded trade, as well as freedom of navigation and overflight of the high seas.</p>
<p>They opposed any unilateral attempt to alter the status quo in the East and South China Seas by the use of force or coercion. Emphasising the need for disputes and issues to be settled by peaceful means, they called on all parties concerned to refrain from actions that could increase tensions, to clarify and pursue claims in accordance with international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and for ASEAN and China to reach early agreement on an effective Code of Conduct in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>They tasked officials to develop a coordinated strategy to strengthen cooperation in the Pacific region, commencing with consultations to identify priorities.  The strategy would support economic prosperity, peace and stability in the Pacific region.</p>
<p>The two leaders welcomed the close collaboration between the two countries in promoting nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, including through the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative (NPDI).  They committed to follow up the outcomes of the 8th NPDI Ministerial Meeting in Hiroshima, including actively contributing to a successful 2015 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the early entry-into-force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).</p>
<p>The two leaders reaffirmed they will continue to cooperate on United Nations Security Council reforms, peacekeeping operations and humanitarian assistance activities.</p>
<p>They called upon North Korea to abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programmes as well as its ballistic missile programmes.  North Korea should abide by its obligations under United Nations Security Council resolutions and its commitments under the 2005 Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks.  It should fully comply with the IAEA Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement under the NPT.  The two leaders reaffirmed their support for the work of the UN Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. They condemned North Korea’s violation of human rights and called on it to address urgently its unresolved humanitarian concerns including the abductions issue.</p>
<p>The two leaders resolved to work together to manage and respond to regional and global challenges. They discussed developments in the Middle East, especially the conflicts in Iraq and Syria, and the renewed risk of regional instability and the export of terrorism. They exchanged views on the situation in the Ukraine.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural and People-to-People Exchanges</strong></p>
<p>The two leaders renewed their commitment to promote two-way student mobility between Japan and Australia, to increase mutual understanding. Under the New Colombo Plan the Australia government will increase the number of Australian undergraduate students who study in Japan.  Under the Government Scholarship for Study Abroad and the 'TOBITATE!</p>
<p>Young Ambassador Program' the Japanese government will increase the number of Japanese students who study in Australia. The two leaders warmly welcomed the commitment to establish the Rio Tinto Chair of Australia-Japan Studies at the University of Tokyo and the Australia-Japan Research Centre at the Australian National University (ANU), as well as the recent progress on cooperation between Ritsumeikan University and the ANU.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Abe welcomed the decision to simplify entry procedures for Japanese citizens arriving in Australia through the planned expansion of the SmartGate automated border processing system.</p>
<p>The two leaders affirmed their intent to cooperate for the success of the AFC Asian Cup 2015 in Australia, the Rugby World Cup 2019 in Japan and the Games of the XXXII Olympiad and Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games.</p>
