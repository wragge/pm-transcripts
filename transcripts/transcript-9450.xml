PRIME MINISTER 109/ 94<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
If imitation is the highest form of flattery, I should be overwhelmed by Dr<br />
Hewson's remarks today.<br />
On the other hand, plagiarism is a symptom of intellectual and professional<br />
bankruptcy and in the case of the Liberal Party, yet another symptom of<br />
terminal decline.<br />
A week ago it was Mr Downer talking incessantly about " Mills and Boon"<br />
fictions, a phase borrowed directly from my own description of that less than<br />
monumental work of fiction, The things that matter.<br />
Today it is Dr Hewson telling his fellow liberals that it is " not the jockey but<br />
the horse" my very own words of advice to the Liberal Party on several<br />
occasions this year. And Little Sir Echo, Mr Downer, says he agrees with Dr<br />
Hewson, which is the same as saying that he agrees with me that it is his<br />
party which is the problem and its incapacity to race.<br />
The Liberal Party is not a national party with policies for a nation, but a<br />
composite of state fractions run by the most reactionary of states.<br />
As the last 12 months have made clear, for the Liberals the leadership issue<br />
has become a form of entertainment, a distraction, a means of forgetting the<br />
awful fact that the party is no longer a credible or viable conveyance.<br />
Mr Downer may console himself at Christmas by telling himself over and<br />
over: " It's not me that's really the problem, it's my party".<br />
And they can quote me on this.<br />
