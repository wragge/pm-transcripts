PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY , JUNE 30 l1981<br />
JOINT' STATEMENT BY THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER<br />
AND THE PREMIERS OF NEW SOUTH WALES, VICTORIA<br />
AND QUEENSLAND<br />
The Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victorian and Queensland<br />
Governments have established a judicial inquiry into the<br />
possible drug trafficking and related activities of<br />
Terrence John Clark and other persons associated with him.<br />
It will be headed by His Honour, Mr Justice Donald Gerard Stewart<br />
of New South Wales Supreme Court, who has been requested to<br />
report no later than 30 June 1982. It is envisaged that the<br />
judicial inquiry may be given supplementary terms of reference<br />
referring to the activities of other drug trafficking -groups<br />
should the occasion arise.<br />
The Victorian Coroner's Report on the deaths of D. R. and<br />
I. M. Wilson found that a criminal group involving Terrence<br />
John Clark ( also known as Alexander James Sinclaire) existed<br />
in Australia. The Coroner stated that a huge drug empire had<br />
grown within Australia under the leadership of Clark involving<br />
many other persons.<br />
The judicial inquiry will be supported by a Commonwealth/ State<br />
multi-discipline task group comprising specially seconded<br />
Federal and State police officers. The task group will be<br />
assisted by lawyers from the Commonwealth and States experienced<br />
in the conduct of prosections and as required by persons<br />
experienced in accounting and banking.<br />
It is considered that the means adopted are the best ones of<br />
ensuring that major drug offenders are identified and<br />
prosecuted and exposing their techniques and methods, which can<br />
then be countered by the authorities.<br />
The Commonwealth's terms of reference are attached.-<br />
The New South Wales, Queensland and Victorian Governments<br />
have issued complementary terms of reference. </p>
