    <content><![CDATA[<p>Canberra</p>
<p>I bid you all very warm welcome to Parliament House  -  this place of gathering that belongs to every Australian.</p>
<p>I welcome you all to Techfest in this, NICTA's tenth anniversary year.</p>
<p>And I offer you a very warm welcome to Canberra in its centenary year.</p>
<p>I can't think of a better place to be holding Techfest because at their best, this House and this city are places of ideas.</p>
<p>The nation sends 226 of us to this parliament as legislators, not just to debate the issues of today but to imagine the nation of tomorrow.</p>
<p>Our best ideas are the ideas whose results are measured in decades.</p>
<p>Stanley Melbourne Bruce established the CSIRO at the same time as this city was being carved out of the Molonglo plain.</p>
<p>Sixty years later, the brilliant researchers at CSIRO came up with something that has changed the world called wi-fi and one those pioneers, Dr Terry Percival, now works for NICTA and joins us today.</p>
<p>The same concern for the future saw Bob Hawke set-up the Cooperative Research Centre program as part of his vision for the “clever country”.</p>
<p>In a bi-partisan spirit, I can say the same for the Howard Government's decision in establishing NICTA.</p>
<p>NICTA is one of the real game-changers transforming the Australian economy.</p>
<p>NICTA has brought scale and depth to ICT research, training and commercialisation in this nation.</p>
<p>Ten years later, NICTA is the largest and most successful ICT research organisation in Australia.</p>
<p>Last year NICTA had a stellar performance in attracting wealth and creating new jobs  spinning-off four new companies and working with major companies such as George Weston Foods, Healthscope and the Commonwealth Bank to improve their productivity and competitiveness.</p>
<p>A Deloitte study estimates that NICTA projects will have a combined annual impact of $3 billion a year on the national economy.</p>
<p>Innovations conceived through NICTA are part of our everyday lives.</p>
<p>One NICTA invention now provides the live audio platform for major outdoor events and concerts all around the world.</p>
<p>Another provides the operating system for 1.5 billion mobile phones.</p>
<p>I know NICTA didn't come here today empty-handed; there are some amazing innovations on display here.</p>
<p>For example NICTA has today announced the spinout of new company, Saluda Medical, which has developed a miniature smart chip implant that will transform the way chronic pain is managed.</p>
<p>Today I witnessed the signing of a landmark agreement with NICTA and the global software leader, Infosys.</p>
<p>I acknowledge the presence of Mr Narayana Murthy here today, the co-founder of Infosys, who is also on NICTA's international Business Advisory Board.</p>
<p>In my walk-through today I've also had the opportunity to see a fantastic new initiative that NICTA is developing called the lens.</p>
<p>It's an open-access tool to help start-ups and entrepreneurs navigate the incredibly complex world of intellectual property and break down the barriers to innovation.</p>
<p>I acknowledge the presence of the Global Senior Vice President of Qualcomm, Roger Martin, who has come from the US today to support this initiative.</p>
<p>These announcements are a measure of NICTA's ten-year journey to date and the qualities that have brought you so far: ambition, curiosity and a restless search for excellence.</p>
<p>It's no coincidence that Techfest is the single most important event in the NICTA calendar.</p>
<p>The scientific mind is inherently optimistic.</p>
<p>Innovation is always about the future.</p>
<p>Always asking the question “what's next?”</p>
<p>In an advanced economy like Australia, that's the way it has to be if we are to secure high-wage, high skills jobs for our children.</p>
<p>That's the way it has to be if we are to succeed in the Asian Century.</p>
<p>The way we get there is innovation.</p>
<p>Innovation equals productivity, equals prosperity.</p>
<p>That's why next week I'll be making a major statement on Australian innovation and jobs.</p>
<p>Studies show that in advanced countries like Australia, more than half of all growth in productivity comes from innovation.   </p>
<p>We know that growing productivity is the best way to create and support jobs for the long-term.</p>
<p>That doesn't happen by accident.</p>
<p>It comes from deliberate investments like NICTA, CSIRO, our CRCs, and the policies that go with them.</p>
<p>Investments and policies that help bring the future closer.</p>
<p>That's a perfect description for NICTA.</p>
<p>It's also a perfect description of the NBN  -  bringing the future closer.</p>
<p>We won't be the nation we want to be in ten or twenty years' time without universal high speed broadband.</p>
<p>Not half-baked, but the real thing.</p>
<p>Not to the node, but to the home.</p>
<p>Earlier this month I was privileged to spend some time with Sir Tim Berners-Lee.</p>
<p>Sir Tim congratulated the Government on the NBN and our vision for the digital economy because he knows that the Internet is the great equaliser.</p>
<p>So much of how we deliver services - education, social welfare, health care, even energy use  -  will be mediated through the Internet and that means the NBN.</p>
<p>But it's more than just services.</p>
<p>It's about an outlook and a philosophy.</p>
<p>A free and open Internet served by a universal, competitive, world-class broadband market is about empowerment.</p>
<p>It's about choices and possibilities.</p>
<p>We think we understand the digital world, but we haven't even scratched the surface.</p>
<p>When I entered this Parliament in 1998, there was no wi-fi, no smart phones, no iPads, no apps.</p>
<p>But the ideas were there; the people were there; the research facilities were there.</p>
<p>And in those facilities, remarkable men and women were rehearsing the future that is now our today.</p>
<p>Here at Techfest we see the very best Australian ICT innovation and development.</p>
<p>And here we also catch a glimpse of the future.</p>
<p>We see that future not just in the inventions being showcased but in the young people present with us.</p>
<p>I know some of you students are road-testing the new smart phone app to that gives you a window on a career in ICT.</p>
<p>It's my hope that in a few years, your own ideas and apps will be showcased here at a future Techfest.</p>
<p>Now Hugh Durrant-Whyte, Ian Chubb and the other scientists will have lots of advice for you today.</p>
<p>I'll just leave you with this thought as the Prime Minister who is delivering the NBN, the NDIS, the price on carbon and our National Plan for School Improvement:</p>
<p>The future doesn't belong to the timid.</p>
<p>And no dream is ever big enough.</p>
<p>I warmly congratulate NICTA on its ground-breaking achievements over the past decade.</p>
<p>I look forward to your continued work to strengthen our economy and improve our lives.</p>
<p>And I proudly declare Techfest 2013 officially open.</p>
