<p><br />MR. HOLT: I have discovered that Parliament will be in session tomorrow,<br />and that's the proper place for a statement of this kind to be made, and<br />preferably first to my own colleagues in the Cabinet. I don't want to make<br />a statement here today which means that the statement I make in Parliament<br />-tomorrow has already been said. So I feel that what I should do here today<br />is give you my own impressions and conclusions of the conference, but not<br />try to go through it in too much detail. I have brought along the parchment<br />document of the " Goals of Freedom" and the " Declaration on Peace and<br />Progress". I have also got with me the official communique. I thought the<br />TV boys would like to take a shot of the page which deals with the " Goals of<br />Freedom" and the seven signatures with it.<br />I haven't had time to go through the Australian press, but I<br />gather that one or two of them are referring to wrangles that went on between<br />us that delayed the conference and held up the drafting and so forth. Well,<br />we have the distinguished Prime Minister of New Zealand here with me, so<br />anything I say can be used against me and challenged by but if he<br />has ever attended a better-natured conference or a more co-operative<br />conference, or one in which it wds, found easier to reach agreement on the<br />points of substance, then he has the advantage of me. I have not attended a<br />conference where there has been readier dispostion to find agreement<br />-together on the matters that counted, and when you come to think of it, at the<br />drafting stage, three different documents were produced. The short ones<br />are not always easier to write than the long ones. The " Goals of Freedom" s<br />expresses the essence of what we were trying to say In our ' Declaration of<br />Principles of Peace and Progress in Asia and the Pacific". I think the correct<br />official title I have the document with me is " Declaration on Peace and<br />Progress in Asia and the Pacific". The " Goals of Freedom" were drawn as<br />expressing the esaance of that larger document.<br />I have never attended a more successful conference myself<br />and I never expect to, nor a more important conference, because this reaches<br />right out in to the future.<br />Well, that is something that I am prepared to say here today.<br />There are highlights which I would otherwise have referred to but which<br />could perhaps more appropriately be dealt with in the Padi iament.<br />( At this stage, the television cameras were switched on)<br />As you will see, we have just returned from what I believe<br />is the most important conference I have ever attended or ever expect to<br />attend. I am quite sure that as the years go on this will be seen as an<br />historic landmark in man's long struggle for freedom and it will reveal how<br />closely identified are the policies of the Asian powers who have joined with<br />the great Western country of the United States of Am erica and with A1ustralia<br />and New Zealand from the South Pacific in order to resolve the principles<br />which will guide us not only in our policies in respect of the freedom for<br />Viet Nam from aggression the Republic of Viet Nam but will also guide<br />us in the positive and constructive tasks we see ahead of us in that / 2</p>
<p>-2<br />( MR. HOLT Contd. country and in the peaceful progress that we feel can be<br />made in the Asian area as a whole. It was most heartening to find<br />the sincerity and the complete dedication to the task ahead of us manifested<br />by all the Heads of Government present. I am sure we all took encourage<br />ment from the way in which we were able to agree so readily on all<br />matters of substance. I haven't had an opportunity of checking the<br />Australian press accounts in any detail, but I have seen one or two<br />reference-s which frankly astonished me references to wrangling at<br />the conference, delays because we couldn't agree on wording and matters<br />of that sort. Wkell, Mr. Holyoake was present; Mr. Hasluck was present<br />at much of the discussion and at the separate proceedings in which the<br />Foreign Ministers were doing their own drafting, and I would say in their<br />presence, and would confidently expect them to agree with me, that it<br />would be difficult to name a conference in which there was agreement more<br />fully reached in a more co-operative fashion than was the case at this<br />conference. As to the drafting, when you consider that the conference produced<br />three significant documents " The Goals of Freedom", the communique<br />itself which ran into many pages because there were important matters<br />relating particularly to Viet Nam which we thought should be spelt out<br />in some detail for public knowledge and then the " Declaration on Peace<br />and Progress in Asia and the Pacific". Now these things can't be drafted<br />in double-quick time. No-one would imagine that we came to them as<br />novel propositions. Indeed, in the " Goals of Freedom", there is no<br />novelty in the fact that these principles have been stated. Each of us<br />in our turn has stated them at some time or another, probably many times.<br />But what is significant is that seven countries so diversely composed<br />the grea test power in the Western world, th ese four Asian powers and<br />New Zealand and ourselves, were able to come to such a consensus and<br />express ourselves so forcibly regarding it.<br />You will have noted through the detail published of the communique<br />that certain important items have been put more clearly, I think, than ever<br />before The intentions of the Government of the Republic of Viet Nam.<br />They have made it clear that they are not looking to North Viet Nam to do<br />anything more than abandon its aggression, and that is the least that could<br />be asked of any country, and that is all that we have asked in our support<br />of the Republic of Viet Nam in the south. They have given firm assurances<br />of their intention to proceed speedily to the creation of democratic<br />institutions. They think the constituent assembly will have reached its<br />decisions within the scheduled time indeed in advance of it in March, 1967,<br />and that within six months of that constituent assembly producing a<br />constitution for the country, they will be able to hold elections for a<br />democratically-elected Parliament.<br />Now this, I think, is a great advance in a country which is<br />subjected to daily attack of one kind or another and is afflicted by the<br />ravages of war.<br />There was the agreement to help in the civic programmes of that<br />country. One thing that should be noted in Australia Is that there are limits<br />ase how effectively we can work on these civic action programmes<br />the tasks of reconstruction and rehabilitation while the Viet Gong are able<br />to come back and destroy the work which is being carried out. So whereas<br />emphasis in the past has been on what has been known as " search and<br />destroy" operations, in the future the emphasis will be on " clear and hold"<br />operations. In other words, you don't merely deal with the Viet Cong<br />militarily, but there is the political Viet Gong remaining behind which<br />have been able to destroy a good deal of the work done through the / 3</p>
<p>3-<br />( MR. HOLT Cont.) programmes of civic action, and on a " clear and hold"<br />basis, you donft merely deal effectively in a military sense with the enemy,<br />but you remnain on in that centre to ensure that whatever you are able to<br />do in a positive and constructive way is not subsequently sabotaged.<br />Now these are some of the things which have come out.<br />I would like to put to you the detail of the " Goals of Freedom"<br />Perhaps those of you with television cameras might like to get a shot of<br />this particular passage in our documentation. It reads as follows<br />" Vile the seven nations gathered in Manila, declare<br />our unity, our resolve and our purpose in seeking together<br />the ' goals of freedom' in Viet Nam and in the Asian and<br />Pacific area. They are<br />1. To be free from aggress ion.<br />2. To conquer hunger, illiteracy and disease.<br />3. To build a region of security, order and progress.<br />4. To seek reconciliation and peace througniout Asia<br />and the Pacific.<br />In support of these objectives, you will see that each of the~ Heads of the<br />seven Governments represented there have attached their signature as in<br />earnest of their determination to follow these princip~ les through.<br />Now that, if it is carried out, will represent the most remarkable<br />advance in the story of Asia ever to be recorded. I bel ieve that there are<br />these revoluti onary processes going on in Asia, revolutionary in the sense<br />that they represent a movement away from an unhappy past, but hope is<br />stirring in Asia, and that this conference will have lifted the hearts of the<br />people of the area of Asia and the South Pacific generally, will have revealed<br />to them a resolute determination because each of those seven Governments<br />has said quite firmly, " We are going to see this job through" and if there<br />are any doubts in the minds of the Government of North Viet Nam as to our<br />resolution, then I hope this clear and emphatic declaration will have resolved<br />thosa cbtbt; ( br them.<br />So, with the concentration on the task of securing a peace, if peace<br />cannot be negotiated and surely we have made it abundantly clear that the<br />terms of a peace require nothing more than an aband onment of aggressionnot<br />a surrender of national integrity or a destruction of an economy, or the<br />life of the North Vietnamese people; they are free to choose the form of<br />government they want, the way of life they want, but they must abandon<br />the aggression....... . well, if they won't negotiate on those terms, we<br />must see the thing through, and check the aggression as best we can by<br />our own combined military means. While this is going on, and after a<br />cessation of hostilities has been produced, then the tasks of reconstruction<br />and rehabilitation must. proceed.<br />I would conclude by saying just this a bmit the initiatives of the<br />Asian countries which brought us together that it was, I feel a happy augury<br />for the conference that it should have arisen in this way. We had a firm<br />statement from the President of the United States of the major part that the<br />United States was willing to continue to play, and the vast expenditure / 4</p>
<p>-4<br />( MR. HOLT Contd.) it was willing to incur in pursuit of our agreed objectives,<br />and no-one could have attended that conference and felt and seen the evidence<br />of the earnestness, the sincerity and the dedication and the courage of<br />the rq) resentatives of the Government of the Republic of Viet Nam. the<br />Chairman of the National Committee of Liberation, Mr. Thieu, and the<br />Prime Minister, Kao Ky without feeling that here were men of purpose<br />and dedication, men who could justly require of us support in the task they<br />have of restoring the freedom which their country should enjoy and In--mabling<br />it to go steadily forward in peaceful progress.<br />MR. EGGLETON Now, are there any questions?<br />Q. Sir, you are quoted in Manila as saying you wouldn't be reviewing<br />our commitment in Viet Nam until after the elections and that you wanted<br />to give the Australian public a chance to vote on the issue. Does this mean<br />if you win the elections you will regard yourself as having a mandate to<br />increase our commitment in Viet Nam?<br />MR. H-OLT: This is the situation, if I can state it quite simply. I don't<br />make a decision i n the absence of my Calb net. We have a system of Cabinet<br />Government in this country and I wouldn't accept firm commitments on behalf<br />of Australia in relation to matters of this sort without my Cabinet colleagues<br />being fully informed and having an opportunity to engage in any discussion.<br />Within perhaps twentyfour hours or so, the Parliament will have been<br />dissolved. I have already had letters prepared for my colleagues of the<br />Cabinet that f rom the dissolution of the Parliament, no major decision is<br />to be taken which would alter existing arrangements, because this is the<br />traditional practice as a government nears an election. ( To Mr. Holyoake)<br />I suppose you have the same practice, Mr. Prime Minister.<br />Mr. HOLYQAKE: That's the constitutional way.<br />MR. HOLT: That's the constitutional way, as you say, of dealing with<br />these matters. So, it is not a case of asking the Australian public to decide<br />whether or not we should have more troops or less, or more aid or less.<br />They know our policies and the purposes we have in mind. If they re-elect<br />us, they must expect of us that we will pursue those policies in the most<br />effective way we can. Whether or not this requires an increase in the<br />military commitment will be a matter which the Cabinet will then have to<br />decide in the light of thc circumstances which exist. Conceivably before the<br />new Parliament is elected, there could be moves from Hanoi which wculd<br />respond to our peace iniatives from this conference. I am not so optimistic as<br />to expect this as a probability, but it is certainly within the reakris of<br />possibility. It may be, on the other hand, that the fighting intensifies, that<br />our allies increase their commitments, and if they were to do so and the<br />situation worsened, then wie would have to review our contribution in the<br />light of those facts. I don't thin k that the Australian people would ever<br />expect that we take up a static position, neither moving up or down,<br />regardless of circumstances, but the evidence should be clear enough that<br />I have no desire to involve more Australian lives in issues which are of<br />tremendous consequence to the long-term future of this country than<br />circumstances make necessary, not ori y in the judgment of myself but of<br />men like Mr. Hasluck and my other Cabinet colleagues who wailbe joining<br />in a discussion on those matters with me.<br />Q. Mr. Prime Minister, will there be an opportunity before<br />Parliament dissolves for a statement by the Opposition or any kind of<br />debate?</p>
<p>MR. HOLT; Yes, what is now currently planned and I understand this<br />is in accordance with Mr. Caiwell's expressed wish is that I make a<br />statement to the Parliament tomorrow, proba~ bly in the night session, and<br />that the Opposition would debate that statement on the Friday. This would<br />then be among the concluding business of the Parliament. What I would<br />like to do is table the documents after Question Time tomorrow so that<br />there will be opportunity through the day for them to be carefully studied,<br />and no doubt the texts are already around, but the full and authorithtive<br />text would be available for their study and then I would make my statement<br />and the debate could proceed on it.<br />Thank you.</p>
