FOR PRESS: P2. L No. 97/ 1965<br />
SOUTH VIET NAM. CLASP FOR AUSTRALIANS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Her M; 1aj esty The Queen has approved the award of<br />
a special clasp to the General Service Medal 1962 for<br />
Australians serving in South Viet Nam.<br />
The award will be made in recognition of<br />
operational service in Viet Nam and terms and conditions<br />
for the South Viet Kami Clasp will be similar to those for<br />
the recently-announced Borneo Clasp. In most cases, the<br />
qualification for the General Service Medal and appropriate<br />
Clasp is a minimum of thirty days' service in the relevant<br />
theatre. I am sure all Australians will share my satisfaction<br />
at the approval of these awards, recognising the<br />
distinguished service which our men are giving in Viet Nam<br />
and Borneo.<br />
CANBERRA, 17th December, 1965. </p>
