RICHARD COLVILLE: " SUNDAY REPORT"<br />
CANBERRA Question Prime Minister, there has been a great deal of discussion<br />
over the past week or so about your proposed amendments to<br />
the Arbitration Act. Exactly what was your Government trying<br />
to achieve, Why did you regard this as so important?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
There are three things that Tony Street proposed and which we<br />
accepted, because I think they make a great deal of commonsense.<br />
There have been problems before in getting particular cases<br />
to the Full Bench. so that they can be dealt with, in a sense,<br />
in the most important way in which the law and the system is<br />
capable. one case in particular, Telecom, dragged on for a long<br />
while without it going to the Full Bench. The Government believed<br />
that the President of the Commission needed a capacity to say,<br />
in the national interest, a particular case should go to the<br />
Full Bench. The provision also allows the Minister to suggest<br />
to the President -that in the national interest something to<br />
go to the. Full Bench, but it is the President who must make<br />
the decision. So the President of the Commission is having his<br />
position strengthened by those provisions. Nobody can suggest<br />
that is diminishing the power or the integrity of the Commission<br />
itself. At the centre it has been strengthened. I think is<br />
a very eminently sensible proposal. If I could go through them,<br />
there is another provision which requires Commissioners to<br />
consult with their Deputy President. The Commissioners are<br />
grouped into panels under a Deputy President, depending upon the<br />
industries they are in. Again, there have been cases where<br />
decisions have been made clearly outside the indexation guidelines.<br />
They have caused industrial trouble. Claims for flow-on. There<br />
have appeals. There has been disputation as a result. It would.<br />
have been much better if the decision that way, outside the<br />
guidelines that is the Commissioner's guidelines, not-the<br />
Government's necessarily, the Commission's guidelines much<br />
better is those decisions had never been made. So, the provision<br />
I believe is a relatively harmless one. in which the Commissioners<br />
are required to consult with the Deputy Presidents. The Government<br />
believes and hopes that that will lead to a greater degree<br />
of cohesion within the body of decisions made by the Commission.<br />
I would have thought that is a pretty harmless sort of amendment,<br />
but it is nevertheless an important one in the overall strength<br />
of the Conihission and where the Commission itself is going.<br />
The third amendment is for use in very serious situations when<br />
the safety, health or waelfare of the Australian community, or<br />
if part of the Australian community, is threatened, prejudiced,<br />
by severe industrial action. An application can be made to the<br />
Commission if the Commission rules that the safety, health or<br />
welfare of the community is under threat then Ehat does give / 2<br />
' SUNDAY, 21 OCTOBER 1979 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
the Government certain powers in relation to de-registration<br />
of part of the union or the whole of a union which could be<br />
used much quicker than the normal de-registration process.<br />
Again, it is the Commission that must make the proclamation.<br />
It is that that then could give the Minister of the Government<br />
powers in relation to that section. But the Government knows<br />
quite well that the test of that system will be the way in<br />
which the Section is itself used. On many occasions we have<br />
had circumstances over the last two to three years where<br />
people have said: " Why doesn't the Government act". Well,<br />
very often it has been because it is in a State arena with<br />
State employees. Sometimes has been because the law has been<br />
deficient, sometimes it has been Commonwealth employees and<br />
we have acted. This will extend the powers available to the<br />
Commonwealth in extreme emergency situations when the trade<br />
union movement itself, or some parts of it, are confronting the<br />
people of Australia. We know quite well that we will be judged<br />
on the way this section is used or not used. But we are happy<br />
to have that responsibility.<br />
Question On the first instances you outlined, as summing it up, it<br />
just requires the Commission to talk about major cases to<br />
discuss them more thoroughly than perhaps might have taken place<br />
in the past?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
That is the requirement on the Commissioner to refer the<br />
matter and discuss it with the Deputy President. It is a<br />
question of discussion. If the Deputy President doesn't then<br />
give the Commissioner directives, the Commissioner still makes<br />
his own decision.<br />
Question<br />
Why did you think these particular amendments so necessary.<br />
Have there been cases in the past where you were unhappy with<br />
the way that a particular Commissioner handled<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I don't want to mention cases in particular at the moment,<br />
but there have been one or two cases where plainly the decisions<br />
went right outside the guidelines. They were appealed against.<br />
The award was reduced, and all of that led to a great deal of<br />
disruption. People had an expectation. It was taken away from<br />
them as a result of a further decision. In addition, of course,<br />
when there are unreasonable decisions in terms of their extent<br />
and scope that creates a follow-through, a flow-through situation<br />
and many other people say: " If this union, this industry, can<br />
get that, why can't we get that". Ultimately what we have done<br />
doesn't alter, can't alter, what the Commission has determined,<br />
but what we hope is greater cohesion within the body of<br />
decisions made by the Commission. I would have thought that that<br />
is a very natural objective. ./ 3 </p>

Question Prime Minister, the main trouble area in the world I suppose<br />
at the moment is Kampuchea, and your Government has just<br />
announced tax deductibility for donations to charities in<br />
this area. Do you think this will improve or increase the<br />
flow of aid coming from Australia, substantially?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think it will. For decades all Australian Governments have<br />
resisted to make gifts for foreign aid purposes tax deductible.<br />
because the Governments ' have ' successively taken the view-that<br />
so much aid is provided by direct payment from the Government<br />
and that is from taxpayers that if people wanted to pay<br />
something over and above that, all right, that is their affair,<br />
we are very happy for them to do so, but not something that should<br />
in a sense be susbsidised by tax deductibility. But we felt<br />
that the problems in Kampuchea are so great and they go back<br />
over a long while; there were up to 2 million people killed,<br />
destroyed, under the Pol Pot regime itself, then the invasion<br />
involving 15 to 17 divisions of the Vietnamese Army, the<br />
continuing guerilla war, and massive refugee and massive famine<br />
problems, difficulties and degradation amongst the people for<br />
those who remain in Kampuchea. I doubt if any country, within<br />
the memory of most people living, or certainly since 1945, has<br />
gone through a more difficult, more stark, more horrifying<br />
circumstance. It is not all that far from us. our own part<br />
of the world Southeast Asia has been upset and disturbed<br />
by massive refugee movements coming out of the problems in<br />
Indochina. We believed, because of the total circumstances,<br />
that a lot of people in Australia would want the maximum<br />
opportunity of closely identifying themselves with the difficulties<br />
and hardships of Kampuchea. We thought, therefore, we ought to<br />
make an exception to the general rule which prevailed up to now.<br />
So donations made to the Kampuchean Relief Fund through the course<br />
of this financial year will be tax deductible. I hope it does<br />
lead to substantial additional sums being made available over<br />
and above the further aid that the Government itself has provided.<br />
Question A lot of people have voiced concern that whatever aid is given<br />
by Australia, or by individuals, may not be going to the people<br />
who need it most. Have you been able to get any sort of<br />
assurances that it: will?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
I've got that concern myself, but it just means that we have to<br />
do everything we can to see that aid gets to people who need it..<br />
I would be very concerned if I thought it was going to get into<br />
the hands of the Vietnamese Army. That must be a possibility, but<br />
the international agencies are well aware of that. We are well<br />
aware of it. All I can say is we will be doing everything we<br />
possibly can in the most difficult circumstances, to make sure<br />
that aid gets to those who really need it. Andrew Peacock is<br />
trying to get some aid officials to go with one of the relief<br />
planes to see on the ground what is happening. I am told there </p>
<p>-4<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
could be some probl. ems with that, but we will be wanting to<br />
get Australian officials on the ground in Kampuchea so we<br />
can have a direct report as to how matters are being handled.<br />
Question<br />
The other issue that has come up over the past few days has<br />
come up over the past few days has been that of Marlin fishing<br />
off north Queensland. I suppose that as one of Australia's<br />
keenest amateur fishermen yourself, do you have any sympathy<br />
or feeling towards the people who think that their livelihood<br />
may be disrupted by the agreement your Government has just<br />
signed?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I would have enormous concern if I thought that Marlin fishinga<br />
great fishing sport was going to be disturbed by what has<br />
happened. It is worth noting that most Marlin fishermen, I<br />
believe the best, when they catch a Marlin they tag the fish<br />
and they let him go. If it is going to be a great trophy fish<br />
or a trophy win I suppose that might be another matter, but<br />
I think the best catch, tag and release. For a sport, fishing<br />
of that. kind I think is the way it ought to be. What has<br />
happened is that for 25 years or so the Japanese have been<br />
fishing these waters and nobody has really known what's happened.<br />
They have been fishing, taking fish and that's gone on. Under<br />
the new fishing agreement that we have signed with Japan, they<br />
are excluded from quite considerable areas where they previously<br />
were able to fish. So that is the first point.<br />
The second point I would make is that under the fishing arrangement<br />
there will be a much better after a little while, of what'shappened,<br />
because there will be supervision, information collected.<br />
Then we will be in a better position to judge, on a basis of fact.<br />
Thirdly, these particular elements, again, as I'm told, are<br />
capable of re-negotiation at the end of a 12 month period. So we<br />
will be watching the evidence very closely over this period. If<br />
there is a need for re-negotiation of some elements of the<br />
agreement, and in accordance with the agreement, well then, we<br />
will certainly want to do that.<br />
Question How, exactly, are you going to supervise this to make sure that<br />
they're not taking marlin or anything els-e that they-shouldn't.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Oh, I think that you will find there will be people on fishing vessels<br />
themselves, catches will be supervis-ed and a lot of this-is a<br />
question of gaining knowledge and that's in the interests of<br />
fishing itself, of the commercial fishing. Because, you need to<br />
understand that the resources are not being over-fished, that they<br />
are not being depleted, because people want to be in this as-a<br />
long-term business, not coming in, making a kill and destroying the<br />
grounds and going out again. So, it's in the interests of everyone<br />
to see that there is greater knowledge and understanding of marine </p>
<p>Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
resources, whether it's off the North Queensland coast or<br />
in other parts of the waters around Australia.<br />
