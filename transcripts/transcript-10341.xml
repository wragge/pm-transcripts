PRIME MINISTER<br />
LABOR KNOCKS, BUT NO ANSWERS<br />
After thirteen long years of ruining Australia in government, Labor in opposition has<br />
been reduced to knocing and whingeing.<br />
The Opposition Leader's Budget reply tonight was the proof.<br />
Now that the Coalition Government has set a plan to save and build for Australia's<br />
future, Kim Beazley's responsibility was to put aside the predictable rhetorical bluster<br />
and tell the Australian people whether he would support the Coalition's solutions.<br />
There was no answer on:<br />
whether he will support a programme to pay back Keating Labor debt for the sake<br />
of our children's future;,<br />
whether he will support the * firstc* o mpreliensivi tax break for savings in Australia's<br />
history; whether he will now belatedly and unreservedly support the greatest investment in<br />
improving nation's environmental capital;<br />
whether he will support the Federation Fund for real jobs and our country's<br />
infrastructure; or<br />
Whether he will support the first legislative guarantee to lock in the indexation of<br />
pensions to 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings.<br />
Kim Beazley can't afford to have an each way bet on Budget measures, either<br />
deliberately, or through lack of control over his Senate Colleagues, as he did with the<br />
superannuation surcharge on high income earners.<br />
ir Beazley has to take a stand.<br />
The old Labor way of high taxation and wasteful spending was decisively rejected in<br />
March last year.<br />
By failing to reassure the people that Labor supports efficient government and lower<br />
tax, Kim Beazley's Budget response tonight demonstrates agaiu that Labor has failed<br />
to listen, let alone learn, mainstream Australia's message at the last election.<br />
