PRIME MINISTER 135/ 92<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON. P. 3. KEATING<br />
WHAT MANDATE? I think it's a pity that what is said aboutpenalty<br />
xate _ and holiday leave 1oadins before the election<br />
hasn't been totally adhered to in actual the Bill<br />
itself..<br />
What is my observation is what is in the Bill on<br />
penalty rates and holiday loadings is not the same<br />
as what they said before the election. ( John Howard<br />
on Meet the Press November 1 1992)<br />
1 think there is a fair argument to say, Laurie,<br />
that they made a promise before the election and in<br />
some circumstances that promise may not be met as a<br />
result of their reforms.<br />
I think that Is simply a statement of fact.. ( Peter<br />
Reith on Sunday November 1 1992)<br />
It is " simply a statement of fact" that during an<br />
election in which industrial relations was a major issue<br />
Mr Kennett deliberately disguised his real intentions.<br />
It is " simply a statement of fact" that there is no<br />
mandate for what Mr Kennett has actually introduced. The<br />
Victorian people know it. And so do Or Hewson, Mr Howard<br />
and Mr Reith.<br />
It is " simply a statement of fact" that Mr Kennett's<br />
legislation constitutes a pointless and destructive<br />
attack on the rights and living standards of many<br />
thousands of victorians.<br />
At the same time it threatens the national recovery.<br />
In substantial ways it strikes not at inefficiencies but<br />
at fundamental social Justice, at the reasonable and<br />
decent standards of employment and remuneration to which<br />
Australians are entitled.<br />
' TO" 0OV0N T 7 " I? </p>

Mr Kennett's legislation undermines not Just V. ictorian<br />
workers but the national interest.<br />
By replacing unprecedented industrial' harmony, with the<br />
conflict it took so long to get out of the system, he has<br />
destroyed the essential condition for reform of<br />
industrial relations the cooperative spirit which has<br />
already produced more than 550 enterprise bargains.<br />
The Federal Government's proposed changes to industrial<br />
relations laws recognise that-workplace reform must<br />
continue. In many cases that reform is seeing penalty rates, leave<br />
loadings and outdated work practices n-egotiated -away,-<br />
with the support of employees.<br />
The Federal legislation allows for all the reform Mr<br />
Kennett wants on penalty rates, leave loadings and<br />
hours worked.<br />
But it also protects people from being forced onto<br />
-individual contracts. It means that the reforms<br />
continue, but no worker is worse off.<br />
In other words, flexibility every which way, but not<br />
downwards. Mr Kennett's legislation is an attack on progress in<br />
industrial relations. It is an attack on the economic<br />
recovery which Australia is staging in the face of an<br />
unfavourable international climate.<br />
The changes I propose create an opportunity for a return<br />
to industrial peace, to give recovery the best possible<br />
chance, to provide the best climate for continuing<br />
essential reform of the labour market, and to protect the<br />
rights and living standards of Australians.<br />
Mr Kennett has referred to this as " gutless."<br />
In fact, acts of destruction require no courage.<br />
Looking after people's living standards and protecting<br />
them against exploitation while bringing on economic<br />
recovery is a much harder thing to do. It requires more<br />
courage and more faith in our fellow Australians and<br />
the rewards are much greater.<br />

<p>LAURIE OAKES: It is not a cover-up, Mr Reith, when they have<br />
an election campaign not only you don't mention these<br />
policies but in fact say that no worker will lose any benefit<br />
under awards. Surely that's a cover-up if it's not a lie?<br />
PETER REITH: It may arguably be put that they have brought<br />
down a policy which was different to what they had said before<br />
the election. I'm not dS 0? ocieAM<br />
