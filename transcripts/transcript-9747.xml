TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
OPENING OF THE MCARTHUR RIVER MINING PROJECT,<br />
NORTHERN TERRITORY, 6 SEPTEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Thank you indeed, Administrator, Chief Minister, Ambassador Hasegawa,<br />
your colleagues Mr Kohno and Mr Sakamoto, the Chairman of Mt isa Mines<br />
Mr Bruce Vaughan, distinguished members of the company, my ministerial<br />
colleagues who are with me Laurie Brereton and Bob Collins Barry Coulter<br />
Minister from the Northern Territory involved with the project, Warren<br />
Snowdbn the Member for the Northern Territory, members of the Government<br />
of the Northern Territory, other distinguished representatives and ladies and<br />
gentlemen. It has been a great pleasure for me to be able to come here today, to<br />
participate in this project which, I think, many will see as part of the<br />
renaissance of one of Australia's great mining companies Mt Isa Mines.<br />
This is a company with a great tradition in mining in this country. One that<br />
goes back many years to that great deposit at Mt Isa and the mining of it and<br />
in other important projects and that great pioneering and adventurous spirit<br />
which we have seen from this company and from Australian mining.<br />
I think we are seeing something new today. We are seeing the adventurous<br />
spirit of Australian mining coupled with a new understanding about the<br />
environment, new technology and social responsibility. That is what, I think,<br />
makes this project so significant. It is not just another project. It is a project<br />
which might not have happened though it always had the potential to happen.<br />
It has happened because people wanted it to happen. Governments wanted<br />
it to happen. The company with this technology wanted it to happen and they<br />
found a partnership again with our great partners in Japan to make it happen.<br />
All of these things, I think, are milestones in its future.<br />
Mr Fruend ( Executive General Manager, Project Development, MIM Holdings<br />
Limited) was kind enough to mention One Nation and yesterday I had the<br />
pleasure of opening the new international terminal in Brisbane which was part<br />
of the One Nation program as well. A month earlier, I had the pleasure of<br />
joining Laurie Brereton on the One Nation train which for the first time carried<br />
freight from Brisbane to Perth via Melbourne on a single gauge and which </p>
<p>tied the country together as never before and yesterday I reminded people in<br />
Brisbane that in One Nation we removed the interface between the domestic<br />
and international carriage of passengers, where we folded Australian Airlines<br />
into Qantas and then made it a strong private company, where we are now<br />
trying tobuild Ansett as an international as well as a domestic company. We<br />
saw One Nation as pulling Australia together the very name underwrote the<br />
concept and at the same time kick start the economy which it did and since<br />
then, of course, we have had 16 consecutive quarters of growth. Four<br />
straight years of growth. It is the longest phase in Australian growth in<br />
years with low inflation at around 2.5 per cent.<br />
We are now outgrowing most other western economies and as a<br />
consequence we have had huge employment growth at around 4 to 5 per<br />
cent employment growth, around three times as much as most other<br />
comparable industrial societies.<br />
As a consequence of One Nation we introduced something to kick start<br />
projects such as this. And we kick started them with the investment<br />
allowance, but they needed more than that, they needed co-operation. They<br />
needed to be brought together and because One Nation also implied bringing<br />
it together as one, we had a co-operative venture between the Government of<br />
the Northern Territory, the Government of the Commonwealth, Ministers of<br />
the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory and, of course, co-operation<br />
with the Aboriginal community of this area. With that co-operation we gave<br />
the lie to the notion that the Aboriginal people are opposed to development,<br />
that things can't be done and we have given not only birth to a new mine and<br />
to a new enterprise, but a new spirit of co-operation which will underpin the<br />
Mabo legislation and all of the other things which will follow once we<br />
recognise some of the essential truths that had to be recognised. That there<br />
was a civilisation here before European people arrived. That now, because<br />
of our High Court decision, the common law of Australia no longer comes<br />
from European custom and tradition but also Aboriginal custom and tradition<br />
and that the Commonwealth has enacted a piece of law which pulls together,<br />
understands who has this title and how it can be awarded, but in the granting<br />
of it tries to make a reparation or reconciliation with Aboriginal Australians<br />
which is honest and real.<br />
That is why this project is going because that good will is there. And it came<br />
from the companies, it came from the governments and, I hope, one of the<br />
consequences of it is that MIM which has been at various times in recent<br />
years, in the doldrums particularly with low zinc prices, could find itself reborn<br />
as a company, as a new age Australian company, as a can do business that<br />
gets things done. Against the odds, it has been able to develop this project<br />
and I certainly pay a tribute to the company. To Bruce Vaughan Chairman,<br />
Nick Stump Chief Executive Office and to Peter Freund who was the ramrod<br />
on the project to get it going, that these people saw something better beyond<br />
silly factionalism and mindless politics and mean spiritedness towards the<br />
Aboriginal communities displayed by other mining companies and they<br />
actually got it up and got it running. At $ 300 million a year or thereabouts, if<br />
the mine runs for 20 years we will see around $ 6 billion a very large addition </p>
<p>to the country's wealth and accords a large addition to its capacity to pay its<br />
way. Let me also take this opportunity to salute the technologists because there is<br />
a new terchnological barrier being breached here in milling this product down<br />
to a very fine powder and then finding the extractive processes to take the<br />
silicates et cetera from it to produce the zinc. I would say to our colleagues in<br />
Japan I hope that they understand that when they deal with an Australian<br />
business, and I'm sure they do, that it is real and it will be here in five years<br />
or ten years or 15 years and that when you do business with Australia you<br />
don't wake up in the morning, some morning, to find a general in charge of<br />
the country, that it is the solid democracy, that our word matters that you can<br />
litigate your interests here in our courts and like you we are a democracy and<br />
also like you we don't have a two tiered society. We used to have the<br />
remnants of our failed upper class, they have disappeared, thankfully, into<br />
obscurity. And as a consequence, we have essentially, one group of<br />
Australians as you have one group of Japanese. I think this is an important<br />
thing, that the egalitarianism which exists in Australia also exists in Japan.<br />
This is not well understood in Australia. It is one of the reasons we do things<br />
together and we do them well. As the Ambassador and I know, all to happily,<br />
of the great partnership we now have with the Government of Japan and the<br />
people of Japan, better than a commercial partnership, a great political and<br />
human partnership which has put the war years and the rest behind us and<br />
where we are now, through APEC, building a great pacific rim community and<br />
where, I think, we enjoy a relationship of trust which our two countries have<br />
never enjoyed before and one, I think, Japan rarely enjoys with any other<br />
country in the world. This is a matter of great pleasure to us.<br />
I'd like to say that I hope that our Japanese colleagues Mr Kohno and<br />
Sakamoto will find pleasure in this relationship as well as business and that<br />
we will go on to do other great things together. Because we can, I think, be<br />
relied upon. I'd like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to my colleagues,<br />
one in particular, Laurie Brereton, who I have grown up with, of course, in<br />
public life. Who pushed through all the big projects in NSW when weaker<br />
spirits wouldn't have and who took over this transport and mining<br />
responsibility from Bob Collins, who himself picked up the initial One Nation<br />
projects but where Laurie had this particular task as a facilitator to try to push<br />
this through as my Parliamentary Secretary. He did that, of course, with his<br />
colleague beside him from the Northern Territory, Barry Coulter, and I think<br />
Shane Stone and I here today to give evidence of that co-operation and to<br />
say how pleased we are about it.<br />
I hope the people of the Northern Territory can understand this. That their<br />
media can communicate the fact that something good is going on here and<br />
that something valuable has happened and that it is not about petty politics<br />
and mean spiritedness or even the narrow and limited gaze of news editors.<br />
That it is something grander than all of that and that people start to<br />
understand these things. </p>
<p>I want to say a special word about the Borroloola Aboriginal community and<br />
their good will. To the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial<br />
Development Corporation ( CDC) and Mawurli Corporation partners with<br />
Bums Philp in the Bing Bong Project which we have just seen and to say<br />
again this is the sort of involvement that we want to see with the Aboriginal<br />
community. Not simply royalty takers, price takers in a market, but people<br />
who are actually engaged in the business as well. Useful, responsible<br />
partners in the development of Australia. And if we have trust in them and<br />
respect for them we will see more of this. But those without faith and those<br />
without trust and those without respect will get obfuscation as they have in<br />
the past.<br />
I'd like to say that the freehold title, I think it is Bauhinia Downs, which the<br />
Commonwealth has purchased and given to the Gurdanji people and the<br />
freehold title which will come from it pleases me enormously. I was glad that<br />
the Commonwealth could spend $ 6 million diverting the road around the<br />
Borroloola Aboriginal community to make this a much more pleasant project<br />
for them. That all of these things could come together and that we could<br />
underwrite a new future of co-operation for mining and for governments and<br />
communities in this country.<br />
This is a great continent. It is a rich continent. It is inhabited by people who<br />
believe in the human spirit and in democracy. There is no end to its wealth,<br />
to its bounty, to its abundance. We only need the sense and the good will to<br />
be able to exploit it, but to do so in a way that pays tribute to the environment.<br />
That lets people understand that the Aboriginal community were trustees of<br />
this place for 40,000 years and have now given it to another society in<br />
partnership which must have respect for the land and must understand what<br />
a great inheritance we have been given. That is why it is incumbent upon<br />
mining companies and the exploiters of the land, the pastoralists, to<br />
understand this point. I am very glad that MIM does and in the new age of<br />
mining that taking the best and leaving the rest is something that does belong<br />
to some other epoch, that doesn't belong to now.<br />
So, respect for the environment, for the Aboriginal community, for the<br />
economic imperatives of Australia, for co-operation for the partnership with<br />
Japan, these are all the things that we celebrate today and why we are so<br />
pleased to be here for the opening of this historic project.<br />
