    <content><![CDATA[<p>This week the world will commemorate the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings.</p>
<p>The D-day landings changed the course of human history.</p>
<p>As part of the commemoration, I will join seven Australians who were there 70 years ago.</p>
<p>Over 3,000 Australians were involved – including 2,500 air force personnel who provided air support for the Allied landings.</p>
<p>Following the D-day commemorations, I will be travelling to Canada and the United States – and will be joined by Australian business leaders.</p>
<p>My message to overseas investors is that Australia is open for business.</p>
<p>The Government’s Economic Action Strategy to lower tax, cut red tape and encourage trade will improve the competitiveness of businesses – so that we can build a stronger Australia.</p>
<p>We welcome investment and we are making investment more attractive by scrapping the carbon tax and the mining tax, cutting 50,000 pages of red tape and ending the “analysis paralysis” on major projects.</p>
<p>Our international partners can see that our Budget is again under control, we are tackling debt and deficits and we are serious about building a strong and prosperous economy.</p>
<p>This year Australia hosts the G20 summit to encourage growth around the world and I will be advancing that cause during this trip.</p>
<p>The United States, Canada and France are long standing friends.  We stood together at D-Day, we trade every day and we have always shared a commitment to democracy, to enterprise and to people’s right to be free.</p>
