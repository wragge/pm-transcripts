Strength Through Diversity promotes the values that unite us as Australians – tolerance, justice and a ‘fair go'; for all.<br />
In order to advance these values, the Coalition Government will invest an additional $47 million over four years in multicultural, citizenship and settlement programs.<br />
Our policy seeks to develop a coalition of the community, the corporate sector and every level of government, thereby engaging all Australians in the task of building a united Australia and reaffirming our shared commitment to its democratic institutions, laws and values.<br />
Since 1996, we have made settlement programs more accountable and outcomes-oriented.  They are now aimed at ensuring newly arrived migrants and refugee and humanitarian program entrants become independent and active participants in Australia';s society as quickly as possible.<br />
A great deal has been achieved but we cannot rest on our laurels.  Recent events in the United States, and the fears, doubts and prejudices that have surfaced in their wake, challenge us to redouble our efforts to engender tolerance, respect for cultural diversity, and community harmony.<br />
A re-elected Coalition Government will:<br />
 Commit $1 million annually to promote Australian citizenship as the single most unifying force in our community, and to encourage eligible permanent residents to take out citizenship and participate fully in our democratic society;   Work with the Council for Multicultural Australia to implement The New Agenda for Multicultural Australia as a policy for all Australians, and to focus on policies that maximise the benefits of our cultural diversity;   Provide annual funding of $3.5 million to the Living in Harmony initiative;   Introduce an annual Living in Harmony grants round, in recognition of the fact that communities are best placed to develop the solutions to local problems and to combat racism at the grass roots; and Ensure our settlement programs remain the most comprehensive in the world by maintaining, on an ongoing basis, the funding first committed in the 1997/98 budget, at a cost of $29.2 million over four years.<br />
We have long enjoyed and celebrated the manifestations of Australia';s culturaI diversity.  I believe that the commitments I have made today will ensure that our cultural diversity continues to serve an even more important purpose – that of a unifying force.<br />
