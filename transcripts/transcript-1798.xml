COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
Rt Hon. J G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
INTERROGATION IN VIETNAM<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 14 March 19681<br />
Mr GORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
[ 8.35]-Mr Speaker, at the conclusion of<br />
the speech which he has just made the<br />
Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam)<br />
quoted some words which he attributed to<br />
me, and I think attributed rightly, to the<br />
effect that it was proper that information<br />
should not be suppressed and that facts<br />
should not be withheld from the public. of<br />
Australia. I suggest, Mr'Speaker, that the<br />
statement which has been made by the<br />
4inister for the Army ( Mr Lynch) tonight<br />
eIars out completely that the Government<br />
believes in that and is acting in accordance<br />
with that because the facts of this incident<br />
have been presented by the Minister for the<br />
Army to this chamber.<br />
r Clyde Cameron-What about<br />
._ son's report. Let us have a look at that.<br />
Mr SPEAKER--Order! I have already<br />
warned the honourable member for<br />
Hindmarsh earlier in the debate. If he<br />
persists in interjecting I will have to deal<br />
with him.<br />
Mr GORTON-The honourable member<br />
for Hindmarsh is quite eager, Mr Speaker,<br />
no doubt. But what is it that the Minister<br />
for the Army's statement has presented to<br />
this House as to what has happened? Let<br />
me recapitulate the situation that has been<br />
presented by the Minister for the Armya<br />
situation which has not been, denigrated<br />
or attacked at all by the Leader of the<br />
Opposition. That situation was that Australian<br />
troops in Vietnam, having just been<br />
engaged in one of the greatest engagements<br />
13968168 fought by Australian troops in that area,<br />
were being harassed. Their -patrols were<br />
being reported upon. They were being<br />
endangered by an enemy agent with a radio<br />
set who was reporting on their movements<br />
and reporting on what was happening in<br />
their base camp. Is it not clear that this<br />
would endanger the lives of Australian<br />
soldiers? Is that not perfectly evident? That<br />
was disclosed and so far has not been<br />
rebutted. Then, Mr Speaker, what<br />
happened? What happened was that the<br />
agent so engaged was captured along with<br />
the transceiver and the radio. set which she<br />
was using as an enemy agent to endanger<br />
Australian troops. Then she was taken to<br />
an interrogation tent and,' Mr Speaker, at<br />
this stage I must say that it is perfectly true<br />
that having been taken to an interrogation<br />
tent the. spirit of the Geneva Agreement,<br />
which probably did not apply to this civilian<br />
anyway-Opposition members-Oh!<br />
Mr GORTON-AiI . right.. The Opposition'wants<br />
to apply it. Apply it. I am speaking<br />
in my own way..<br />
Mr SPEAKER--Order! The honourable<br />
member ' for Stirling will cease interjecting.<br />
I have already arned him already in the<br />
debate. Mr Webb-Oh!<br />
Mr SPEAKER-If I have not warned<br />
him* then I am Warning him now. I suggest<br />
h should not continue to interrupt. </p>
<p>Mr GORTON-To repeat what I was<br />
saying, whether members of the Opposition<br />
like it or not-and perhaps they do notthe<br />
Geneva Agreement, as I understand it,<br />
applies to prisoners of war, not to civilian<br />
franc tireurs, but -the Australian Government<br />
applies, and seeks to apply, the spirit of<br />
the Geneva Agreement even to these civilian<br />
agents and franc tireurs. But it is nevertheless<br />
true no matter what brouhaha comes<br />
from the other side of the House -that the<br />
Geneva Agreement itself in these circumstances<br />
is most unlikely -to apply. But the<br />
agent was taken and the spirit of the Geneva<br />
Agreement, I am bound to say, was exceeded.<br />
To what extent? It was exceeded<br />
to the extent that the interrogating officer<br />
raised his voice and this is not allowed<br />
under the Geneva Agreement. Honourable<br />
members opposite should read it if they do<br />
not believe this. Prisoners may only be<br />
asked questions as to -their name, their rank<br />
and their number. The interrogator is not<br />
even allowed to ask for that information<br />
in a loud voice. But this interrogating officer<br />
did. He raised his voice. He shouted. Do<br />
you know what he did, Mr Speaker? He<br />
even banged on the table when he was talking<br />
to -this spy who was engaged in activities<br />
endangering Australian forces. He even<br />
smashed his fist on the table. This is not<br />
allowed by the Geneva Agreement, but this<br />
is what he did. He went further. He sought<br />
by threats and by intimidation, which are<br />
not allowed by the Geneva Agreement, to<br />
discover information. I do not know what<br />
that information was, ' but could it not have<br />
been-and if it were would it not have been<br />
important-What were the last messages<br />
you sent out as to where Australian patrols<br />
were and where they were going?', s o that<br />
ambushes could be -laid for them? I do not<br />
know. But he banged his fist on the table<br />
when he was seeking this information. He<br />
raised his voice. He went further. He<br />
threatened and he intimidated. This is all in<br />
the report of the Minister for the Army. He<br />
went further than that. He went much<br />
further than that because he not only<br />
threatened that he would use the water<br />
treatment-or water torture as the Opposition<br />
would call it-but he began to pour<br />
water down the throat of this woman.<br />
Mr Daly-What a scandalous thing.<br />
Mr GORTON-Yes, a shocking thing.<br />
But let me say this in response to something<br />
the Leader of ' the Opposition said. He said that we would have ' little chance<br />
-to complain if Australian soldiers were captured<br />
by the Vietcong or the North Vietnamese.<br />
If the worst that happened to Australian<br />
soldiers was that somebody banged<br />
on the table, raised his voice and poured<br />
one cup of water down -their throats then<br />
we would not have very much to complain<br />
of. There are people in this House and<br />
there are people in this country who know<br />
what a water treatment or a water torture<br />
really is. There are people in this House<br />
hwahdo thhea vree abl eewna tperr istoonretursre , o fn owt arth isa nmd awtteho<br />
applied to them. Those in this House anujthose<br />
throughout this country know this-<br />
Nobody walks away from that; no<br />
walks out of a tent under his own pow,-Is'<br />
photographed, poses and is driven away.<br />
What has been disclosed on this? Let u<br />
be clear that the spirit of the Geneva Agreement<br />
-has been transgressed but it has not<br />
been transgressed -to the extent to which it<br />
is sought to be presented that it has been<br />
transgressed. It has not been transgressed<br />
to the point that any real torture has been<br />
applied. Even so, in compliance with the<br />
approach of the Australian Military Forces,<br />
in compliance with the instructions issued to<br />
the Australian Military Forces, because this<br />
went beyond the bounds that were laid<br />
down, therefore in spite of what I have sale~<br />
the interrogator was removed from in th. I<br />
future interrogating any other prisoners.<br />
That I suggest clearly indicates the approach<br />
of the Australian Military Forces in this<br />
matter. It clearly indicates -that even in this<br />
kind of circumstance the Australians<br />
operating not only in an honourable<br />
but in a way which in effect is dangerous<br />
to them-far more dangerous to them than<br />
what the Leader of the Opposition has suggested<br />
that something which could come<br />
out of this incident could be dangerous to<br />
, them. Let me ask all members of the House<br />
a question. We are--perhaps the Opposition<br />
is not but -the rest of us are and the majority<br />
of the people of, this country are-responsible<br />
for believing that we should be serving<br />
in Vietnam and for sending troops to serve<br />
in Vietnam. Having done that, even members<br />
of the Opposition, . I would have<br />
thought, would want to see that the safety<br />
of those troops was safeguarded.<br />
Mr Bryant-Turn it up. </p>
<p>Mr G40RTON-AUI right. Let me ask<br />
them -this and see what -answer I get to this<br />
question: If they were in charge of a military<br />
camp in Vietnam and they discovered,<br />
any one of them-<br />
Mr Hayden-What about Archbishop<br />
Strong's attitude?<br />
Mr GORTON-You, if you like. You are<br />
a policeman. If you discovered-<br />
Mft Hayden-What are Archbishop<br />
Strong's views?<br />
C -Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable<br />
-member for Oxley is continually interjecting.<br />
I ask him to restrain himself.<br />
Ar GORTON-What I was asking the<br />
honourable member for Oxley before he<br />
ceased to restrain himself was whether if<br />
K. he were in charge of a military camp in<br />
Vietnam -and he discovered in that camp<br />
a civilian who he knew had set booby traps<br />
throughout that camp, he would regard it as<br />
such a terrible thing to raise his voice when<br />
he asked that person where those booby<br />
traps were, or to bash his fist on the table<br />
when he said: ' Did you put them in these<br />
tents or those tents?' Or would he-perhaps<br />
he would-say: ' Well, this is just too bad.<br />
We will let the Australian troops find out<br />
where the booby traps are by falling over<br />
them.'<br />
C. Mrt SPEAKER-Order! I warn the<br />
honourable member for Mitchell, who is<br />
interjecting. Mir GORTON-Would he only say to<br />
Qthiisr civilian: ' VWhat is your name? What is<br />
rank? What is your number?' and let<br />
-L. ings go. It is not to be assumed for one<br />
minute from what I am saying that the<br />
Australian Army does not apply the Geneva<br />
conventions because it does. It is not to be<br />
assumed for one minute-and the actions<br />
of the Army authorities underline thisthat<br />
they believe even the departure which<br />
this interrogator made should be condoned.<br />
But we do need, I think, as a House of<br />
Parliament and as a nation, to realise this:<br />
We are engaged in armed combat. There is<br />
talk of bringing people out-flying them<br />
out. After all, people spoke about what was<br />
attributed to me and it was not attributed<br />
to me in my name and I can do the same.<br />
This talk, which I have no doubt is well<br />
based, of flying out this enemy agent to<br />
put her in a box somewhere in Australia, under safe conduct, to be examined by a<br />
Judge, to say anything she liked, to make<br />
any kind of propaganda she liked, to make<br />
any kind of lying story she liked, is an<br />
impossible approach to a situation in which<br />
we in Australia find ourselves today. Let us<br />
draw the lines perfectly clearly here. We are<br />
not going to be put into a situation where<br />
the morale of our armed forces is going to<br />
be attacked by this kind of imputation. We<br />
are not going to be put into a situation<br />
where our intelligence techniques are laid<br />
open to an enemy by some open inquiry<br />
such as is suggested by the Opposition. We<br />
will not do it. If they want to do it, let<br />
them say so. We say we will not. Let us<br />
fight it out on that line, if it takes all<br />
summer. That having been said, I now go on to<br />
this, Mr. Speaker: There has been some<br />
attack upon the Minister for the Army,<br />
some suggestion that he has been improper<br />
in what he has done. He has not been<br />
improper in any way at all and the statement<br />
which he presented to this House<br />
makes this abundantly clear. He was under<br />
the impression and given the information<br />
that there had been an investigation in<br />
Vietnam which had said there had been no<br />
ill-treatment. Because he felt that needed<br />
further investigation he said that he would<br />
set up a court of inquiry. Subsequently,<br />
because he then discovered-not having<br />
been told before-that there had been an<br />
investigation in Vietnam which -in fact had<br />
discovered this degree of ill-treatment, it<br />
became perfectly abundantly clear, surely,<br />
that there was no point in setting up a court<br />
of inquiry to discover whether the facts<br />
about an incident should be investigated<br />
when in fact the facts about that incident<br />
had already, by the first investigation, been<br />
made clear and been presented to this<br />
House. In relation to this incident there<br />
can be no requirement -for any further<br />
action. The facts have been presented.<br />
There has been some ill-treatment of a<br />
degree which the Australian people in their<br />
own commonsense and their own judgment<br />
will judge. It has gone beyond the strict<br />
letter of the Geneva Convention. It has<br />
gone beyond it in circumstances of not calm<br />
legal discussion-not an atmosphere of<br />
courts of law-but beyond it in a situation<br />
oA' fighting and of strife and of violence<br />
and of life and of death. I would like to<br />
say, Mr Speaker, that this kind of thing </p>
<p>will never happen again, because we do not<br />
believe it should. But it would be a wrong<br />
and stupid thing for me to say that this<br />
kind of thing could never happen again.<br />
Men are engaged in war. Their lives are<br />
forfeit. It is an astonishing thing to meperhaps<br />
not so. astonishing considering some<br />
of the experiences we have all had-that<br />
in this kind of circumstances there have not<br />
been allegations of real substance made<br />
about mistreatment,-not of prisoners-of-war,<br />
because that does not happen, but of<br />
civilian spies-that there have not been real<br />
allegations of substantive mistreatment, that<br />
there have not been more instances of this.<br />
I think it says a great deal for the Australian<br />
Military Forces and for the instructions<br />
which they are given and to which<br />
they adhere, that in this kind of warfare,<br />
that in the circumstances of espionage and<br />
reporting to which they are exposed, there<br />
has come out of this conflict merely this one<br />
incident which we deplore, which we hope<br />
will not be repeated but which, . when it is<br />
all boiled down, relates to threats, to<br />
intimidation, to a loud voice, to bluff about<br />
water torture and to the beginning-and<br />
this we do not condone-of such torture.<br />
At the end of it-<br />
Mr Uren-Does the Prime Minister<br />
support thuggery?.<br />
Mr SPEAKER-Order!<br />
Mr GORTON-I cannot pick up a word<br />
the honourable member is saying.<br />
Mr Uren-I said-<br />
. Mr SPEAKER-Order! The House will<br />
come to order. Mr Uren-I said: Do you support<br />
thuggery? Thuggery is a-<br />
Mr GORTON-I can assure the honourable<br />
member. that I do not support thuggery.<br />
Indeed, I thought it was abolished in India<br />
some 50 years ago by imperial decree. If<br />
it has not been abolished then I would be<br />
glad to help to abolish it. What I was saying<br />
before I became intermittently interrupted<br />
was that out of this incident has emerged<br />
this: There was somebody endangering Australian<br />
troops. That somebody was interrogated.<br />
That interrogation did go beyond the<br />
bounds of the Geneva Convention. At the<br />
end-perhaps this'has something to do with<br />
thuggery-of that interrogation the sub'r-t,<br />
was able to walk out of the tent to<br />
photographed, to pose for photographs.<br />
Then Mr Cross--A bit wet perhaps.<br />
Mr GORTON-Yes, a little vet, I agree.<br />
Perhaps, Mr' Speaker, we could conclude<br />
on that interjection. At the end of the interrogation<br />
she was able to walk out. She was<br />
able to be photographed. She was able to<br />
be flown out in a United States aircraft.<br />
But it must be admitted, she was a little<br />
wet. Let me say this: This sort of interrogation<br />
should not happen. But to put it in<br />
perspective, how far did it go? Was there<br />
real -torture of the kind that people in this<br />
House know? In the stress and strain of<br />
fighting this may happen again; but if it'<br />
does it will be as it was on this occasion.<br />
It will be because of an individual acting<br />
aga'inst the instructions given . by the Army<br />
arid against the instructions given by the<br />
Government, and who, because he acted.;'<br />
that way, was removed from the position<br />
previously held.<br />
