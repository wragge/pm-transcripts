    <content><![CDATA[<p>I will travel to Singapore for meetings with President Tan and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to progress Australia’s economic, defence and security links.</p>
<p>In its 50 years as a nation, Singapore has become a dynamic economic and security partner for Australia.</p>
<p>It is Australia’s sixth largest source of foreign direct investment and our fifth largest trading partner with total trade of $30 billion.</p>
<p>The Minister for Trade and Investment and senior business leaders will join me to promote an Australian economy that is open for business.</p>
<p>Following the release of the Government’s Northern Australia White Paper, I will also host a high-level roundtable on investment opportunities in our great north with Singapore’s leading investors and the First Ministers of the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia.</p>
<p>I am honoured to be delivering the 35th Singapore Lecture, entitled ‘Our Common Challenges: Strengthening Security in the Region’ under the distinguished chairmanship of Singapore’s Deputy Prime Minister Mr Teo Chee Hean.</p>
