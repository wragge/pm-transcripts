PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 4 FEBRUARY 1986<br />
The Prime Minister today officially handed over to the<br />
International Committee of the Red Cross the first of the<br />
Hercules aircraft the Government has offered to provide for the<br />
airlift of food supplies to famine areas in Africa.<br />
The International Committee of the Red Cross will use the<br />
aircraft for its relief operations in Africa for a 12 month<br />
period commencing 1 March 1986.<br />
The Hercules C130A was handed over at Richmond RAAF Base, near<br />
Sydney, to the Assistant Secretary-General of the Australian Red<br />
Cross Society, Mr Alan McLean, representing the International<br />
Committee of the Red Cross.<br />
The ICRC has demonstrated a capacity for effective distribution<br />
of humanitarian aid in Ethiopia and elsewhere in Africa.<br />
The aircraft is scheduled to leave Richmond tomorrow for<br />
Bordeaux, France, for further mechanical refurbishment before it<br />
commences operations in Ethiopia in March.<br />
The Government offered to provide two C130A aircraft for famine<br />
relief work in Africa following a request by Bob Geldof, of Live<br />
Aid, and to meet the costs of making the aircraft flightworthy<br />
and ferrying them to Africa. This was initially estimated to cost<br />
between $ 1.1 million and $ 1.7 million. </p>
