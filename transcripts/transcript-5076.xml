PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 19 JUNE 1979<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE: FOLLOWING CABINET MEETING<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think we all know that the Kurnell Refinery dispute, which is<br />
going to cause enormously severe disruption in N. S. W. and<br />
possibly beyond that, has arisen out of divided industrial<br />
jurisdiction in N. S. W. itself. There is now a Federal award<br />
covering the industry. The State Branch of the AWU wants to<br />
break away from that and re-establish the authority of the<br />
N. S. W. Industrial Commission. There have been a number of<br />
arguments about this particular case. The Tribunals have met<br />
on a number of occasions and the umpire's verdict to this<br />
point has in fact been given supporting the Federal jurisdiction.<br />
I b1-elieve that overwhelmingly there is support for one<br />
jurisdiction in this industry. It makes no sense at all to have<br />
a divided jurisdiction which can only lead to additional disruption.<br />
Indeed, if there had never been more than one jurisdiction<br />
this particular dispute now would not be with us. It's origins<br />
lie in the divided jurisdiction. But there is certainly no<br />
ser. se whether it is within N. S. W. or within Australia, in having the<br />
oil. industry subject par _ ly to a Federal jurisdiction and partly to<br />
a State jurisdiction. Therefore, the Federal authority, ought,<br />
I believe, be upheld very strongly indeed. It is worth noting<br />
that the N. S. W. Government is using its emergency powers to ration<br />
petrol. It is not using its emergency powers to try and achieve<br />
a resumption of work and that I think is very significant.<br />
It is also significant that N. S. W. is being held to ransom<br />
in this way as a result of the dispute by about 400 people and<br />
400 people who are certainly not amongst the lowest paid throughout<br />
the Australian community. I think, as I have said on other<br />
occasions, that if Premier Wran could only say in forthright<br />
termis that he supported the Federal jurisdiction or if he didn't<br />
wa-nt-to say that to say that he supported the umpire's decision<br />
in relation to this matter that at least part of the problem<br />
would tend to be overcome; because there has been a view,<br />
widely shared throughout the industry, as I understand it, that<br />
the N. S. W. Government gives tacit support to the State AWU in<br />
trying to break away from Federal jurisdiction.<br />
There is a meeting tomorrow between Sir John Moore and the<br />
C1-ai'Lr--an of teN. S. W. Industrial Commission. I applaud the<br />
fact that that meeting is taking place, I would hope that it<br />
will be able to resolve the matter. But again, as I am advised,<br />
Sir John Moore will be seeking to uphold Federal authority<br />
ad jurisdiction because in the longer term this is regarded<br />
as important for the industry itself. If N. S. W. is in a very<br />
difficult position, it would probably depend upon the other<br />
States being able to use their own emergency powers if any<br />
additional supplies of petrol were to be diverted to N. S. W.,<br />
because there is no surplus available, as we are advised this<br />
afternoon. Whether other States would be prepared to run short<br />
themselves to assist N. S. W. in this situation is a matter that<br />
clearly they would have to consider. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Prime Minister-( continued)<br />
The Commonwealth is very mnuch concerned at the problems arising<br />
out of this particular case; not just for the present, not<br />
just for the severity and the harm and the damage which will come<br />
as a result of the selfishness of 400 people in the State Branch<br />
of the AWU. Very often, people believe that the Commonwealth<br />
has power to resolve a matter. Very of-ten they believe we have<br />
power to intervene in a matter when in fact our own constitutional<br />
power is limited and when it is within the hands of a State<br />
Government, as indeed, both the Kurnell dispute and the<br />
Western Australian dispute are on this occasion. Against this<br />
background, against the additional problems that are so often<br />
with us as a result of divided jurisdiction State and<br />
Commonwealth we are prepared to re-examine the basis of our<br />
industrial framework right from the beginning, from its very<br />
fundanentals. We are therefore going to put ourselves in a<br />
position of having discussions with the States, with employer<br />
organisations, and with the trade union movement with the<br />
-Australian Council of Trade Unions to see whether or not any<br />
consensus can be reached about the advisability of the States<br />
referring, even if only for a trial period, their industrial<br />
powers to the Commonwealth. Now, I don't suggest for one moment<br />
that that would end all disputes, but I do believe it would end<br />
a significant cause of a number of disputes when people in the<br />
same industry, but under different industrial jurisdictions,<br />
seek to capitalise on the best in both awards and there is a<br />
lean-frogging process Set in train and an attempt to get<br />
into the jurisdiction that may offer the highest payments for<br />
a particular industry. This matter, because it is a very<br />
sicznificant decision even to embark on this particular discussion<br />
with the States, with the ACTU and with employer organisations,<br />
has been discussed with the Minister for Industrial Relations,<br />
Tony Street, during the course of the afternoon. He is fully<br />
in accord with the approach that is adopted. Quite clearly, this<br />
doesn't offer any immediate solution to the current situation.,<br />
But I hope it will offer a productive basis for discussions in<br />
a reasonable and rational way between the Commonwealth and the<br />
States, employers and the trade union movement in seeking to<br />
improve the basis of industrial relations within this country.<br />
I should emphasise that no decision has been taken that the<br />
Commonwealth wishes to pursue a particular course. We want to<br />
examine the whole matter from its very fundamentals, with the<br />
es t-hat,-are in-volved to try and come up with a much better<br />
solution than that which we now have. We would want to achieve<br />
a maximum rationalisation, if possible single authority, at least<br />
for a trial period, that could well involve a referral of power<br />
by States but again,.-it couldbe for a trial period.<br />
Quite plainly, these are substantial matters and this alone<br />
would make it worthwhile listing industrial relations as an issue<br />
for discussion at the next Premier's Conference. The Commonwealth<br />
will be doing that.<br />
If I could turn now to the day of national protest the<br />
resolution passed by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and<br />
to the situation that has arisen over activities in Western<br />
Australia. The Government has looked at this matter and it has<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
looked at the Australian Council of Trade Unions resolution<br />
and is very firmly of the view that this is a vast over-reaction<br />
to a particular matter which the Premier of Western Australia<br />
had in any case said was under review; that the application of<br />
the Police Act or that section of it would be under review by<br />
the Western Australian Government. It is<br />
well known that there is a general review going on of western<br />
Australian industrial legislation. Against the background of<br />
that to cause a day of national protest to lead to disputes and<br />
difficulties, maybe going far beyond what might happen on<br />
Thursday, is an over-reaction which can do enormous damage to<br />
Australia, enormous damage to the trade unionists involved.<br />
I don't believe for one moment that the Australian Council of<br />
Trade Unions believes that their right to assembly and their<br />
right to organise and all the rest is threatened-b ! cause these<br />
things are deeply embedded within Australian society. Nobody<br />
off-'-ers any threat to that whatsoever.<br />
But how can we proceed with the task of continuing with<br />
the anti-inflationary battle? How can we proceed with the task<br />
of providing greater employment opportunities for people right<br />
throughout this continent; how can we proceed with the task<br />
of strengthening the Australian economy when a resolution with<br />
potentially such damaging consequences was passed by the<br />
Australian Council of Trade Unions as they passed this afternoon?<br />
We all know that trade unions have great power, but this must be<br />
one of the most irresponsible uses of that power that Australia<br />
has ever seen.<br />
In Western Australia, whatever one may think of the particular<br />
dispute and there are differing versions of the facts, I make<br />
no comment about that, that will come out in the court itself,<br />
in the Magistrate's Court but the dispute in no way justifies<br />
the action, the reaction, that has occurred. I think it ought<br />
to be understood that something is said about the current<br />
industrial climate by the fact that the AMWSU and one or two<br />
other significant unions have already much earlier, before<br />
this ever arose made a decision to have a national stoppage of<br />
their own unions on Thursday to support wage claims. That had<br />
nothing to do with Western Australia. It hadn't then arisen.<br />
Aa-Lnst that background it ought to be noted that the cause,<br />
the purpose of the stoppage, has obviously been altered.<br />
That in itself was a totally irresponsible act because there is<br />
an Arbitration Commission. There are industrial tribunals.<br />
We can only achieve some degree of industrial harmony and peace<br />
if we have a situation in which both employers and employees.<br />
are prepared the verdicts that flow from those tribunals. There<br />
is no need to try and strengthen an argumentwithindustrial muscle.<br />
That adds nothing to the merits of the case and it does harm<br />
to the members concerned, the unionists concerned who lose<br />
wages. It does harm to the industries and it jeopardizes the<br />
economic recovery within Australia. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
We need to understand that Sir Charles Court has said that<br />
this section of the Police Act will be reviewed and against<br />
that background Senator Durack will be having talks with<br />
his counterpart in Western Australia, Mr. Metcalffe who is<br />
I think at this moment travelling back from overseas. We are<br />
also asking Mr. Peter Nolan, from the ACTU and such other<br />
members of the ACTU Executive or officers as Mr. Nolan himself<br />
would wish, to come to Canberra first thing tomorrow morning<br />
for discussions with myself and other Ministers Mr. Viner<br />
obviously; Mr. Macphee. There might well be one or two others<br />
there in addition.<br />
I think it is worth noting that the ACTU resolution not only<br />
calls a day of protest, whether there is a significance in the<br />
fazt that they haven't called a national strike or not as such,<br />
but a day of protest which to this point does not necessarily<br />
involve. all States or all unions. But going beyond that<br />
they have talked of a ban on the export of key commodities<br />
fromL Australia and if requested by Western Australian trade<br />
unionists, a selected blockade on Western Australia and then<br />
a niumtber of matters are also involved in their resolution.<br />
But tCo elevate this incident in Western Australia to one in<br />
which -they could contemplate a ban on the export of Australia's<br />
major produce, major commodities, or a selected ban on the<br />
whole of a State, can only cause irrepairable harm to Western<br />
Auistralia, to the trade unions involved and to this nation.<br />
I urge all employers on Thursday to keep their workplaces open<br />
and I also urge all trade unionists who are prepared to put<br />
this nation first to turn up for work. We will be contacting<br />
employer organisations -through tonight and tomorrow seeking to<br />
make sure that they do have their places of employment open and<br />
provide the opportunity for those who do want to put Australia<br />
first and put this total irresponsibility aside.<br />
Question On t;-he general question of industrial disputes. That ( inaudible).<br />
Are you prepared to put that question to the people and if so...<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Let's take things gently to start with. If States were prepared<br />
to go along with our proposal, as I understand it, it would<br />
be Dossible for them to make a referral of powers available to<br />
us 4f necessary, * for a limited period perhaps. That might<br />
enzo', rage greater involvement than would otherwise be the case.<br />
But, Jit. is early days yet.-We are prepared to re-examine our<br />
tota. approach to these matters and at least remove one of the<br />
potential causes of grave dispute of the kind we have had at<br />
Kurnell. But I think if it was going to be successful it would<br />
need not only the goodwill of States, also the goodwill of<br />
sections, important sections, of the trade union movement.<br />
So we will need to be entering into a process of discussion<br />
on this particular matter. </p>
<p>Question would you like to see transferred to the Commonwealth.<br />
What sort of powers?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It's the powers that would basically give, provide, one<br />
industrial jurisdiction instead of two.<br />
Question Over all-' the unions, or just the unions which would be<br />
involved in~ the leap-frogging?<br />
Prirme-Minister<br />
Well, where you've got divided jurisdiction that leap-frogging<br />
p rocess can always take place; if there is a divided jurisdiction<br />
in-relation to a particular industry.<br />
Question What'L about industries where there is just one jurisdiction, say<br />
a State jurisdiction?<br />
Prime; Minister<br />
Well I think there are very few industries that are confined<br />
to the boundaries of one State.<br />
Question So it would be all unions?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I don't think you really want to take this too far at the<br />
moment and try and get into the details of the many matters<br />
that will need discussions with the States. We all know that<br />
for a long while there have been difficulties because of the<br />
diffJerences in jurisdiction between the State and the Commonwealth<br />
in relation to a number of important industries. That does not<br />
he2. D the industrial climate in Australia. Now we are prepared<br />
-to re-examine that from its very fundamentals and I hope that<br />
the States and the trade union movement would also be prepared<br />
to enter into that examination in good faith, in a realistic<br />
attempt to achieve a situation which can at least remove some<br />
of = ie causes of dispute from thiLs nation.<br />
Question ( Inaudible) it won't be ultimately necessary to do<br />
that ( inaudible) whether the States agree or not?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
If you had the referral of powers from the States I think it<br />
could well not be. / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
Question I understand that last well I remember that last year you<br />
wrote to the various Premiers with respect -to the leap-frogging<br />
problem trying to get around this problem. What was the<br />
response from the various States and if any State ( inaudible)<br />
how would you now overcome that problem?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There has been a minimal response from the Premiers to that<br />
letter I sent after the last National Wage Case. But, the<br />
particular proposal that we have now put was not specifically<br />
placed before the Premiers at that time.<br />
Ques tion<br />
What will this decision tonight what effect will it have<br />
on getti ng petrol flowing in NSW.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I indicated that this was a longer-term matter and it can't<br />
have an immediate.-impact on the Kurnell dispute which has flown<br />
out of a divided jurisdiction. There is a meeting tomorrow<br />
between the Chairman of the NSW Industrial Commission at<br />
2: 00 o'clock and Sir John Moore, I think that is a very<br />
uSeful initiative. I strongly believe that the Federal<br />
jurisdiction, the authority, should be upheld because otherwise<br />
the oil industry is going to e fragmented and I would hope<br />
that whatever comes out of that meeting will be supported.<br />
But what I put, have spoken of, this afternoon, this evening,<br />
is against the longer-term background of trying to establish<br />
an environment in which Governments can work more closely<br />
together to remove some of the causes of disputes in Australia.<br />
QuestiLon Have you had contact with Mr. Wran at all?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, I haven't.. Our Cabinet meeting ended only relatively<br />
shortly before you came in and messages will be going to the<br />
Prentiers as soon as they can be draffted in relation to that<br />
particular matter. But, I emphasise it obviously doesn't offer<br />
a solution to the present dispute.<br />
Ou 0.= St<br />
How soon would you wish these talks with the States to go<br />
ahead on the question of referral of powers?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I have indicated that we will be listing the general question<br />
of industrial relations and this will obviously be a part to<br />
the Premieres Conference which is due to meet at the end of<br />
this month. So often, in the question of industrial disputes, / 7 </p>
<p>7<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
and we have had two classic examples over recent days, NSW<br />
with NSW powers very largely under divided jurisdiction<br />
that is causing the problem, and in Western Australia it is<br />
a different cause, different circumstances, but again, disputes<br />
of the utmost severity coming out of Western Australia in which<br />
our powers for dealing with it are very limited indeed.<br />
Question You have yourself said earlier today that the Western Australian<br />
court case is very likely to be adjourned. Do you think it would<br />
be useful to be holding discussions on such a long-term<br />
imnortant matter as the referral of powers, while obviously<br />
a fispute will still be going on in this particular area that<br />
you are talking about?<br />
Prire Minister<br />
But their Police Act the States would still have their<br />
Police Acts. le are talking about powers in relation to industrial<br />
jurisdiction and that wouldn't alter or modify or affect in<br />
any way what the various states have within their various<br />
Police Acts. So that in a sense is a separate question. It is<br />
only relevant to the extent that the dispute in Western Australia<br />
has risen out of State causes and the Commonwealth has very<br />
limited capacity to do much about it. The general proposal that<br />
we have put about a referral of industrial powers is not one<br />
that probably could have affected that kind of situation. It<br />
could I believe have a very real relevance in the NSW situation.<br />
But what has hapoened in W1estern Australia just emphasises<br />
again that we can have very severe disputes. People often<br />
look to the Cotonwealth for their resolution, they don't always<br />
see that the Commonwealth does not have the power, the<br />
constitutional right to intervene. While the causes are<br />
different, that happens to be true in a real sense in NSW at<br />
the moment and in a real sense in Western Australia.<br />
Question Do you see the contradiction', Mr. Fraser, between seeking<br />
more central Government power and the general philosophy ( inaudible).<br />
P-r-ie Minister<br />
Nc, none at all, because there are some things that a<br />
Co= rcnwealth has to do. The Commonwealth has to be responsible<br />
by and large for the management of the economy. You can't<br />
de-centralise that. But I ought to emphasise that decisions<br />
have not been made. The industrial climate is one of great<br />
seriousness and we are prepared to sit down with the States and<br />
the Australian Council of Trade Unions to see whether or not<br />
we cannot, together, devise a better approach to these<br />
particular matters. / 8 </p>
<p>8-<br />
Question On the question of Thursday's national protest, what will<br />
the Commonwealth' s attitude -to Co= rn. r.; ealth emrployees.. will they not be4-paid'<br />
Prime Minister<br />
People who don't turn up for work certainly won't get paid. I would<br />
hope that nobody who doesn't turn up for work would get paid<br />
whether it is Commonwealth employment, State employment or<br />
private employment.<br />
Question That will apply to Commonwealth public servants or other<br />
( inaudible)<br />
Prine Minister<br />
To Com-monwealth employees if they don't turn up for work<br />
they won't be paid. That's the normal rule that applies, there<br />
is nothing new in that.<br />
Question<br />
Will they be sacked?<br />
Prm Minister<br />
I think that's a different question.-<br />
Question<br />
You have indicated that you are not happy with the steps<br />
Mr. Wran has taken in his emergency powers, what are you<br />
suggesting he should have done to get those men back to work?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
That's for him to decide under his own emergency powers.<br />
He does have very extensive powers. I pointed out he has<br />
used those powers for one half of the equation and not for the<br />
other half.<br />
Q n<br />
Federal Government would use -the other half?<br />
= e: 1in r<br />
I -think it's reasonable enough'-to wait until you see the<br />
result of the conference being held tomorrow afternoon. But<br />
after that if there is still no resolution, Mr. Wran might well<br />
need to consider using those emergency powers. He was certainly<br />
prepared to use emergency powers in the " Truckies dispute"<br />
sometime ago and passed special legislation of a fairly severe<br />
kind, as you would understand. / 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
Question In the unlikely event that the States did agree to this<br />
proposition to hand over powers -to the Commonwealth, does<br />
the Federal Governmpent have any industrial legislation in<br />
mind to introduce to give us more, wider powers, to handle<br />
industrial disputes in the Federal jurisdiction?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The Commonwealth has significant powers in a number of areas.<br />
The Minister has proposals that will be being put to the<br />
Government very shortly when he returns from the International<br />
Labour Organisation meeting. The Arbitration Act is kept under<br />
pretty constant review. I think it has to be because it is<br />
a ci. anging scene. Tactics, approaches, differ as time passes.<br />
It is one area where I think there is no perfect law which<br />
WLII stand for all time. It depends very much on the practices<br />
that are pursued. As one gains experience you see things<br />
tnat need modification or change.<br />
Question Then propositions will be put to Cabinet regardless of this<br />
la-tes-t ( inaudible).<br />
Prime minister<br />
There have been propositions that have been under examination<br />
partly by Cabinet committee and by the Minister and relevant<br />
departments over the last four or five months. They have<br />
been under examination quite separately from the issues that<br />
are before us at the moment. 000---</p>
