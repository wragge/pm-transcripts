PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 4 April 1976<br />
TORAL TALK<br />
This week in Federal. Parliament, the Government announced<br />
three major initiatives that will benefit both Australian<br />
icdustry and hundreds of thousands of families and individuals.<br />
In separate statements the Government unveiled its long term<br />
blueprint for the motor vehicle industry; it set out<br />
clear and sensible guidelines for foreign investment<br />
in Australia and presented new initiatives for the home buyer.<br />
The motor vehicle industry and foreign investment moves<br />
will play a real role in greatly enhancing stability and<br />
security in Australian industry while the home savings<br />
plan will offer new hope for those who wish to own their<br />
own home.<br />
I wait to briefly comment on each of the three initiatives.<br />
It is worth noting that our plans for the motor vehicle<br />
industry have already received the support of the industry,<br />
the trade union movement, consumers and State Governments.<br />
Broadly, the GovernmenL has decided that its long term objective<br />
for the passenger motor vehicle industry can best be achieved<br />
by an 85 percent local content plan, supported by appropriate<br />
tariff arrangements. / 2 </p>
<p>In examinin~ g the industry, the Government pinpointed<br />
areas of special concern.<br />
We looked at the importance of the industry as an employer<br />
of labour and capi-tal. Many Australian cities and towns<br />
rely on the mctor vehicle industry as the main source of<br />
employment. We specifically looked at the importance of.. the<br />
industry to South Australia and I am pleased that the South<br />
Australian Premiez strongly supports our moves.<br />
OZE course, another major concern was that-consumers had access<br />
to reasonably priced cars. One of our objectives is to avoid<br />
fracmentation cf production, and encouraging economies of scale<br />
and thus help keep production costs down.<br />
The Government also took into account the growing demand<br />
for smaller four-cylinder cars and the importance of<br />
Japanese firms in the overall Australian market, because<br />
of the consumer acceptance of their products.<br />
The last point i want to make on the motor vehicle industry<br />
is that the Government is anxious that the necessary changes<br />
in the industr~ r are effected in a way that can be sustained<br />
by the economy. Accordingly, our policies have been deliberately<br />
tailored to make sure this change occurs in a controlled and<br />
manageable manner.<br />
our foreign investment policy reflects our determination to put<br />
Australia back on its feet again.<br />
We wish to encourage overseas funds and skills because<br />
of the contribution they can make to the national growth<br />
and to standards of living in Austialia. At the same time<br />
we wanted to offer Australians the greatest possible<br />
opportunity to play an effective role in the ownership and control<br />
of our own natural resources and industries.<br />
In our con-siderations on foreign investment we recognised that </p>
<p>our partnership with foreign capital must be of mutual<br />
advantage.<br />
We are far past the stage of welcoming all foreign capital<br />
with open arms with no questions asked. Today, Australia<br />
can afford to , taxe a more discerning &amp; ttitude towards<br />
-the inflow of overseas funds.<br />
Accordingly, the Government will examine each proposal<br />
by overseas companies on individuals merits. Apart from<br />
levels of local equity we will make sure that the economic<br />
benefits, employment opportunities and the likely effect<br />
on our social and economic policies are closely checked in<br />
each case.<br />
in key areas oil and gas production, uranium mining,<br />
agricultural and pastoral projects, forestry and fishing<br />
projects we will apply specific rules on the level of<br />
Aqstralian equity and control.<br />
The Government also expects the Australian Industry Development<br />
Corporation to work closely with the newly set up Foreign<br />
Investment Review Board. The Corporation plays an important<br />
role in helping to generate funds for Australian companies.<br />
The home cwnership question was also spotlighted in the Parliament.<br />
ThE. Home Savings Grant Scheme is the most progressive and far<br />
reaching programme ever offered by a Federal Government to<br />
people wanting to own their own h-me.<br />
We are determined to give Australians a real chance to own<br />
their own homes. This philosophy of home ownership has been<br />
one of the great platforms of Liberal Governments.<br />
In fact, the Liberal Country Party government introduced<br />
the present Home Savings Grant Scheme in 1964 to help yonng<br />
couples buy their first home. </p>
<p>Our new grants scheme goes even further than my election<br />
pledge to increase the grant for first home buyers from<br />
$ 730 to $ 2,000.<br />
The grant--s work on a slidiag scale. Home buyers next year<br />
will get $ 667 if they have saved $ 2,000 this year.<br />
The grant will1 increase to for savings of $ 4,000<br />
in any two year period after the start of this year.<br />
The maximum grant of $ 2,000 will be payable on savings<br />
orf $ 6,000 over three years.<br />
: ome buyers will now receive the first payouts early<br />
ne; xt year, two years earlier than promised.<br />
The Scheme will be extended to cover all first home buyers<br />
regardless of age or marital status.<br />
A-special feature of the scheme is that it allows<br />
people on farms to get grants even though they do notown<br />
the land on which they are building. This feature will<br />
apply to all homes or rural properties bought or contracted<br />
to be built after last Wednesday.<br />
Finally, I believe that our decisions in these three areas<br />
alone will convince Australians of our desire to make<br />
this nation a land of opportunity and one where we can all<br />
plan ahead with confidence and optimism. </p>
