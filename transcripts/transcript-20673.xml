    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is there any greater threat to Australia in the same way as the threat assessments have obviously been racked up in the UK and the US?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There was a general threat increase, if I could put it that way, late last year but we haven't had any specific new information as I speak to warrant a further adjustment of that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Back home the ALP is saying that the US Ambassador should be recalled or counselled for interfering in domestic political debate over Iraq. Do you have any comment on that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't think he should be recalled. Obviously the Labor Party is entitled to have whatever foreign policy it chooses. I think it's pretty ridiculous foreign policy on occasions. I think what the Ambassador was doing was defending his President against some of the personal criticism. I would expect an Australian high commissioner or a Australian ambassador to defend an Australian prime minister of either side of politics against personal criticism. I've said that in the past. I don't really have anything to add to it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, have you had your anthrax shot yet?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>My anthrax shot?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>President Bush had his....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No it was actually a smallpox vaccine.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well have you had your smallpox...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I haven't.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>There's been expressions back home in Australia that Australian troops may not have had their anthrax inoculations in time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That is contrary to the advice I've received. Thank you.</p>
