    <content><![CDATA[<p>This is the complete text of the 1984 Australian Labor Party Policy Speech. </p>
<p>An edited version will be delivered by the Prime Minister,the Hon R J Hawke at the Opera House at 1pm, 13 November 1904. </p>
<p>My fellow Australians, </p>
<p>When from this place in February 1983 I first asked for your support I sought from you an act of great trust. </p>
<p>Our nation was then in deep crisis the worst economic<br />
crisis for more than fifty years; and a searing crisis of the<br />
national spirit, after a decade of confrontation and division.<br />
Unprecedented circumstances demnanded unprecedented<br />
responses. Therefore, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, I<br />
asked for your support, your co-opcration and your active<br />
participation in a course of action and a new national approach<br />
which had never been tried in A~ ustralia in peacetime the course<br />
of national reconcil1iation, national recovery and national<br />
reconstruction. The last twenty months have seen the supreme vindication<br />
of that trust not only the trust you pieced in us, and the! new,<br />
untried approach we offered; but much more important, the trust<br />
you expressed in yourselves, as a people, as a nation that,<br />
given leadership, we Australians could be brought together, we<br />
could work together; we could, together, beat back the crisis,<br />
restore hope, restore growth, confidene and a sense of united<br />
purpose to this nation.<br />
And together, we have done it.<br />
But now, my fellow Australians, on I. December 1984, you<br />
are called upon to make a very different decision, in very<br />
different circumstances, for very different purposes:<br />
note this time, as it was then, a decision, to<br />
fight against a deepening economic and social crisis;<br />
but now, to consolidate, sustain, and build upon<br />
the great gains we have already achieved together;<br />
not, this time, to end the confrontation and<br />
divisivenless of a decade, but to build a new<br />
decade of national unity, national purpose and<br />
national progress;<br />
not, this time, to restore positive economic<br />
growth from negative; but to ensur~ e that the </p>
<p>2<br />
benefits of our econcmy now thc lo: ldlz<br />
fastest-growinV 6? conciy ag fully &amp; nd fairly<br />
Sh~ arOd by all sections of the Communityl<br />
and to build, In our time, ca nation foremost<br />
among the nations of the world, in freedom<br />
arid fairness for all.<br />
Never in living memory have the people of Australia had<br />
a clearer choice to make.<br />
And never have they had a more important choice to<br />
make. The opposition has destroyed any vestige of credibility<br />
by the most negative election campaign any of us can remember.<br />
But long before that, their credibility was destroyed by their<br />
known xevord in Covernment and their known record in Opposition~<br />
more especially their recent performance.<br />
And let me make this clear:<br />
We of the Australian Labor Party do not ask you, the<br />
people of Australia, to take us on txust.<br />
The only trust I seek is the continuance of the trust we<br />
have striven to earn in the past twenty months the trust the<br />
mutual trust that we have tried to build with and between all<br />
sections of the community, your tri'st that we will continue to<br />
put Australia first.<br />
And let me make it clear, from the opening of this<br />
campaign as I made it clear from the opening of the last<br />
camnpaign~ we are not in the business of making grandiose<br />
spending proposals of the kind our opponents have been throwing<br />
around. We are not offering a grab-bag of unrelated,<br />
u-nachievable election promises. we are notL offering a fistful of<br />
dollars. It is Imperative that the sound economic management we<br />
have given Australia continues. He pledge that it shall<br />
continue. we are not going to endanger all that has been achieve~ d,<br />
and the enduring advances, the real and lasting benefits for all<br />
Australians we can achieve in the years ahead, by a vote-buying<br />
spree. There is a' new spirit of confidence in Australia.<br />
And never has that confidence been mnore soundly based. </p>
<p>kiatralia atanft it L. oplen~ id but critical -point 1z~<br />
it&amp; history. Splendid, because of all we have achieved together since<br />
M~ arc~ h 1983. But critical, because the alternative offered indeed,<br />
explicitly threatened by this Opposition, is a return to the<br />
path which produced the OisasterG of two years ago the highei~ t<br />
numbe~ r of Australians throw'n out of w~ ork since the Great<br />
Depression; the longest period of high inflation; the highest<br />
interest rates; growth In reverse; home ownership placed beyond<br />
the reach of an ever-increasing percentoge of Australian<br />
families; and above all, a return to policies and attitudes<br />
which produced unparalleled division in the nation.<br />
x put to you a simple question: -will you risk<br />
everything we have achiev~ ed together, to return to all that?<br />
This Opposition asks you to reject the very meaning of<br />
all that we have been able to achieve together not our.<br />
Government alone, but all the sections of the Australian<br />
community who have contributed so moch to the recovery by their<br />
restraint, by their responsibility# by their initiative, by their<br />
co-operation. it is an opposition of despair an Opposition which<br />
begrudges Australia's new success and prosperity an Oppoeition<br />
opposed to the whole spirit of co--operation we Australians have<br />
built together. We pledged ourselves to fight unemployment and inflation<br />
simutltaneously something which our critics said could not be<br />
done and something which onr opponlents refused to do, fciled to<br />
do, throughout their seven years of waste and loss.<br />
In the last year more new jobs have been created in<br />
Australia than in any other year in our history. Against their<br />
record of two hundred thousand jobs lost, and a quarter of a<br />
million increase in unemployment in a single year, we have<br />
created 270,000 jobs in the eighteen months since the National<br />
Economic Summit began its work of regeneration.<br />
We are going to maintain that effort. We will fulfil<br />
the pledge ' we made at the last election, to create half a million<br />
new jobs within three years-A~ nd we will continue to create jobs<br />
more rapidly than the labour force grows, so that unemployment.<br />
will continue to fall.<br />
We have more than halved inflation. Building on our<br />
achievement of the lowest inflation. for thirteen years, inflation<br />
over the next year will be less than five percent. We aim to keep<br />
it below five percent. </p>
<p>econmy. e Plod~ ied ouraelves to restore Igrovith to the A~ ustralian<br />
In the last year, Aurtralia h&amp; 3 experienced the<br />
strongest growth on record the StrongestL growth of any of the<br />
Membcr-countrxies of the Organi~ ation for 13conomic Co-operation<br />
and Development. in the world's3 economic stakec, we are winners<br />
again. W3e are going to keep lRustralia where it is now<br />
internationally recogni~ ed to be among the frontrunners of the<br />
world's industrialised economnies.<br />
We pledged ourselves to end the needless confrontation<br />
and disruption in Industry. Industrial aisputation Is ot the<br />
lowest level for sixteen years.<br />
wie are going to keep it that way.<br />
We pledged ourselves to bring homne ouinership once agaiin<br />
within the reach of ordinary Australian families to end that:<br />
sense of despair and frustration that was beginning to engulf<br />
thousands upon thousands of young people seeking their owzn honiez.<br />
We have Increased public housing support by fifty percent. W~ e<br />
introduced the First H1ome Owners Scheme, to bring home ownership<br />
within the reach of thousands of young Australians of limited<br />
mea* ns. The number of new houses being built in Australia has<br />
increased by one third.<br />
And we are going to keep it that way. In the next<br />
twelve months# 145,000 new houses will be built in Australia, an<br />
increase of forty percent over the level of two years ago. And<br />
beyond the next year we will m~ aintaini at leaxst this level of<br />
housing activity, and ensure that our housing industry never<br />
again slumps into the contraction and despair of the year before<br />
we were called to office.<br />
The overall picture for Australia in 6tark contrast to<br />
the grim re~ alities of tw'enty months ago Is this;<br />
never in the last decade and more has there been<br />
anything like* the combination of favourable economic<br />
prospects that now existt consumer confidence at record<br />
levels; business confidence and business investneiit<br />
restored and growing by the month; the housing<br />
industry buoyant; manufacturing production risingj<br />
industrial disputes dram~ atically down; interest rates<br />
declining; employment up; inflation down.<br />
With a record like that, is it any wonder that<br />
Paul iReating has been nominated as the w~ orld's beat Treasurer? </p>
<p>This-AB3 the baio the ctzngest for decades on which<br />
We Can build, together, ain even better a~ ndi gairer ZAuatralia.<br />
Th" Accord The cornerstone of the geundations we have laid is the<br />
Prices and Incomes Accord.<br />
After seeing every fitful attempt at recovery in the<br />
last decade dissipate in a new round of price and wage increas~ es,<br />
the Australian economy Is now growing wThile inflation is falling.<br />
The continued success of the Accord is the absolute<br />
condition for achieving a sustained recovery without inflation.<br />
The Accord provides the fra~ mework for business to wiak: e<br />
mlajor new investmzients with a new confidence.<br />
W0e pledge ours~ elves to maintain the Accord, and all the<br />
benefits that flow from it.<br />
Our opponents are committed to its destruction.<br />
They propose to dismantle everything which makes the<br />
Accord wiork. They propose to end central wage figing based on wage<br />
indexation, and to close clown the institutiions which give form<br />
and substance to the Accord, the Economic Planning Advisory<br />
Council, the Advisory Committee on Prices and Incomes, and the<br />
Prices Surveillance Authority.<br />
But beyond that, they stand against the whole spirit of<br />
the Accord the spirit of co-operation, and the process of<br />
consultation between Government, business and unions, which hais<br />
enabled Australia# at last, to break out of the cycle of<br />
inflation and recession.<br />
But the sabotage of the Accord and its achievements<br />
threatened by their proposals reaches even deeper, with policies<br />
which could have only one result the unleashing of another<br />
burst of inflation and a new wage cirplosion.<br />
Theirs is a recipe for economic disaster.<br />
The central achievement of the past twenty mionths<br />
ros~ tored growth with reduc'ed infation waould be wrecked, with.<br />
&amp; 21 that would mean for employment, gor interest rates, and for<br />
the standard of living for the twe~ ker aections of the community,<br />
especiailly our young and our pensioners, for everything that<br />
mzillions of ordinary Australian can iaow hope for themselves and<br />
their families. </p>

recovery, iational reconstruction. E~ ach part of that program~<br />
? M. d it is through the ptth of reconciliction leading to<br />
recovery by which so mu~ ch has~ already been achievea that YYLe<br />
can nowi, in our next terim, continue the task of buailding upon the<br />
strong foundations we have laid towards national reconstruction.<br />
I repeat; we refuse to put at risk all that bas been<br />
von, by irresponsible electioneering in this canpaign.<br />
We offer a continuingp coherent program a<br />
firm ordering of priorities to build a prosperous, fair and<br />
caring society; a strong and dynamic nationi harnessing to the<br />
full the talents of our people to meet even miore effectively the<br />
challenges and opportunities of an increasingly com~ plex world and<br />
an increasingly competitive Western Pacific region, in which our<br />
destiny has placed us forever;-and a nation in w~ hich, as we<br />
strive to m~ eet those challenges and to reach those goals, all<br />
Auritralians, w'hatever Cheir backcground, can truly feel that they<br />
are involved, that each has a pa~ rt to play, in the real life and<br />
growth of a great nation. 1HATIONAL PRIOITIES<br />
The Australian Labor Party Is the Party of Growth,<br />
Equity, and Peace. I offer the Australian people the<br />
unswerving commitment of our Government to the promotion in<br />
Australia and in the v'orld to the entent that it is within ourpower<br />
to do so of Grov-th, Equity and Peace.<br />
Towards these great goals, wfe now set these priorities<br />
for our next term:<br />
The maintenance of r5trong eco'nomic and employmont<br />
growth with low inflation; and to this end, new<br />
initiatives to remove i~ apediments to Australia<br />
applying our resources to the most productive uses,<br />
anid to strengthen industry;<br />
a genuine reform of the Australian tax system to<br />
promote growth and to enzure that the benefits of<br />
that growth are fairly sbared and bring lasting<br />
relief on personal incvnie tanes to the millions<br />
of ordinary Auctralian tanpayers. W'hat we m~ ean<br />
by tax reform is that the~ hard wiork of the ordinary<br />
Australian is not unfairliy penalised; </p>
<p>oncerted effort to aittock the caiute3 of poverty<br />
an inequaiity in o~ ur midst, t~ o clijliate unemploypient<br />
ana to create a ivirer cociety;<br />
n drive to raice the lovelus of educationo health<br />
anid the other comamunity aervices for all Auutralians;<br />
and to continue, with renewed vigour based on<br />
your renewed mandate, our u~ nremittin~ g efforts in the<br />
cause of peace vnd nuclear disarmam~ ent.<br />
RECONSTRUCTION AND GROWITH<br />
The task of building upon the strong foundation we have<br />
laid for national reconstruction requires first of all that the<br />
conditions u~ hich buil~ t national recovery continue: co-operative<br />
industrial relations, and fiscal and P~ onetary policy designed to<br />
support gradual reductions in interest ratesi and strong economic<br />
growth without any resurgence of inflation.<br />
We have established these conditionsr in the past tventy<br />
wrorths, nnd undertake to maintain them through the life of the<br />
rext Parliament, and for mis long as the ZAustrallan people<br />
continue to charge us with responsibility for national<br />
reconstruction. And beyond the maintenance of these favourable general<br />
conditions, we will continue to work system~ atically on long-term<br />
structural reforms designed to raise the capacity tor sustained<br />
Sirowth: in trade; in education; in the effective use of<br />
technology; in business deregulation; in manufacturing and<br />
rural industry, transport and other key economic sectors; and iyl<br />
taxation reform. The strengthening of Australia's capacity for sustained<br />
sitronig growth requires Ynizcnh greatnr etxport orientation of<br />
Australian industry. This demands the continuation of our<br />
efforts to raise productivity and improve international<br />
competitiveness, as well as to pursue an active trade policy.<br />
The destiny of the secure, dynamic, prosperous and fair<br />
siociety which we are building lies in the Asia-r acific region,<br />
and especially the Wgestern Pacific region.<br />
The industrial transforEoation of Japan, the rapid<br />
industrial isatiol of Korea and oost of ASEAN, and now the<br />
emergence as a major new p~ rticipant in the international<br />
community of a dynaia'c CbIna determinled rapidly to moderni'se its<br />
economy, provide a great challenge and opportunity for Australia.<br />

t. he countries of ASEA~ N, u~ ith Japani and China, and w~ ith our<br />

Wie will continue to build an environment of confidence<br />
amongst gjovernments and peoples within which productive<br />
interdependence can prosper.<br />
Australia mzust be more than a passive beneficiary of the<br />
growing Past Asian deman6 for foodstuffs and raw materials.<br />
Our resources hn6 the talents of oujr people call for a<br />
new role: Australians as suppliers of advanced services,<br />
technology, and manufactures embodying high skills,<br />
as well as the primary products w~ hich have b~ een the traditional<br />
m~ ainstays of our foreign trade.<br />
The Department of Trade and an upgraded Trade<br />
Commissioner Service have been reoriented towards a targeted<br />
approach in key markets iauch as China, Japan, North A~ merica and<br />
the Middle East, including the provision of more effective<br />
support for exports of advanced services and manufactured goods.<br />
tie will continue to defend strenuously AustralSa's<br />
interests in international forums against unfair and often<br />
subsidized competition in world markets, for our prospective<br />
exports of processed and canufactured goods &amp; s well as for our<br />
traditional agricultural exports-<br />
The fruits of our continued efforts in trade policy will1<br />
be harvested in their contribution to growth and roconstruction<br />
in Australia over the next three years, and beyond into the<br />
twenty-f irL c-iiLujy.<br />
The New Technology Challenge<br />
National reconstruction &amp; nd the enhancement of sustained<br />
growth eill require heavy investm~ ent in education, training and<br />
retraining, and a redircction of our education effort to ensure<br />
that it prepares our young people better for productive and<br />
creative lives in a complenr and rapidly changing modern world.<br />
This concern for t-he quality and relevance of education<br />
has caused the Government to initia~ te inquiries Into tertiary<br />
education through the Co= Aonwealth Tertiary Education Commidssion,<br />
under its chairinan, Hugh 1Hdson, and into secondary and primary<br />
education under the Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National </p>

Coveznient effort in scientific research through our Univesities<br />
ana C. S. I. O. But We ha~ ve to recognise that our applica~ tion of<br />
new technology to many areas of industry has lagged behind.<br />
Sustained high growth An Australia will require greater<br />
and nore systematic application of the best technology to 211 cur<br />
industry. in recognition of this weak~ ness in our national research<br />
and develop-ment effort, t-e have promoted a greatly increased flow<br />
cf funds to enterprises applying new technology through the<br />
rWanagement Investment Companies.<br />
Research Concession<br />
T~ o further encourage this effort, tve intend to allow 1150<br />
percent of genuine expenditure within Australia on research anC,<br />
development to ba deducted against income for taxation purposes.<br />
T'his vill m~ ean that the effective cost of research and<br />
development to the investor W1ll be only thirty-one percent of<br />
increased exrpenditure. Ie expect this initiative to expand<br />
substantially the research and development affort within<br />
Australian business, and assist also In the revitalisation o! the<br />
established research communities. All research and development<br />
expenditure will qualify, unless it is within projects which<br />
already receive assistance under R~ ID Grant Schemes.<br />
Business Deregulation The reconstruction of Australia needs the systematic<br />
removal of unnecessary institutional Lnd legal imnpedim~ ents to<br />
applying our national resources to their most productive uses.<br />
In consultation with the 18usiness Council of Australia,<br />
the Confoaeration of A~ ustralian Industry, the Australian Council<br />
of Trade Unions, the National Farn. er3 Federation, and the<br />
Australian Chamber of Commerce, L-e have begun to review the great<br />
volume of laws and regulations affecting business which have<br />
accumulated over the past eigh'Cy-four years of the Australian<br />
Federation. They fall with particular, impact on omiall business. </p>

TAX RFORM1<br />
A Second m~ ajor challenge for our next term of of fico is<br />
reformi and a complete overhaul o i our tax systemn. That wil!. be<br />
of fundamental importance to the task of naLtional reconstruction,<br />
The tax cuts uhich are now being enjoyed are the first<br />
dividend, of econamie recovery and growth being paid to tho<br />
ordinairy taxpayers of Amstralia.<br />
Unli'e the fraudulent cuts of 1977 the notorious<br />
fj* Ltful of dollars tihich were onatched back i~ uudiately after the<br />
election I can guarantee you'll kteep our tax cutG! / 13 </p>

of Å Augtrcili&amp; the or6inary hr-working Autrlians viho N-y &amp; a<br />
they earn. The second element is cur continauin~ g attach on the taix<br />
avoidance industry whiche throuqhout the yeas of the previous<br />
Governmient,~ became Australiala fastest-growing inaustry.<br />
Our capacity to smash~ the tax avoidance industry has<br />
been hamipered by the Opposition uThich by obstructing legislation<br />
in the S3enate to close notorious loopholes, has effectively cont<br />
the~ ordinary, honest taxpayers of Australia hundreds of milJizoll<br />
of cdollara. That is one of the reasons t~ hy uFC ask every A~ ustralian<br />
voter vAbo Bapports our Governmnent in its ef~ fort to smaish the tax<br />
avoidance Industcry completely as u-are n~ ow wiell ont the zoad<br />
tw~ ardis doing to ensure that our Governm~ ent in the Mouse of<br />
Representatives iG supported by a majority in the Senate.<br />
We will re-introduce the twice-rejected legislation and,<br />
vith a Senate m~ ajority, ue can complete our " ork of Gmashirig the<br />
tax avoidence industry in A~ ustralia on~ ce and for all.<br />
Tihe third elervert a thoroughgoing review and reforin of<br />
the entire tax systemn vill be central to all our task5 in our<br />
second tem.. our tan ref orm will be preceded by w~ idespread cormmunity<br />
consultations, and will proceed on the basis on nine cleay<br />
principles and objectives. The Governmient's nine principles of~<br />
t( xation reformn are:<br />
FIrst0 there must be no increase in the overall<br />
tax burden, aso measured by the share of<br />
Comcnoalth Goverament revenue in gross domestic<br />
product. Second, any reform most continue the process alroady<br />
begun by this Governm~ ent, and provide further major<br />
cuts in personal incomne tax.<br />
Thlrd, taxation changes must contribute to c~ anhing<br />
tmu avoidanlce and nvaoJion t~ hich resiin as featuzes<br />
of the tax system which the Government inheritod. </p>

orvanisations ana ccmiiunity groups.<br />
t~ e therefore propose t~ o conv~ ene a widelyr reprenentatiVe<br />
National Tan Summnit during the third quarter of 1985.<br />
A~ nd at-that Suimmit we c~ hall take specific steps to<br />
ensure that the citigens of Austraiia a~ re directly representedi in<br />
their ro&gt; o as taxpayers.<br />
M~ en at the lbst election 7 foreshadowed the tWaticonal<br />
