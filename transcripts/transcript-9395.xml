PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP,<br />
DOORSTOP, KURILPA PARK, BRISBANE, 27 OCTOBER 1994-<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: You wanted a comment about David Wilson. We have unconfirmed,<br />
but we understand fairly authoritative reports that David Wilson and<br />
his two associates were killed in Cambodia and, I think, this has been<br />
communicated to his parents. If this is true, this is a very tragic<br />
outcome and I would like on behalf of the Government to extend my<br />
condolences to David Wilson's parents and to anyone so affected by<br />
this tragedy. There is obviously a substantial risk for young<br />
Australians travelling in Cambodia, particularly in some parts of the<br />
country and it is something that we will need to be more vigilant about.<br />
J: What about the state of the military aid for the Cambodian defence<br />
forces. Where does that stand now?<br />
PM: That is nought to do with this. That is a broader question about how<br />
best Australia can continue to help the process of democratisation in<br />
Cambodia and how we may be able to help the government of<br />
Cambodia establish itself as a government of the people which<br />
commands the respect of the people.<br />
J: What response now are you expecting from the Cambodian<br />
Government?<br />
PM: Well, I don't know. We'll wait and see what they have to say, but<br />
again, they are unconfirmed reports but they have a ring of authority<br />
about them.<br />
J: Do you have any message to the Khmer Rouge?<br />
PM: Well, it's not for me to have a message to them. My message has<br />
been consistent, I think, that is that the best process for Cambodia is<br />
to see the reflection of the peoples wishes in the government of their<br />
affairs and where all factions in the country should come together and<br />
try to make a success of their future. This basic stand out position<br />
which the Khmer Rouge has taken can't, in the final analysis, produce<br />
anything but more hardship and problems for the people of Cambodia.<br />
ends </p>
