TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 2 SEPTEMBER 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Well, look, I have called this press conference today, because today marks<br />
an important stage in the Government's resolution of the Mabo issue. Today<br />
the Government has released a detailed outline of its proposed legislation,<br />
which will resolve the uncertainties created by the High Court decision on<br />
Mabo while ensuring that Native title is recognised and treated with fairness<br />
and justice.<br />
From the beginning the Government has had two essential aims with Mabo.<br />
One was justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in relation to<br />
rights granted by the highest court in this country, the High Court; and the<br />
Integrity of our land management system as one of the essential foundations<br />
for our economy.<br />
There has never been any doubt in my mind that an adequate response to<br />
the Mabo judgement had to meet both of those objectives, the objective of<br />
justice and at the same time the integrity of our land management system.<br />
The legislation is complex because the issues are complicated. But we have<br />
drawn clear lines of policy and principal including un-grudging and<br />
unambiguous recognition of Native Title in Australian common law; a fair,<br />
rigorous and efficient means for determining who has Native Title; where and<br />
what the key attributes of that title are in particular cases: a just and workable<br />
regime under which dealings in land can go on, and which provides clear<br />
processes with wh~ ich our vital land based industries can operate and full<br />
security for people holding grants of interests in land provided by<br />
Governments in the past, and at no cost to them, and fair compensation for<br />
the extinguishment or impairment of Native Title.<br />
Now, contrary to so much mis-informed opinion and mischievous propaganda,<br />
the vast majority of Australians will, of course, feel no tangible effects from<br />
this legislation whatsoever. What they may well feel is a sense of satisfaction<br />
that Australia's democratic processes in harness with our better feelings, our<br />
sense of justice and common sense has produced a mature national<br />
response and the biggest chance the nation has ever had to correct a two<br />
hundred year old problem, a real chance to address the wrongs and achieve<br />
our goal of reconciliation between Indigenous and non-indigenous </p>
<p>TEL: 2. Sep. 93 17: 17 No. 015 P. 02,-<br />
2<br />
Australians. They may feel that their generation has made a mature<br />
response and future generations will be grateful for that mature response.<br />
Neither I, nor the Government, expect that the draft outline will be welcomed<br />
In toto by every interested party in the debate. I can almost guarantee that<br />
will not be so. But a balanced approach was taken, a truly balanced<br />
approach, and a balanced response has been made. The proposed<br />
legislation Is the result of one of the most comprehensive consultations ever<br />
undertaken on a national Issue in this country, and one of the most intense<br />
periods of ministerial involvement and discussion of any issue in the<br />
Governments history.<br />
Since the High Court handed down the decision many meetings and<br />
consultations have been held with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander<br />
people, with the mining industry, with the pastoral industry and with State and<br />
Territory officials. And while the draft released today is not the final<br />
Government position, it does reflect the Commonwealth view on key issues.<br />
Today I have written to Premiers and Chief Ministers providing copies of the<br />
document and seeking comments before the final bill is drawn up, obviously<br />
States and Territories will have comments to make, but the important thing is,<br />
I hope, they will see the merits of a national approach and understand the<br />
obvious advantage to them in such a national approach, and these<br />
advantages are outlined in the detailed statement that I have released. No<br />
doubt other parties will also have suggestions and we will listen to them just<br />
as carefully. But what you do have before you today is a very carefully<br />
considered view of the Government. When comments have been received<br />
we will finalise the Bill for introduction into Parliament in October.<br />
Now, our information package which we have tabled with the draft legislation<br />
contains a detailed statement by me which highlights the main elements of<br />
our proposal. Also there is a detailed summary of the proposed legislation<br />
and a question and answer document which I think will help people<br />
understand some of the principal issues. I might also add that my colleague,<br />
Frank Walker, who is here today and officials that are also here, will be<br />
available after Question Time if you have questions of technical detail about<br />
some of the issues in the Bill.<br />
So, I will be pleased to take questions.<br />
J: Prime Minister, does this mean now that you will be prepared to sit<br />
down and begin negotiating with the Aborigines?<br />
PM;* Let's not have a play on words. A consultation of substance Is one<br />
where an interest group puts to the Government issues of principle<br />
about which it believes the Government should respond. And because<br />
the imperatives in the development of this legislation require that the<br />
twin interests, of justice for Aboriginal people and maintaining a system<br />
of sensible land management are key to the national economy,<br />
whatever is put by an Aboriginal person or group, in a sense, is </p>
<p>T2EL.:$ ep93 17 : 17 No .015 P .03<br />
3<br />
negotiating a view off that background. So, this has been~ the most<br />
realistic consultation negotiation with Aboriginal people in our history,<br />
about a matter which has great ramifications for them, and for which<br />
we all believe there Is a foundation for a long-r-un reconciliation<br />
between non-Aboriginal Australians and Aboriginals.<br />
J: are you recognising just physical attachment to the land, or also<br />
spiritual connection to the land?<br />
PM: Well, you will see that in the draft legislation, in ways in which that can<br />
be established, but it is not purely, simply a physical association.<br />
Though, that will be the case most of the time.<br />
J: States, States who have already expressed a considerable<br />
opposition of some of your principles, are you really saying that this<br />
draft is merely an ambit claim? How flexible are you on this?<br />
PM: Well, for a start there has been an enormous amount of consultation<br />
and negotiation with States at the official's level. Which has gone on<br />
now for months. The Bill is, as I say in the press statement, it is not a<br />
gerry built proposal designed for a quick fix, that suits a particular<br />
hinatevere sstp. enWt es o amreu cbhu iltdimineg ohne rteh es opmrinecthipinlegs . to Slao, s t thains di sth naott's anw haym wbeit*<br />
negotiating document, this Is the Commonwealth's considered position.<br />
But importantly it gives, in the legislation, a chance for the States to<br />
come back with proposals which they may wish to put to us, where<br />
they believe, in their terms, better meet our principles and objectives<br />
and our Bill. So, while we lay down very clear mechanisms for the<br />
meeting of the principles which the Commonwealth has decided, we<br />
are also saying to the States, if you think you can do it better in some<br />
way by changing or developing your institutions, come back and tell<br />
us. But what we are saying here is that on all the key principles which<br />
we have articulated in the notes, the mechanisms which we have<br />
established around there, be they for hearing and awarding Native<br />
Title, be they for considering economic uses for Native * Title land, be it<br />
exploration, or mining, or pastoral, all those mechanisms we think are<br />
sound ones for meeting the objectives Of the Commonwealth's<br />
principles. And whIch would apply in the Commonwealth Bill for<br />
Commonwealth lands, which would also apply in a State in a noncomplying<br />
State. But we have got a complying State, not only have<br />
they the option to comply with our principles, but they also have a<br />
further option in coming back to us and saying in which ways they<br />
believe they can better comply.<br />
J: On that basis though, would you believe the States who issued their<br />
own draft legislation are more or less with your position, and how far<br />
would they have to move If they are not?<br />
PM: Well, the Commonwealth Bill takes precedence and legal precedence,<br />
and I think there is, well developing within the States, very much the<br />

<p>TEL: 2 . Sep 91 17 : 17 tn. o015 P .04/' 1Q<br />
4<br />
view to examine this, to examine this positively. Because this Bill Is a<br />
balance in crafted proposition, and it does seek that balance, and a<br />
nice balance between justice for Aboriginal people and the essential<br />
principles of land management for the economy. There is a nice<br />
balance there.<br />
J Prime Minister, West Australia has refused to even accept the High<br />
Court judgement, WA has refused at this stage still to accept the High<br />
Court judgement. Do you envisage then, that the Commonwealth will<br />
have to impose its...?<br />
PMV: Western Australia will have a copy of the legislation, they can go<br />
through it, but it is in very much of their interest to accept the principles<br />
here, because they are ones which don't, in any way, certainly in terms<br />
of a claim by a State in any reasonable way, constrain mining or<br />
economic activity. Now, If the view Is they don't want to give land to<br />
black people, well that's a view, of course, we will not accept, and In<br />
which case the Commonwealth Bill finally drafted and when It is<br />
operating would operate where a State fails to comply.<br />
J: Prn'r Minister, if this is not the Commonwealths final position, how<br />
much room is there? Is there only room for some more Input, positive<br />
input from the States or is there room from the other interest groups as<br />
well to have somne..?<br />
PMV: There is room for all the interest groups to say. For Instance, we have<br />
divided here the task of hearing and awarding Native Title and then<br />
considering what economic uses Native Title land can be put. Where<br />
formally we were talking about one institution, we are now talking<br />
about two. We are talking about a stream of Federal Court to handle<br />
the hearing and awarding of Native Title, and then we are talking about<br />
an institution, a tribunal which will then look at the economic uses.<br />
Now, we have got time limits on negotiation and arbitration, for<br />
instance. Now, In the way in which those elements of the Bill are set<br />
up, it is quite possible a State or an interest group could come back~<br />
with a proposition which is helpful to the general design.<br />
J: What about if the Aboriginal people came back, for instance, and said<br />
well, we have said we won't accept, that, you know, if you don't give us<br />
the right of veto<br />
PM. Well, they are not getting the right of veto, and I have told them that<br />
right from the start, because it would bring land management In this<br />
country to a halt, it would slow economic activity down, but they<br />
wanted a right to be asked, and they have got a right there of<br />
consultation. They know if in the result of that consultation their view<br />
is not being observed they can go to an arbitration. And if that tribunal<br />
arbitrates in their favour, well in their terms, well and good. If it<br />
arbitrates against them then they have got to accept that decision. But<br />
in the event that a tribunal overturned a proposition for development a </p>
<p>TEL: 2. ep .93 17 : 17 No. 015 P. 0.1<br />
State or Commonwealth Minister can override that decision. So, the<br />
practical operation will be, any legislation which has an arbitration<br />
procedure automatically turns a consultation into a negotiation.<br />
Because everybody knows if you don't negotiate it goes to an<br />
arbitration. So, there is an imperative there to negotiate, but in the<br />
event that it does go to arbitration a decision can be made and parties<br />
will be able to put their view to it. But the body that Is arbitrating is not<br />
the body hearing the Native Title.<br />
J: Well how vulnerable is your tribunal proposal to constitutional<br />
challenge?<br />
PM. well, I think, invulnerable.<br />
J: You just explained the limitations on compensation, Prime Minister,<br />
particularly there doesn't seem to be a specific mention of special<br />
attachment in the outline and also how would you see the Bill being<br />
spread between the Commonwealth and the State Governments?<br />
PM: Well, we were formally looking at some formulation for compensation,<br />
which in some way devolved a freehold value, and with multiples of<br />
freehold value for special attachment. But for a number of reasons we<br />
think that proposal is flawed and we are now saying that compensation<br />
should only be on just terms, and naturally the just terms will<br />
comprehend the economic value of any particular piece of and the<br />
special attachment which may, and that is the special features of the<br />
land, and therefore the nature of the compensation which could be<br />
more than monetary compensation can be considered in those terms.<br />
On the second part of the question we have not decided what portion<br />
of the financial load the Commonwealth has carried in respect of<br />
compensation for past grants. But only to say that it will be carried by<br />
government.<br />
J: Can I get my question in now what is the position of National parks,<br />
wildlife areas, wilderness areas under this draft legislation? Will they<br />
be able to pay more..<br />
PM: Look, David ( Barnett) can I say I don't want to be running down a<br />
whole lot of technical features of the Bill. So you can put all those<br />
questions this afternoon. The thing I think 1 would like to hear is the<br />
politics, the generic qualities of it, et cetera.<br />
J: Prime Minister, developing among the States as to how they look at<br />
this, the whole issue of a national approach. Can that be interpreted<br />
as you being optimistic that the States will join in with this and if so<br />
what States might be still holding out and also what is your response to<br />
Mr Perron's letter about changes to the Northern Territory Land Rights<br />
Act? </p>
<p>TEL: 2 . Sep .93 17 No. 0115 P. 6i<br />

PMV. Let me deal with the first part of the question I think States which look<br />
at this issue sensibly understand that a comprehensive national<br />
approach is better than a State by State approach. I think the Bill will<br />
get a better hearing than maybe people believe at this point from the<br />
States. Whether we get agreement is a different matter, but I think it<br />
will get a reasonable hearing. I think they are convinced that a<br />
genuine attempt on our part is being made to get the balances right<br />
here. I am not sure in the end how all States will react, it may be that<br />
some want to overturn the High Court decision or take that view. I<br />
think it is an unrealistic view. Sorry, your other question was?<br />
J: Mr Perron's letter about possible changes to the Northern Territory.<br />
PM: Well, we have had, routinely, letters from Chief Ministers in the<br />
Northern Territory about the NT Land Rights legislation. This is not<br />
something the Government wishes to focus on at the moment, this is<br />
the primary focus of our consideration this is this piece of draft<br />
legislation. This is the primary piece of Aboriginal law, potential draft<br />
law in Australia and easily the best piece of Commonwealth law in<br />
respect of Aboriginal land and we want to get these principles drawn<br />
togeiher, agreements around this Bill and deal with this Bill.<br />
J: two sets of rules, two sets of principles acting at the one time.<br />
PM: Well, one goes to statutorily confirmed land rights and the other goes<br />
to inherent rights under the common law.<br />
J: What sort of directions have you taken to match the expectation raised<br />
in your Redfern speech in relation to reconciliation and social justice<br />
for Aboriginal people?<br />
PM: Following this draft Bill, and then Bill, and passage, will be a package<br />
of measures to deal1wth other social justice questions and these will<br />
go to land acquisition and other issues. We are not as developed in<br />
that package as we are with this because this is the primary vehicle for<br />
giving effect to the High Court decision. But where the High Court<br />
decision doesn't have impact on Aboriginal people, that. is where they<br />
have been dispossessed or not able to take advantage of Mabo then<br />
we will then go down the route of trying to see in which ways we can<br />
sensibly advance the social justice for those categories of Aboriginal<br />
and Islander people. I will probably give some expression to that in<br />
the Second Reading Speech on this Bill so that the Aboriginal and<br />
Islander community know that in the Autumn session of next year we'll<br />
will introduce the other legislation.<br />
J: Prime Minister, how can you avoid delays in exploration and mining<br />
activity when under the provisions of this proposal you have outlined<br />
today, you only need to register a claim to then be regarded as having<br />
an interest in that area such that the Tribunal can direct a company for </p>
<p>T2EL.:$ ep .93 1-7: 17 No .015 F. 7'.<br />
example to negotiate with a registered claimant rather than someone<br />
who has actually had their native title claim tested.?<br />
PM: So, what is your point?<br />
J: Well, that Is going to build In delays because inevitably you will have<br />
to end up having to hear the claim to establish a native title hold.<br />
PM. No, no, it would build in no further delay than that which is inherently<br />
there in dealing with a native title holder. Aboriginal people are<br />
entitled to say, for all these years we have asserted that our traditional<br />
customs and land should have been part of the common law of this<br />
country. Finally, our most supreme Court has said it is. So we have<br />
land which is obviously going to be native title land, but because we<br />
have not yet sorted out the ownership of it, the holders of the title,<br />
should it be reasonably open for companies or economic developers to<br />
then go in just as though no native title ever existed. Native title exists.<br />
it exists this very day, it Is a matter of deciding who the holder of the<br />
title Is. Therefore, should it be treated in any less of a way than native<br />
title land where the holder is clear.<br />
What we have said is this: the registrar under the Bill, has a set of<br />
measures, a set of criteria under which a claim will be registered;<br />
vexatious claims are rejected; claims which for instance seek to claim<br />
title to areas on which freehold title will have extinguished native title,<br />
all those things are taken away, but where there is a reasonable<br />
likelihood of a claim be a valid one and one that can proceed, it will be<br />
registered. If it is registered say a mining company will then deal with<br />
that registered group of owners and then the same time frame applies<br />
that is, four months for negotiation, three months for an arbitration<br />
process if in the event they don't agree, or longer if they both agree. If<br />
it is for exploration it is three months for negotiation and two months in<br />
the Tribunal. But under any mining legislation now It is three months,<br />
for instance, for exploration.<br />
In other words it is a reasonable procedure, a * nd it is a reasonable<br />
procedure for native title where the holder Is'known as it is where a<br />
claim has been registered.<br />
J: it turns out not the native title holder, if someone had just made a<br />
claim, not had it tested and can subsequently be found not to be the<br />
native title holder; you built in all that negotiation for months in delay.<br />
PM; Yes, but you are talking about at the most a seven month process.<br />
Who now gets an approval process within seven months? Who now?<br />
J: Prime Minister, why have you decided that native title claims won't be<br />
heard in the same courts that other Australians use?<br />
TEL </p>
<p>TEL: 2 $: eP .97 1: 1? No . CII 5 F. 3l<br />
PM: That is not necessarily so. The Federal Court is a court other<br />
Australians use, a State Supreme Court or' a Land and Environment<br />
Court for instance are courts other Australians use, except a stream of<br />
those facilities will be devoted to the special task of hearing claims for<br />
native title, which will mean that anthropological information and tribal<br />
information et cetera, custom and tradition these issues will become<br />
the specialisation of whatever will be a variant on these particular<br />
Courts whatever they might be. They are very much the same<br />
institutions whlchopther Australians use, but varied, changed, adapted<br />
for the special task of hearing and awarding native title.<br />
J: Have you got a timetable yet for when this Bill is to be completely<br />
finished and introduced into the Parliament? How long is it?<br />
PM; We want it in in October and it is just a matter of whether we can get<br />
responses in time to consider the responses, to put them into the draft.<br />
We have concurrently been writing a draft Bill as we have been writing<br />
drafting instructions so what you see here in the draft legislation also<br />
exists as a very rough draft of a Bill. So, that will truncate the time<br />
down of actually completing the draft legislation and drafting<br />
instiuctions and then the writing of it.<br />
J: Mr Keating, what impact do you think this proposed legislation is going<br />
to have on the Government's fiscal policy over the next couple of<br />
years?<br />
PM: Not very much at all.<br />
J: Mr Keating, you have obviously spent an immense amount of time on<br />
this yourself, what do you say to those who say that you have been too<br />
preoccupied with this issue at the cost of political attention to other<br />
areas of government?<br />
PM, I say that is not a correct judgement.<br />
Labor governments are hear to do these things. These are things that<br />
will never be done by Tory governments, they will never get the social<br />
balances that are in this right. That is why governments like this exist.<br />
And I think the work which we have put in here and it has been an<br />
enormous work by my Cabinet and ministerial colleagues and by<br />
officers of the various departments the intensity of the work in six<br />
months to try and put together something which has got principles so<br />
clearly articulated first of all decided and articulated as this has, I<br />
think will do credit to any piece of legislation of this kind anywhere.<br />
So, you get a choice in these things either you can do it the way it<br />
should be done on an issue which is 200 years old for which we have<br />
never adequately tackled, or you can fudge it. What we have decided<br />
to do is do it right. </p>
<p>TEL: pP9&gt; 3 17 No. 0 15 F. 0 9'<br />

As to political attention, when Budgets go like a charm everyone thinks<br />
they are politically tuned and tuned up and polished up and all these<br />
things about politics and consultation are never an issue. It is only<br />
wh~ en something goes awry that you have these problems. Again, one<br />
has got to look at the long run. This is five months into a three year<br />
political cycle and if this Parliament was worth nothing but to get this<br />
right, it would be worth it.<br />
J: Prime Minister, was the Budget going to some extent awry, part of the<br />
cost of the pre-occupation of this issue?<br />
P M. TheOBidgetwill end up a very good Budget for the nation. That is, that<br />
this country alone among few will have a fiscal position which is going<br />
to be exemplary by the middle 1 990s. There are a lot of you, former<br />
incessant barrackers for this position just three or four weeks ago you<br />
have all gone strangely silent. The fiscal industry that exists in this<br />
gallery has gone Into hibernation, but it is not in hibernation in the<br />
Budget figuring it is there.<br />
As I said yesterday, this notion that we should basically not give an<br />
improvement in the tax position of middle income tax payers, this sort<br />
of inverse snobbery on the part of people who have never given a hoot<br />
for low income earners in the past, Is humbug and hypocrisy I will<br />
never cop. If the ACTU wants to talk to us about the low paid, fine,<br />
because they have always been genuinely interested in it. If they want<br />
to put a view about middle incomes I will take it. But I will never take it<br />
from people who have never had a interest ever, who wanted to cut<br />
Commonwealth outlays back at every opportunity and then are already<br />
now discovering as a way of criticising the Budget this question about<br />
the low paid. Anyway, as I indicated yesterday in the House those<br />
huge real increases for people up to around three quarters of average<br />
weekly earnings attest to the fact that the Government looked after<br />
these people first.<br />
Let me say this the Government is taking no humbug or lectures from<br />
anybody about looking after those on low incomes. We have done<br />
more than any Commonwealth government ever, but nor * are we going<br />
to say that somebody on average weekly earnings, at $ 33,000 or<br />
$ 36,000, Is a wealthy person and doesn't deserve to be considered in<br />
the sweep of incomes which all governments have to consider. The<br />
Liberal Party has taken the Bill we have introduced and challenged it,<br />
or are seeking to challenge it. They want to cut away at the Budget's<br />
capacity to pay tax cuts to middle income earners. The Liberal Party of<br />
Australia is hoping in to middle people on middle incomes, the people<br />
on $ 33-36,000. The hypocrisy is profound.<br />
J: As leader of the Labor Party, what message did you take away from<br />
the Caucus Economics Comm ittee meeting of the other night? </p>
<p>TEL:~~ .9 1.1 11: 5 er Ic 1<br />
PM: The first I'd take away if I was you is don't believe all that is told to you.<br />
Because much of what I saw printed the next day was never said. No,<br />
it was a reasonably, I thought, good meeting and I went there because<br />
I could not attend the Caucus the following day, I had to speak to the<br />
ACTU and I was not going to leave the Treasurer alone in a Caucu3<br />
meeting just to argue the point himself. So, I took the opportunity to go<br />
to the Economic Committee meeting and there most people put a very<br />
reasonable view. Those who had sharp comments either wanted to be<br />
In the Ministry and missed out or had been in the Ministry and had<br />
been dropped out and had an axe to grind. That is all right, we all<br />
know about them, they are wounded soldiers, but we will try and bind<br />
them up and make them happy.<br />
