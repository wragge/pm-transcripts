TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH GRAHAM WORLD, " AM PROGRAM", ABC RADIO,<br />
SEPTEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
At the South Pacific Forum in Papua New Guinea, Mr Keating has said now<br />
that his Health Minister has appeared at the Easton Royal Commission in<br />
Perth, there is not much value in it continuing. He was echoing the sentiments<br />
of Dr Lawrence, who last night resumed her media campaign, calling for the<br />
inquiry to be closed down and adding that it is unlikely to produce a balanced<br />
report. Mr Keating, meanwhile, says he will ignore the Commission's findings.<br />
The Prime Minister spoke to Graham World in Madang last night.<br />
GW: Prime Minister, today's communique will include an endorsed code of<br />
conduct to restrict logging in the region. But it doesn't guarantee that<br />
unsustainable logging practices can be reigned in in countries where it is<br />
going on.<br />
PM: Well nothing can guarantee that. The Pacific Forum is just the sort of<br />
is basically a community advisory organisation. It has no legally binding<br />
strength. But the communique today, was endorsed unanimously by all<br />
the countries the code of conduct for logging and, of course, a year<br />
ago we had a snowball's chance in hell of getting any of this endorsed.<br />
And now it has come back, it has been endorsed by everybody.<br />
Vanuatu is currently taking regulations before their Ministerial Council.<br />
Papua New Guinea is in the position of, I think in the next few months,<br />
being able to adopt the code for their own forestry operations.<br />
GW: What about the Solomons?<br />
PM: Well for the Solomons it has been up to them whether they adopt it, but<br />
they have endorsed it.<br />
GW: On French nuclear testing, would you have expected anything beyond<br />
the extreme outrage that the Forum statement has agreed upon? </p>
<p>PM: Well I don't think there is much else that the Forum can do as it has<br />
already been party to delegations to Paris, it has already expressed<br />
itself in the strongest way in the past. We have now seen one weapon<br />
detonated and it's a case of continuing to keep the pressure on France.<br />
GW: Nauru's President wanted the French Minister for Cooperation excluded<br />
from the post-Forum dialogue to take place in Port Moresby on Monday.<br />
Why not go down that route?<br />
PM: Well there was no support for that because I think for some countries<br />
here, smaller Pacific island states, their only contact with France is<br />
actually through this dialogue point every year. For those, of course,<br />
who have embassies and structured relations with France, it doesn't<br />
matter. But you have got to remember there are many countries that are<br />
very small you know, with just populations of 70,000 and less and<br />
their only contact with France is at post-Forum dialogues. So I think<br />
they took the view they are better to have a link than no link.<br />
GW: Tomorrow you will be attending the 20th Anniversary celebrations for<br />
Papua New Guinea's independence. Would you agree that the<br />
economic difficulties in PNG, in recent years, have placed the bilateral<br />
relationship under more strain than previously?<br />
PM: Oh not as much strain as it would be under had there not been<br />
independence. I mean if it was still basically a trust territory, a colony of<br />
Australia, then we would have a lot more problems than we have ever<br />
had in the period of independence. It was a right step for Australia and<br />
a right step for Papua New Guinea.<br />
GW: We are giving about $ 300 million annually in aid. It is being shifted to<br />
program aid. Isn't one of the difficulties that Australia is dictating to PNG<br />
really how that money should be spent?<br />
PM: No I don't think so. It is just that Papua New Guinea has got now a<br />
revenue base of its own, it is a country that has got a lot of resources,<br />
mining in particular, and it doesn't need the Australian appropriation to<br />
come as budget aid. Rather, we get a better bang for the buck coming<br />
as program aid and the communities can see the immediate impact of<br />
Australian spending in such areas as schools and education and roads.<br />
Whereas, if it goes as a budget, it disappears into the accounts of the<br />
Papua New Guinea Government. So we decided long ago, Australia<br />
I mean, that we would make this transfer from budget aid to program aid<br />
and we are just about half way.<br />
GW: Just finally, while you have been overseas this week, Carmen Lawrence<br />
has appeared before the Royal Commission. You supported her going<br />
there in public statements. But what has she achieved? </p>
<p>PM: Well she has had a chance to put her view in a structured and orderly<br />
way after other people, who have had a counter-view, have had the<br />
opportunity to have their view put and publicised. So I think that is what<br />
she has achieved. What is the value of the Commission after this?<br />
I think not much.<br />
GW: Will her appearance influence the outcome?<br />
PM: I don't know. But given the narrow terms of reference and the political<br />
nature of it, I don't think it matters very much.<br />
GW: So what you are saying, still, is wind up the Commission immediately?<br />
PM: Exactly. I think it was an outrage at the beginning with the terms of<br />
reference the way it was framed and no matter how conscientious the<br />
Commissioner might try to be, one can only work within the terms of<br />
reference a Commissioner is given.<br />
GW: Is Dr Lawrence still a positive selling point for the Government in the<br />
next election?<br />
PM: Well I think she remained that right through the period and I think the<br />
Australian community are quite smart about these things. They know<br />
when there is a lurk on and they know there is an abuse of executive<br />
power here. Royal Commissions are things which have been very<br />
valuable to Australia, very valuable. What Richard Court and<br />
John Howard have sought to do is to trash them as an institution to try<br />
and abuse their powers, the powers of the Royal Commission, to try and<br />
abuse it to seek out an opponent. And, of course, in Richard Court's<br />
case, he was not simply content to defeat Carmen Lawrence at the<br />
election, but he has now tried to destroy her personally. He is very<br />
spiteful and very vindictive and will be, of course, ignored in this<br />
exercise by us.<br />
GW: Prime Minister, thanks for joining us.<br />
PM: Thank you, Graham.<br />
