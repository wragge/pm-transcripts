FOR PRESS PM. NO. 67/ 1971<br />
BRITAIN AND THE E. E. C.<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr William McMahon<br />
The Prime Minister ( Mr McMahon) said that a decision by<br />
Britain to join the European Economic Community would create special<br />
problems for a number of important Australian industries. It would also call<br />
for adjustments in Australian trading arrangements with Europe and an<br />
increasicng emphasis on the development of new markets.<br />
" We have always recognised th-qt the decision to join the<br />
Community was one for Britain herself", M/ r McMahon said, " but, at the sametime,<br />
we have consistently pressed for recognition of, and consideration for,<br />
Australia's substantial trading interests with Britain.<br />
" As it became more apparent that the Six would be willing to<br />
admit Britain, Australia made further representations to ensure that there<br />
would be, in respect of her own trade with Britain, a reasonable transitional<br />
period in which any necessary adjustments~ required by Britain's entry could<br />
be made. " The Government decided that the Deputy Prime Minister<br />
and Minister for Trade and Industry, Mr Anthony, should go to Britain and<br />
to the member countries of the Community, to bring personally before them the<br />
case which Australia had been pressing through Ministerial and diplomatic<br />
channels and in other ways over an extended period. Our purpose was to<br />
ensure that, in the crucial stage of the negotiations between Britain and the Si,,<br />
Australia's case would be received and appreciated at the highest level.<br />
" Mr Anthony has pressed Australia's case strenuously in the<br />
face of formidable difficulties. The Government commends the effort he has<br />
made on behalf of Australia and the industries and communities concerned,"<br />
Mr McMahon said. " It is a matter for regret that Britain has not pressed our case<br />
with the Six to an o~ utcome satisfactory to us.<br />
' The Governmen-t will seek to maintain, as far as possible, its<br />
trade with Britain and the countries of Europe. At the same time, it will continue<br />
and increase efforts to develop new markets throughout the rest of the world.<br />
" I am informed that some time will elapse before the full impact<br />
of any decision by Britain to enter the Common Mairket is felt by those industries<br />
and communities in Australia li kely to be affected. However, the Government<br />
will, in the meantime, be giving urgent and close attention to the problems which<br />
will be posed in these areas by such a development and to ways and means of<br />
meeting them."<br />
