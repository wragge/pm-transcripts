PRIME MINISTER -THURSDAY, 3 April 198<br />
from the. Press Office K<br />
SUMMARY OF ZR~'<br />
V / Y<br />
Why the construction workers vacated the Noonkam Ise~ ati o yesterday<br />
is open to debate. Amax workers claim they were forced to withdraw.<br />
Report from earth mover and Liberal Party member, Mr O'Dristoll,<br />
interviewed.. Says the Aboric~ inies did not have to ask him twice<br />
to leave the station. Member for Fremantle Mr John Dawkins had<br />
a different interpretation of what happened at the station. Said<br />
the community leaders repeated a request they had made to Amax<br />
workers that they wanted them to leave and Amax said they<br />
understood the problems, and later in the morning, an Amax<br />
representative came to where he was and said that the company<br />
was withdrawing from the site. Says there was no suggestion of<br />
intimidation or threats of violence. ALP spokesman on Aboriginal<br />
Affairs, Mr West, agrees with Mr Dawkins account. Says if the<br />
State government has any sense they will take the opporunity<br />
to consider the matter deeply, and that it is the State government<br />
who is itching for confrontation. A Melbourne Age journalist,<br />
another eye witness to the Amax workers' departure, said the<br />
incident was a friendly and low key affair. Sir. Charles Court is<br />
adamant that the drilling will go on, and rejects any suggestion<br />
that Amax may want to withdraw. Says if Amax wants to go onto<br />
the station tomorrow, the government-will make it possible for<br />
them to go on tomorrow. Says it will be a very sorry day for the<br />
Aboriginies if they find that because of their actions, they have<br />
denied other Aboriginies access to this type of pastoral lease.<br />
Russia's export ban on titanium and soaring world prices for<br />
this metal have raised hopes for another major mining development<br />
in West Australia's gold fields, 400km west of Kalgoolie. They<br />
are claimed to be the largest ever discovered, and two companies<br />
are proposing to mine and process the metal. They are Ferrovenadiun<br />
Corporation and Thomas McKinnon Securities of Florida. Interview<br />
with two of their executives.<br />
A violent riot errupted in Bristol, England, when police raided<br />
a local cafe frequented by West Indians. 24 w'ere injured, 19 of them<br />
police. Report.<br />
The Australian mountaineering team which lost 3 of its members in<br />
the Himalayas on Sunday is now trekking out of the mountain, having<br />
abandoned both the expedition and the bodies of their dead colleagues.<br />
Report from Dehli on other lives lost on the, Annapurna.<br />
In France, the day may not be too far away when a newly married<br />
couple are asked discretly by waiters, boy or girl. These are the<br />
findings. of a French professor who has concluded that specially<br />
chosen diet for women can apparently decide the sex, of their baby.<br />
The Queensland Parliament has just passed a series of amendments<br />
to the State Police Act, and according to Terry O'Gorman, President<br />
of the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties, Section 69C of the Act<br />
is the most dangerous piece of legislation passed in the last<br />
years. Says 4,000 police in Queensland can now gather information<br />
on people who have never been before the court. They can feed<br />
that information into a central system to make it available<br />
to governments, agencies,-private insurance companies, and the<br />
people on whom-the information is being kept have no idea i that that<br />
it is being done. </p>
<p>2<br />
The statement issued by the Queensland Police Commissioner, Mr Camm,<br />
has claimed that the only people who will be investigated by police<br />
will be those who come under suspicion.<br />
In Los Angeles it has been announced the earliest form of life<br />
ever found on earth has been dated as 3.5 billion years old.<br />
The evidence consists of fossiles produced by microscopic<br />
organisms embedded in rock found in Marble Bar<br />
Western Australia. The announcement represents one of the first<br />
results of a 15 month project by an international team of scientists<br />
who have joined together in California to learn when and how life<br />
first began. Interview with man who found the rock, Dr Malcolm Walte:<br />
In the Greek Islands, Easter is traditionally celebrated with<br />
firecrackers but it seems that some of the large Greek community<br />
in Darwin have added a typically Darwin twist to the tradition.<br />
Their zeal in constructing these homemade firecrackers about<br />
the size of an easter egg, led to the roof of a neighbourhood<br />
factory being blown in by one of these eggs. N. T. police have<br />
issued a warning against these Greek easter eggs. Police spokesman<br />
says they are the non-eating type.<br />
