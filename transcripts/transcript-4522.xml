EMBARGO: 7.00 p. m.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 23 OCTOBER 1977<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
This week's announcement of a 2 percent increase in the<br />
Consumer Price Index for the September quarter is good news for<br />
Australia. It is good news for big companies,. small companies<br />
for farmers and its certainly good news for families.<br />
It is the first time in more than four years that the rate of<br />
increase has been held below 2.5 percent in each of three<br />
successive quarters. It confirms that Australia's rate of inflation<br />
is now running at an annual rate of around 9 percent and<br />
coming down.<br />
The figure confirms as I pointed out ten, days ago that we are<br />
beating inflation. There can be no doubt of that. It again<br />
shows up Mr Whitlam's pitiful attempt to talk the economy down<br />
in the Parliament just ten ' days ago when he claimed that inflation<br />
would spurt ahead in the quarter. He was trying to wreck confidence<br />
throughout Australia. He failed then. He will continue to fail.<br />
Clearly, the latest CPI result continues to vindicate our<br />
consistent economic strategy. Surely, there could hardly be a clearer<br />
confirmation of the success of our strategy. It shows above all<br />
else as we have never stopped repeating the benefit of firm<br />
control on Government spending, sensible monetary policies and<br />
wage restraint.<br />
This sustained and steady decline in inflation and in<br />
inflationary expectations will strengthen the economy in many ways.<br />
It gives business and industry the green light to expand: with<br />
confidence. Industry can now see that we have broken through ixi the<br />
fight to stop run-a-way inflation. It can plan ahead with the<br />
knowledge that the Government will maintain its policies.<br />
Industry can be certain that the Government will keep on with<br />
policies that encourage them to produce and to make profits, in a<br />
stable economiic climate. Australia's export and manfacturing<br />
industries will be in a stronger competitive position.<br />
The gains fJrom last year's devaluationlhave not been thrown away in<br />
higher prices. Exports are strengthening and we can look forward to<br />
a consolidation in this vital area. The economy will also<br />
strengthen as interest rates come down. This will reduce the<br />
Cost of borrowing to Australian companies and will certainly<br />
encourage new investment decisions. / 2 </p>
<p>Our fight against inflation is not being taken in isolation.<br />
Inflation has hurt millions of Australians. Perhaps its most<br />
devastating effect has been on the growth of jobs in the community.<br />
There is only one way to effectively increase the number of jobs<br />
in Australia and that is by restoring growth in our economy.<br />
We are growing as a nation if we produce more goods and services.<br />
These goods and services must be sold and the degree to which this<br />
can be done depends on individuals buying and business investing.<br />
Now the great problem in Australia over the last few years<br />
is that inflation has affected people's willingness to make<br />
these decisions about buying things they want. This also has<br />
other effects. If people don't spend on the things they want<br />
Australian manufacturers and other producers pull back their<br />
production. This inevitably means that jobs are lost.<br />
That is why we need growth to provide., those essential jobs for<br />
people now looking for work and especially for young people<br />
still at school who will be wanting jobs in the years ahead.<br />
That is why we have placed priority in winding down Australia's rate<br />
of inflation. We know that we cannot relax in-policies to beat<br />
inflation. Our determination to keep inflation moving down must be<br />
fully miantained. We cannot afford to throw away the hard won<br />
gains. The Government is completely determined to press on with its<br />
economic strategy. There is no alternative.<br />
The fLull b-enef-its-of-.--ur-strategy consistently applied from our<br />
first day in Government will soon become even more widely<br />
recognised. There will be a lift in optimism, in confidence.<br />
It will be reflected throughout Australia in the cities and in<br />
the country. Australia is back on the road to economic health.<br />
There is no question of that.<br />
I and my Government know that our policies are right for Australia.<br />
We know too that Australia will never accept the kind of forlorn<br />
economic thinking still being advanced by the Labor Party.<br />
As I said two weeks ago we must never forget what happened<br />
to Australia under Labor. There is no way we could survive that<br />
kind of experiment again. </p>
