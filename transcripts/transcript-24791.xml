    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth Government will secure funding for the Men’s Sheds programme.</p>
<p>Men’s Sheds are an important part of many Australian communities. They keep men active, contributing to their mental health and physical wellbeing.</p>
<p>Funding for the Men’s Sheds programme is due to expire on June 30, 2016. To provide certainty, the Government will guarantee funding for a further three years. This will take our total additional commitment to $4.5 million over 3 years.</p>
<p>We’re pleased to be able to make this announcement on Father’s Day.</p>
<p>This will allow the Men’s Sheds grant rounds to continue to run for the next 3 years. These allow local men’s sheds to maintain their shed, buy new tools or start new projects. It’s a win for the sheds, the men who use them and the communities that benefit from them. Men’s Sheds reduce social isolation, particularly for older men and people living in rural and remote areas.</p>
<p>This funding reflects our commitment to promoting and supporting men’s health.</p>
<p>Applications for grants are assessed by the Australian Men’s Shed Association, in accordance with guidelines agreed by the Department of Health. All sheds are eligible to apply for funding under the National Shed Development Programme (NSDP). Grants are awarded on a competitive basis up to a total of $8,000 (GST exclusive), with priority given to sheds in disadvantaged areas.</p>
<p>Round 11 of the NSDP is currently open for applications.  Sheds are able to apply for up to a total of $8,000 across three funding categories – tools, equipment, community projects and training; building maintenance and development; and health improvement activities.</p>
