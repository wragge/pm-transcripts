The Prime Minister Julia Gillard is encouraging South Australians to make schools the heart of their local communities following a record Government investment in new facilities and equipment.</p>
<p>More than 600 South Australian schools have built education and recreation facilities which are now being used by local community groups as well as students and staff.</p>
<p>The Gillard Labor Government has invested more than $1.37 billion to modernise South Australian schools and the Prime Minister today inspected new such facilities at her former primary school in Adelaide.</p>
<p>The Mitcham Junior Primary and Primary schools, the oldest state school in South Australia, received a total of $5.3 million for refurbishment work, the construction of classrooms, a library and a multipurpose hall.</p>
<p>The new facilities are now being used almost every night of the week by members of the local community.</p>
<p>This is a great example of how communities are benefiting from the Government's investment in our schools.</p>
<p>School projects completed across South Australia include:</p>
<p> * 	288 Classrooms<br />
 * 	173 Libraries<br />
 * 	26 Science centres<br />
 * 	24 Language centres<br />
 * 	234 Multi-purpose halls<br />
 * 	250 Shade structures<br />
 * 	61 Sporting facilities<br />
 * 	202 Sporting grounds, and<br />
 * 	42 Covered outdoor learning areas          </p>
<p>These projects have transformed the learning environment for thousands of students. Examples like these are also helping to meet the diverse needs of local communities across South Australia.</p>
<p>Funding for Tyndale Christian School in Salisbury East Adelaide, for example has allowed the school to support its most needy children through the provision of specialist support, therapy and sensory rooms. Meanwhile, the new school hall at St John's Lutheran School in rural Eudunda is serving as a valuable facility for the local community.</p>
<p>The multipurpose hall at Mitcham Primary School is being used for a wide range of activities while students have access to better facilities for physical education and drama classes.</p>
<p>Investments like these ensure students at Mitcham Primary and other South Australian schools have the best conditions to help them get a world-class education.</p>
