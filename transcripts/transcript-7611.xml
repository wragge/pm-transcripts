TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH PAUL MURPHY, TONIGHT PROGRAM,<br />
SBS, 23 MAY 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
0 oMnU RPtHhYe: TonPirgihmte mSihnowi. ster thanks very much indeed for coming<br />
PM: My pleasure. Could I just correct that introduction?<br />
I did not clash with my Foreign Minister.<br />
MURPHY: OK, I'll get to that in a second and to other<br />
foreign policy matters. If I can just put in a domestic<br />
question first.<br />
PM: Sure.<br />
MURPHY: Apparently in Question Time in the Senate this<br />
afternoon Senator John Button said in reply to a question<br />
put by Richard Alston that all arms of economic policy were<br />
under review and an appropriate announcement will be made<br />
shortly. Can you tell me what arms are under review and<br />
why? PM: Well, rather it's correct to say that we are always<br />
looking at the way in which all the arms of policy are<br />
operating. We are constantly doing that and seeing that<br />
they are appropriately tuned.<br />
MURPHY: So this is fiscal and monetary policy?<br />
PM: And wages.<br />
MURPHY: And wages.<br />
PM: Always under review.<br />
MURPHY: So nothing out of the ordinary about the statement?<br />
PM: Nothing out of the ordinary.<br />
MURPHY: Just before I go to foreign policy, the dollar's<br />
not been doing too well recently. Are you concerned about<br />
that? </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM: Well, let's get it clear that basically the decline of<br />
the Australian dollar has been against the United States<br />
dollar which has surged against all currencies. There has<br />
been a drop, but only relatively, a marginal drop against<br />
the other major currencies the pound sterling, deutschmark<br />
and the yen.<br />
MURPHY: Yes, not doing too badly against the yen today, but<br />
you're not worried about that at all?<br />
PM: No, well once you've floated the dollar, then the<br />
market sets the rate. That's what a floating dollar is<br />
about. MURPHY: OK Prime Minister, if we can go to foreign policy,<br />
but even before that, you are putting a motion up on<br />
multiculturalism and immigration.<br />
PM: No, wrong again. Not a motion about multiculturalism,<br />
Paul, and deliberately not because the one thing that we<br />
want absolutely to do in terms of Australia's and the<br />
region's interest is to get an unequivocal declaration of a<br />
return to bipartisanship on our immigration policy. That is<br />
in terms of there being no discrimination on the basis of<br />
race. We've deliberately excluded reference to<br />
multiculturalism, not because we're not totally committed to<br />
it, but we didn't want to introduce that element into the<br />
motion because perhaps the opposition needs a bit more time<br />
to sort out its position on that. But the Leader of the<br />
opposition made a, from my point of view, a totally welcome<br />
statement about a return to bipartisanship in immigration<br />
policy. MURPHY: Indeed he did, so I'm wondering why you're putting<br />
him to the test on the floor of the House. Do you to<br />
deliver? PM: No, and I want to make it quite clear to your viewers<br />
and I hope that the Leader of the opposition understands<br />
that there's not an attempt to get any political advantage,<br />
but rather the position that I know directly from my visit<br />
earlier this year to the region and what we've had conveyed<br />
to us is that there's a very deep concern in the region,<br />
Paul, about what they perceive as the departure from<br />
bipartisanship. It's very much, in all our interests, the<br />
Opposition, the Government, the people of Australia, that it<br />
-be clear that we are back-on-the bipartisan track on<br />
immigration.<br />
MURPHY: So, it's really a signal to the region and to those<br />
people, those countries who may have been worried about how<br />
things have been going over the past twelve months?<br />
PM: A signal to the region and, may I say, to Australia as<br />
well. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
MURPHY: with people like Ian Macphee and Philip Ruddock on<br />
the Shadow frontbench, multiculturalism shouldn't be too<br />
hard a concept for the Opposition to come to terms with now<br />
should it?<br />
PM: It shouldn't be, particularly when you consider that<br />
not so long ago in the old Parliament House there was a<br />
unanimous vote of the Parliament on this question. It is<br />
something for which the Liberal Party historically is<br />
entitled to take a great deal of credit for its<br />
introduction. So it shouldn't be a difficult problem. I<br />
hope it won't be.<br />
MURPHY: OK Prime Minister, well let's turn to the Middle<br />
East and let's hope that we get our facts right in this. I<br />
think I'm right in saying that in the Parliament some weeks<br />
ago you did reprimand Dr Wilenski, our Ambassador to the UN,<br />
for a speech that he did give on the situation in the<br />
occupied territories and you said that it lacked balance.<br />
Now can you explain why you did come to that conclusion?<br />
PM: Yes basically, because while the statement by Dr<br />
wilenski did deplore violence on all sides, in my judgement<br />
it was somewhat unbalanced in that it didn't put the<br />
difficulties of Israel into an historical context. I mean<br />
we recognise that they have difficulties that they've<br />
historically been confronted with, but having said that<br />
and I think that ought to have been said there was simply<br />
no question but that the vote was right and there should<br />
have been the vote in the way it was where there was 129<br />
countries voting, there was only the two, United States and<br />
Israel voting against and one abstention, Liberia. So the<br />
vote was right. of course one of the the problems is that<br />
when you do an explanation of vote it is necessarily very<br />
brief. It doesn't enable any government to give a detailed<br />
full exposition of its foreign policy position. But I still<br />
made the point that I thought in that respect, it was<br />
somewhat unbalanced.<br />
MUPEHY: Alright, so it didn't signal your statement. Any<br />
change in our policy towards a solution of the Palestinian<br />
problem? PM: None at all. There was no change of policy and indeed<br />
we'd voted on a similar resolution UNGA 42 in 1987 and in<br />
1988, so there was no change of policy. The position that<br />
ehave in regard to-. Middle East in general is quite<br />
clear. It is based upon a recognition of the right of<br />
Israel to exist and to be viable and secure, also as<br />
consistently involve the recognition of the rights of the<br />
Palestinian people.<br />
MURPHY: Yes indeed, and of course now the PLO has said that<br />
Israel has the right to exist. In fact I think I'm right in<br />
saying that in 1981 you said that once the PLO did that,<br />
then there should be efforts made to get Israel and the PLO<br />
to the negotiating table? </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PM: Yes, my position has been consistent over a long period<br />
of time. Indeed I'm entitled I think to say that I was the<br />
person in the international arena who first laid down, if I<br />
may put it that way, the three conditions which I believe<br />
were necessary for movement. On the part of the PLO, that<br />
required an acceptance of 242 and 338 resolutions of the<br />
United Nations, secondly, the right of-Israel to exist and<br />
thirdly the renunciation of terrorism. Now I put those<br />
positions within the United States, I put them in the Soviet<br />
Union and I put them in the Middle East. Essentially I<br />
think they've come to accept it as the reasonable conditions<br />
and in fact, at least in form, the PLO has met those<br />
conditions. I accept the fact that in respect of some<br />
spokesmen for the PLO you could say there's been some<br />
equivocation about certain elements of that, but it would be<br />
churlish on the part of anyone, I believe, not to recognise<br />
there has been a significant move towards the acceptance of<br />
those three conditions by the PLO. In those circumstances I<br />
have said consistently, I believe there's an obligation upon<br />
Israel itself to respond positively and to go towards the<br />
processes of dialogue, fully understanding that they in<br />
Israel are entitled to watch cautiously and to see a<br />
reflection in deeds to those words of acceptance. But I do<br />
believe that it would be unreal for anyone, Israel included,<br />
not to accept two things. One, that there has been a<br />
significant change in statements by the PLO and secondly, in<br />
a sense, also equally importantly, Paul, that there is a<br />
change in the international environment by which I mean<br />
that in terms of the two superpowers we are now living in a<br />
world where, as a result of the dialogue and a constructive<br />
dialogue that is going on between the two superpowers, we<br />
are seeing in regional areas the reduction of conflicts.<br />
vide Namibia, vide Afghanistan, vide Indo-China. So I think<br />
Israel and the-parties in the Mi[ le East have to understand<br />
that there is now an attitude in the world which is<br />
requiring of participants to local conflict a preparedness<br />
to move more than they have in the past towards the<br />
resolution of those regional conflicts.<br />
MURPHY: Indeed Prime Minister there's confusion at the<br />
moment about the Israelis wanting to offer some form of<br />
elections in the occupied territories. The PLO don't appear<br />
to be interested, although who knows what will happen.<br />
You've taken a keen interest in this area as you've just<br />
said for many years, and you're one of the world's longest<br />
serving leaders. Would you feel tempted to offer your<br />
services at all in a.,, olution of this continuing problem?<br />
PM: Well not to offer. But what I've said and may in<br />
response to feelers and suggestions that have been made to<br />
me from a number of quarters from within Israel, from<br />
within some of the Arab states who have recognised my long<br />
standing interest and, may I say, knowledge of the subject<br />
that they've said perhaps I could do something. My position<br />
is quite clear. </p>
<p>MURPHY: Recent feelers Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Well there have been some suggestions. I mean I don't<br />
want to go to them and I don't want to have a great story<br />
developed out of that. There have been some suggestions.<br />
My position has been consistent Paul, and it is this. That<br />
I don't attempt to push myself or Australia in this issue.<br />
It is simply this to say, ' yes I do have a long involvement<br />
and interest and I think an acceptance by both sides of<br />
integrity in this issue. I do have a pretty profound<br />
knowledge I think of the issues'. My Government and, may I<br />
say, not only my Government but I think I can speak on<br />
behalf of the Opposition on this matter that there is a<br />
bipartisan commitment to a resolution of the an honourable<br />
resolution in this region. I simply say that if it were the<br />
wish of the parties involved for us to play some more<br />
particular part then we would be prepared to do it.<br />
MURPHY: And you personally would be available if approached<br />
by the parties or the UN or the superpowers?<br />
PM: Yes if they thought I could help, of course one would<br />
be available.<br />
MURPHY: All right. If I can move on to the situation in<br />
China. I know you spoke in the House this afternoon about<br />
this. How are you reading it now? Do you think that<br />
Government is paralysed? Is there a secret power struggle?<br />
You knew Hu Yaobang very well of course his death sparked<br />
off the student demonstrations. Do you think that there's a<br />
power struggle going on now at the moment?<br />
PM: I did know all the leaders and I don't think it is a<br />
very profound observation to say that there is some form of<br />
power stuggle. There are obviously differences of approach<br />
amongst the leadership as to what is the most appropriate<br />
way of dealing with this matter. But let me say this. I<br />
think that the authorities in China are to be congratulated<br />
on the fact that certainly to this point there has been an<br />
eschewal of violence to try and put down the protest and the<br />
expression of view that is now coming through not only<br />
from the students but from a wide variety of interests in<br />
China. It is my strong view and the view of my Government,<br />
again I think I can speak for the Opposition, the view of<br />
the Parliament and the people of Australia that we would<br />
hope and expect that ~ e~ beautho-rities in China would not<br />
resort to violence to put down these obvious widespread and<br />
deeply felt expressions of concern in China and to the<br />
extent that there are differences of emphasis. You may want<br />
to use the word crisis in leadership. It is uncertain and<br />
we are constantly in touch with what's happening. One can't<br />
be absolutely precise Paul, about whether you would describe<br />
it as a total crisis. But there does seem to be a division<br />
of opinion. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
MURPHY: It's not looking too good for reform at the moment<br />
and what these youngsters these dedicated youngsters are<br />
after? PM: I think there will be inevitably be further reform.<br />
What we're witnessing Paul, both within China and the Soviet<br />
Union, is the invarying degrees and understanding that<br />
historical and outdated ideologies which have as their<br />
central thesis the concept of command control of the<br />
economy, command control of the policy, that those<br />
historical ideologies are not relevant to the modern<br />
realities of the end of the 20th century. These were<br />
philosophies that emerged at the beginning of this century.<br />
They are not appropriate to the realities of the end of this<br />
century. Now it is inevitable therefore and I think both in<br />
the Soviet Union and in China that there would be moves<br />
which we welcome towards a society in which there will be<br />
greater rights of political involvement and expression for<br />
the ordinary people. We've seen that. We're seeing that<br />
emerging very much in the Soviet Union. I think it's<br />
inevitable that it will happen in China as well.<br />
MURPHY: All right Prime Minister. I can't let you go<br />
without a final brief question domestically if you don't<br />
mind? A Newspoll poll this morning showed the Party that Mr<br />
Peacock now leads is not doing too badly in fact quite<br />
well viz a viz your Government and apparently Andrew<br />
Peacock did quite well in the House this afternoon. Do you<br />
think you'll have to be on your mettle now that Mr Peacock<br />
leads the Liberals?<br />
PM: No. He's no greater threat than Mr Howard. Just about<br />
that poll. There is no-one in politics who believes the<br />
switch from 49 to 41. But if you want to look at the poll I<br />
mean look at the satisfaction rating of Mr Peacock 22 no<br />
where not a half of mine. Now I'm not complacent about<br />
that. The poll was a pretty meaningless one. We are<br />
content that we're going on with the business of Government,<br />
they are going on with the business of self destruction.<br />
MURPHY: But is Andrew Peacock a more substantial figure<br />
PM: No, no. Mr Howard is a much more substantial figure<br />
and all the people who voted for Mr Peacock recognise the<br />
fact. They didn't vote for substance, they voted for style.<br />
MURPHY: OK Prime Mint'ñ er. -Many thanks indeed for talking<br />
to<br />
PM: It's a pleasure to be with you Paul, thank you.<br />
ends </p>
