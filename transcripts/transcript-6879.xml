    <content><![CDATA[<p>FOR MEDIA 10 April 1986<br />
Mr Ian Castles, formerly Secretary Department of Finance, has<br />
been appointed Australian Statistician.<br />
As Australia's major statistical authority, the Australian Bureau<br />
of Statistics plays a vital role in providing the information<br />
needed to provide a firm basis for decision-making and for<br />
community understanding of economic and social issues. The<br />
Government is committed to its continuing development as an<br />
objective statistical organisation maintaining the highest<br />
professional standards, thereby ensuring the availability of<br />
adequate information to support decision-making in the public and<br />
private sectors and to promote a generally well-informed society.<br />
It is the Government's intention that the Australian Bureau of<br />
Statistics should establish closer links with the many centres of<br />
economic and social research within Government and in the<br />
universities which make extensive use of the Bureau's product in<br />
carrying out their functions.<br />
Mr Castles has had an extensive involvement in the formulation of<br />
advice to government on economic and social policies. Before his<br />
appointment as Secretary, Department of Finance in 1979 he worked<br />
as Chairman of the Income Security Review and as a Deputy<br />
Secretary and then Under Secretary in the Department of Prime<br />
Minister and Cabinet.<br />
Dr M4 S Keating has been appointed as Secretary to the Department<br />
of Finance. Dr Keating was formerly Secretary to the Department<br />
of Employment and Industrial Relations. Since 11 February 1986<br />
Dr Keating has been the Secretary designate to the Department of<br />
Finance. These appointments take effect today. </p>
