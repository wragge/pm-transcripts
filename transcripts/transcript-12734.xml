    <content><![CDATA[<p>Subjects: Lleyton Hewitt's Wimbledon win.</p>
<p>E&amp;OE...........  </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Lleyton Hewitt';s victory?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It';s fantastic. I think there will be millions of very happy Australians this morning. It';s a tremendous performance at such a young age. A very convincing win. He';s got an enormous future in front of him. He';s a very resilient sportsman. He';s got great determination and I';m just so delighted.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Have you spoken with Lleyton since his win?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I just tried to reach him on the phone and he';s on the way to where I rang, and I';m going to try and speak with him in a few minutes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You';re in Europe. Were you tempted to go over for the game?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I was but duty called. I had other things to do and it is important that I do those. But it was on our minds and he was very much in our thoughts and he';s made it. And it gives Australians great pride when somebody as young as that and as talented as that can win the most prestigious tennis tournament in the world.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What will be your message when you finally speak to Lleyton?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well just warm congratulations and he';s made millions of Australian sports lovers very happy. I spoke to him last night to wish him well, and he was confident without being cocky about it, which is always good. And I';m just so delighted it';s come off for him.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>He does occasionally stray into not so good behaviour though. Is that a concern if he';s representing Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Goodnight.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Could I ask you how you rate him? You';ve seen a lot of great Australian tennis playersâ€¦</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It';s too early to get into those comparisons and I don';t want to burden a young player with premature comparisons. He is a very talented tennis player in his own right and it is never helpful for anybody, particularly somebody in my position, to say well he';s another X or another Y. He is not another X or Y. He is Lleyton Hewitt, outstanding young tennis champion.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Would you like to see Pat Rafter back for perhaps an even better final next year?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I';ve got great fondness for Pat, as many Australians have. What he does with his future is a matter for him and I';ll tell you what, if he did decide to come back, he';d make a lot of people happy. </p>
