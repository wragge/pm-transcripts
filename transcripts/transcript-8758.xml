PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW/ TALKMACK WITH PET~ ER KENNEDY/ GERRY<br />
WWkNONI ABC RADIO 8 DECEMBER 1992<br />
Z AND OE PROOF ONLY<br />
KENNEDY; Prime Minister, with regard to yesterday's<br />
meeting of the Council of Australian Government you must have<br />
been disappointed that not even the Labor States aided with<br />
you ont theS issue of industrial relations reforms.<br />
PM: They did on the one part but not another. That<br />
is there are two parts of this, That in that we extend or<br />
make It easier for people to have access to the federal<br />
lurisdiction of the Arbitration Commission where no arbitral<br />
structure exists. Thie is nationwide legislation but for<br />
instance In Victoria, the thing which would trigger it would<br />
be when the awards under the Kennett government expire in<br />
March, Victorian employees can seek coverage and have an award<br />
made to protect them by the Industrial Relations Commission.<br />
Vow it seemed to me the Labor states were not so much worried<br />
about that, they were a bit worried about the legislation<br />
under what we call the external affairs power that was<br />
legislation giving effect to ' International Labour Organisation<br />
conventions on equal pay, minimum rites of pay and<br />
terminations of conditions. But they have got nothing to fear<br />
from that, an4 the other thing is Australia has ratified these<br />
conventions, They were all ratified with the agreement and<br />
consultation of the States and we are legislating to impose<br />
international minima. So I said to them how could you object,<br />
does anyone object to it being equal pay for equal work or<br />
minimumr rates of pay or proper redundancy in termination<br />
axrangemezfts, KENNEDY: You said at the lunchtime news conference that<br />
you wanted to legislate onl some of these-issues before<br />
Christmas. Are you still going to be able to do that?<br />
PM, We have got a very large legislative load and<br />
the drafting task is always, With a thing like this,<br />
considerable. But if we can got it drafted In we will, but we<br />

PM: ( cont'd) may noat. We certainly will get the extension of<br />
the Arbitration Commission prerogative, that legislation in.<br />
But see the important thing about all this Peter is this, the<br />
States in a sense are worried about their patch.' Mhat I have<br />
got to worry about is the rights and entitlements of<br />
Australian working men and women and what the Victorian<br />
government has done is unconscientable. Come March people<br />
have got no rights at all, no rights. You take the contract,<br />
Individual contract, or you take the sack and there is no<br />
minimums which will protect them. There is no rights to<br />
redundancy arrangements if they don't appear at work it's an<br />
industrial action they can be fined. They have got no rights<br />
whatsoever and that is what I am worried about and that id<br />
what the government sought to protect.<br />
XE4NEDYI How important in your industrial relations<br />
strata g was the need to head off continued Industrial action<br />
especially in Victoria which could have Cost you electoral<br />
support? pXg z think what we have said to the Victorian<br />
community and its workfoarce is, look while the Kennett<br />
government is running the sort of small business<br />
organisation's agenda trying to strip working people of any<br />
roipgphotrst uwnihtyat sotoev ebre, cwoev ewreidll beyx tean df etdoe rayol u aewnahradn. ced I tahcicneks s thanedy<br />
have thought well good enough and therefore the widespread<br />
dispute which we would have had this week with a power strike<br />
in Victoria they have I think quite Wisely but sensibly called<br />
off.<br />
IGANNON a Let's take some callers Prime Minister.<br />
JOHN: In the committee stages of the tax law<br />
amendment file number bill in 1988 on 2 November Paul* Keating<br />
stated the amendments that the government agrees to accept are<br />
designed to guarantee that the tax file number sygtem is<br />
completely voluntary. They ensure that every person when in<br />
all Circumstances retain the right to elect to have tax<br />
witheld at source rather than quote their number. Taking into<br />
account comments reported by yourself in The Australian<br />
newspapar some months ago regarding the WA Royal Commission<br />
and TIN fishing trips, could you please explain the<br />
dragnotting that the Department of Social Security is<br />
indulging in and why my invalid support pension was cut two<br />
months ago because of my refusal to comply with the request<br />
for a TFN7 Is this what is meant by voluntary in your quoted<br />
statement on 2 November 1988?<br />
PM: The voluntary means that you have the right to<br />
get a tax f ile number and to use that or you elect to have<br />
deductions taken at source. That's where the voluntary<br />
quality comes in and most people of course have a tax f lie<br />
number and therefore that witholding at source doesn't Occur.<br />
That's what meant, simple as that. TE: Dec .92 15 : 56 1, o 038 P. 02/ 1-</p>
<p>TEL: Dec .92 115: 6 No .038 P. 03/ C<br />
3. IIIENs What concerne me more than anything is the<br />
health problem that we have, It's all very well f or Xedicare<br />
and all that sort of thing but we here in Kalgoorlie we have a<br />
wonderful hospital, good administrators, nurse., whatever we<br />
need. But not sa long ago the hospital administration had to<br />
close a ward because there wasn't sufficient money to run it.<br />
we are lacking in doctors because we are s0 f ar f rom the<br />
medical centre which is Perth. What is in it and what's going<br />
to happen especially for the pensioners please? That is my<br />
question I am a bit worried about that.<br />
P1 As you know Medicare is a national health<br />
insurance system. It covers the provision of medical servi~ ces<br />
with doctors and also access for patients to public hospitals.<br />
Medicare is not the management system for the public hopsital<br />
system they are managed by the States and what the government<br />
has proposed in the new Medicare agreement# which will now run<br />
for 5 years, in the Budget, we proposed in the Budget to pay<br />
the States another $ 300 million a year or $ 1,500 million over<br />
years for enhanced access by public patients to public<br />
hospitals. That is to make the taking of public patients into public<br />
hospitals more 4ttractive and I am pretty confident thoe<br />
agreements will be signed and it will mean I think that those<br />
particularly elderly patient. who may have a need of elective<br />
surgery of some kind, it means that their access should be<br />
speedier through the public hospital system because it will be<br />
more in the inttere8s of the public hospital system to take<br />
them. Now of course some people will wisely insure themselves<br />
as well but the insurance helps In relation to elective<br />
surgery it doesn't matter that much of course for acute. It<br />
you have got an acute condition you are rushed to a hospital<br />
well then if you go in as a Medicare patient you go in<br />
basically the same room and you are treated by the same<br />
doctor. So these are all matters for judgement but we will<br />
make the public system much better by providing to the States<br />
$ 300 million a year for the next 5 years.<br />
GANNONt So will that mean the prevention of the<br />
scenario for isomebody who has got to wait a year oree 2<br />
years for a painful hip replacement?<br />
PM1 It should shorten it, it should shorten it<br />
considerably because I think the States will then and as well<br />
an that we provided yesterday as a matter of fact $ 50 million<br />
to the States to reduce waiting lists by setting up systems,<br />
computer systems, time management sytems in state hospital<br />
administrations where perhaps you might have queuing at one<br />
hospital but not at another where people's desire for surgery<br />
can be accormodated at a range of hospitals within the city<br />
for instance. So that was done yesterday. All this I think<br />
should help very much in improving public patient access for<br />
things like el. ective surgery. </p>
<p>TEL: . Dec .92 15: 56 N. o .0<br />
4. C3ANNON1 So you believe that there is still a lot of<br />
scope in the state management of the hospital system for<br />
improvement? PKI I think that is true of all systems but again I<br />
think if the Commonwealth mAkes it more attractive for the<br />
public hospitals to take public patients they will and by<br />
adoption of this scheme yesterday on waiting lists it should<br />
be that we won't f ind a position where someone has to wait<br />
quite awhile at one hospital but at another there is virtually<br />
no waiting time. We can arrange better the queuing more<br />
effectively, more efficiently. Between the two it should make<br />
a very big change.<br />
TAPFYs What I Wanted to Speak to you about in that I<br />
commend your action you have taken regarding the television<br />
violence for our children. Were you influenced by the good<br />
relations that you have and close knittedness(? with your<br />
wife and your children?<br />
PI The thing that influenced me on this was<br />
exclusively my ownl experience with my children because I think<br />
that when you sit down to watch a movie a 8.30 at night you<br />
should be able to sit there with your family and not be<br />
embarrassed by what you see, not have to go and switch the<br />
dial to another channel or shoo the kids off to somewhere else<br />
and that is why I think that what has been happening in<br />
chasing ratings and revenue the TV stations have been pushing<br />
the limits and the edges out to what was acceptable In terms<br />
of violence for showing it at 8.3Opm.<br />
Now what has happened now we have now developed two<br />
categories. First of all we have developed a sole -single<br />
classification system for video, film and TV aQ that the<br />
commonwealth film censor will determine what classification<br />
goes on a f ilm to go in the theatres. That will be the same<br />
classification that goes in the video shops and it will be the<br />
same classification that goes on TV. Afd essentially what it<br />
will mean is that what used to be called AO or adults only on<br />
Tv will now be split into a category called 24 for mature<br />
audiences which is the softer part of AO and the harder part<br />
will be called &amp; XA and they can only be shown after 9. O0pm. So<br />
what it means is one system, so everyone will know more<br />
accurately what is in the film and at 8.3Opm, for an B. 3Opm<br />
showing which is now nearly every night of the week in most<br />
Australian cities people will not see the violence they would<br />
have seen three months ago.<br />
GANNONt so you were influenced by your own family<br />
situation and your own family viewing habits?<br />
PM1 I watched them, I see what my kids have on and<br />
I watch them like hawks you see to switch of f the things which<br />
are violent and i don't think they want to see them and<br />
children 7 and 11 and 13 they shouldn't be subjected to that 13 F .04/ C </p>
<p>TEL<br />
S1 PXt ( cont'd) sort of etuff and particularly during the school<br />
holidays I think TV stations should use a bit of snose about<br />
what they show and to have kids sitting up obviously a little<br />
bit later in the school holidays watching stuff which is quite<br />
violent is just not a goer. So my children are seeing less<br />
and less TV by virtue of the fact that a lot of it is not<br />
worth watching. I hope this changes.<br />
GERRYs In the light of this country's desperate need<br />
for foreign currency, tourism and offshore business, how can<br />
the government JustiLy the difficulty being enCOuntered in the<br />
UK in relation to visitors'_ visas? Regular family visitors<br />
now have to renew visas annually and a business friend and<br />
frequent visitor applied to extend a 2 year visa to a 3 year<br />
one and got a 6 month visa instead. ' Why are we making it so<br />
hard for visitors and business to help us make ends meet?<br />
Immigration control is one thing, cutting oft our noses to<br />
spite our face is another don't you agree?<br />
PM: Who could not agree with that but I am not<br />
familiar with what change we have made there but I don't think<br />
that anybody that wants to come to this country as a visitor<br />
has any real problem and countries do run Immigration laws to<br />
suit their national interests and I am sure many Australians,<br />
it wasn't that many years ago when people from so called<br />
commonwealth countries had ease of access into Britain but now<br />
what you find is that when you arrive at Heathrow it is the<br />
Suropean Community queue that has ease of access Into Britain<br />
and all the colonials wait on a long line. Now we don't do<br />
that to anybody no I don't think access Into Australia is a<br />
problem and whatever the visa arrangements might be they are<br />
not onerous.<br />
JOHNI my question relates to the goods and services<br />
tax. I am a self funded retiree and have some distinct<br />
reservations on the GST and I also believe that many of the<br />
initiatives that you undertook in your early years as<br />
Treasurer made a very positive contribution to this country.<br />
However, on the GST maybe the electorate has a short memory<br />
but in 1985 a GST was your special project, your baby, you ran<br />
with it, you fought for it, I think you called it the<br />
Taxcard(? 7 Ok you lost out to the ACTU. NOW in respect of<br />
this and the fact that now is a period of record low inflation<br />
I submit that your credibility in opposing this tax now is<br />
lea than<br />
PM. Let me explain<br />
JOHNs Could I just finish my question. My question<br />
is that in the event that Dr Howson wins the election and a<br />
GST is introduced would you give an undertaking that as<br />
opposition leader that you would campaign Ln the 1996 election<br />
for its abolition? T. Dec. 92 15: 56 No. 038 </p>
<p>TEL<br />
PXI Let me just explain things this way. In the<br />
middle 1980o the former government, the Liberal government of<br />
which Dr Hewbon wag a principal adviser to John Howard, left<br />
the tax system in a dreadful state of haemorrhaqe. Very few<br />
people in the Australian tax administration felt, it had been<br />
left in neglect for so long, it was capable of repair. so<br />
perhaps a gloomy view was we want to collect it when they<br />
spend its Let's Put on a consumption tax because we won't fix<br />
the direct side tax system and we have a very large budget<br />
deficit to fund. Two things, 1 when the GS? was denied to me<br />
because the f act I couldn't give the guarantee that the<br />
inflationary effect wouldn't go into wages and I Might say Dr<br />
Hewson certainly can't give that guarantee.<br />
it a Labor Treaeurer under an Accord couldn't give the<br />
guarantee to have the workforce discount the 06T for inflation<br />
certainly a conservative leader could never give such a<br />
guarantee, anyway leave that point to one side. When it was<br />
denied to me I then decided to repair the tax system, coot and<br />
branch on the direct side with things like the fringe benefits<br />
tax, the taxation of capital gains where most tax schemes<br />
relied upon the non taxation of capital gains, Changes to the<br />
tax system in terms of a whole range of concessions. The<br />
abolition of entertainment as a deduction, a whole stack of<br />
things which have now Made the Australian direct tax system<br />
one of the most secure in the world. In the intervening<br />
period we also reduced the site of the public sector<br />
commonwealth spending by about $ 20 billion a year from about<br />
28/ 29% of GDP to 23.<br />
So by the time I finished and that is a couple of years ago we<br />
had A very small public sector, a much smaller level of<br />
spending therefore requiring much loes tax. We had a direct<br />
side tax system which was as tight as Any in the western<br />
world, a tax share to * GDP the second lowest of the 27<br />
countries of the OECD so you ask yourself the question why do<br />
" s need a consumrption tax? The conumption tax's period has<br />
passed and to now take the macro economic risk of pushing<br />
another 6 or 7 percentage points into inflation and then<br />
seeing it go onto wages and then into ongoing inflation and a<br />
6 or 7 percentage point addition to interest rates that will<br />
come with it in now not worth doing.<br />
it's quite wilful, no Liberal leader can give a guarantee that<br />
the price effect of a consumption tax won't go into wages and<br />
into ongoing inflation and interest rate.. And if you can't<br />
give the guarantee it's just vandalism to proceed with it. I<br />
couldn't give the guarantee in the middle 000 and I gave it up<br />
but now we don't need the thing. We have got the second lowest<br />
tax share in CDP in the total economy in the whole of the<br />
OEcD. We have now got a very tight direct side tax system, we<br />
don't need a tax in consumption, we don't need an expenditure<br />
tax and that is the reason why I have opposed it.<br />

GANI4ONs So if there is A Change Of government next<br />
election, in 1996 at the following election what would be yotm<br />
attitude to GS'r?<br />
PM: I am happy to say with today's polls I don't<br />
think there is going to be a change of government and I think<br />
the Australian public understand very clearly that this Means<br />
a very large impost on gill, look the Liberals have got two<br />
very nasty policies. They want to lift tax and cut wages,<br />
they want to lift tax by a consumption tax and they want to<br />
cut wages like Jeff Xennfltt is doing in Victoria with his<br />
single employment contracts. They will drive 8 million<br />
Australians onto single employment contracts which each person<br />
has to then negotiate with themselves without the protections<br />
of awards, without protections as to minimums and I believe<br />
that such a policy prescription will mean that basically the<br />
Coalition is not going to be elected so I am happy to may I<br />
thinkc they are ntot going to arise,<br />

Industries very heavily Indebted, or as they s highly leverailed. It bas<br />
taken About it wonths to 2 yeas' longer than I think ay of as expected to<br />
deleirerass those cmpanies, that's what is happening Io the United States<br />
today, that Is what is happening In Japan today. Bat I am happy to jay In<br />
Australia we ar. reaching the point now whene the balance between equity<br />
and debt ina bose isb ow getting back to a proper balance and we are<br />
starting to see Australian companies look around for opportunities, and as<br />
that happens the growth will Isa" spin. If yOu look at our unemploymnt<br />
rate, roughly halt of it comes brm the down cycle in the economy and half of<br />
it coon. from the strctura change of the churanig of different Industries. It<br />
Is called cydleal and structural unemploymentL If we can pull the first one<br />

Paullament t beard you may tht I WOWl haVe to pay 54000 tax on that<br />
5300,000 under the GST and at present I am told It will be less then $ 15,00.<br />
Isthatgo?<br />
pm, Well what it iseants kthis, that any block of savings. a of the day of the<br />
introduction of the GST, are stomadully diftinished by the price effkct of<br />
the GST because they simpl buy less Ini t eonoray. go there I&amp; a one oft<br />
loss to savings which will never be replenished, that was the point I was<br />
muakinig. Could I just duke thh associated point, there will also be a<br />
continuing Ins" to savings In the desig of Skit GST uander the Liberals. So<br />
tuere is an unavoidable, one off los Wo anyone who is Iblvn off their savings,<br />
someone who Is eaperemuuated as yous are or anyone living from the Income<br />
off a block of savings, those savings ' wM simply buy teso and eamn lae day one<br />

CAlley' Prime Minister I Would Ilk. to sMY tha I Am WerON that would im to po<br />

PM: One Or the t0Ovenslf feacrl In intereut rates is the Underlying rate of<br />
Inflation, so obviously It Inflation were to rise it would have a Imupact upon<br />
Interest ftts, ButI think At this 09tag we are at A stag in the cycle Where<br />
inflation Is down, and I think will stay down, so it is probably the beut lons<br />
run, low interest rat&amp;, low nominal laterest rate horimo we have0 seen for<br />
some time. Rlat I think the beet thing for you to do would be to thy to securt<br />
some 00dium sesm fimRAmee YOU Could4 tak IQs some debt now an a five year<br />
basis taking admapg of the prevalil ioteaeat rates, which will give you<br />
quite ssabstlmtWa Protcto 600a145t somse Iovement Ina Margins over the<br />
Period. Now It may cost youm a ts premium to Pick up A five year fkinal<br />
medWIu tgrm finance package, but you could do it rather than be left to the<br />
vagaries of fletiuug rate debt.<br />
