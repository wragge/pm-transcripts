    <content><![CDATA[<p>This marvellous new centre for Vodafone, an investment of some $12 million by Vodafone, the employment of an extra 300 people here by Vodafone makes Vodafone one of the largest private sector employers in Tasmania.</p>
<p>So, this is a very, very good day. Itâs been made possible by a $4 million Commonwealth grant. I have to say that direct Commonwealth grants to business are rightly rare, but in this particular case, the former government decided that the economic conditions of Tasmania did make this justified and I've got to say, because of the partnership investment by Vodafone that very much seems to have been the case.</p>
<p>Still, the best thing that governments can do is create the conditions for strong private sector business, to get on with the job of doing what they do best and that's exactly what has been happening over the last year or so here in Tasmania, thanks to a Government in Canberra and a Government in Hobart which want our country and this state to be open for business.</p>
<p>Back in September of 2013, Tasmanian unemployment was over eight per cent; today it's close to the national average at 6.5 per cent. Since the Federal election, some 9,000 new jobs have been created in Tasmania; so many indicators here in Tasmania are going in the right direction for the first time in years. Over the last 12 months, tourism numbers are up six per cent to over one million. Building approvals are up 31 per cent in the nine months after the election compared to the nine months before the election and annual retail growth is now the second highest in the nation and thanks to the good work of the Hodgman Government, deficits here in Tasmania have been reduced by $450 million and business confidence is at the highest levels in years.</p>
<p>So, this is what happens when you get government which wants to say yes to business, government which wants to remove impediments, to remove obstacles, to unleash the creativity of people and while I have always enjoyed every second that I spend in Tasmania, while everyone who comes to Tasmania appreciates what a great place it is to visit, what a great place it is to live, Tasmania needs to be a great place to invest and to work as well. Tasmania needs to be a strong economy, as well as a beautiful national park and that's what this Government and Will Hodgman's Government is out to achieve every single day.</p>
<p>Finally let me just again say thank you to Vodafone. Vodafone is a great international business but it's a great international business that for many years now has had a strong base here in Tasmania. Tasmania and Australia welcomes Vodafone and we look forward to a very strong ongoing relationship between our country and Vodafone in the months and years and decades to come.</p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>
