    <content><![CDATA[<p>On 26 December 2004, a magnitude nine earthquake off northern Sumatra triggered one of the worst natural disasters in modern times.</p>
<p>The tsunamis that swept across the Indian Ocean caused massive loss of life and utter devastation.</p>
<p>More than 200,000 people died and over a million were left injured or homeless.</p>
<p>The thoughts and prayers of all Australians were with the people of our region that day, as news of the horrific events flashed around the world.</p>
<p>This 10th anniversary is a time to commemorate the lives that were lost.</p>
<p>This is also an opportunity to pay tribute to all that were involved in the search, rescue and rebuilding efforts.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the tsunamis, Prime Minister John Howard said this catastrophe had brought the world closer together:</p>
<p>â<em>It has been a brutal reminder of the force of nature but also of the inspiring capacity of mankind to ease the suffering of others in their hour of need.</em>â</p>
<p>Ten years on, we remember that the worst of times can bring out the best in people, and that the bonds of friendship between the countries of the Indo-Pacific have never been stronger.</p>
