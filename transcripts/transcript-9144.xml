TEL<br />
I PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY BOMBING REWARD<br />
The Federal Government will contribute $ 250,000 towards a reward being<br />
offered to help bring to justice the culprit or culprits responsible for the tragic<br />
bombing of the NCA office In Adelaide yesterday.<br />
This contribution will be combined with the $ 250,000 reward offered by the<br />
South Australian Government to assist the police investigation.<br />
I appeal to anyone with information which may assist police in their inquiries<br />
to come forward immediately.<br />
The Government will make every effort to ensure whoever perpetrated the<br />
savage and senseless attack is apprehended.<br />
