    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was very sad to learn of the death of Bruce Goodluck.</p>
<p>Bruce gave his life to public service, serving at all three levels of government.</p>
<p>Bruce Goodluck will be remembered for his joviality and sense of humour, most memorably perhaps for taking up a dare to walk into the House of Representatives Chamber dressed as a chicken.</p>
<p>Bruce combined his good humour with a serious and effective advocacy for his community and his state. He was a small business owner and was President of the Australian Automobile Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Cynthia, and his five daughters, his family and many friends.</p>
