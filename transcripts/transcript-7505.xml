TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, OPENING OF PRINTING AND<br />
KINDRED INDUSTRIES UNION, TASMANIAN BRANCH OFFICE, MOONAH-<br />
24 FEBRUARY 1989<br />
E E -PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you think that there should be an<br />
economic impact study done on the Wesley Vale development?<br />
PM: Well, there has been. what we'll do when we come to<br />
consider it after the Tasmanian Parliament has made its<br />
decision is to try on all the evidence available to balance,<br />
as I said last night, try and balance the two sets of<br />
considerations. It's not an easy decision but everyone in<br />
this State can be assured that we will accept our<br />
responsibility very seriously of trying to come to the<br />
decision which is in the best interests of Tasmanians and<br />
Australians. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister the Democrats are calling for a<br />
Senate inquiry into the pulp mill industry, do you think<br />
there is a place for something like that?<br />
PM: Well, no it's not something that's struck me as being<br />
necessary at this stage.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister, do you think the sums actually<br />
add up on especially the balance of payments benefits and<br />
also the tax benefits to the Commonwealth?<br />
PM: I made it clear, that I don't necessarily accept the<br />
figures that have been produced by the joint venturers, and<br />
I don't say that in any attempt to be derogatory about them,<br />
but when you are considering issues like that, it's a fairly<br />
complex set of calculations that have to be made. We'll be<br />
looking at them very closely so that when we do make the<br />
decision we will have what we think are the most precise<br />
sort of projections that you can. So, in making the point I<br />
have I'm not criticising and saying they have tried to<br />
mislead either Tasmania or the Commonwealth. I don't think<br />
they have been about that, but it is a pretty complex set of<br />
calculations. We will do our best to try and get them<br />
right. JOURNALIST: Do you believe that the State Government has in<br />
fact relaxed the guidelines? </p>
<p>PM: There is no doubt they have, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: How do you think Mr Field has handled the issue<br />
so far?<br />
PM: Well.<br />
JOURNALIST: In what way do you think the State Government<br />
has relaxed the guidelines?<br />
PM:. I would think it's just an exercise in logic. If they<br />
haven't relaxed the guidelines, what's it all been about?<br />
JOURNALIST: Senator Richardson this morning said that the<br />
guidelines had been torn up. Would you go as far as to say,<br />
to agree that they've been torn up?<br />
PM: I'm not getting into exercises in semantics about<br />
relaxed, torn up. We will consider the matter without tags<br />
when we, when it comes to us in Cabinet on the<br />
recommendations of the ministers concerned.<br />
JOURNALIST: How do you think that vote will go in Cabinet?<br />
PM: Don't know.<br />
JOURNALIST: How will you be voting in Cabinet?<br />
PM: Oh, you'd be joking wouldn't you?<br />
PROTESTER ( bearing basket of fresh fruit, vegetables and<br />
seafood): basket of produce from the Devonport area.<br />
This is where the mill is actually to be sited, these are<br />
from around about the area there.<br />
PM: I see.<br />
PROTESTER: Our concern is that the quality of this will be<br />
lost to Tasmania if the pulp mill goes ahead<br />
PM: Well I can assure you that the whole range of<br />
considerations that are appropriate to be taken into account<br />
including these sorts of things, we will. It's an important<br />
decision for you, Tasmania and for Australia and all I can<br />
assure you is that we will deal with it with integrity, we<br />
will not be intimidated by anyone in economic terms, that we<br />
will take account of all the sets of arguments and certainly<br />
the environmental concerns, the sorts of things that you<br />
have been talking about, will be well before us. I can't do<br />
any better than that.<br />
PROTESTER: Thank you for your time.<br />
PM: OK, thank you very much. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke will the Federal Government be doing<br />
its own figures on the pulp mill economics?<br />
PM: I just said that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what is your opinion on the<br />
PM: Oh look don't please be silly. Look no Prime Minister,<br />
including this one, says before a Cabinet meeting to you or<br />
anyone else '. this is how I'm going to vote' for the very<br />
simple reason that I have integrity and I'm going to look at<br />
all the evidence and I haven't got it all before me here and<br />
it is, with respect, juvenile in the extreme for you to<br />
imagine that I will say to you before a Cabinet meeting when<br />
I have all the evidence how I'll vote. It really is just<br />
about, if I may say so, the most juvenile question I've ever<br />
heard. JOURNALIST: When will Federal Cabinet make a decision on<br />
the mill?<br />
PM: Well, as I said, when we get the decision of the<br />
Tasmanian Parliament and I've given the undertaking that we<br />
will then deal with it with the utmost expedition. Once<br />
that comes to us, the ministers will put the submission in<br />
and make a recommendation and we'll deal with it. without<br />
being absolutely bound by this, I would imagine that<br />
certainly within a fortnight of receiving the decision, we<br />
should be able to make the decision.<br />
JOURNALIST: North Broken Hill is concerned about losing its<br />
tax concessions if it doesn't get the mill up and going by a<br />
certain time next year, by the middle of next year I think<br />
they've got to have so much work done. Is the Federal<br />
Government willing to extend that if<br />
PM: Well, that's a hypothetical consideration depending on<br />
what our decision is so I'm not addressing that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you've seen the wilderness<br />
Society's banners on the way here<br />
PM: I'm sorry, I haven't seen them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Haven't you? They were all along the road.<br />
PM: Were they?<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you getting sick of being called upon to be<br />
the final arbitrator in all their battles with the State<br />
Government? </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PM: It wouldn't be right to say I'm getting sick of it. I<br />
mean when you become Prime Minister, Leader of the Federal<br />
Government, there are certain responsibilities that go with<br />
the position of leading the national Government and it's no<br />
point in saying you are getting sick of those<br />
responsibilities. I rather enjoy the job.<br />
JOURNALIST: How much weight will you give to the State<br />
Opposition stance<br />
PM: May I just say that what we've got to understand as a<br />
community, and I think it is becoming increasingly<br />
understood, is that there are two legitimate sets of<br />
considerations that have to be taken into account when you<br />
have developmental proposals. I mean we can't, and I don't<br />
think even the most extreme environmentalist would say that<br />
you just ignore every developmental proposal on the basis<br />
that it may in some way or another upset an existing<br />
environmental situation. So you've got to responsibly say,<br />
now what will this mean if it went ahead for present and<br />
future generations. Now that's a legitimate set of criteria<br />
that you have to take into account and against that, present<br />
governments also have a responsibility to future generations<br />
so that you can't allow a development if you are convinced<br />
that to do so would irreparably harm the interests of future<br />
generations. Now what you've got to do without being<br />
intimidated by anyone, either intimidated by the developers<br />
or intimidated by conservationists is, with all due<br />
integrity, to try and make the right decision. And that's<br />
what we'll try to do. And may I say on the record, over six<br />
years, I think we've got a pretty good record. I mean, no<br />
Government in the history of this country has done more on<br />
the environmental side of things than this Government. At<br />
the same time we've also had very high rates of economic<br />
growth so I think we've, generally speaking, got it right.<br />
0 JOURNALIST: How much weight will you give to the Opposition<br />
stance on the mill?<br />
PM: Well that will be one consideration, but not simply<br />
because they have said they are opposed. They will put<br />
arguments to us and no doubt we'll listen to, you know, take<br />
account of the arguments.<br />
JOURNALIST: There's still room for compromise as far as<br />
you're concerned between what the State Government's arrive<br />
at and your final decision?<br />
PM: Well it's not a question of compromise. We'll have to<br />
make a decision about it. I mean, it just can't go on and<br />
on for ever and the time comes when there has got to be a<br />
decision. Now we'll have to deal with the proposal that is<br />
before us out of the Tasmanian Parliament. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Are you surprised that it has gone on for so<br />
long? PM: No, as I say, I've been around for six years now and<br />
these issues seem to have a habit of going on for sometime.<br />
Look at the dam, look at the forests. And it's just part of<br />
nature, one shouldn't be surprised. The issues are<br />
important and it's much better in the end I suppose to have<br />
taken a fair bit of time and tried to listen seriously to<br />
both sides of the argument.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it possible that the Federal Government will<br />
put its own riders on FIRB approval.<br />
PM: Look, I'm just not going to speculate about what we'll<br />
do. It's not fair to anyone. What we'll do is what I've<br />
said we'll do. when we get the decision from the Tasmanian<br />
Parliament, we'll then consider it, we'll take into account<br />
all the evidence and all the arguments that are available.<br />
Now it's no point in asking me questions which are<br />
speculative about what might happen if.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister, do economic factors compel the<br />
State rough time at the Premiers Conference when it<br />
comes up in probably<br />
PM: I don't think that's the right way of putting it. I<br />
think the accurate way of putting it is that we have said,<br />
at Federal level and basically that means myself and Paul,<br />
that there's not a great deal of room left for massive<br />
fiscal cuts because what we have done must be appreciated.<br />
Just get the magnitude of what we've done in the six years<br />
since we've been in Government. We've moved from a public<br />
sector borrowing requirement of some six percent down to<br />
zero, which is a massive achievement. In the area of<br />
Commonwealth public outlays as a proportion of GDP we've<br />
moved that down from 31 1/ 2 percent to about 25 percent<br />
which is an enormous achievement, and gone into surplus.<br />
Now you just can't, and what people have got to understand<br />
including economic commentators and people removed from the<br />
realities of life there is a limit to how far, having done<br />
all those things, that you can go. Now there will be some<br />
room I believe in a housekeeping sense for some things to be<br />
done in the fiscal savings area, you know, the outlay side<br />
of the whole fiscal equation, be some room and we'll<br />
probably require the States to take some share of what we'll<br />
do. But the important thing to understand is we, having<br />
done all that we've done, which is massive and more than has<br />
ever been done before, there's not a whole lot of fat left<br />
there. JOURNALIST: A few years ago you said you thought Tasmania<br />
had suffered enough and you wouldn't impose any more cuts on<br />
it and then last year the Federal Government did cut all the<br />
States. Will Tasmania, along with other States get a cut<br />
this year? </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PM: Well Tasmania is part of Australia isn't it?<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes, but you said Tasmania had suffered enough-<br />
PM: Yes, and we again as I usually do went out of my way to<br />
see that Tasmania didn't suffer an undue share because I<br />
have always understood the special circumstances of Tasmania<br />
and I still do. A number of people down here including the<br />
Premier at times have been good enough to acknowledge that I<br />
have recognised that fact.<br />
