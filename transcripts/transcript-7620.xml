PRIMINEI STE<br />
FOR MEDIA 2 JUNE 1989<br />
I will visit France, the United Kingdom, the United States,<br />
the Federal Republic of Germany and Hungary from 16 June to<br />
3 July.<br />
The visit has been carefully targeted to advance Australia's<br />
political and economic interests. I will, for instance, be<br />
visiting four of the G7 members just a matter of weeks<br />
before their annual Summit and three of the leading members<br />
of the EC in the context of the proposed European Single<br />
Market in 1992. In each of the countries being visited I<br />
will be advancing specific Australian interests in areas<br />
covering multilateral and bilateral trade, the environment,<br />
including matters related to the Antarctic, and disarmament<br />
chemical weapons in particular.<br />
Senior Australian business leaders will be involved in my<br />
visits to Paris, London, Bonn and Budapest. A Trade and<br />
Investment Conference to be held in conjunction with my<br />
visit to London will bring together over 200 senior business<br />
people to strengthen and expand commercial ties between<br />
Australia and the United Kingdom.<br />
The visit to France will allow me to renew contact with<br />
President Mitterrand and to establish closer dialogue with<br />
the Rocard Government. I will visit the Australian<br />
exhibition at the Paris Air Show and the village of<br />
Villers-Bretonneux in north-west France, where thousands of<br />
Australian soldiers died during World War I. I will also<br />
take part in matters relating to Australia's contribution to<br />
the celebration of the Bicentenary of the French Revolution.<br />
My visit to the United Kingdom will return Mrs Thatcher's<br />
visit to Australia last year. Our wide ranging discussions<br />
will encompass East/ West relations and the forthcoming<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kuala Lumpur.<br />
At Mrs Thatcher's suggestion, I will be accompanied by<br />
Senator Button, Senator Evans and Mr Beazley, who will<br />
participate in elements of my program. Senator Button will<br />
co-chair the Trade and Investment Conference and Senator<br />
Evans will address it.<br />
While in the United Kingdom I will have discussions with<br />
Her majesty, The Queen.<br />
I have been invited to Washington by President Bush for an<br />
official visit. In addition to extensive discussions with<br />
President Bush himself, I will be meeting with senior<br />
members of his Administration and Congressional leaders. An<br />
extensive agenda of issues will cover bilateral, regional<br />
and global, political and economic developments. </p>
<p>My visit to the Federal Republic of Germany will be my first<br />
as Prime Minister. The FRG does, of course, have a key role<br />
in East/ West relations, in international economic matters<br />
and in the establishment of the Single European Market in<br />
1992. I am looking forward to discussing these and other<br />
significant issues with Chancellor Kohl, who visited<br />
Australia last year.<br />
My visit to Hungary comes at an important time of political<br />
and economic reform in that country. Those reforms open up<br />
the prospect of further significant changes in East/ West<br />
relations. I look forward to discussing with Prime Minister<br />
Nemeth these and other issues related to a strengthening of<br />
the bilateral relationship.<br />
