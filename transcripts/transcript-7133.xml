PRIME~ MINISTR<br />
CHECK AGAINST DE3LIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
" OUR FOURTH ANNIVERSARY"<br />
BATHURST 8 MARCH 1987<br />
Fellow members and supporters of the Australian Labor Party,<br />
Cabinet and Parliamentary colleagues, Friends:<br />
Last Thursday we passed an historic milestone in the great<br />
march of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Labor<br />
Movement the fourth anniversary of our government's<br />
election on 5 march, 1983.<br />
For four years now this Government has proudly represented<br />
the par! ty, served the people, and built the nation.<br />
We have shared those tasks with Labor Governments in four<br />
Australian States.<br />
Never L-efore in the long history of our party spanning<br />
nearly a century have so many voters in so many parts of<br />
the country elected and re-elected so many Labor Governments<br />
to office.<br />
So it is fitting that we should take a brief moment to<br />
celebrate these historic achievements.<br />
And especially, I want to pay my tribute to the thousands<br />
upon thousands of our fellow Australians, the Labor men and<br />
women, w'. ose work and support, whose faith and loyalty and<br />
firmness of purpose have made it all possible.<br />
And it is absolutely fitting that we should do so, here in.<br />
Bathurst the place forever associated with the name of<br />
Chifley and with all he stood for and fought for, all he<br />
represented for Australia.<br />
We are celebrating not just the victory of a party.<br />
We are celebrating a victory for the people of Australia.<br />
we are celebrating the successful fight we waged for the<br />
very heart and soul of this nation, four years ago. </p>
<p>2.<br />
But the note I wish to sound tonight is not one of<br />
self-congratulation, and certainly not one Of com~ placency.<br />
Rather, it is a note of urgency a deep sense of the urgent<br />
demando the future of Australia makes upon us, as a party,<br />
as a mcvement, a government, a nation.<br />
Four years ago we brought to office a determination to buildi<br />
reforms that would endure, create growth that could be<br />
sustain~ ed, promote genuine equality of opportunity.<br />
And I believe we have been, and are being, successful in<br />
fulfilling those promises.<br />
By any standards, those four years have been difficult ones<br />
for a Fceral Government and we have never disguised those<br />
difficulties from the Australian people.<br />
The legjacy bequeathed to the nation by Malcolm Fraser and<br />
his Treasurer John Howard was scarcely a rich one.<br />
They bequeathed an almost tangible pall * of gloom over the<br />
country, a gloom created by lengthening dole queues,<br />
continuing business failures, racking confrontations in our<br />
work places, economic mismanagement, double digit inflation<br />
in sum, the worst recession this nation had endured in<br />
years. our first task was to reverse that recession. This we did.<br />
we restored growth and revived employment throughout the<br />
nation. But we then had to face a new and even greater crisis. A<br />
sudden collapse in commodity prices meant that our<br />
tradition~ al primary exports our wool, our wheat, our meat,<br />
our dairy products, our sugar, our minerals were no longer<br />
bringing the prices on which we had confidently relied in<br />
the past.<br />
The fact * is, that collapse slashed $ 6 billion off our<br />
nationa~ l income the equivalent of $ 1500 for every<br />
Australian family.<br />
our livin~ g standards have been pushed down.<br />
only by restructuring the economy, by creating a more<br />
competitive and productive attitude within the Australian<br />
community, can we restore our nation to the prosperity we<br />
seek for ourselves and our children.<br />
That means breaking our cycle of dependence on those<br />
agricu-. tural and mineral commodities whose prices have<br />
fallen so sharply; reorienting our economy to look outwards;<br />
exporting; competing; paying our way.<br />
This is the only sure way towards lower unemployment and<br />
higher living standards. </p>
<p>That hard fact sets the stage for the Government of<br />
Australia for the remainder of the 1980s and beyond.<br />
So this government has initiated the most sweeping reform of<br />
Australi., s economy in the history of our nation.<br />
in the L1ezms of the pledge we made to the people four years<br />
ago, we have effected national reconciliation. We have<br />
generatoc6 national recovery. We are now achieving national<br />
reconstruction.<br />
And we are doing it within the context of the great Labor<br />
tradition the application of Labor principles and Labor<br />
aspirations to the demands of present challenges.<br />
It has been our task, and our achievement, to undertake the<br />
task of reconstruction while also protecting the essential<br />
welfare of the disadvantaged, the battlers, and the ordinary<br />
men and viomen of Australia.<br />
Let tha. z., he no doubt about the contrast. This Government<br />
has sta-ted the long task of reconstruction and has<br />
distributed the burden of hardship fairly and<br />
compassionately. The opposition parties, with their<br />
spurioui ; and reckless promises, have made it clear they not<br />
only can.-iut provide the answers but cannot even comprehend<br />
the prow ) em<br />
So don't . et us have any of this nonsense that we are not a<br />
real LabDor Government.<br />
Don't jucw. e me or my government by whether we have blindly<br />
adhered to the standards of the past or uncritically<br />
observed the shibboleths of the past.<br />
Judge u by our ability to take our inherited principles and<br />
breathe nsew life into them, applying them anew to the task<br />
we face today.<br />
Let me show you in detail how we have done that.<br />
Through the Accord, the industrial and political elements of<br />
the Labo: movement have forged anew their traditional links<br />
not just to protect the interests of working people but to<br />
advance the task of cooperatively building a better future<br />
for Australia.<br />
The rewi-rd has been clear: we have created three quarters<br />
of a mil. lion new jobs in our first four years the highest<br />
rate of crployment growth in Australia's history and we<br />
have halved the number of industrial disputes.<br />
Like previous Labor governments, it has been our achievement<br />
to fulfil to the maximum extent we could, our historic<br />
responsibilities to the underprivileged.<br />
We have wcrked to help the poor, protect the battler, and<br />
ensure that the elderly and people with disabilities and the<br />
sick are well cared for. </p>
<p>We have . iade the taxation system faitrr and more efficient<br />
than it eve-r was under the Fraser-Howprd years.<br />
income tEax rates have fallen and will fall further. Rorts<br />
open to t. Ac privileged few the free lunches, the company<br />
cars and the tax-free capital gains have been closed off.<br />
Young people are staying at school longer, learning the<br />
skills they need to play their role in the workplace of the<br />
future. Whlen we came to office, only 36% of school kids<br />
stayed on to year 12 by the end of this year more than<br />
will. Health care is now available to nearly two million<br />
AustralianG who were previously without insurance, thanks to<br />
our restoration and improvement of Medicare.<br />
In addition to our range of existing rural programs, we are<br />
providin( I $ 150 million in assistance to farmers, who though<br />
they are the most efficient in the world, have been hit<br />
especially hard by the collapse in our commodity prices. In<br />
every appropriate international forum we are pushing for an<br />
end to the insanities of American and European protectionism<br />
which are squeezing us in our traditional markets.<br />
We have spent more on public housing than any other<br />
Government a 42 per cent real increase.<br />
We have introduced sex discrimination legislation and<br />
affirmative action legislation which for the first time<br />
guarantee a fair go for women in the workforce.<br />
we have provided more child care places than any other<br />
Government since Federation. By June next year we will be<br />
funding 106,000 of them, compared with just 46,000 when we<br />
came to office.<br />
We have established new levels of care for the vast majority<br />
of aged people who wish to stay in their homes rather than<br />
entering an institution.<br />
we have stopped millionaires from getting the pension. We<br />
have lifted the pension by more than 6 per cent in real<br />
terms; the conservatives managed a meagre 1 1/ 2 per cent<br />
increase over their entire seven years in office.<br />
We have acted decisively to protect the environment. we<br />
stopped the Franklin Dam. We are protecting environmentally<br />
valuable forests in Tasmania while exploring alternatives to<br />
logging them. We are legislating against mining in the<br />
existing frakadu national park. We have nominated Stage 2 of<br />
the Park for the World Heritage List and are adding large<br />
areas to the Park.<br />
We have restored a proper sense of independence and<br />
self-respect to the conduct of Australia's foreign policy. </p>
<p>Without seeking to exaggerate the importance of our<br />
influence, we have sought where we can to ease tension,<br />
encourage dialogue, promote disarmament, discourage<br />
violence. We have involved ourselves constructively in the great<br />
issues confronting the world and our region.<br />
We havi do-voted unprecedented effort to the practical<br />
pursuit o. l peace and disarmament, both in our dealing with<br />
the superpowers, and in our own region, where we took the<br />
lead in creating the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty.<br />
Australia nias become one of the first independent sovereign<br />
countries in the world to make a commitment by national<br />
legislation never to acquire nuclear weapons.<br />
We have taken the lead in the Commonwealth to fight for<br />
democracy and justice in South Africa against the evil of<br />
aparthei6.<br />
We stand vith our South Pacific neighbours in favour of<br />
decolonisation in New Caledonia.<br />
in recoun~ ting this record of achievement, I do not seek to<br />
deny therse have been hardships along the way.<br />
Because ol' the acute economic problems we are going through,<br />
some peop&gt; a have had to do with less than they might have<br />
expected. Aged pensioners have taken a delay in the<br />
increase ol? their pensions; home buyers have had to endure<br />
high inter2Gt rates; some groups legitimately seeking<br />
government assistance have been given a ' no' or at least a<br />
' not yet'.<br />
But this has to be understood clearly: without wage<br />
restraint, without a smaller budget deficit, without<br />
temporarily higher interest rates, we could not have made<br />
the progress we have-in reforming the Australian economy,<br />
making it more resilient, and putting us back on the road to<br />
prosperity. The need to make further spending cuts in a May Statement<br />
demonstrates that we remain committed to achieving a still<br />
lower deficit.<br />
And let me make a further comment about interest rates.<br />
No politician in his right mind wants interest rates a point<br />
of a per cent higjher than absolutely necessary because<br />
high interest rates do cause difficulties for farmers, small<br />
business~' en, home buyers the whole community.<br />
But, at present, interest rates have to be held at their<br />
current level to support the dollar. They cannot be lowered<br />
without the certainty of losing the exchange rate,<br />
dramatically higher interest rates and higher inflation. I<br />
assure you interest rates will begin to come down the moment<br />
economic circumstances permit. No sane government could<br />
have any other objective. </p>
<p>The simple fact is this: the sacrifices the community has<br />
borne during these difficult economic times would have been<br />
more onerous, indeed they would have crippled the long term<br />
health of the nation, had our opponents been in charge.<br />
Nor would they have endeavoured to share with fairness the<br />
burdens of restraint, as we have ensured they are shared.<br />
They claim to stand for the Australian family.<br />
But in 18 out of the last 20 National wage Cases they have<br />
urged a wage freeze.<br />
How can they protect the family with a policy of pure and<br />
simple wage freeze? How can they protect the family by<br />
totally lifting the lid on prices with the abolition of the<br />
Prices Su : veillance Authority?<br />
How is the-welfare of the family advanced by their<br />
commitment to renew for the exclusive use of the privileged<br />
few all the tax lurks and perks which we have eliminated?<br />
And the real consequences of their tax proposals could only<br />
devastate the families of Australia.<br />
If the conservatives again dismantled Medicare, they would<br />
set the average Australian fanily back some $ 15 a week.<br />
So their promise to help Australian families is empty. They<br />
pretend to offer huge tax cuts, but those supposed cuts are<br />
so spurious, they could only be paid for by bigger deficits<br />
or drastic cuts in Government services.<br />
As for the National Party, whether, I stress, led by Ian<br />
Sinclair or Joh Bjelke-Petersen, what does it stand for?<br />
Environmental vandalism. Cronyism. Perversion of one vote<br />
one value elections. Racism at home. Friendship with the<br />
racists in South Africa. Free enterprise rhetoric cloaking<br />
massive intervention on behalf of greedy vested interests.<br />
Now, my friends, I suppose we are entitled, as Labor men and<br />
women, to take a passing pleasure in the disarray of our<br />
political opponents in the way they have unleashed upon<br />
themselves the forces of division they want to unleash upon<br />
Australia. But looking deeper, we must take urgent warning from this<br />
spectacle, as Australians, passionately concerned about the<br />
future of Australia.<br />
For there is more to this than their squalid brawling.<br />
What is ha~ pening on the other side of politics today is an<br />
attempt to revive the kind of Australian politics the people<br />
of Australia rejected so decisively four years ago. </p>
<p>7.<br />
In our election campaign in 1983, we asked the people of<br />
Australia to set their face against the politics of division<br />
and of confrontation.<br />
They did so then, and equally clearly, they did so again in<br />
1984. Yet what the conservatives now propose for Australia is<br />
precisely a return to divisiveness and confrontation the<br />
setting of Australian against Australian.<br />
The factions which make up the non-Labor forces want to tear<br />
Australia a-, art, hoping in the process to pick up some of<br />
the pieces, from the wreckage to satisfy their pe-rsonal<br />
ambition or their collective and individual greed.<br />
And the strategy behind it all is very clear: to use the<br />
individual and sectional discontents inseparable from times<br />
as complex and difficult as these, to exploit the anxieties<br />
of the groups which make up the fabric of this society, and<br />
to stitch together a temporary coalition of fear and greed.<br />
But I deeply believe the whole strategy is based on a<br />
gigantic :-iiicalculation.<br />
It is one 4-ing to hi-jack the National Party -and they<br />
have done that.<br />
it is one thing to hi-jack the Liberal Party -and they are<br />
more than half way to doing that.<br />
It is one thing to hi-jack the coalition and they have<br />
certainly done that.<br />
But nobody however rich and powerful their hidden backers<br />
can hi-jack Australia.<br />
Because Australia has an unbeatable weapon against what<br />
Howard himself has called " this political terrorism"<br />
It is the greatest weapon of all, in defence of democracy,<br />
in defence of stability, in defence of sanity, in defence of<br />
all the freadoms and decencies of the Australian way of<br />
life. It is the matchless weapon of the commonsense, the<br />
intelligenca and maturity of the Australian people.<br />
And I will back this commonsense against all the armoury of<br />
deceit and irrationality, that could ever be brought to bear<br />
against us.<br />
So much for the Liberal-National coalition. Not liberal,<br />
never national, and no longer a coalition.<br />
Contrast all that with the great Australian Labor Party. </p>
<p>8.<br />
Where th(! y are desperately divided we are in fundamintal<br />
unity ibove all, united on the correct course for<br />
Australiii In the years ahead.<br />
Where thoy squabble over who should lead them and what<br />
directiou they should travel, we provide a strong, united,<br />
competen'-. znd decisive team.<br />
Where they are in barren opposition we shoulder the broad<br />
national responsibilities of government.<br />
They stane for the deliberate creation of conflict. We<br />
stand fo:-the resolution of conflict.<br />
They opt for the short cut. We run the whole race.<br />
As the el~ ection draws closer, one thing will emerge with<br />
stark claL-ity for the overwhelming majority of the<br />
Australii. n people, day by day.<br />
And it iG the most basic fact of Parliamentary democracy<br />
itself simply, that the purpose of an election is to elect<br />
a Governnernt that can govern.<br />
But to makco that choice properly, the people have to know<br />
exactly ' zhat the competing policies are and exactly who will<br />
implement them after the election.<br />
And whatover may emerge from all this turmoil, only one<br />
thing is certain.<br />
This Opposition, in whatever form it emerges, whatever<br />
combinat:. ori of incompetencies is stitched together, will be<br />
totally '. ncapable of offering the people a government.<br />
Because, La~ dies and gentlemen, a government is not just a<br />
gaggle oZ snake oil merchants, three or four of whom think<br />
it's about time they had a go at being Prime Minister.<br />
It involves the highest responsibilities that Australian men<br />
and women can ever seek to undertake.<br />
It demand-s discipline and a profound sense of responsibility<br />
for the ael~ fare of all sections of the Australian community.<br />
It demands clear, coherent and consistent policies. it<br />
demands A high degree of party unity. And it demands at the<br />
very least, a moderate degree of mutual goodwill and common<br />
purpose amnong colleagues.<br />
But not one of tfrese minimum requirements for government in<br />
Australia can ever be met by this Opposition.<br />
So ladies and gentlemen,<br />
As we mark our Government's Fourth Anniversary, we are<br />
entitled to take pride in our achievement. </p>
<p>7-9.<br />
We offer stability, we offer unity, we offer competence, we<br />
offer co-operation, we offer leadership.<br />
In these times of enormous challenge we offer a strategy for,<br />
the futuic~ and we offer a vision for the future.<br />
There are four elements to that strategy.<br />
The first of these is the continued effort to restructure<br />
our econom-y to make it world-competitive and<br />
outwa rd-look ing.<br />
Certainly, the great agricultural and mining industries<br />
which unkrpinned our prosperity in the past will remain as<br />
engines of growth. But, they must be supplemented by new<br />
exports. We must learn to develop a more competitive<br />
attitude towards production. We must find new markets. We<br />
must learn to pay our way again.<br />
We are only part way along what will be a long road back to<br />
prosperity. As we approach the 1990s we must ensure that<br />
the start we have made along this road is-not wasted by an<br />
opposition whose inability and irrelevance is so clearly<br />
demonstrated both at the level of leadership and in the<br />
generation of realistic policies.<br />
Second, given the decline in our national income, we will<br />
continue to ensure that where sacrifices are necessary,<br />
their burden will be shared with fairness and where gains<br />
can be made, their benefits will be passed on, with<br />
fairness, to the whole community.<br />
Where the false prophets of the conservative parties offer<br />
Australian workers the immediate prospect of a wage freeze,<br />
we will make an explicit promise.<br />
Under this Government there will be no wage freeze.<br />
under this government, workers will continue to receive wage<br />
increases as large and as prompt as Australia's economic<br />
circumstances can afford.<br />
And where the conservatives offer the reversion to an unfair<br />
taxation system, where taxes will rise for virtually every<br />
item you buy, we will guarantee a continuation of fairness<br />
and efficiency in taxation.<br />
The third element of our strategy for the rest of the 1980s<br />
is to continue to manage the economy and the nation with<br />
strength and stability.<br />
And the keystone of that task is our capacity to maintain<br />
co-operation with business and unions, to work within the<br />
estabished framework of our conciliation and arbitration<br />
system, to provide leadership for the whole nation. </p>
<p>The fourth element of our strategy is to continue to ensure<br />
that todiay's policies not only achieve goals for today but<br />
are so geared as to protect the interests Of our children<br />
and of our children's children.<br />
This is why we must restructure our economy; it is why we<br />
must protect the environment for the future.<br />
it underlies why we must continue to encourage school<br />
children stay at school so they can productively<br />
contribute to society in a satisfying job; and it underlies<br />
why we must ensure that adeq~ uate technical training exists<br />
for those young people who need it; and it underlies our<br />
commitment to ensuring the talent and potential of young<br />
people is not destroyed by drugs.<br />
Perhaps most fundamentally of all, it underlies the need to<br />
secure pea. ce and effective disarmament in the world<br />
without which all our hopes and plans can founder.<br />
Friends, These aze our aspirations: reconstruction of the economy,<br />
fairness in the protection of living standards, stability in<br />
leadership, and care for the future of our nation.<br />
They are the elements of a ntrategy which will guide<br />
Australia's economic and social growth in the lead up to the<br />
election and, after we have been re-elected, into the<br />
1990' s.<br />
So we go together into our fifth year with renewed<br />
confidence confidence in our ability to lead Australia<br />
through tV-hese times of high challenge to an even better and<br />
fairer future.<br />
And the real basis of that confidence is our confidence in<br />
the people of Australia.<br />
I am ab,, solutely confident about the judgement the Australian<br />
people make, for they will have an absolutely stark<br />
choice bcfore them: the firmness and fairness, stability<br />
and security we offer, or the conflict and bitterness, the<br />
weakness and instability offered by this shambles of an<br />
opposition increasingly dictated to and directed by the<br />
faceless men of greed.<br />
Their old ramshackle coalition is dead.<br />
Their parties are hopelessly split in at least five ways<br />
that is, on the last count, anyway.<br />
But let us not be diverted by their disarray.<br />
This government will not be diverted nor will we relax in<br />
our endeavours to provide the solutions to our nation's<br />
problems. </p>
<p>11.<br />
That will be the real basis for our victory at the next<br />
elections, whenever they may have to come.<br />
The question before the people of Australia will be clear.<br />
It is the essential question of our Australian denocracy.<br />
It is indeed the essence of our democracy.<br />
It is this: which side of politics has the proven capacity<br />
to make and take the best decisiops for our country and our<br />
future? My friends, 4. n this election year can there be any doubt<br />
what answei: the people of Australia will give?<br />
Fellow members of the Australian Labor Party, colleagues,<br />
friends:<br />
Ben Chifleyo " light on the hill" still beckons us.<br />
As far zo thiis Labor Goverment iq concerned, that light on<br />
the hill it; otill our goal.<br />
That light is what we march towards today proud of our<br />
record, confident of our future, and determined to write<br />
another grea. t chapter in the grand partnership botween the<br />
Australian L bor Party and the Australian people.<br />
