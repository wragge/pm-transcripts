TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THlE HON P J KEATILNG MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH MURRAY NICHOL" 5AN, 27 AUGUST 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
MN: you're firing on the Opposition on this, you're saying that it's an irresponsible<br />
attitude to the industry.<br />
PM: They're basically saying we don't care whether we have a car industry. if<br />
Australian car needs nccd to be satisfied exclusively by imports, that will do us.<br />
Whcn Mr McLachlan was asked in today's Australian in a question and answer<br />
session, hc said it's a matter for them to decide what changes they will necd to<br />
make to exist. Now the fact is, that a zero tariff, given the fact that there's a glut of<br />
motor carm In the Northern hemisphere, the big companics will just ship them into<br />
Australia at marginal costs and thc Australian motor industry just won't exist, it<br />
will just simply go out of business. These characters, that is Dr l-cwson and Mr<br />
McLachlan, mean it. I mean they're not just mouthing cmpty rhetoric here. This<br />
fellow McLachlan, who is a representative of South Australia, is rcally basically<br />
saying that he and Dr Hcwson would wipe out the base manufacturing industry of<br />
the State of South Australia.<br />
MN: Is it that serious, can it happen?<br />
PM: Too right.<br />
MN: That simply wouldn't wipe it out, surely?<br />
PM: Yes it would. Look, Toyoia is going to build a state of the art plant in Victoria, a<br />
mioderm Japanese state of the art plant. Now when we made the judgements about<br />
that, John Button, myself and others made the judgenment that a 15 per cent tariff<br />
was as far as we could push tariff protection down and still keep a motor industry<br />
notwithstanding the efficiency of that particular plant, and the renewed efficiency<br />
of General Motors and Ford. What they're saying is It's zero. And a zero in a<br />
small country like this, patrticularly with a glut of cars around the Northern<br />
hemisphere, just marginally costing them, that is the marginal cost of production </p>
<p>just shipping into Australia, there's no way the Australian motor vehicle Industry<br />
would survive it.<br />
MN: But from 15 per ccnt down to zero is really not much of ajump when you look at<br />
how big the tariffs wcrc before.<br />
PM: We're giving them a chance to adjust. For instane, I'm not quite sure of the<br />
Commodore price but the Ford Falcon which now sells for $ 23,000 for a basic car,<br />
under today's protection of 35 per cent, would have been $ 33,000 without the tariff<br />
changes. We've introduced a regimc of change along with export facilitation<br />
where the motor vehicle industry has now adjusted to lower levels of protection by<br />
selling, in the case of H-olden, world class competitive engines to Germany; In the<br />
case of Ford, Capris, sports cars to the United4 States; and soon Vcrada wagons are<br />
to follow. Ford today announced, in the same newspaper, 280,000 cylinder blocks<br />
going to Japan and 70,000 engines. All of this has conmc from our policy mix, and<br />
we'd made the judgement of 15 per cent, and the car industry made the judgement<br />
that at 15 they can stay in. Zero is just going to knock themn out of the ring. All of<br />
this is sort of naive and primitive views about primitive capitalism. This Is Dr<br />
Hewson's view he has attacked Mr Prescott from BIIP, Jac Nasser from Ford, he<br />
has attacked Bob Johnston from Toyota. He is basically saying big business are<br />
fat bureaucracies, if you haven't come up the hard way and you're not a self made<br />
person and worked your way through a merchant bank, basically you should be<br />
left to the vagaries of the market. It's that sort of thoughtless ideology which I<br />
think we can do without.<br />
MN: The State Opposition says that our vehicle manufacturing industry is slack and<br />
inefficient and has not, in fact, fulfilled the requirements of what you laid on it.<br />
PM: Look, Dr Hcwson advised the Fraser Government as its principal in-house adviser<br />
for 7 years, and in those years tariff protection went up, quotas stayed for motor<br />
vehicles, the motor vehicle price wcnt up, we were not selling any more cars, and<br />
Australians were doing very poorly from it. We're the people who have had to do<br />
the hard task of introducing the changes, but we've done it with some<br />
comprehension. We've given them export facilitation which means they can go<br />
and export things with support, which would disappear under a zero tariff. We've<br />
done the things which will actually change thc industry for the better and of<br />
course, the revolution in industrial relations, in enterprise bargaining, and the<br />
improvements in productivity and efficiency of motor plants, and the willinigness<br />
of the car unions, and the employces of the car industry to sit down with their<br />
managements and make these companies better, Dr Hcwson says give all that<br />
away there'll be no national wage case for them, awards go, annual leave<br />
entitlements go, sick pay goes, we're getting out of the award system, you now<br />
make an arrangement person to person with your employer. So all of that good<br />
will goes out of the door and at the same time we're going to drop a zero tariff on<br />
you. You see, I think a lot of Australians thought look, this is him banging his<br />
gums. The truth is he means it. </p>

MN: Of course, realistically it's always been said that our market is so small that we<br />
have onc too many manufacturers anyway.<br />
PM: Well one has disappeared recently, Nissan. Thiat's the point. I mean the policy in<br />
this sense has worked in the sense that we're now Setting down to a smaller<br />
number of viable units. But remember this, Murray, this is a small market, it<br />
produces around about 400-500 thousand vehicles a year. There's always going to<br />
be some diseconomies of that sort of scale. And the notion that it's almost<br />
experimental sort of capitalism, this sort of view that you don't take any notice of<br />
the biggest company, BHP, you just say they're asking for handouts. You don't<br />
take any notice of General Motors, or Ford, you say they're asking for handouts. In<br />
other words, you don't even try to comprehend the changes the Government has<br />
introduced with them, sensible changes, to produce a decent motor vehicle<br />
industry which will underpin thc manufacturing base of say citics like Adelaide.<br />
They'rc just simply saying look, frankly it's zero, and if it's imports it's imports, if<br />
you can survive good on you, don't expect any help from us.<br />
MN: A recent examination of our motor vehicle industry by a UK expert, acknowledged<br />
as an expert by thc motor industry, in fact he was brought out by the motor<br />
industry or parts of it, said that our motor industry Is very out of date and behind<br />
the times as far as processes and procedures go. Not necessarily industrial<br />
relations, I don't think he was looking at that, but the plants themselves he said<br />
were very out of date and a long way behind the hotshots.<br />
PM: Well, for a start there's going to be a new state of thc art plant with Toyota. But I<br />
had the pleasure earlier this year of flying down to Adelaide and going out to<br />
General Motors and opening the new paint plant $ 230 million I think, for a state<br />
of the art, world ranking paint shop. Now that sort of Investment Is going In, and<br />
the quality of the cars has I think improved enormously. So, the companies<br />
operating in Australia are getting it together. But We started this change In the mid<br />
1980s. We firstly abolished quotas and started to move to tariffs, and then move<br />
the tariffs down, with notice, with assurance, with support, down to a 15 per cent<br />
end point whcre they can survive, where Australians gct dcent cars at a decent<br />
price. Not good enough for our opponents. Our opponents say, not ideologically<br />
pure here, this is not the way to go. The way to go is to basically slam them, cold<br />
turkey them.<br />
MN: Have you had a chance to cast your eye over our State Budget today?<br />
PM: I haven't seen it, no, I don't know any of the details.<br />
MN; Probably a lucky man. We're in serious trouble down in this State, I know you're<br />
aware of that. How do you regard us as far as propping up the Federal<br />
Govermcent in our coming State election?<br />
ILL </p>

PM: Well look, in the ' 50s and ' 60s South Australia sold itself as having comparative<br />
advantage by having cheaper labour rates than the rest of Australia. That brought<br />
industry to South Australia. As labour rates and wage rates evened up around the<br />
Commonwealth with federal awards and national wage fixation, that comparative<br />
advantage disappeared. And what John Bannon has sought to do is to try to reestablish,<br />
if you like, the efficiency of South Australian industry on a competitive<br />
nmodel basis. And that's why whether It be the car Industry In our cooperative<br />
discussions, or it is in the ship building area In the contracts which were lct to<br />
South Australia, or in the Onc Nation package where I announced the building of a<br />
standard gauge railway between Melbourne and Adelaide, all of that Is to basically<br />
bring South Australia into nearer, effectively nearer and more Integrated into the<br />
higher population, bigger market centres of Australia and keeping it a relevant<br />
place. And that's what I think a comprehending Government has to do. But to<br />
take some sort of ideological view, you know to go back to some text book is of<br />
course not only nonsense, but a great shanic.<br />
MN: It just seems that we're digging our way further Into the dirt. We've now got a<br />
State debt of $ 7.3 billion and that's gigantic. And I'm quite sure South Australians<br />
are infectcd with a sense of desperation here and helplessncss, because we just<br />
can't see anything coming right. We can't see It coming right state-wise, we can't<br />
see anything coming right federally.<br />
PM: Let me just deal with federal first. We're going through the 1990s with low<br />
inflation for the first time in 20 years; low interest rates; basically a structural<br />
budget surplus, once the rcession passes through and the economy starts to pick<br />
up ag ain the budgets will whirr back into surplus in the ' 90s; we've got a<br />
revolution in wage fixation and enterpris bargaining and higher productivity;<br />
we've got a remodelled tax system, a 39 per cent corporate rate, full dividend<br />
imputation; we've got a superannuation savings system which is going to pump<br />
national savings into equities into Australian companics, we won't be out in the<br />
rest of the world bidding for savings, we'll have our own in adequate measure. I<br />
mean, Australia is going to be In a very good position in the 1990s. There's been a<br />
great change in productivity. I was in Melbourne on Monday presenting the Best<br />
Practice Awards for a great variety of companies, a couple of them South<br />
Australian, Solar was down there for instance, but there was BHP, Toyota and I<br />
think General Motors, and some of the other car companies et cetera. And what's<br />
happening is a revolution in the way in which efficiency and productivity is<br />
happening in Australia. And at each table from each company were the employees<br />
of the business, the union representatives sitting there. And people were saying to<br />
me, look this is one of the best programs to get an International bench mark for our<br />
business, and to get awards on the basis of reaching those benchmarks to give us<br />
international efficiencies in a sensible, humane way Is the way to travel. Now, all<br />
of that is happening, and it's happening for South Australian companies. See we<br />
had great growth in the ' 80s. The Australian labour market today is 26 per cent<br />
bigger than it was in 1983. In 1983 there were 6 million people in the workforce,<br />
there's 7.6 million today. In New Zealand, for instance, which we hear a lot about, </p>
<p>we've got fewer people in work today than there was in 1983. Now we've kept<br />
most of that employment. All we've got to do is get that efficiency into place and<br />
build those volumes, manufacturing and production volumes, and the employment<br />
will come our way. So there's no reason to be looking gloomy about Australia<br />
when we're now out of the recession and we're growing. Now as far as South<br />
Australia goes, I think thc Bannon Government pursued a very sensible policy of<br />
trying to find a solid, long term basis for South Australian industry, which by and<br />
large it has achieved.<br />
M N: Yes, well it didn't count on the performance or lack of by the State Bank. To you<br />
now, and reports coming out of Canberra saying that you're in a quiet desperation<br />
mode. is it like that?<br />
PM: Well, do I sound like that?<br />
MIN: No, you never sound like that.<br />
PM: No I don't. Of course not, of course not, You know, there's always a bit of navel<br />
gazing here along the press gallery corridor, people writing columns for the<br />
weekend. But look, on the big brush things we're forcasuing growth in the<br />
Australian economy the same as our trading partners through this financial year.<br />
We just clocked up 1.6 for the last financial year, so we're out of the recession and<br />
we're growing. We've got all the One Nation expenditures now coming through.<br />
We've just Ict a contract for 3 thousand tonnes of rail steel. A lot of that will go to<br />
Whyalla, BHP in Whyalla, to build that Adelaide to Melbourne railway line and<br />
other railway lines. We've just let a contract for a million concrete sleepers. We<br />
just announced a $ 2 billion road program for the year, $ 400 million larger as a<br />
result of the One Nation package. All of this expenditure and the new spending in<br />
the Budget is now coming at the time for thc economy to kick growth, activity and<br />
employment along. So, from the Government's point of view we're putting the<br />
blocks into place, the building blocks of a stronger economy Into place, and the<br />
Budget just did that in fine style.<br />
MN: Thanks for talking with us this afternoon.<br />
PM: Good Murray, thanks again.<br />
