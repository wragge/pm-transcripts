    <content><![CDATA[<p>Many of you are concerned about the threat of extremism.</p>
<p>Here in Australia weâre a peaceful democracy.</p>
<p>As Australians, weâre rightly reluctant to reach out to conflicts thousands of miles away but sadly these conflicts sometimes reach out to us.</p>
<p>In these uncertain times,Â I have three messages for the Australian people:</p>
<p>First, your government will do everything possible to keep you safe.</p>
<p>Second, our security measures at home and abroad are directed against terrorism, not religion.</p>
<p>And third, as Australians we should always live normally because terroristsâ goal is to scare us out of being ourselves.</p>
<p>The Government has a plan to keep Australia safe.</p>
<p>Weâve committed $630 million more to our police, intelligence and security services.</p>
<p>There are now stronger measures at international airports, and many public buildings, to deter extremists.</p>
<p>And the Parliament has passed further measures to strengthen our counter-terrorism capability â with more legislation coming.</p>
<p>Our job is not just to deal with the symptoms of extremism, we must also deal with its origin.</p>
<p>In this case, it is the extremism of the ISIL movement in Iraq and Syria.</p>
<p>The beheadings, the crucifixions, mass executions, ethnic cleansing and sexual slavery that are occurring in northern Iraq and Syria, are only the beginning if ISIL has its way.</p>
<p>So Australia is supporting international operations against ISIL.Â Itâs a decision the Government has made in Australiaâs national interest.</p>
<p>Weâre doing so in a way that is prudent and proportionate.</p>
<p>Our actions are supported across the political divide.</p>
<p>And we are responding in coalition with other countries from around the world, including from the Middle East.</p>
<p>Our goal is a safer Australia and a more humane world.</p>
<p>4 October 2014</p>
