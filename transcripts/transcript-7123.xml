PIME MINITER<br />
FOR MEDIA 19 February 1987<br />
The United States' most famous Tall Ship, Eagle, will visit<br />
Australia to take part in the Bicentennial celebrations.<br />
The three-masted barque is to join an international fleet in<br />
the Tall Ships event which will culminate in a parade of<br />
sail out of Sydney Harbour on Australia Day, 26 January<br />
1988. I am delighted that President Reagan's personal undertaking<br />
to me to provide a Tall Ship has been fulfilled in this way.<br />
A special feature of the Eagle visit will be the<br />
participation of young Australians in the sailing ship's<br />
crew. It is planned that at least two young Australians<br />
will join the voyage to Australia and back to the US.<br />
The Eagle is e;: pected to arrive in Newcastle on 20 December<br />
where it will spend Christmas before Joining the Tall Ships<br />
event, n Brisl'cne on 30 December for the start of the<br />
Bicentennial year.<br />
The Eagle will then proceed to Hobart to participate in the<br />
Tall Ships Race to Sydney the first such race to be held<br />
in the Southern Hemisphere.<br />
The 90-metre-long Eagle is among the larger tall ships of<br />
the world and it will bring aboard a crew of about 200,<br />
which includes 102 male and 32 female cadets. Originally<br />
built in 1936 in Germany and named, Horst Wessel, it was<br />
claimed by the United States as part of war reparations and<br />
joined the US Coast Guard in 1946.<br />
Tall Ships Australia 1988 is being organised by the<br />
Australian Bicentennial Authority and will bring together<br />
nationally and privately owined sail training vessels from<br />
around the world.<br />
The Federal Republic of Germany, India, Japan, the<br />
Netherlands, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom have also<br />
accepted the invitation from my Government to participate in<br />
the Tall Ships event. A number of overseas non-government<br />
vessels have also accepted ABA's invitation and some are<br />
already on their way to Australia. other overseas vessels<br />
are still considering their participation, while numerous<br />
Australian groups are well advanced in their plans to join<br />
the event. </p>
