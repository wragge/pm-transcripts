STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. P. C. KEATING<br />
THE FALL OF SINGAPORE<br />
in recent days the media has carried stories based on<br />
reports prepared by unidentified British military<br />
officials and endorsed by General Sir Archibald Wavell<br />
years ago.<br />
Some of these reports suggest that AustraliSan troops were<br />
in some way responsible for the fall of Singapore, others<br />
contain allegations that a number of Australian troops<br />
behaved in ways which, if true, would bring discredit on<br />
themselves and their country and reflect on the 17,000<br />
Australian men and women who served on the Malaya<br />
Peninsula and Singapore.<br />
It is important that our history be discussed and that<br />
the truth be told. We should not seek to hide from it.<br />
In this context it is a pity if it is true that these<br />
reports were suppressed 20 years ago in an effort to<br />
appease Australian feelings when Britain was seeking to<br />
enter the Common-Market.<br />
In fact, the substance of the reports appears to confirm<br />
what has long been known: that Singapore's defences were<br />
inadequately prepared, and the British Government knew<br />
it. It was certainly not Australian troops or British<br />
troops but British' aQlicy which led to the fall of<br />
Singapore. It is unlikely that the other allegations can ever be<br />
satisfactorily tested.<br />
But blaming young soldiers for the failures of<br />
politicians an( generals will not find much support in<br />
this or any other country.<br />

Whatever the alleged behavior of individual soldiers in<br />
the last days of Singapore, the fact remains that<br />
Australian, British and other Commonwealth troops were<br />
placed in an impossible position.<br />
overwhelmingly, they served with courage and distinction<br />
in appalling circumstances not of their making.<br />
That there was an attempt in this instance to saddle<br />
young Australian soldiers with the responsibility for the<br />
British Empire's most humiliating debacle is beyond the<br />
bounds of decency and credibility.<br />
