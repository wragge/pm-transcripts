    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister today congratulated the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on the birth of their first child, a son.</p>
<p>On behalf of all Australians, Therese and I extend our warmest regards to the new parents, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.</p>
<p>Prince William holds a special place in the hearts of many Australians. Some of us remember his first visit to this country as a 9 month old baby more than 30 years ago with his mother Diana and father Charles.</p>
<p>In more recent times, Prince William demonstrated deep compassion when he met with families in Victoria who had lost everything during the Black Saturday bushfires of February 2009.</p>
<p>We share in the joy of the Royal Family, particularly Prince Charles on the birth of his grandson and Queen Elizabeth II on the birth of her great grandchild.</p>
<p>This is a happy day for our close friends in Britain and the Commonwealth.</p>
