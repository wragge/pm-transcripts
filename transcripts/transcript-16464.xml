    <content><![CDATA[<p>An online gateway to keep Australians informed about the economy and the Australian Government's Economic Stimulus Plan has been activated today.</p>
<p>The website <a href="http://www.economicstimulusplan.gov.au/">http://www.economicstimulusplan.gov.au/</a> will provide information and updates on the progress of the $42 billion Nation Building-Economic Stimulus Plan as the Australian Government acts to cushion the nation from the worst effects of the global economic recession.</p>
<p>Subscribers to the website will receive regular economic notes by email from the Treasurer, focussing on the real economic story, without hype or drama, to keep Australians informed of the latest developments.</p>
<p>The website will also keep Australians up to date with the Government's progress in funding projects which will have lasting benefits for communities across the nation.</p>
<p>In getting on with the job, the Australian Government is funding:</p>
<p>     * A new 21st century school library, multipurpose hall, or classroom modernisation for each primary school in Australia;</p>
<p>     * New science labs or language centres for 500 secondary schools;</p>
<p>     * Grants of up to $200,000 for individual school communities to fund much-needed maintenance;</p>
<p>     * Ceiling insulation for around 2.7 million Australian homes;</p>
<p>     * Increased rebates for solar and heat pump hot water systems; </p>
<p>     * 20,000 new social housing dwellings;</p>
<p>     * 802 new houses for the Australian Defence Force;</p>
<p>     * Urgent maintenance to upgrade around 2,500 vacant social houses;</p>
<p>     * An additional 30 per cent tax deduction for small and general businesses buying eligible assets;</p>
<p>     * 350 additional projects in the Black Spot Program;</p>
<p>     * Installation of around 200 new boom gates at high risk rail crossings;</p>
<p>     * $650 million funding boost for local community infrastructure and maintenance on Australia's national highways;</p>
<p>     * One off cash payments to eligible families, single workers, students, drought affected farmers and others; and</p>
<p>     * $900 payment to eligible taxpayers. </p>
