I am honoured today to be part of a unique and memorable event.  At an investiture at Admiralty House at 2.00pm today, the Governor-General will present 20 Centenarians with the Centenary Medal.  Rarely, if ever, have 20 people aged over 100 been brought together to be honoured in such a way.<br />
On 28 December 2001, I announced the creation of the Centenary Medal to honour Australians who have made a contribution to Australia';s federation or to Australia';s society or government.<br />
One special group that will receive the Centenary Medal is our Centenarians: Australian citizens born on or before 31 December 1901 and who were alive to celebrate the centenary of federation on 1 January 2001.<br />
Overwhelmingly, most of the 3,000 or so Centenarians who are eligible to receive this medal will never before have been formally honoured by Australian society.  They will be people whose last expectation would be that they would be honoured in this way.<br />
The decision to award the Centenary Medal to Australia';s Centenarians gives us, their children, grandchildren and great grandchildren, the opportunity to honour older Australians and thereby to honour the nation as a whole, which owes them so much.  They have not only been asked to adapt their lives to a world that has changed so much during their lifetime, but have made a significant contribution to the changes that have made Australia what is today.<br />
I have the great pleasure of seeing one of my own constituents, Mrs Caroline Steel receive the Centenary Medal.  She is a striking example of the spirit of our Centenarians.<br />
Born in Woolahra on 6 July 1901, in World War I Mrs Steel worked in a factory pressing rising sun badges for the Army.  In World War II she was an air raid warden.  In the 1970';s Mrs Steel achieved great success in the Sydney Morning Herald garden competitions.  All her life she has been very active in the Baptist Church.<br />
I know that these medals will be worn with pride and we all acknowledge that the Centenarians'; lives have contributed to making Australia what it is today.</p>
