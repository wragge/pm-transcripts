<p>I am pleased to announce that the late Raoul Wallenberg will be recognised as an honorary Australian citizen.</p>
<p>This is the first time that Australia has bestowed such an honour.</p>
<p>Raoul Wallenberg was a Swedish diplomat who led an extraordinary rescue operation in Hungary during World War II.</p>
<p>He saved tens of thousands of Jews from the Holocaust by issuing protective passports and providing shelter in diplomatic buildings. </p>
<p>Tragically, Raoul Wallenberg did not return to Sweden.  He was arrested by Soviet troops in January 1945 and his fate remains a mystery.</p>
<p>Mr Wallenberg has been recognised as an honorary citizen of the United States of America, Canada, Hungary and Israel.</p>
<p>Many monuments, buildings, streets, schools and other institutions around the world bear his name. </p>
<p>He was awarded the honour of â€˜Righteous among the Nations' by Yad Vashem, the Jewish people's living memorial to the Holocaust.</p>
<p>The lives of those he rescued are Mr Wallenberg's greatest memorial and Australia is honoured to have survivors he rescued living in Australia today.</p>
<p>The Governor-General, Her Excellency Ms Quentin Bryce AC CVO, will host the presentation of a certificate of honorary Australian citizenship at Government House, Canberra, on Monday, 6 May 2013.</p>
<p>The award is made in the year of the centenary of Mr Wallenberg's birth.</p>
<p>The award of honorary Australian citizenship is symbolic recognition of Mr Wallenberg's tireless devotion to human life during the Holocaust.</p>
<p>The award is not conferred under the Citizenship Act 2007. </p>
