PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 24 APRIL 1987<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL 5.30 PM SUNDAY<br />
An outstanding international line-up of tall ships will visit<br />
Australia for the Bicentennial celebrations and take part in the<br />
first tall ships race in the Southern Hemisphere.<br />
Tall ships from Europe, Asia, and North and South America will cross<br />
the oceans to participate in Australian port festivities in this<br />
major Bicentenary event.<br />
I am delighted that so many nations have accepted the Australian<br />
Government's invitation to take part in Tall Ships Australia 198.8.<br />
The magnificent international fleet will grace our shores from early<br />
December. The tall ships race, involving overseas and local vessels, will<br />
start in Hobart on January 14, ending in Sydney.<br />
The event will culminate in a spectacular parade of sail onA<br />
Australia Day, 26 January 1988 out of Sydney Harbour. I am<br />
confident this international event will not only capture the<br />
imagination of all Australians but also remind us of our maritime<br />
heritage. It promises to be one of the most spectacular events of<br />
the Bicentenary.<br />
Visiting government ships will. start arriving early in December and<br />
will continue to arrive throughout December and early January 1988<br />
before assembling in Hobart to race to Sydney.<br />
The ships will be open to the public for inspection and a<br />
hospitality program involving visiting crews and Australians is<br />
being organised.<br />
The ships will visit most capital ports.<br />
A significant number of non-government vessels have also registered<br />
interest in Tall Ships Australia 1988. Three small non-government<br />
vessels are already on their way to Australia from the United<br />
States, Holland and Poland. </p>
