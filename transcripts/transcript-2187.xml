FOR PRESS: PM No. 30/ 1970<br />
SIGNING OF NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Cabinet this morning gave full consideration to<br />
the question of whether Australia should sign the Nuclear Non'-<br />
Proliferation Treaty. We have decided that it would be in Australia's<br />
interests to sign but with reservations. Signature will enable<br />
us to join with other like-minded signatories,, such as West<br />
Germany and Japan to achieve those interpretations, assurances,<br />
and qualifications which we regard as important.<br />
We have always supported the proposal for a<br />
Treaty designed to limit the further spread of nuclear weapons<br />
among the nations of the world.<br />
But we have wished to be satisfied that such a<br />
Treaty was effective, and did not damage Australia's interests.<br />
We do not believe that as yet sufficient nations<br />
have signed or ratified the Treaty to render it fully effective.<br />
But the recent signatures with reservations of Japan and<br />
West Germany have undoubtedly made it possible for the Treaty<br />
to be much more effective than it was.<br />
Further, although the questions of inspection and<br />
the safeguard provisions of the Treaty have not yet been resolved<br />
to our satisfaction progress has been made towards a solution.<br />
It is clear, too, that the Treaty will not inhibit<br />
but will assist the application of atomic energy for peaceful<br />
purposes in Australia. In these circumstances the Government believes<br />
that the time has come to sign the Treaty and hopes that this<br />
action will encourage other couDig to do the same. </p>
<p>* Ourd ecision . san-expxressio-no f -oure ar nest Jiope<br />
that a fully satisfactory Treaty can be achieved. It is also an<br />
expression of our desire to help and above all not to hinder<br />
such an achievement. However we wish to make it plain that our<br />
decision to sign is not to be taken in any way as a decision to<br />
ratify the Treaty, and of course, the Treaty is not binding<br />
on us until it is ratified. As was the case with Japan and West Germany<br />
our signature will be accompanied by a statement of our<br />
reservations and we do not propose to ratify the Treaty until<br />
the matters of concern to us have been clarified to our<br />
satisfaction. 18 FEBRUARY 1970 </p>
