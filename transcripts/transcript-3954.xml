PRIME MINISTER'S RADIO BROADCAST IN PORT AUGUSTA, S. AUST.<br />
SUNDAY 2 NOVEMBER 1975<br />
It is a very great pleasure to be in Port Augusta<br />
again in the centre of South Australia's iron triangle<br />
and to have this opportunity to talk to you. I was last in<br />
Port Augusta in April, before going on to Tarcoola for the<br />
inauguration of the new railway line to Alice Springs. That<br />
railway will be one of the many achievements of my Government<br />
of benefit to the people of South Australia and the Northern<br />
Territory. Since then South Australia has had a State election.<br />
It was an election on the very issue of railways, and I was<br />
delighted that Don Dunstan won that election and was able to<br />
put through his lesiglation to transfer financial responsibility<br />
for the State railways to the Australian Government. It was<br />
an excellent financial deal for South Australia, and it will<br />
make possible a very great improvement in South Australia's<br />
railway services.-Of course the other issue, the basic issue in your<br />
election, was the power of an Upper House to frustrate a<br />
Government's policies. Don Dunstan won that battle too,<br />
and now in Canberra the national Government is facing an even<br />
more serious challenge from a reactionary Upper House and<br />
we are fa: ing it for the second time in the life of my<br />
Goverrent. We have to win that battle for the sake of democracy,<br />
for t e sake of our Budget with all the benefits it will bring<br />
to thee Australian = eople and for the sake of the economic<br />
health and stabili-y of the nation. The Senate is threatening<br />
Australia with total chaos and disruption in its attempt to<br />
ovet_ r_ n the Gover-nent, in its determination to follow in<br />
the wcrds of Senator Steele Hall, a great South Australian<br />
the " sleazy road to power."<br />
In the pas-t few days the opinion polls have shown<br />
clearly what the Aus_-alian People think of Mr Fraser's tactics.<br />
Seventy percent of the people believe the Budget should be<br />
passed. Yet Mr Fraser persists with his disastrous policy.<br />
Already the Liberal-Country Party tactics are damaging the<br />
business community and threatening the nation's economic recovery.<br />
The Opposition is threatening the country with chaos in a grab<br />
for political power. They are telling the Australian people<br />
that a democratically elected Government, a Government with a<br />
secure majority in the House of Representatives, a Government<br />
elected for a three year term, should hand over power half<br />
way through its term simply because it suits the Opposition.<br />
Could any self-respecting Prime Minister yield to such tactics?<br />
What leader worth salt would give in to this sort of<br />
blackmail? I certaily will not. The Government will not.<br />
It's not Government which is blocking the use of<br />
. your taxes. It's = ot -he Government which is threatening the<br />
life and stability cf the nation. It's the Opposition in the<br />
Senate. The House of Representatives has passed the Budget<br />
Bills. Every Labcr Senator has voted for the Budget Bills.<br />
Every Labor member of Parliament and every Labor Senator will<br />
go on voting for these Money Bills until they are passed.<br />
The Opposition Senators alone are holding them up. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
We have to remember that at the Senate elections<br />
in May last year Labor candidates polled 165,000 more votes<br />
than the candidates of all other parties represented in the<br />
Senate. We Were returned with 29 Senators the same number<br />
as the Liberals and the Country Party. And there were two<br />
Independents. No party has a Senate majority. Since then,<br />
the Labor Senators have been reduced to 27, because two State<br />
Premiers have flouted another great constitutional convention<br />
that Senators should be replaced by a man or woman of the same<br />
Party as the one elected by the people. The Senate motion to<br />
block Supply would never have been carried but for the death<br />
of Senator Milliner of Queensland. As Steele Hall put it in<br />
another vivid phrase: " Let it be remembered that the Opposition<br />
succeeded only because a Labor Senator died. They did it<br />
over a dead man's corpse."<br />
I ask the people of South Australia a State that<br />
has consistently demonstrated its concern for democratic<br />
principles and for the rights of elected Governments to<br />
stand firm with me in resisting Mr Fraser's threat to democracy<br />
and his threat to the nation's economy. The Budget must pass.<br />
The Government must be allowed to govern. The nation and the<br />
economy must go forward. </p>
