PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 18 OCTOBER 1981<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The River Murray is Australia's most important water resource,<br />
and effective and appropriate management is vital to the future<br />
of the Murray. Everyone agrees that the Murray must be<br />
safeguarded against deterioration, but the different concerns of<br />
those people and groups who have an interest in the Murray meanl<br />
that a balance must be struck between a variety of con~ siderations.<br />
The Commonwealth Government, together with the state government~ s<br />
affected, has been determined to achieve harmony and effectiveness<br />
in making arrangements for the management of the Murray, and<br />
the new River Murray Waters Agreement is a significant milestone<br />
in the continuing development and management of the Murray.<br />
The quality of the water in the Murray has become a critical<br />
issue, especially in South Australia, and the difficulty of<br />
maitiriing a high quality has for some years been giving cause<br />
for concern. The Commonwealth has been taking significant<br />
action over recent years in connection with the environment<br />
and the economy of the Murray, especially through its<br />
contributions to the construction of the Dartmouth Dam, which<br />
is now about two-thirds full. The vastly increased fresh<br />
water source which this darn places under the control of the<br />
River Murray Commission will enable the Commission to advance<br />
many important river management objectives, including<br />
significant control of river salinity.<br />
The Commonwealth has also been providing funds over the past<br />
three years for salinity control projects in the Murray Valley,<br />
and some $ 6 million will be provided this year for this purpose.<br />
The highest priority projects recommended in the most recent<br />
report on the Murray, the Maunsell Report of 1979, are now<br />
well in progress, and the Commonwealth intends to proceed with<br />
additional projects concerned with the other priorities<br />
identified by that Report.<br />
The Commonwealth has also introduced taxation concessions to<br />
encourage the improvement of irrigation practices because poor<br />
irrigation practices are a major factor in salinity problems.<br />
In addition, the Commonwealth is continuing to assist South<br />
Australia improve the quality of the river water supplies for<br />
urban purposes, and by the end of this finan~ ial year over<br />
million will have been provided towards a filtration scheme<br />
for Adelaide's water supplies. / 2 </p>

The new River Murray Waters Agreement pays particular attention<br />
to water quality in the river, and gives the River Murray<br />
Commission the right to assess the implications for water quality<br />
of new developments, and the right to make representations on<br />
proposals which otherwise might be harmful to water quality.<br />
Former River Murray agreements have worked to the advantage<br />
of all three states for some 60 years, and the revision in the<br />
new Agreement to meet today's requirements is an important<br />
step towards improving water quality in the Murray.<br />
A draft of the new Agreement has been before the governments<br />
concerned for a considerable time, and I am delighted that we<br />
achieved acceptance of the new Agreement at our joint meeting<br />
last Friday, and delighted also at the degree of-co-operation<br />
which this. achievement represents. The Murray River system<br />
is a mighty resource which belongs neither to any one state nor<br />
to the Commonwealth, and we owe it not only to ourselves but also<br />
to our children to make sure that the Murray system and its<br />
water are maintained at the highest standards.<br />
It is a vital concern for all the people who live along the<br />
Murray and make their livelihood as a result of the resource,<br />
whether they are in New South Wales, Victoria or South Australia.<br />
This is important for many thousands of farms in all three<br />
states but it is also important for people who live in<br />
metropolitan areas and in the city of Adelaide. </p>
