Highway projects was construction of stages of a<br />
four-lane divided carriage way from the Cross Roads at<br />
Liverpool to near Mittagong.<br />
Other Hume Highway projects are four-lane work<br />
between Mittagong and Goulburn, and preliminary work<br />
on three new bridges at North Goulburn.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the roadwork would be<br />
carried out under the National Roads Act 1974.<br />
New South Wales will receive $ 136.7 million for national<br />
roads in the State in the period 1974-75 to 1976-77.<br />
