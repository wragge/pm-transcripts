AU STRAA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 7 MARCH) 1978<br />
ADDRESS TO INTERNATIONAL PRESS INSTITUTE<br />
I am delighted to be with you this morning and Australia is<br />
privileged to host the 27th Assembly of the International Press<br />
Institute. I understand this is the first meeting of the Institute south<br />
of the Equator. Of course, it is the largest press gathering<br />
of its kind Australia has ever seen.<br />
I'm particularly pleased to talk with an audience of editors,<br />
proprietors and publishers under full public gaze.<br />
I make that point because I am occasionally accused unkindly<br />
accused of spending too much time in private conversations<br />
with Australian newspaper editors and proprietors.<br />
Some people not, of course, reporters from the press gallery<br />
here in Canberra have the notion that I have a great influence<br />
over what the press say about my Government's actions and<br />
policies. Of course, one only has to look at the exceptionally flattering.<br />
political cartoons or read editorial writers' fulsome praise<br />
to understand exactly what influence I have on a newspaper's stance.<br />
Newspapers are not in business to keep Prime Ministers and<br />
politicians happy.<br />
Editors and proprietors owe no debt to any politician.<br />
Governments need a free press just as they need opposition parties.<br />
Without press freedom, the standards set by any government will<br />
decline, the worth and quality of government policies will<br />
deteriorate.<br />
With this freedom comes responsibility.<br />
A responsibility to expose; to criticise; to distinguish fact.<br />
from opinion; to be honest and fairminded in the presentation<br />
of opinion.<br />
But the responsibility is greater than this. / 2 </p>
<p>2-.<br />
There is now a responsibility to examine the effects of the<br />
press on the fibre of the nation, whether it fosters dispute<br />
or division, whether it enhances community spirit and pride.<br />
It is the ability to fuse criticism with this equally important<br />
sense of responsibility that is the hallmark of a free press<br />
at its best.<br />
The freedom of the press is of course the great ideal-for which<br />
your Institute stands and among you here are many who have<br />
taken heroic stands for freedom of speech.<br />
Australia's association with I. P. I. goes back to its infant days<br />
when the late H. A. M. Campbell of the Melbourne AGE was one of<br />
the 35 editors who gathered in the office of the New York Times.<br />
This was in the early post-war years a time of reconstruction<br />
and reform, when the leaders of the free world were establishing<br />
a new framework for international cooperation in many fields.<br />
The new institutions were set up and new rules were established<br />
for the conduct of trade and payments between nations.<br />
These rules were directed at avoiding a reversion to the " beggar<br />
thy neighbour" policies that exacerbated the 1930 economic<br />
recession. These new rules and institutions provided a framework by which<br />
international trade and payments could develop without<br />
restriction: that recognised the potential increase in wealth<br />
and welfare that can result through the international division<br />
of labour.<br />
The fact that total world trade has grown at a faster rate than<br />
the world economy during the post-war period indicates the success<br />
of this approach.<br />
Regrettably, however, the post-war international co-operative<br />
effort to reduce trade barriers has not been applied uniformly<br />
and there have recently been signs of regression in areas where<br />
progress had previously been made.<br />
The continued failure to deal with agricultural protectionism,<br />
and the yielding to pressures for increased protection in<br />
other areas pose one of the most important and testing challenges<br />
to world leaders today.<br />
That challenge is all the greater because it comes at a time when<br />
the western world continues to be plagued with the twin problems<br />
of inflation and unemployment.<br />
To understand these problems and -reach towards their solutions,<br />
I believe we need to stand back a little and view recent development<br />
in historical perspective.<br />
Immediately after the depression, there was some optimism that<br />
new economic theories held the answer to steady economic growth<br />
and the end of cyclical booms and recessions. .3 </p>
<p>3..<br />
The economic policies of the New Deal, after some initial SUCC ssOS,<br />
were beginning to lose steam with the Second World War suddenly<br />
providing a huge boost to demand.<br />
The period since the Second World War has almost certainly seen<br />
a rate of economic development unprecedented in history.<br />
In the past quarter of a century, average incomes in both deve: loped<br />
and developing countries increased by about 3% per annum in real<br />
terms-In a relatively short time, there has been a " doubling" of<br />
the average standard of living.<br />
Many factors have co ntributed to this remarkable growth, but there<br />
can be little doubt that maintenance of a continued strong consumer<br />
demand has been a vital element.<br />
This has been so since the time of the generous and necessary<br />
Marshall Plan to rebuild post-war Europe and the widespread adoption<br />
of " full employment" policies in the immediate post-war period.<br />
Our economies have responded to meet the vastly increasing demand<br />
for cars, washing machines, T. V. sets and all other multifarious<br />
trappings of the consumer society.<br />
It seems just yesterday when, in my own home, our Coolgardie<br />
safe was replaced by a new-fangled kerosene refrigerator. Today<br />
we demand automatic defrosting and complain when it doesn't work.<br />
As in the other developed countries, strong consumer demand has been<br />
a major driving force in Australia's economic growth during the<br />
last thirty years.<br />
Our development has, of course, also been spurred on by<br />
other factors: a great immigration programme the discovery and<br />
exploitation of our great mineral resources.<br />
Essentially, however, the Australian economy in the post-war period<br />
has been geared to trying to fulfil the expectations of the<br />
Australian consumer or, through overseas trade, his international<br />
counterpart.<br />
The slow down in personal consumption expenditure since 1973 in<br />
Australia and other O. E. C. D. countries has inevitably raised the<br />
questions whether we are approaching consumer satiation.<br />
But while consumer spending patterns may have changed in recent<br />
years, we need to look elsewhere for the underlying explanation<br />
of this slackening.<br />
What seems to have happened is that the increased rate of<br />
inflation in recent years has led consumers to reduce their spending<br />
rates and increase their savings rates.<br />
In one or two instances most notably the United Kingdom the<br />
absolute level of personal consumption has actually fallen since<br />
1973. / 4 </p>
<p>These developments have reflected the effects of inflation<br />
in increasing uncertainty and pessimism about the future as well<br />
as the desire to maintain real values of personal assets through<br />
saving. It is worthwhile asking why we got into this situation, because<br />
it might help us in overcoming our present difficulties.<br />
There is of course no single simple explanation. You are all<br />
however aware of overnment's ready acceptance of the theory<br />
that it is possible to trade off between inflation and<br />
unemployment the enticing idea that if governments allow just<br />
a little bit more inflation we can reduce unemployment a little.<br />
That has been described as a " Keynesian" theory, although I am<br />
told that Keynes himself believed that there were serious<br />
limitations to the use of demand management policies to reduce<br />
unemployment. Unfortunately, too many people forget that Keynes wrote in a<br />
period when unemployment was high but inflation and interest<br />
rates were low: his prescriptions were fundamentally designed<br />
for those circumstances and it is not necessarily appropriate<br />
to transpose them into another time.<br />
But the misuse of Keynes theories provided too many governments<br />
with the rationale for telling their people " we can afford it<br />
all". Political leaders sought to out-bid each other in<br />
promises to their electors, and government expenditure began to<br />
run out of control.<br />
It was inevitable that sooner or later this would give rise to<br />
rapid inflation.<br />
And this is exactly what happened in the early 1970s: at a time<br />
when oil producers were extracting very large price increases<br />
for their product, the irresponsibility of massive government<br />
spending was compounded by the irresponsibility of trade unions.<br />
Unions exploited their growing prower to extract higher wages<br />
and reduce profits.<br />
In retrospect, we can now see that the trade-off for higher<br />
inflation was increased, not lowered, by unemployment.<br />
Moreover, higher inflation has left many countries an unfortunate<br />
legacy of distortions in key economic relationships, most notably<br />
that between profits and wages.<br />
Against this background, it is not surprising perhaps that we<br />
are only now emerging, slowly and painfully, from some of the<br />
worst manifestations of this recession.<br />
Such growth as there has been in the world economy over the last<br />
two years has been underpinned by policies of those countries<br />
which have done most to overcome inflation the United States,<br />
Japan and Germany. </p>
<p>They have demonstrated that a reduction in inflation is a vital<br />
pre-condition for the expansion of economic activity, that there<br />
is no instant solution for reducing unemployment<br />
and no alternative to policies which further reduce inflation<br />
if sustainable growth is to be restored.<br />
This Government's policies are based on the firm conviction that<br />
beating inflation and restoring economic confidence are the keys<br />
to economic health.<br />
In Australia, it has been a hard struggle, but inflation is now<br />
below ten per cent, and expected to fall further this year.<br />
With the conditions being set for a further fall in interest<br />
rates, pick up in consumption and investment expenditure we expect<br />
continued moderate growth in output and a decline in unemployment.<br />
Because our economic policies have emphasised controlling<br />
government expenditure we have been able to introduce substantial<br />
personal income tax cuts.<br />
These have been in operation since the beginning of February,<br />
and are adding about one billion dollars a year to after-tax<br />
earnings. We have noted with interest that the U. S. administration has<br />
recently proposed tax cuts which would have a broadly similar<br />
effect in relative terms in that country.<br />
We would, of course, like to see a faster growth in demand for<br />
our exports. But we do not seek to achieve that through<br />
advocating precipitate stimulatory action overseas.<br />
Australia's interests lie in sustained growth in world activity<br />
and trade: too often in the past we have suffered from boom<br />
and then bust commodity cycles.<br />
What we do seek, however, is a fairer deal in treatment of our<br />
exports. Australia is a substantial world trading nation.<br />
Notwithstanding this, we are faced with increasing difficulty in<br />
getting access to overseas markets for some of our major<br />
exports. In the past thirty years or so the institutional framework and<br />
rules which governed world trade, have benefitted all trading<br />
countries. But the benefits have not been equitably shared, and the rules have<br />
not been equally applied. / 6 </p>
<p>we have found all too often that the rules have<br />
been iricerpreted to suit the purposes of the major developed<br />
countries. They have manipulated or ignored the rules to build special<br />
trade barriers to protect the high cost agricultural sectors,<br />
and under the multilateral negotiating procedures of G. A. T. T.,<br />
agricultural products have been placed in a special position,<br />
far less amenable to clear cut negotiations than industrial<br />
products. In fact, it largely exempts them from the rules of trade.<br />
As a result, the upward trend in protection for agricultural<br />
products in industrial countries has continued.<br />
In addition, the agricultural policies of the E. E. C. have<br />
thrown surpluses on to the available world markets almost at<br />
any price.<br />
The result has been to shift the burden of adjustment on to<br />
efficient producers in other countries not least Australia. / 7 </p>
<p>By interesting contrast, the rules have ensured that in industrial<br />
products, where the more powerful nations have a comparative<br />
advantage, there is a largely unfettered access to expanding<br />
markets. Despite this, when the industrialised nations<br />
find the going difficult in the areas where they should be most<br />
successful, they have been adept at devising new protectionist<br />
mechanisms. For example, demands are now being made for voluntary export<br />
restraints on goods as diverse as colour television sets and steel.<br />
Australia's position in the world trading network is a distinctive<br />
one. We are a relatively rich country yet, unlike other developed<br />
countries the bulk of our exports 75 percent of them<br />
comprise primary products, largely agricultural products.<br />
We have found that our agricultural exports to overseas markets<br />
are subject to a variety of restructive measures, such as<br />
variable levies, quantitative restrictions, state trading practices.<br />
The variable levy is an imaginative devise to ensure that<br />
no product subject to it can compete on the community market<br />
other than on the price the community chooses.<br />
The E. E. C. claims that the variable levy is not a tariff, is not<br />
subject to any international rules, is not negotiable at the MTN.<br />
The only thing about the variable levy that the E. E. C. would<br />
concede is that it is in practice infinitely variable, on an al~ most<br />
daily basis, if necessary. But not even this wonderful<br />
device is always adequate. It has to be supplemented at times<br />
with other devices: tying imports to local purchases, minimum<br />
import prices and surveillance licencing.<br />
In common with the developing nations, most of our major exports have<br />
received unfavourable treatment under the policies. of the largest<br />
developed trading nations., ./ 8 </p>
<p>Australia's trading problems in the European Economic Community<br />
and elsewhere form part of an emerging pattern of trade which<br />
has greatly affected the developing countries. Many of the<br />
problems they face have arisn from their inability to generate<br />
markets for their commodities. There is much to support their<br />
argument that this situation has arisen because the world<br />
trading system operates unfairly in relation to the commodities<br />
on whichi they depend. In all these regions there is still great<br />
poverty. Unless the developed world move-s to assist their search<br />
for a fairer share of world trade and access to trade, this<br />
poverty and suffering will not be alleviated.<br />
The developed countries will have an early chance to demonstrate their<br />
good intentions. At the MTN negotiations in Geneva there is an.<br />
opportunity for them to make greater efforts to provide an equitable<br />
international trading framework. Will those negotiations show the<br />
way to an increase in world trade? An opening up of markets<br />
for commodities? The creation of new trading conditions<br />
providing a real equality of opportunity for developing and<br />
smaller countries? If that were to be done, it could lift the<br />
world trade and assist in establishing a sustained<br />
economic recovery.<br />
A further test of the intentions of the major developed countries<br />
will be provided when negotiations resume on the Common Fund,<br />
first amongst Commonwealth Ministers, probably in April then<br />
afterwards in UNCTAD. We can only hope that all countries, but<br />
particularly the rich developed nations, will see the need to reject<br />
rigiLd positions and enter meaningful negotiations. Certainly<br />
it does not augur well that the EEC refuses to be a party to the<br />
International Sugar Agreement, a matter of vital importance to<br />
developed and developing countries alike. We believe that<br />
agreements for individual commodities with assistance available<br />
from a Common Fund, could introduce greater stability into world<br />
trade and to the incomes of developing countries.<br />
In the hope that other developed countries will see the need for<br />
movement, Australia has recently made certain proposals which<br />
could speed the establishment of a Common Fund.] / 9 </p>
<p>We must all approach the coming international discussions with<br />
a genuine commitment and in good faith. If growth in developing<br />
countries is not to be inhibited we must establish a trading<br />
system that allows scope for development, instead of putting<br />
up barriers against it.<br />
Developing countries are beginning to realise their industrial<br />
potential and they must be allowed to continue to do so,<br />
Australia stands ready to participate in this process, but we<br />
cannot undertake it alone. The problem needs to be treated as<br />
a global issue if it is to be resolved. It is a challenge<br />
that the developed world must face if we are not to revert to the<br />
inward looking policies of the 1930' s. That way would spell<br />
economic and social disaster.<br />
The opportunity now exists on a multilateral basis to agree on<br />
mechanisms to open world markets and to keep them open in ways<br />
which benefit all the trading nations. The contribution<br />
that freer trade can make to an economic revival in the developing<br />
countries, if it can be achieved, will not only lift the standard<br />
ov living in developing countries, it will also stimulate<br />
trade and markets around the world. This will be of direct beneift<br />
to all nations, developing and developed alike.<br />
Thus my appeal to you today is not more unfettered idealism:<br />
it is embedded in the self-interest of the whole world. </p>
