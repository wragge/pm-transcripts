DEATH OF GEORGE MEANY<br />
On behalf of all Australians, I would like to express the<br />
Australian Government's regret at the death of Mr George Mieany,<br />
a well known union leader.<br />
Mr Meany was one of America's leading citizens. He was widely<br />
respected throughout America as a strong, independent and<br />
responsible leader of the union movement. He was essentially<br />
non-partisan in outlook and was successful in bringing the views<br />
of American labour Co bear at the highest levels in the country.<br />
As a dedicated and responsible trade union leader he never<br />
sought to enter the political arena to pursue political office<br />
for himself or to intrude in matter. 3 outside the ambit of<br />
what he regarded as his legitimate interests.<br />
