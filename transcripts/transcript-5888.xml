EMBARGO: 5.30PM<br />
FOR MEDIA THURSDAY, 12 AUGUST 1982<br />
The Prime Minister today released the attached text of<br />
a letter which he and other senior Ministers are<br />
sending to business and other community leaders, including<br />
State Premiers. Li 1 9 e-<br />

<p>PRIME MINISTER CANBERRA<br />
" I am writing to draw your attention to the very significant<br />
recommendations of the Remuneration Tribunal released by the<br />
Treasurer and the Acting Prime 1% linister on August 8 and the<br />
Governmesnt's decision, announced on August 10, to accept them.<br />
The Tribunal had been considering over recent weeks the<br />
level of salaries and allowances to apply to Ministers,<br />
other members of Parliament, Judges, senior Commonwealth<br />
public servants and other statutory officeholders.<br />
The Tribunal recommended salary increases of about seven<br />
per cent, with the increase for members of Parliament being<br />
deferred for three months.<br />
The Tribunal points to significantly larger increases which<br />
have been received by some other groups in the community and<br />
states that it has recommended a lesser rate of increase than<br />
it would have adopted were economic circumstances not as they<br />
are. The recommendations, and the Government's decision to<br />
accept them, set a very clear example of wage restraint,<br />
applying as it does to the most senior people in the Commonwealth<br />
public sector.<br />
I believe that the Tribunal's conclusions have given due regard<br />
to the Government's submissions made in writing by myself and,<br />
reflecting the Government's serious concern, by the Treasurer<br />
in apersonal appearance before the Tribunal.<br />
The Commonwealth argued that in the exceptional economic<br />
circumstances which currently exist it was essential to set<br />
a lead to the community generally and that accordingly any<br />
wage increases should be substantially below the rate of<br />
inflation. In support of this position, the Commonwealth pointed to<br />
widespread concerns about the threat that excessive wage<br />
increases pose for the recovery of the Australian economy and<br />
hence job opportunities. -The submissions were in accord with<br />
the spirit of the recent Tripartite discussions between the<br />
Commonwealth, the ACTU and the CAI that Australia is facing a<br />
very serious economic situation and that, while emphases might<br />
differ, there is general agreement about a link between<br />
excessive wage increases and loss of jobs. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The Tribunal noted that it should, as the Government asked,<br />
take into account the state of the economy and, within proper<br />
limits, the effects which its decisions would have upon it.<br />
The Tribunal was persuaded that exceptional circumstances<br />
exist and that its recommendations could have the effects<br />
referred to by myself and the Treasurer.<br />
With the Remuneration Tribunal having recognised the need<br />
for wage restraint and having set the example, I believe<br />
the onus is on all leading Australians to give support. If<br />
all major Australian companies follow the Tribunal's example<br />
of restraint at the senior-levels of their own organisations,<br />
this will set a tone wvhich . will help us in achievring -wage<br />
restraintC throughout the wvorkforce which is so vital,<br />
particularly in the cause of saving jobs.<br />
For its part, consistent with the approach it took before the<br />
Remuneration Tribunal, the Commonwealth also made strong<br />
submissions recently to the Academic Salaries Tribunal on<br />
the need for restraint. The Academic Salaries Tribunal has<br />
now presented its findings, recommending an increase of<br />
seven per cent. I believe that these findings demonstrate<br />
recognition by the Tribunal of the pressing need for wage<br />
restraint in all sectors, and present a further and very<br />
welcome example to others, following the lead set by the<br />
Remuneration Tribunal.<br />
The Commonwealth is also arguing strongly for restraint<br />
before a Full Bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration<br />
Commission in the current case involving Commonwealth public<br />
servants in the clerical and administrative areas.<br />
The Government welcomes the initiatives taken by several major<br />
corporations in the private sector to give a lead in wage<br />
restraint in their own sphere. Indeed, in some cases companies<br />
have decided that in their present circumstances a complete<br />
freeze on executive salaries is appropriate. The Government<br />
hopes that the examples set will be widely followed.<br />
Moreover, since restraint at all levels is vital to improving<br />
the competitiveness of all Australian companies, it is also<br />
to be hoped that the message of what is being achieved and the<br />
reasons why restraint is necessary will be conveyed to all<br />
company employees, and their co-operation and participation<br />
sought. This message might be presented on the basis of<br />
national data, and the figures relating to the particular<br />
enterprise. Thus I seek your personal support in pursuit of the vital<br />
national objective of wage restraint. The stakes for the<br />
Australian economy and the Australian community are high.<br />
With a responsible approach we now have an opportunity to<br />
improve substantially our economic prospects.."<br />
