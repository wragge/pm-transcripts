MACQUARIE NETWORK( WEEKLY BROADCAST<br />
BY THE PRIM4E MINISTER, THE RT. HON.<br />
WILLIAM McMAHON, CH, MP.<br />
IMM4IGRAT ION-11 OCTOBER 1972<br />
Interviewer Paul Lynch<br />
Q. Prime Minister, on Macquarie stations las~ t night, I<br />
conducted what is called a " Five Cent Poll". People were<br />
invited to call in and talk about what they consider to be<br />
the issues of the 1972 election. Many, many people who<br />
called in said they considered immigration to be one of the<br />
major isaues. The ALP, of course, has brought out a number<br />
of proposals on immigration. You have not spoken out very<br />
much on this issue. How do you feel about the ALP programme<br />
for immigration?<br />
PM: I-think it would be disastrous for this country, both<br />
in economic terms, and of course, they would destroy our<br />
policy of having one single Australian community. In other<br />
words, when we allow, or we attract migrants to come here,<br />
we want them to be integrated into one homogenous society.<br />
That is our policy, and I believe the alternative the<br />
Labor policy would destroy both of the objectives that we<br />
seek.<br />
Q. A brief summation of the ALP policy would be in effect<br />
that they seek to remove racial discrimination, they wish to<br />
reduce the numbers of migrants coming to Australia and they<br />
would want migrants to come to this country who had been<br />
nominated by their families. Ibw do you s-ethat as being<br />
disastrous to this country's economy?<br />
Q. Well, at least 50 per cent of the migrants who come here<br />
now were nominated by the Commonwealth or State Governments<br />
and not by individual nomination. When we nominate them in<br />
the Commonwealth or the State4, it means that we pick the people<br />
we want, and to a very large extent they go to the developing<br />
areas such as the North-West where our mineral development is<br />
taking place or up around the Gladstone area and places of that<br />
kind. What it would mean, therefore, is that we would cut<br />
down on our development substantially and our growth would be<br />
stunted. You would also find that migration from the United<br />
Kingdom would be reduced by probably as much as 60 per cent.<br />
Migration from North America and Northern Europe and South<br />
America would be practically cut out and there would be a<br />
big reduction in migration from Southern Europe. All this<br />
would have a bad effect on us because it would take away from<br />
the traditional migration links between the two countries. / 2 </p>

Q. You seem -arti-cunarJy worriced about this orocess of<br />
personal nomination -t~ ie ALP is n-utting torvrard, rarticularly<br />
in respsct to -non-. Eron2ear~ iiraigrantF,. Wrhy is that?<br />
PM,: i am interested in this for.-s-cia1 pixrposes because<br />
we want, as I have said a few minutes age , rr-integrated<br />
Australian societyr. We don't want little enclaves scattered<br />
-all over the lcewith the dif ficulties that they create.<br />
Ncw, if you adopt a policy of non-discrimination, this would<br />
mean that over time, in the long run not in the short periodthat<br />
we would greatly harm this policy becausa the non-Europeans<br />
nominate large numbers of relatives and friends, and as they<br />
do this and the numbers in~ crease and they go on multinl ' ving,<br />
then you would find that you would have disproportionately<br />
large number of non-Euro ' ncans coming into the community. That<br />
I believe would bo contrary to our nclicY ( and contrary to the<br />
best interasts of the Australian people and, I believe, too,<br />
of the migrants thcmselves.<br />
Q. In view of the oublic interest in immigration in the<br />
election castwaign, do you plan to announce any reforms or<br />
chanqe-,: S of goal in your Party's and your Government's<br />
immigration poli. c 1r<br />
PM: No. What we havo done is to establish a committee of<br />
enquiry on population, and we want that committee to look at<br />
every aspect of nopulation birthrq and. deaths, immigration<br />
and emigration, the numbers that we can absorb and the best<br />
distribution of vonuiation in order to ensure that w~ e can<br />
devAeultoapJi. o the full but at the same time nrotect<br />
environmental conditions -nd establish qualities of life that<br />
we think the Australian people want.<br />
You would want a revort from that commission bofore<br />
ycu decided on any change in plans?<br />
PM: Yes, and as it is an in-depth study, we do not think we<br />
would be able to get that repaort until the 1973-1974 Budget<br />
year. Prime M~ inister, thank yrou very much. </p>
