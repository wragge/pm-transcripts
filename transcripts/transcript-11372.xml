    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..................</p>
<p>  Well thank you very much Mr Pederson. To my Ministerial colleague Nick Minchin,</p>
<p>   to Senator Stott-Despoja, Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats, other</p>
<p>   Parliamentary colleagues, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>  Tonight is an opportunity to do a number of things. It's an opportunity</p>
<p>   for me on behalf of the Government, and I'm sure on behalf of the Australian</p>
<p>   people to record the immense respect and admiration I have for the on going</p>
<p>   contribution that engineers of all kinds and of all shapes and sizes make</p>
<p>   to the strength, not only the economic strength but also the social and</p>
<p>   physical infrastructure of the Australian community.</p>
<p>  There are many things that Australians do extremely well, and we were reminded</p>
<p>   of our proficiency on a sporting field of course today. I've never been</p>
<p>   through a less focused Question Time than I was this afternoon, and I can</p>
<p>   assure you the lack of focus was totally bipartisan. But ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p>   there are many things that this country does well and I've had occasions</p>
<p>   over the past few months to not so much coin the phrase, but repeat the</p>
<p>   concept of a can-do country. That is a country which focuses on achieving</p>
<p>   outcomes which are to the benefit of the entire community. And amongst the</p>
<p>   many things that Australians do extremely well is that we are very good</p>
<p>   builders and very good engineers. And of course the two go hand in hand</p>
<p>   together.</p>
<p>  I've had many memorable weekends as Prime Minister of this country visiting</p>
<p>   the many different parts of our community. But none has exceeded in interest</p>
<p>   and absorption and sheer Australian pride than the weekend I spent only</p>
<p>   recently in joining with many others, including many here tonight, to celebrate</p>
<p>   the 50th anniversary of the commencement of the construction</p>
<p>   of the Snowy Mountain Scheme. That remains to this day one of the great</p>
<p>   engineering feats of the world. It is certainly Australia's proudest engineering</p>
<p>   achievement. Not only was it a great engineering triumph, but of course</p>
<p>   it was a great personal triumph for the thousands of people who worked there</p>
<p>   and a great national triumph for the Australian nation and our openness</p>
<p>   and our tolerance and our capacity to blend together very quickly in the</p>
<p>   Australian environment people from so many different parts of the world</p>
<p>   who came to this country after the Second World War to make it their home.</p>
<p>  When I think forward, and I look forward to the 21st Century,</p>
<p>   I can see a role for engineering, particularly in our part of the world</p>
<p>   which will even surpass the contribution that it has made over the last</p>
<p>   50 years. I predict now that Australian engineers and Australian expertise</p>
<p>   will be increasingly in demand in South-East Asia and in the Asian-Pacific</p>
<p>   region. Our standards of excellence, our reliability and our capacity and</p>
<p>   our technical expertise is without parallel. And the contribution that the</p>
<p>   engineering schools of our various universities will make to producing the</p>
<p>   graduates, and in time the practical engineers, will play a very major role</p>
<p>   in the economic thrust of Australia into the region immediately adjacent</p>
<p>   to us.</p>
<p>  It remains of tremendous importance that all of us do what we can to encourage</p>
<p>   the study of science and engineering both in our schools and in our universities.</p>
<p>   It is true, as the Chairman said, that I have derived incredible stimulus</p>
<p>   and insight and knowledge from the Prime Minister's Science and Engineering,</p>
<p>   or Science and Innovation Council as it's now called. It's brought home</p>
<p>   to me as somebody not trained in the discipline of engineering or science,</p>
<p>   the integral role that that discipline, or those disciplines play in our</p>
<p>   daily life, and the interconnectedness of engineering and scientific skill</p>
<p>   to the economic and social wellbeing of our community. And the experience</p>
<p>   chairing that council has brought me into contact with the best engineering</p>
<p>   and science minds in Australia. And on display to me every time that council</p>
<p>   meets is the enormous depth of talent that this country has been able to</p>
<p>   draw on in that area, and the ongoing contribution that it has made and</p>
<p>   continues to make to our community.</p>
<p>  So tonight is therefore an opportunity for me as Prime Minister and collectively</p>
<p>   for the nation to honour and salute the contribution of Australia's engineers</p>
<p>   to the wellbeing of our society. It's also an opportunity for you to salute</p>
<p>   and honour those amongst you who have excelled in a particular way. It is</p>
<p>   important that every discipline, every group in our community pause for</p>
<p>   a moment and honour those who've been particularly good and those who have</p>
<p>   achieved a special level of excellence, and tonight you will have a splendid</p>
<p>   opportunity to do that.</p>
<p>  Engineering is part of the history of this country from the very beginning</p>
<p>   and it will be a very integral part of the future of this country. And in</p>
<p>   a symbolic way to capture that the institute has decided, and they've asked</p>
<p>   me to announce tonight, something that will in a symbolic way link the skills</p>
<p>   of engineers and the specialty of engineering with the history and the important</p>
<p>   events in the history of this country. And I'm pleased to announce that</p>
<p>   with funding from the National Council for the Centenary of Federation,</p>
<p>   and Dick Smith, who's no mean achiever in his own right as Chairman of that</p>
<p>   council, and Tony Eggleton, the Director of that council, both of whom who</p>
<p>   are here tonight. But they've taken on a project that provides a wonderful</p>
<p>   opportunity for communities around Australia to make their mark on history</p>
<p>   for the 100th anniversary of nationhood in 2001.</p>
<p>  Many of you will be aware, I don't know whether any of you remember from</p>
<p>   personal experience, that in the late 19th century arches were</p>
<p>   a popular form of street decoration for public celebration in the then Australian</p>
<p>   colonies. The celebrations associated with the inauguration of the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   of Australia on the 1st of January 1901, and the opening of the</p>
<p>   first federal Parliament in Melbourne, the arches were grander and more</p>
<p>   extravagant than ever before. And around Australia at that time organisations</p>
<p>   and communities designed and erected a wide array of arches. There was the</p>
<p>   floral welcome arch, the wool arch, the Aboriginal arch, and the weed arch,</p>
<p>   the citizen's arch, the firemen's arch, and the apple arch. There was a</p>
<p>   railway arch, a rustic arch and a butter arch, which melted incidentally.</p>
<p>   And then there was the Chinese, the French and the American arch. And all</p>
<p>   of those arches, particularly the butter one, were temporary, being dismantled</p>
<p>   within days of the federation celebrations. But in planning and erecting</p>
<p>   them citizens of the new nation were expressing something of who they were</p>
<p>   and something of their aspirations for Australia.</p>
<p>  So appropriately for the year 2001 the Institution of Engineers and the</p>
<p>   National Council for the Federation have developed a nationwide project</p>
<p>   to encourage people to revisit their nation's history and the idea of creating</p>
<p>   an arch. By decorating the arches in many and varied styles throughout the</p>
<p>   community, we'll be telling a significant story of who we are today as our</p>
<p>   nation celebrates its 100th birthday. Using specially designed</p>
<p>   kits provided naturally by the institute of engineers, school groups, community</p>
<p>   organisations, professional associations and others, will commemorate the</p>
<p>   centenary of federation by creating their own piece of unique centenary</p>
<p>   memorabilia. The Chairman of the National Council Dick Smith, as I mentioned</p>
<p>   is here tonight, and I know Dick is very enthusiastic about this project</p>
<p>   and about the opportunity it offers all Australians to celebrate the nation's</p>
<p>   history and achievements.</p>
<p>  The Federation Arches Project will also involve a competition for engineering</p>
<p>   students to design the Australia arch to be installed in Canberra on Federation</p>
<p>   between the old and new Parliament House as part of the finale event for</p>
<p>   the centenary year in 2001. So I therefore encourage all of you in the engineering</p>
<p>   profession to support both elements of the Federation Arches Project, and</p>
<p>   in so doing commemorate in a very tangible and relevant way not only the</p>
<p>   history of our nation but also the contribution made by engineers through</p>
<p>   the building of the modern Australia, and also as a signal into the future</p>
<p>   of the contribution that all of you will make to the future.</p>
<p>  I welcome you to Parliament House in Canberra. I honour the contribution</p>
<p>   of engineers to the development of the Australian nation. This is a magnificent</p>
<p>   gala occasion and I congratulate in advance all of those who will be given</p>
<p>   awards for their tremendous contribution within their chosen profession.</p>
<p>  [Ends]</p>
