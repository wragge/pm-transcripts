6 March 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
RADIO INTERVIEW WITH HOWARD SATTLER, RADIO 6 PR<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
SATTLER: In the week that he chalked up one year as Australian Prime Minister, John Howard is<br />
a clear 30 points ahead of his rival, Kim Beazley, in the opinion polls. His Government<br />
is also a comfortable 13 points ahead of the ALP but that is not to say the Coalition<br />
hasn't had its problems as governments do, the stand-outs I think being the Austudy<br />
backdown, fuinding rows with the States, alleged procrastination over Aboriginal land<br />
claims and the Senators Woods and Colston affairs. So is John Howard, is his<br />
Government ahead by default? The Prime Minister joins me now. Your response<br />
Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't believe I am ahead by default but nor do I get carried away with opinion polls.<br />
I keep reminding myself and reminding my colleagues that public opinion demands<br />
performance. We have to keep in touch, we have to keep delivering and I don't enter<br />
my second year as Prime Minister with any sense of smugness or complacency.<br />
SATTLER: So do you think that you've made some blues?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Let me put it this way. All of the major things we said we were going to do we have<br />
done and we have done them with bits added. We introduced our Family Tax<br />
Initiative, we have changed the industrial relations system, we've got the sale of one<br />
third of Telstra through the Parliament, we've introduced a lot of measures to help<br />
small business and there's more coming in that area in two or three weeks time. </p>
<p>Obviously you get a bit of static along the way but it's for others to make judgements<br />
about errors that we would have made.<br />
SATTLER:<br />
Well, Austudy was a static one, wasn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, there was nothing wrong with the actual means test. The purpose of that was to<br />
make sure that people who were not entitled to Austudy didn't get it and I don't<br />
apologise for that.<br />
SATTLER: But it was too stiff, surely?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well the administration of it was poor and when that was discovered we did something<br />
about it and we changed it. The goal of making sure that people who could afford not<br />
to have Austudy wouldn't get it was a proper goal and it was just that the way it was<br />
done was administratively clumsy and when we discovered that the Minister changed<br />
it. But I certainly don't believe the original decision was a bad decision. It was a good<br />
decision. People don't want benefits like that that are meant to help low income<br />
earners and modest income earners. People don't want the rest of the community who<br />
can afford it to get them. That's what it boils down to.<br />
SATTLER: Yes but what do you say to the students who may have missed out because they didn't<br />
believe they could survive without Austudy and they would have been entitled to it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well the information that I have is that there aren't a very large number of people in<br />
that category and because the, many of the school, the university year has just begun,<br />
there's not going to be an enormous number of people affected by that.<br />
SATTLER: Can we talk about the Federal Government's relationships with the States and even<br />
some of your conservative colleagues like Richard Court, for example, he's upset<br />
about the cuts to legal aid. He wants you to get on with the job of defining pastoral<br />
and mining rights following the Mabo and now the Wik native title decision. Are they<br />
entitled, people like him, to be a bit hot under the collar? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I accept that in the lead-up to a Premiers' conference you always get a bit of<br />
shadow boxing between the Commonwealth and the States, no matter who is Prime<br />
Minister or who is Premier. So far as legal aid is concerned, we are applying the<br />
principle that the Commonwealth Government will fund legal aid matters arising under<br />
Commonwealth law and the States should fund legal aid matters arising under State<br />
law. SATTLER: Yet at the same time, seeking to save $ 120 million for yourselves too, aren't you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The reason we are saving money as a result of the application of that principle is that<br />
over the years the States have used Commonwealth money to fund State legal aid<br />
responsibilities. Now I know this is a difficult decision but the principle is sound and<br />
the principle is defensible and that is that if somebody is charged under a State law and<br />
that person is entitled to legal aid, that legal aid ought to be provided by the<br />
Government that has brought in the law and that's the State government. And<br />
conversely, if somebody is charged under federal law, that person ought to be, if he is<br />
to be legally assisted, he or she is to be legally assisted, should be legally assisted out<br />
of federal money.<br />
Now that is the principle that Daryl Williams has argued for and that is the principle on<br />
which the decision is based. Now, I don't think there's anything wrong with that, I<br />
really don't. I think it is fair, it is transparent and it establishes a clear demarcation of<br />
responsibilities. Now the second point that you raised, and that is about native title, I've had a lot of<br />
discussion with Richard Court in the wake of the Wik decision. We had a Premiers'<br />
meeting in January at the request of the Premiers. Immediately they asked for it. We<br />
had a meeting and it is a very complicated issue and I have been in very detailed<br />
discussion and so have my offices with the West Australian Government and I am<br />
endeavouring through discussion with everybody to see if there is a basis for an agreed<br />
outcome. I have said that if that does not emerge by around Easter, which is only a<br />
few weeks off now, I will then make a recommendation to my colleagues in the<br />
Federal Government as to what we should do.<br />
Now I don't believe that I'm dragging my feet. Equally I don't believe that I am<br />
hurrying the thing along. It is incredibly difficult and complicated.<br />
SATTLER: Well you are sitting on a barbed wire fence on this, aren't you? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It is an enormously difficult issue. I am trying to achieve an outcome that everybody<br />
regards as fundamentally just and an outcome that delivers certainty. The Wik<br />
decision was an extremely disappointing decision. It overturned my understanding,<br />
Richard Court's understanding, the understanding of farmers and miners and many<br />
other people about the relationship between pastoral leases and native title and that has<br />
really thrown the whole issue back on the table. Now I accept the Mabo decision. I<br />
thought the Native Title Act was badly flawed and that is why we said we were going<br />
to amend it and I remind your listeners that the then Coalition Opposition actually<br />
voted against the Native Title Act in its present form when it was passed by the former<br />
government because we knew there were weaknesses. Now, I'm trying very hard in<br />
good faith discussions with everybody and I mean, I've spoken very regularly to the<br />
Western Australian Premier about this and I want to assure people living in Western<br />
Australia that their Federal Government understands the particular problems that<br />
Western Australia has, unlike any other State, with this issue. Now, I understand that<br />
and I won't let them down. I have an obligation to try as hard as I can to, if I can, to<br />
achieve an agreed outcome. Now that is the basis on which I am proceeding but it is<br />
not going to go on for ever and if we can't see our way towards that agreed outcome<br />
within the broad time frame of about Easter, I'll then be giving certain<br />
recommendations to my colleagues.<br />
SATTLER: All right Prime Minister, you agreed to take talkback calls and we've got one on the<br />
line for you now. His name is Bill. Bill you've got the opportunity to speak directly to<br />
the Prime Minister, a rather unique opportunity, away you go.<br />
CALLER:<br />
Good morning Howard, good morning Prime Minister.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Hello Bill.<br />
CALLER: You made a comment a short while ago in relation to Austudy and that it was designed<br />
to help low and moderate income earners. Now, I was just wondering what your idea<br />
of low or moderate income was in view of the quote the other day about families<br />
going to have to look after their 18 20 year olds and I think the income limit they put<br />
on that was $ 23 350.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, no decision, I mean, the decision that has been taken in that youth allowance<br />
area is that we are in favour in principle of having a common youth allowance. I mean,<br />
low to middle income is something that is very much in the eye of the beholder. And </p>
<p>there are certain income and assets limits that apply. Obviously somebody who is<br />
earning anything like that money would have to be classified as a low income earner<br />
obviously. SATTLER: Okay, thanks very much for you call there Bill. Now, Prime Minister, of specific<br />
interest to Western Australia and I believe you are up to speed on this, is the decision<br />
to chop a five percent subsidy to the shipbuilding industry by December 31. Now, I<br />
don't know whether you've heard, but jobs have already been lost. They are putting<br />
people off down at Coogee here because the companies now can't compete with their<br />
forward orders against their more heavily subsidised foreign competitors who get<br />
between 9 and 23 percent subsidy and we'll get it until the end of 1998. I can't for the<br />
life of me and neither can the people in the industry here see the logic of chopping that<br />
subsidy ahead of the competitors.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, what we have done originally the subsidy was to have disappeared earlier than<br />
the date you mentioned.<br />
SATTLER:: Yes, in June.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That's right. Now what we have agreed to do is to extend it until the end of the year.<br />
SATTLER: But you are not going to have an inquiry until the end of the year. It might be too late<br />
then. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Hang on. This is the result of some discussions I had with the shipbuilders and the<br />
Western Australian Premier and Deputy Premier when I was over in Perth in<br />
December. I had a meeting with all of them, and following that meeting and following<br />
some negotiations in . we agreed with a proposal that was put to us in the Parliament<br />
that it should be extended, and we extended it until the 31 st of December which on my<br />
advice brings us into line with the subsidy arrangements applying in our competitor<br />
countries. SATTLER: No it doesn't now. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well you know we are obviously going to have an argument about this but that is the<br />
advice that I have and that we will, in the meantime we'll monitor what those OECD<br />
countries do with their assistance and we will review the need for any further bounty<br />
during the second half of 1997.<br />
SATTLER: But can you understand it doesn't make a lot of sense when they are paying Canberra<br />
more than three times the amount in income and company tax than you are giving them<br />
in subsidies, now they are losing the contracts, people are losing their jobs and the<br />
companies are slowly winding back.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I mean, a lot of companies don't get any subsidies from the Government. Most<br />
companies don't. I mean it's very few companies in aggregate get subsidies from the<br />
Government. Most people have to, if they want to start a business, they have to start it<br />
with their own capital and if they earned a profit they pay some tax. I mean, a great,<br />
overwhelming majority of companies don't get any subsidies at all for anything so it is<br />
an atypical situation for any company to get a subsidy. Look I understand the strength<br />
of feeling on this. I also understand the success the shipbuilding industry has had. I<br />
listened very carefully to what had been put to me and as a result of that and other<br />
propositions that had been put to me we did change the original budget decision. We<br />
changed it in the belief that that would put us in line with our OECD competitors. We<br />
have said that we will review the need for further bounty assistance during the second<br />
half of 1997 having in mind what happens amongst other things in those OECD<br />
countries. Now that's not a bad response...<br />
SATTLER: No it is not a bad response but a lot of people you'd think could be better.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, obviously I understand that, but nobody can say we are ignoring them.<br />
SATTLER: No we can't say that. Now, I was going to ask about politicians perks but I think<br />
Margaret might have got in ahead of me. Here she is. Yes Margaret.<br />
CALLER: Hi Howard, and Mr Howard. I just want to know, when you came into power, I<br />
thought you said that you were going to cut out the frequent flying points for<br />
politicians and public servants and also the chauffeur driven cars, and with this man<br />
that's coming up now, this Colston, or whatever his name is, you've done neither. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I didn't say I was going to cut out cars with drivers, I've never said that. I'm<br />
sorry I didn't say that. I did say that I would cut Government staff and I've done that.<br />
Staff in Ministers offices has been cut in my government from 455 under the former<br />
Government to 380. As far as frequent flyer points are concerned, what we said that<br />
should happen was that in future, frequent flyer points should not be used for personal<br />
travel and should be accumulated and set off against the cost of official travel and that<br />
is the principle that is being applied. In many cases it is difficult in practice to apply<br />
that because the conditions attaching to the use of frequent flyer points, so I am<br />
informed, is such that you can only use the credit accumulated on particular flights and<br />
at particular times and those requirements often don't coincide with the need for<br />
official travel. But I have no recall at all of having said that I was going to cut out cars<br />
being driven by chauffeurs or drivers or however you want to describe them, because, I<br />
mean, in some cases there is a totally legitimate security reason for it. I don't think it<br />
is unreasonable for somebody who is a Minister of the crown to have a driver, I don't.<br />
I think in this country you've got to keep a sense of balance about these things.<br />
Ministers may in the eyes of the public and politicians have certain perks as they are<br />
described. On the other had, given the responsibilities they carry the salaries that<br />
senior Ministers in particular have are way below what people carrying far fewer<br />
responsibilities in the private sector receive.<br />
SATTLER: All right, well just another call, we're just about out of time. But Bill's there, hello<br />
Bill. CALLER: Good morning, Howard.<br />
SATTLER: And the Prime Minister's listening.<br />
CALLER: Good morning Prime Minister.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Good morning Bill.<br />
CALLER: Look I would like to ask about this health business. How is it that people in private<br />
health that are in there to take the weight of the public hospital system, the public<br />
health system, get penalised all the time? </p>
<p>SATTLER: What do you mean Bill?<br />
CALLER: Well they get penalised by every, the cost of the payments going up.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Do you know what I think I think, Bill, I think you've got a fair complaint. One of<br />
the reasons why the payments have gone up is that there are fewer people in private<br />
health insurance now than there used to be.<br />
SATTLER:<br />
We need more encouragement don't we?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well of course you do and we'll be introducing a tax subsidy worth $ 500 million on<br />
the first of July. The tragedy is it should have been introduced five or ten years ago. If<br />
it had have been introduced five or ten years ago by the former government the number<br />
of people in private health insurance wouldn't have fallen to 34 per cent from about 61<br />
per cent in 1983. And it stands to reason that if you've got more people in private<br />
health insurance you're spreading the risk around, you're getting the premiums down.<br />
What increasingly has happened is that fewer and fewer young, relatively healthier<br />
people are staying in private health insurance because it's too costly for them, they've<br />
had no incentive, no encouragement. The more of them that drop out the greater<br />
strain is put on the funds and as a result they push their premiums up which in turn<br />
push more people out and it becomes a self perpetuating process. Now if Graham<br />
Richardson's advice to the former Labor government had been taken and not rejected<br />
by people like Kim Beazley and Paul Keating five years ago you may now have had<br />
perhaps 38 39 per cent of people in private health insurance instead of 34 and the<br />
premiums would have been a bit lower.<br />
SATTLER:<br />
Yes, all right. Prime Minister just before you go too. You're copping a little bit of<br />
flak from some of the ladies in Parliament about returning to gender specific titles.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I haven't seen any criticism of that except from Dee Margetts. </p>
<p>SATTLER:<br />
Natasha Stott-Despoja says that you're living in a bygone era because of your<br />
preference for gender specific language.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
So it's a bygone era to call somebody a chairman instead of a chair or a chairperson?<br />
SATTLER: That's what she thinks.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think you apply the test of common sense does anybody really want to be called a<br />
chair or a chairperson. I'm not going back to any offensive gender specific language.<br />
What I'm trying to do with these things is to inject a bit of Australian common sense.<br />
Chair and chairperson are both ridiculous, clumsy expressions. Chairman is not gender<br />
specific. For hundreds and hundreds of years words like chairman and craftsman and<br />
sportsman have been inclusive languages and if you examine the anglo-saxon origins of<br />
the English language you will find that they have never been gender specific, they have<br />
always been taken to include both men and women and that argument on linguistic<br />
history as well as the grounds of common sense.<br />
SATTLER: Are we mankind or humankind?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I've always said mankind. If a female member of my staff makes a statement on<br />
my behalf she is described as a spokeswoman. She's not described as a spoke or as a<br />
spokesperson as far as I'm concerned. I just think you need a bit of common sense and<br />
you also need to avoid mutilating a beautiful language in the name of political<br />
correctness. SATTLER: Are you participating in International Women's Day this weekend?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I'll certainly be saying a number of things about it today.<br />
SATTLER: All right, thanks for your time today. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
You talk about women in my Government, there are more women in my ministry than<br />
any ministry before. There are more women who sit on the Liberal and National Party<br />
side of the House of Representative than in any government since Federation. That's<br />
the real test.<br />
SATTLER: And they are women and you are men.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Tokenistic things about whether you're called a chair or a chairperson.<br />
SATTLER: All right, thanks for your time. Congratulations on the first year.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Thank you.<br />
SATTLER: Well talk to you again soon, I'm sure.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I hope we do.<br />
ends </p>
