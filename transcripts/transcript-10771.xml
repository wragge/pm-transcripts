    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.............................................................................................</p>
<p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. The Prime Minister and I have</p>
<p> had almost an hour of very valuable talks and they will continue over</p>
<p> lunch.</p>
<p>The relationship between our two countries is close. It is built very</p>
<p> directly on people-to-people links. We have a lot of shared history.</p>
<p> And I've found the talk today with the Prime Minister to be extremely</p>
<p> positive and, as a result, the relationship between the two countries</p>
<p> has been further strengthened.</p>
<p>He naturally briefed me, the Prime Minister, on the circumstances</p>
<p> in his country following the tragic events of the Tsunami. And I will</p>
<p> have an opportunity at lunch to express to him, and also fortuitously,</p>
<p> because many of them will be there, to the Australian defence personnel</p>
<p> the way in which that tragedy affected the Australian people and the</p>
<p> way in which we were very pleased, in the tragic circumstances, to</p>
<p> respond in such an emphatic way. The spontaneous response of the Australian</p>
<p> community was evidence of the affection which is held in this country</p>
<p> for the people of Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>I want to announce that apart from the relief activity which is already</p>
<p> being provided, about which I'll have something more to say in</p>
<p> my remarks at lunchtime, Australia will provide further assistance</p>
<p> for rehabilitation work. We will provide whatever extra is needed</p>
<p> to ensure two or three new schools, some facilities that are more</p>
<p> accessible for people who've been disabled as a result of the</p>
<p> tragedy, medical support for those with orthopedic injuries and amputations,</p>
<p> agriculture and fisheries programmes to rebuild the local economy,</p>
<p> assistance to churches and non-government organisations working on</p>
<p> rebuilding in new areas, upgrading and repairs to roads, support for</p>
<p> earthquake monitoring and geological survey work, advice to provincial</p>
<p> and district administration on planning, and assistance to Papua New</p>
<p> Guinea with disaster planning. And some of the aid programmes that</p>
<p> are already in operation will provide some relevant assistance. We'll</p>
<p> also provide some funding additional to the aid programme. That amount</p>
<p> will depend on needs and the funds already provided by Papua New Guinea</p>
<p> and other donors, but we envisage a sum of, in the order of, a million</p>
<p> dollars. Australia has already spent $2 million additional to the</p>
<p> aid programme on relief, not counting, of course, the contribution</p>
<p> of the Australian Defence Force.</p>
<p>On other matters, we were pleased a few moments ago to witness the</p>
<p> signing of the Memorandum of Understanding regarding the gas pipeline.</p>
<p> And that represents, if it comes to fruition, a total investment of</p>
<p> $3.1 billion and that will generate a large number of jobs in both</p>
<p> countries.</p>
<p>Both of us shared experiences in relation to the impact of the Asian</p>
<p> downturn on our two economies. I want to take this opportunity, as</p>
<p> I will at lunch, of congratulating Mr Skate for the role that he and</p>
<p> his government have played in bringing the possibility of a lasting</p>
<p> settlement in Bougainville closer to fruition. Bougainville has been</p>
<p> a source of concern to successive governments, both in Australia and</p>
<p> Papua New Guinea and the role that Mr Skate has played and, I might</p>
<p> also remark, the role that has been played by Australia's Foreign</p>
<p> Minister, Mr Alexander Downer, have played a very, very significant</p>
<p> part in giving us more hope in that area. We also re-emphasised and</p>
<p> agreed upon the importance of the defence cooperation between the</p>
<p> Australian Defence Force and the defence forces of Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Australian Government it's been a very positive</p>
<p> and very productive session. And I'm delighted this is Mr Skate's</p>
<p> first visit, not only to Canberra as Prime Minister but also his first</p>
<p> visit to Canberra, and I'm very happy to have him with me and</p>
<p> to re-affirm, as I will at lunch time, the very close and intimate</p>
<p> links between our two countries and our two societies.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SKATE:</p>
<p>Firstly, Mr Prime Minister, I want to thank you, on behalf of the</p>
<p> people of Papua New Guinea, for inviting me to be here in Canberra.</p>
<p> And, secondly, is to thank all the Australians, the people of Australia,</p>
<p> for what they have done in assisting us in terms of the disaster that</p>
<p> we had faced in Aitape and, of course, over the periods when we had</p>
<p> problems in Bougainville and Rabaul, how the Australians were willing</p>
<p> to help.</p>
<p>It goes to show that the people of Australia do care about the people</p>
<p> of Papua New Guinea. It also shows that they have friends on the other</p>
<p> side, and that we valued, and it also reassures us that we have friends</p>
<p> and brothers on this part of the country, in this region. Secondly,</p>
<p> our objective to come over here is in two-fold. One is to establish</p>
<p> contact and promote understanding with Australian leadership. And</p>
<p> secondly is to reach an understanding on key issues affecting Papua</p>
<p> New Guinea in which Australia has an important role to play in Papua</p>
<p> New Guinea. And as the Prime Minister John Howard has rightly said,</p>
<p> there are four issues that we have touched on Â– defence cooperation,</p>
<p> investment, trade and bilateral strength and our bilateral and multi-lateral</p>
<p> relationship. I am also pleased to note that the Prime Minister and</p>
<p> his Government and, of course, with the support of the Australian</p>
<p> people are willing to stand behind Papua New Guinea and show that</p>
<p> Papua New Guinea progress positively and becomes a prosperous country</p>
<p> to live in.</p>
<p>In terms of Bougainville, I think we are making headway. We have a</p>
<p> long way to go but I thank the Australians for the role they have</p>
<p> played in terms of peace monitoring group. . We have asked Australians</p>
<p> to support us to ensure that the United Nation, when it takes part</p>
<p> as an observer on the Island, recognises the sovereignty of Papua</p>
<p> New Guinea. And the Australian Prime Minister has given us that assurance</p>
<p> and respected that request. I also want to thank the Prime Minister</p>
<p> for the understanding he has with the currency crisis that Papua New</p>
<p> Guinea is facing. We have tried within our means to live within our</p>
<p> means. We are able to control our budget without much help from the</p>
<p> World Bank and the IMF but I am pleased to inform the people of Australia</p>
<p> that the World Bank has taken note of our performance in the last</p>
<p> 12 months that I have been Prime Minister and they are very satisfied</p>
<p> as to how we have been able to control our budget.</p>
<p>On the Aitape, I have been down there. After 24 hours the Australian</p>
<p> supply arrived. I saw children, women, people dead but it's an</p>
<p> experience that I will never forget and that has made me much stronger</p>
<p> to look after my people and care for my people. I thank the Australians</p>
<p> for the supply and the swift way they moved in to assist and bring</p>
<p> normalcy on the devastated island. It was wonderful to know that Australians</p>
<p> flew in quickly, they were the first to land there, followed by New</p>
<p> Zealand and Japan. I want to thank the people of Australia and Prime</p>
<p> Minister yourself and your Government for that assistance.</p>
<p>The latest tally we have today is about 2,134 people are dead. There</p>
<p> are 9,483 in the care centres; 628 in the hospitals and they are still</p>
<p> searching for more dead bodies but we have, in fact, instructed people</p>
<p> not to move into devastated areas because it is contaminated and it</p>
<p> will be too dangerous for people to be living around there. Having</p>
<p> that Mr Prime Minister, when I make my speech I think the people of</p>
<p> Australia will have an opportunity to know who Bill Skate is and what</p>
<p> he stands for and where he comes from. And with the support of the</p>
<p> Australian brothers and sisters throughout Australia, I want to say</p>
<p> thank you very much for having me in your wonderful country. And I</p>
<p> hope Mr Prime Minister it is only fair in a Melanesian custom that</p>
<p> you should come down to my country and I will reciprocate the hospitality</p>
<p> that you have accorded me. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Howard, regarding the Australian aid, will that be</p>
<p> given through aid agencies that are already there and church groups</p>
<p> or will some of that money go through the central fund that the Papua</p>
<p> New Guinean governments.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Well the design is that we would pay directly for those particular</p>
<p> projects. We think that is the most intelligent way of doing it. The</p>
<p> central fund has actually been quite successful, the response to that</p>
<p> has been tremendous and we just think the most beneficial, practical</p>
<p> way is to itemize some projects and pay for them directly.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Skate, if I could ask you, what guarantees are there</p>
<p> that any donations of money that are coming from Australian people</p>
<p> will go to the source i.e. will go to helping those people?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SKATE:</p>
<p>I have set up a committee and the committee is not made up of politicians</p>
<p> except me as the Chairman and patron. The funds will go into an account,</p>
<p> we'll open up a special account, and it's going to be managed</p>
<p> and audited by a company called Deloittes Chartered Accountants. We</p>
<p> have a bishop, a Catholic Bishop, Bishop Brian Barnes in the committee.</p>
<p> We have a bloke by the name of [inaudible] Bernhard Chulai representing</p>
<p> the international donors, and NGO representative, Janet Philoman.</p>
<p> That makes up the committee. I am not the signatory to the cheque,</p>
<p> it is the NGO or international donors, one of the representatives,</p>
<p> the Catholic Church and, of course, the Chairman of National Disaster.</p>
<p> Therefore, with Deloittes as chartered accountants, it's very</p>
<p> transparent, accountable and I think it will be put in the right place</p>
<p> for projects that will benefit the people of Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Despite that, though, there are accusations though that you are siphoning</p>
<p> off some of that money. At least one provincial governor has said</p>
<p> it's a racket and a conspiracy and that you are trying to take</p>
<p> that money, what do you say to that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SKATE:</p>
<p>We have a very strong law, much, much better than, I think, some of</p>
<p> the laws in Australia. We have an ombudsman commissioned to investigate</p>
<p> leaders if they have bridged any law. We have a fraud squad and our</p>
<p> laws...if you are found once, under section 14 of the Leadership</p>
<p> Code, you don't hold public office. In politics, people accuse</p>
<p> leaders because they want to make noise, but they should investigate</p>
<p> the report substantiated before they report. I think character assassination</p>
<p> has truly destroyed my country and a lot of my leaders. I have no</p>
<p> time for leaders who speak like that because they have ulterior motives,</p>
<p> I don't.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Skate, can I ask you, in relation to the recent sex</p>
<p> videos that have been an issue in front of your Parliament, Father</p>
<p> Lak was named as being involved in that, can you update us on what's</p>
<p> happening in your country about that issue?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SKATE:</p>
<p>We have appropriate laws and those who complain should go and see</p>
<p> our institutions that should look into it. It is not for me to be</p>
<p> judging a person.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What are you doing about it, are you going to have a full inquiry</p>
<p> into the allegations?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SKATE:</p>
<p>The people have been told on the floor of parliament to refer that</p>
<p> matter to the Ombudsman Commission and appropriate authorities, it</p>
<p> is their job. I have a bigger problem, my problem is to manage my</p>
<p> country's affairs, run the economy properly and show that my</p>
<p> people are receiving the goods and services that has been denied for</p>
<p> a long, long time.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But the allegations of nine million kina being involved in a bribe</p>
<p> over that incident, isn't that something that you should investigate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SKATE:</p>
<p>If you are to go to the bank and ask them about nine million kina,</p>
<p> there's been no nine million kina bribe. It is again politics</p>
<p> at its best, accusing leaders because we are making a difference in</p>
<p> this country. I am making a difference, that's why people are</p>
<p> worried.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What about Father Lak, do you have confidence in him, do you deny</p>
<p> he's involved?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SKATE:</p>
<p>I have a lot of confidence, I have a lot of confidence in the man.</p>
<p> I have a lot of confidence as one great Papuan New Guinean leader</p>
<p> and his name has been tarnished and I will stand by him until the</p>
<p> law finds him guilty.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you deny that he was involved in this incident?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SKATE:</p>
<p>I deny it totally because I've seen the tape, it's not very</p>
<p> clear.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>...deny those allegations.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SKATE:</p>
<p>Well, they use parliament privileges. Why can't they use it outside</p>
<p> so he can take them to court? The man's not been given a fair</p>
<p> chance.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>In the wake of the Tsunami, nurses and medical staff are obviously</p>
<p> willing to volunteer to go to the area and help with the people up</p>
<p> there. They're saying that they're being told to pay their</p>
<p> own way, that they can't get there unless they pay their own</p>
<p> way. Will you release some money from that central fund so that medical</p>
<p> staff can go and help the injured?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SKATE:</p>
<p>Of course, that's the reason why we are setting up this account.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>When will that happen, though?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SKATE:</p>
<p>Well, we're receiving the money. I mean, to-date, we have 1.1</p>
<p> million kina in the account...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]... assistance.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SKATE:</p>
<p>Yeah but, look, people are sending us money. You know, it's only</p>
<p> seven days I start launching this and we have to have the accountants</p>
<p> who is managing the fund, not Bill Skate. I have accountants, it's</p>
<p> their job. I just call for...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will you tell them to release the money so these medical staff can</p>
<p> go...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SKATE:</p>
<p>Of course I will. I will. In fact, I have spoken to them, before I</p>
<p> left. And we have to do it properly. You don't release a fund</p>
<p> because a man says I want a fund. You have to prepare documents, have</p>
<p> it, you know, checked Â– is it true, is it what they really want</p>
<p> or is it another request, a hand-out request. We want to check everything.</p>
<p> I'm an accountant by profession, therefore I want to see everything</p>
<p> done properly.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How soon can the gas pipeline be built if this Memorandum of Understanding</p>
<p> comes off, if you get the agreement that you need?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SKATE:</p>
<p>Well, it depends very much on Prime Minister Howard and his Government</p>
<p> and the people of Australia and those investors. I think it's</p>
<p> two countries, in fact, three governments, that's the Federal</p>
<p> Government, the Papua New Guinean Government and, of course, the Queensland</p>
<p> State Government and the investors. We have to have a look at it.</p>
<p> If my Minister for Petroleum and Gas, Sir Rabbie Namaliu, the former</p>
<p> Prime Minister, moves faster, I think we can get it going. And, you</p>
<p> know, if you question my credibility, I mean, one has to look at Sir</p>
<p> Rabbie Namaliu, the man with an impeccable reputation, you know, internationally,</p>
<p> and he's in my government and he's assisting me, therefore,</p>
<p> something must be wrong with other people - Bill Skate's okay.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Howard, you were talking about goods and services before.</p>
<p> Your backbench seems to be worried about the prospect of trying to</p>
<p> sell a goods and services tax in Australia. Are you going to be able</p>
<p> to address their concerns?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we won't be selling a goods and services tax. We'll</p>
<p> be explaining a taxation reform plan which embraces a fundamental</p>
<p> reform of the whole Australian taxation system. I'll be notifying</p>
<p> my colleagues later today that there will be a joint party meeting</p>
<p> here in Canberra next Wednesday the 12th of August and</p>
<p> at that joint party meeting the colleagues will be asked to approve</p>
<p> the plan that has been developed. And I feel very confident that when</p>
<p> that plan is explained they will have considerable enthusiasm in promoting</p>
<p> it because it is and will be seen by the Australian public as a very</p>
<p> good plan, a plan for the 21st Century. We believe in reforming</p>
<p> the Australian taxation system, unlike our opponents who want to cling</p>
<p> to the existing wholesale tax system, so that if they happen to win</p>
<p> the next election they could do what they did in 1993 and increase</p>
<p> all the existing wholesale tax rates by two or three per cent, having</p>
<p> promised personal tax cuts. I mean, they are shaping up to do the</p>
<p> same thing this time as they did last time and that is to promise</p>
<p> tax cuts, don't deliver them, but put up the existing indirect</p>
<p> taxes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is it conceivable that the party room may want to tinker with your</p>
<p> package?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we don't take anything for granted. We are going through</p>
<p> a process of genuine consultation. I don't take the partyroom</p>
<p> for granted but I feel very confident that when the plan is presented</p>
<p> the plan will appeal very warmly and very strongly and naturally it</p>
<p> takes a little time to get it all together. This is like a budget.</p>
<p> In fact in some respects it is bigger than a budget because it is</p>
<p> bringing about a very significant change in our taxation system, therefore</p>
<p> you do need a lead time between the taking of final decisions at an</p>
<p> executive government level and the final presentation of the document</p>
<p> for approval, and you have to have consultation and discussion along</p>
<p> the way. There seems to be Paul, a curious notion around that we are</p>
<p> sort of holding it back for some particular reason. We are not. I'd</p>
<p> be very happy if I were in a position to release it tomorrow, take</p>
<p> it to a party room meeting and release it tomorrow but I can't</p>
<p> because there are calculations to be done, there are documents to</p>
<p> be prepared, there are references to be cross-checked because it is</p>
<p> a plan, it is not just a policy, it is a plan for significant change</p>
<p> to Australia's taxation system.</p>
<p>I'm sorry Bill, that I went on at such length about something</p>
<p> which is of such great interest to the Australian press. I apologise</p>
<p> for that. Yes, Stephen?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How long after that do you think it could be before you could make</p>
<p> the ....?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, if it is approved, and that's if it is approved, we would</p>
<p> hope to release it immediately. If it is not approved, well, it might</p>
<p> take a day or two longer.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>...(inaudible)....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, wait wait wait.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Kim Beazley is expected to announce the details of Labor's immigration</p>
<p> policy today which have been reported. What's your reaction to</p>
<p> that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I haven't heard it yet.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>It's on the front page of The Australian.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm perfectly happy to say that we altered the immigration policy</p>
<p> we inherited from the Labor Party. We altered it in three ways : we</p>
<p> reduced it, we introduced a two year waiting period, which the Labor</p>
<p> Party is against, and the other thing we did was to Â– we shifted</p>
<p> the emphasis away from family reunion in favour of skilled migration.</p>
<p> You can't have both. You can't simultaneously maintain the</p>
<p> previous level of family reunion and shift it in favour of skilled</p>
<p> migration. We are in favour of skilled migration, very strongly in</p>
<p> favour and we altered it, and we ended the imbalance that existed</p>
<p> under the former Labor Government's policy. As to what is in</p>
<p> Mr Beazley's announcement today, I don't know. I'll</p>
<p> have a look at it when it is released.</p>
