TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH JANA WENDT, A CURRENT AFFAIR,<br />
8 NOVEMBER 19190<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
WENDT: Prime Minister, thank you very much for your time<br />
this evening.<br />
PM: Pleasure Jana.<br />
WENDT: Acknowledging all the blood sweat and tears that<br />
goes into the kind of micro-economic reform that you've<br />
announced today, do you nevertheless have any regrets that<br />
you couldn't have moved on it a little earlier?<br />
PM: But we have moved on it earlier. I mean, you go back<br />
to the very first days of Government with the deregulation<br />
of the financial sector and the award restructuring. The<br />
whole process of micro-economic reform has been going on.<br />
This is another large instalment, a new large instalment.<br />
WENDT: In the area of telecommunications. Can you still<br />
guarantee that no consumer will be worse off?<br />
PM: Yes. We've said not only that, we've said that there<br />
will be significant real reductions in STD charges and I've<br />
been authorised to say that those charges those reductions<br />
in STD charges to the major routes could be up to 40%, Jana.<br />
WENDT: Can you still guarantee that there will be no timed<br />
local calls?<br />
PM: What I've said in the speech is quite clear that there<br />
will be the requirement that the untimed local calls must be<br />
provided. WENDT: So that will,. categorically that will, continue.<br />
There will be no timed local calls.<br />
PM: That's right. We are saying that we will build into it<br />
a provision that they will have to continue to provide<br />
untimed local calls.<br />
WENDT: Mr Hlawke, I'd like to move on. Once upon a time,<br />
high employment was your Government's proudest boast. Are<br />
you personally disappointed with the sad sort of figures<br />
that we're seeing now? ' IN </p>
<p>PM: Well, disappointed in the sense that for people who at<br />
this point haven't got the same employment opportunities as<br />
they had before, of course I'm sad for them. But I still<br />
have the situation and you say it was once our proudest<br />
boast as though it disappears the fact is that those<br />
1.6 million new jobs have been created. They're there. It<br />
still remains the fact that we've had a period, under our<br />
Government, of employment growth twice as fast as the rest<br />
of the world..<br />
WENDT: But Mr Hawke<br />
PM: That hasn't those facts haven't changed. The fact<br />
is, as I've discussed with you and the media before, we had<br />
a position in this country, a year ago, where the increase<br />
in our expenditure was twice what the increase in production<br />
was. We had to slow things down because if we didn't do it,<br />
if we didn't slow things down, the rest of the world would<br />
have imposed a solution on us which would have been<br />
devastating.<br />
WENDT: In this current climate is rivalling unemployment<br />
the price that we're going to have to pay to solve our<br />
economic problems?<br />
PM: Well you are going to have the experience, that we have<br />
now, of a slowing down of activity which means a slowing<br />
down of employment opportunities but we have said, and I<br />
repeat to your viewers, that as we go through 91 the<br />
recovery will take place. We will see employment growing<br />
significantly again.<br />
WENDT: Mr Hawke, you've always been well able to read<br />
Australians and their feelings towards you. What is your<br />
reading of your relationship with Australians now?<br />
PM: I think the relationship is still sound. It is the<br />
case, as I've acknowledged, that we are not getting ticks at<br />
the moment, as people are being hurt by the necessary<br />
policies that we've had to for the reasons that I've put<br />
of having to slow the economy down people don't like that<br />
and they have been registering their disappointment. That's<br />
one fact. I mean, they're registering their disappointment<br />
about the fact that they are being hurt. No-one regrets<br />
that more than me. But I know that if I didn't do that I<br />
would be letting this country down because the resolution of<br />
the rest of the world would be with us. But, secondly,<br />
politics is about one side and the other and it is the case<br />
that a new leader of the Liberal Party, once they got rid of<br />
that silly h'urdy-gurdy of Howard, Peacock, Howard, Peacock,<br />
which had bEcome a joke, then a new leader was going to have<br />
a honeymoon period. And he's having that.<br />
WENDT: But the fact is that really for the first time there<br />
are more Australians who would prefer to see your opposite<br />
number running the country than would prefer to see you<br />
running the country. </p>
<p>PM: It's taken almost eight years, taken almost eight<br />
years. Let me say this, that I know that in the enduring<br />
sense, there'd be more Australians who would say, we don't<br />
trust Bob Hawke we don't want any more of him if they<br />
thought that what Bob Hawke had done was to pursue wrong<br />
policies to try and hang onto popularity.<br />
WENDT: Most people in a normal and human reaction to<br />
something like this would be hurt by the apparent<br />
deterioration of what was a very warm relationship. Does it<br />
affect you that way?<br />
PM: No it doesn't because I understand the circumstances in<br />
which they ate expressing that concern. But I know I have<br />
total confidence that if you take the period which is<br />
relevant and as I've got to look through the period right up<br />
to the next ( election, I know that I would devastate myself<br />
irretrievably with the electorate if the perception were<br />
able to develop that Hawke had taken the opportunistic line<br />
that instead of doing the hard things he'd done the easy<br />
things and buggered the country.<br />
WENDT: Mr Hawke, what about the long term? I know it's a<br />
fair way to the next election but as you survey the<br />
political horizon you have to consider a loss at the next<br />
election. How does that thought affect you?<br />
PM: I mean I just don't think about it, Jana. Obviously<br />
we've just had an election. There are 2 and a half years to<br />
the next election. I keep saying, I've been saying for 8<br />
years, get your time scales right. I mean there have been<br />
points before the ' 87 election, before the ' 90 election,<br />
go to an election at those points, we would have been<br />
decimated. WENDT: But, Mr Hawke, your popularity has never been as low<br />
as it is now.<br />
PM: And I've given you the reasons for it. I mean I<br />
understand why people are saying that. I've given you the<br />
reasons. WENDT: Well do you think that if this trend in these polls<br />
continue that you will have to consider your position?<br />
PM: No.<br />
WENDT: Do you think that if the trend continues that your<br />
Party might start to consider your position?<br />
PM: They give me no indication of thinking that they want<br />
anyone other than Bob Hawke leading them. I think it's a<br />
sensible decision on their part, I might say. </p>
<p>WENDT: Mr Hawke, let me move on to the situation in the<br />
Gulf. All th~ e signs are that we are moving closer to war.<br />
How close are<br />
PM: I won't say all the signs are. Why do you say all the<br />
signs?<br />
WENDT: Well what is your assessment of the situation?<br />
PM: I don't think all the signs are but I think you're<br />
right to say that war is a real possibility. I think that<br />
is true but don't think all the signs, Jana. I think the<br />
truth is that: no-one, no-one knows what the outcome will be<br />
because basically we are dealing with an irrational man in<br />
Saddam Hussein. Any rational calculation of the interests<br />
of his fellow countrymen and women would have to lead to the<br />
conclusion that he should withdraw from Kuwait. All the<br />
evidence suggests that that's what he should do but he's not<br />
doing it. Now where in fact the accumulation of the<br />
evidence will lead into that conclusion, one can't be sure.<br />
I would not be entirely surprised, I would not be entirely<br />
surprised if suddenly Saddam Hussein said I withdraw.<br />
WENDT: If that did not occur and there was an armed<br />
conflict are we as a country prepared for an involvement in<br />
that kind of war?<br />
PM: Well we've got naval assets there now and I am not<br />
going to these matters are so profoundly important to my<br />
fellow countrymen and women that I'm not going to<br />
hypothesise about this. I follow the events there on a<br />
daily, almost an hourly basis. I insist on being kept<br />
informed of all the latest developments. Now the<br />
circumstances in which war could arise are not capable of<br />
prediction at this time and one will want to know in this<br />
hypothetical situation, one would want to know precisely<br />
what the circumstances are and what it would mean for our<br />
forces there. It would be entirely irresponsible for me to<br />
hypothesise -about this. But our presence there is serious,<br />
it's effective and it's there because we believe that<br />
aggression cannot be condoned and must be resisted.<br />
WENDT: Two Australian hostages are to be released as a<br />
result of the intervention of a self-appointed envoy. Now<br />
what do you think has been the result of that, apart from<br />
the obvious release?<br />
PM: Well let me answer that question this way. Firstly,<br />
obviously for the two that have said are going to be<br />
released then there is obvious pleasure for them, pleasure<br />
on our part for them. The fact is that there are many, many<br />
more that are not being released and that is why most of the<br />
governments that are involved have taken the view that they<br />
will not officially engage in a process of bargaining.<br />
Because the realities are that what this dictator has done<br />
is atrocious, human beings should not be used as hostages<br />
like this and they should all be released. It is<br />
distasteful in one sense that there is some substance being </p>
<p>given, some stature to this dictator by people going and<br />
negotiating with him for the release of one or two when the<br />
great majority stay there.<br />
WENDT: Mr Hawke, we'll have to leave it there. Thanks for<br />
your time.<br />
PM: Thanks very much, Jana.<br />
ends </p>
