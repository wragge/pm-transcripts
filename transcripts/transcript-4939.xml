13 JANUARY 1979 F79/ q<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS AT CASTERTON RODEO<br />
Mr. Chairman, my colleague Digby Crazier and Mrs. Crozier,<br />
Shire President and Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
It certainly is a wonderful day to be having the State<br />
Rodeo Championships in Casterton. I think it is a great<br />
attraction for Casterton and surrounding districts.<br />
A great deal of credit must go to APEX and all those who<br />
have worked for APEX over the last five or six years<br />
when they originally began the Casterton Rodeo, now ending<br />
up as being the State Championships here.<br />
It will put Casterton on the map as a rodeo centre and<br />
I think that is a good thing.<br />
There is quite obviously a very great effort gone into<br />
organising the Championships and again all credit to<br />
APEX and everyone who is involved in doing that.<br />
I would like to congratulate the Casterton APEX Club.<br />
I t%-hink those of us who live in country areas know very<br />
well that the local service organisations of many<br />
different kinds, of which APEX is one of the leaders,<br />
adds greatly to the quality of life in their own community.<br />
So again, our thanks to APEX on this occasion.<br />
Today is a rare opportunity for politicians, because<br />
Digby and I are going to be able to sit comfortably, or<br />
at least I hope we are, while we can look all about and<br />
watch other people losing their seats.<br />
I would like to welcome riders from all States and from<br />
New Zealand. Many of them will be at the World Rodeo<br />
Championships in Sydney later this year. I think that is<br />
fitting at a time when Australia's great rural industries<br />
are starting to look forward to the future with more<br />
confidence they have had for many years.<br />
Spectators are going to be able to enjoy skilled<br />
horsemanship today and this afternoon. These skills have<br />
been developed because of Australia's great founding rural<br />
industries. What happens here today is very much part of<br />
Australia and it is going to endure for a long while.<br />
Apart from recognising the skills of riders, I think it<br />
would be a mistake not to make a mention of their mounts.<br />
From horses such as these, that people see here today,<br />
Australia's own horse the Australian Stock Horse, has<br />
developed. This is a natural evolution I believe. It is<br />
a horse bred often to meet the harsh climates of<br />
Australia and of outback Australia. Originally called<br />
the Whalers the first came from New South Wales and they<br />
served Australia in peace and in war but there are now<br />
40,000 registered stock horses in Australia and it is<br />
under plan to publish the first Australian stock horse stud<br />
book in about October, 1980. I think all of those who / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
are involved in that particular movement in championing<br />
the Australian stock horse also deserve a great deal of<br />
credit. I think want we all want to see are some good events.<br />
So again, I would like to thank all of those who have<br />
been organising this afternoon and I have very great<br />
pleasure in declaring these State Championships officially<br />
open and I wish all the riders the best of good fortune. </p>
