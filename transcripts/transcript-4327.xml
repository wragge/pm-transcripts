ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The Government enters 1977 strongly determined to break' the<br />
back of inflation and determined to reduce unemployment..<br />
Our fight against. inflation is in reality a fight against<br />
unemployment. Inflation must be conquered and the real<br />
productive areas in the community given the opportunity and<br />
confidence to expand before Australia sees a lasting and<br />
sustained reduction in the numbers of those seeking work.<br />
If we do not beat inflation irrespective of any temporary<br />
action we might take in " make work" schemes Australia will<br />
continue with a deep-seated unemployment problem.<br />
Today, our country has too many people in dole queues, too<br />
many people unable to find jobs.. This situation has not<br />
occurred overnight. It hasbeen an escalating problem in<br />
* Aus': ralia since the Labor Government took office in December<br />
1972. At that time unemployment was around 137,000 or 2.4%<br />
of : he workforce. Inflation had been running for 10 years<br />
gs measured by the CPI at an annual rate of Three<br />
years later, when Labor were voted out, unemployment was<br />
around 329,000 or 5.4% of the workforce. Inflation had<br />
lepl-to more than 16% in Labor's last year..<br />
What caused this dramatic increase in unemployment and<br />
inflation? Three sets of official figures provide a telling<br />
answer. When Labor came to office, the budget deficit<br />
that is, the difference between what a Government receives<br />
in taxes and what it spends on services like pensions, roads,<br />
etc. was $ 774 million. When it left office, the deficit<br />
was rapidly-heading: for a staggering, and unprec. edented<br />
$ 4,300 million. Also, during the three Labor years, average<br />
wages rose by 15.2%, 28% and 12.8% respectively, while Federal<br />
Government expenditure rose by 22.6%, 33.1% and 37.9%.<br />
Australia was living beyond her means. These figures do<br />
not lie. They prove beyond doubt that Australia's high<br />
unemployment is a direct legacy of A. L. P. policies. We are<br />
now paying and suffering because of those policies. </p>
<p>-2<br />
The grim situation we inherited 14 months ago could accurately<br />
be likened to a slippery slide easy to slide further down,<br />
difficult to stop, and even harder to climb back up. There is<br />
no doubt that had the Labor policies of big spending continuedthe<br />
policies they still preach then we would be now further<br />
down the slide, with little or no prospect of recovery. The<br />
Government has made a considerable achievement in holding<br />
unemployment at present levels and stopping further deterioration.<br />
What was Labor's-cure for the problem? They certainly didn't<br />
stop, or even try to stop inflation. In fact, they still don't<br />
mean to stop inflation. They introduced a regional employment.<br />
development ( RED) scheme a temporary make-work scheme. But<br />
costs got out of hand, so they abolished this scheme themselves.<br />
Yet today, they call for its re-introduction. They have nothing<br />
new to offer only tired, old and failed policies.<br />
In contrast, the Liberal/ N. C. P. Government has not deserted the<br />
unemployed. We have moved quickly and creatively to introduce a<br />
number of logically planned manpower policies. We've not just<br />
skimmed the surface of the problem but have taken responsible<br />
short and long term action.<br />
Let me briefly outline some of our measures. We successfully<br />
re-organised the N. E. A. T. scheme When we came to Government,<br />
7,500 were in training under the scheme. Today, almost double<br />
that number are in training under and most of those<br />
are getting in-plant training while engaged in productive employment.<br />
We introduced and later improved a special youth employment training<br />
programme. Basically, it pays $ 59 weekly per person to employers<br />
providing 6 months on-the-job training. Tod~, y. more than 4,000<br />
people are being trained under the programme.<br />
We introduced a widely acclaimed Community Youth Support Scheme.<br />
It encourages special community committees or existing youth<br />
organisations to run counselling and support programmes for<br />
young people out of work.<br />
Last month we announced the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice<br />
Full-Time Training The scheme encourages early<br />
technical training and will help overcome the shortage of<br />
skilled tradesmen-It is estimated that C. R. A. F. T. will boost<br />
the apprentice intake by 12,000 within two years.<br />
Other measures taken by.-the Government include a relocation<br />
assistance scheme, an inquiry into the Commonwealth Employment<br />
Service, and our full support of the National Training Council.<br />
Finally, one of our most important initiatives in this whole area<br />
was the setting up of a long term inquiry into the relationship'<br />
between education and training. This will review possible<br />
developments in the link between the education system and the<br />
changing needs of the labour market and other matters up to the<br />
year 2,000. / Clearly, </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Clearly, the Government has recognised the plight of the<br />
uneinployed. We've done more than talk about the problem<br />
we have put words into action. We have acted to relieve<br />
immediate hardship, particularly amongst the young, and we<br />
have looked at the problem on a long term basis.<br />
This Government is committed to providing jobs for all<br />
Australians who want to work. We will only achieve this<br />
goal on a long term and lasting basis by beating<br />
inflation. There is no other way. Our commitment to<br />
beating inflation as we will continue to demonstrate<br />
very clearly is utterly absolute.<br />
