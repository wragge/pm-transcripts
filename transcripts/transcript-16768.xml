    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today, Professor Chris O'Brien was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a great regret of mine that he was not here to receive it.</p>
<p>There can be few people so deserving of this recognition.</p>
<p>Chris was an inspiration.</p>
<p>His contribution to the community was massive, his work unceasing, his dedication to others without limit.</p>
<p>This honour has been bestowed on Chris for his âcontinued service to medicine and to the community through advocacy and fundraising roles for the development of integrated care and clinical research facilities for people with cancer, particularly the establishment of the Lifehouse Centre at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.â</p>
<p>Following Chris' death earlier this year, Lifehouse at RPA has now fittingly been renamed The Chris O'Brien Cancer Centre.</p>
<p>Chris O'Brien was an exceptional Australian, and it was a privilege to be able to commemorate his life and achievements at today's ceremony.</p>
