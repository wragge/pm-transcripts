    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...................</p>
<p>  Well thank you very much Major Watters. To Garth Popple, to Mr Mick Palmer,</p>
<p>   the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, to Mr Hyde, the Commissioner</p>
<p>   of the police service in South Australia, other members of the council,</p>
<p>   ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>  As you know I have a very strong personal interest in and commitment to</p>
<p>   the cause of reducing drug dependence in our community. And the Tough on</p>
<p>   Drugs strategy is designed in different ways to respond to the many challenges</p>
<p>   of the terrible scourge of drug abuse in Australian society.</p>
<p>  I'm often asked what are the most lasting memories I have of places and</p>
<p>   people and events. In the time that I've been Prime Minister, and indeed</p>
<p>   the time that I've been in public life I can honestly say that I had one</p>
<p>   of those experiences just before the formal part of this meeting started</p>
<p>   when I had the opportunity to talk directly to the residents of this facility</p>
<p>   here, for them to tell me the change that being here had meant to them and</p>
<p>   the way in which it had given them a sense of hope about the future and</p>
<p>   a capacity to control their lives.</p>
<p>  And it did make a great impression on me. Here are ordinary men and women,</p>
<p>   just as easily your sons and daughters, and my sons and daughters as anybody</p>
<p>   else's sons and daughters. Many of them had been addicted for a long time.</p>
<p>   They'd all been through very difficult experiences. What was very encouraging</p>
<p>   to me and very uplifting was they talked about their experiences very freely</p>
<p>   and openly. Perhaps they recognised my face but none of them had met me</p>
<p>   before. And I thought, gee, if you could have facilities like this all around</p>
<p>   Australia it would be of enormous help. And a facility like this expresses</p>
<p>   in a way the best possible community response. It's saying to the people</p>
<p>   who've got a problem you've got to help yourself. You can't expect somebody</p>
<p>   else to solve your problem. On the other hand we are willing to provide</p>
<p>   you with a facility to try and help you and to try and put your life together</p>
<p>   and re-enter the community and play a very constructive role.</p>
<p>  I guess if there's one thing about the whole debate on drugs that annoys</p>
<p>   me more than anything else it is the obsessive preoccupation of sections</p>
<p>   of the media on those issues where there's some disagreement about how to</p>
<p>   tackle the problem. There's always going to be debate in a democratic society</p>
<p>   about whether you have this or that approach. Can I say to you that as to</p>
<p>   about 90 to 95% of the whole debate everybody agrees. I mean everybody agrees</p>
<p>   that we have to adequately resource our police in order to try and catch</p>
<p>   the drug pushers and make sure they go to gaol for a very long period of</p>
<p>   time and nobody has any argument about that. I haven't heard one person</p>
<p>   say you've got to go easy on drug pushers or drug barons. Everybody knows</p>
<p>   that. And we are putting more resources</p>
<p>  into that effort.</p>
<p>  And let me praise the efforts of the police around Australia. It's not an</p>
<p>   easy job. They're at the sharp end both of the criminal activity and also</p>
<p>   sadly of the death and personal misery that comes about as the result of</p>
<p>   drug abuse. Of course you've got to do that.</p>
<p>  And of course you've got to educate young people about the dangers of drug</p>
<p>   taking. You've got to encourage young people not to start taking drugs.</p>
<p>   You've got to encourage young people at the very beginning about how dangerous</p>
<p>   it is to even experiment with drugs. There's a lot of peer group pressure</p>
<p>   for them to do otherwise but you've got to put resources into that. And</p>
<p>   you also have got to have resources to help people when they want to kick</p>
<p>   their drug habit and that in a sense is the third arm of the approach. You've</p>
<p>   got law enforcement, you've got education and you've got helping people</p>
<p>   who've got a problem. And those three things underpin our Tough on Drugs</p>
<p>   approach, and we've allocated about $500 million to that program during</p>
<p>   the last couple of years. And it does represent a huge investment by the</p>
<p>   Federal Government in the campaign against drugs.</p>
<p>But I'm delighted to be able to announce today that we have reached agreement</p>
<p>   with State governments for a national approach based on the concept of diversion.</p>
<p>   And what the concept of diversion very simply says is that if you are caught</p>
<p>   on a minor possession offence, or you're a first offender, what basically</p>
<p>   you are told is look you've got a choice. You can go into the criminal justice</p>
<p>   system. Get caught up with court procedures and the possibility of a penalty,</p>
<p>   fine, and then perhaps ultimately gaol. Now that's one alternative and you</p>
<p>   can go down that path if you want to. The other alternative is that if you're</p>
<p>   prepared to undertake some kind of treatment or rehabilitation course then</p>
<p>   you will spared the rigours of the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>  Now I think that is a policy that has not only wide support in the Australian</p>
<p>   community, but it's a policy that makes an enormous amount of sense. And</p>
<p>   it's a policy that in a way encapsulates the principle that I often ennunciate</p>
<p>   on behalf of the Government, and that is the principle of mutual obligation.</p>
<p>   And that is that if people need some help and deserve help than we have</p>
<p>   a moral obligation as a decent community to offer them that help. But they've</p>
<p>   got to something in return if they're able to do so, and what we're saying</p>
<p>   to people is you've got a drug problem we'll provide you with rehabilitation</p>
<p>   and treatment facilities. But you've got to be willing to undertake that</p>
<p>   treatment and the alternative is if you don't you run the risk of being</p>
<p>   caught up in the criminal justice system. Now I think that is a good, fair</p>
<p>   Australian principle. I think it's a commonsense Australian principle and</p>
<p>   I think every Australian I've confronted with that and explained it in that</p>
<p>   way they've said yes that is a very intelligent way of handling it.</p>
<p>  Now what I'm really announcing today is that we have reached a framework</p>
<p>   agreement with all of the States and I've had great cooperation across the</p>
<p>   political divide. This is not a party political issue. I will sit down and</p>
<p>   sign an agreement and negotiate an understanding with a Labor Premier of</p>
<p>   New South Wales or Queensland or Victoria, as readily as I will with a Liberal</p>
<p>   Premier of South Australia or Western Australia. This is an issue that must</p>
<p>   be free of party politics and I'm happy to work with ministers and premiers</p>
<p>   of any political complexion. And I know that Mr Carr for example here in</p>
<p>   New South Wales, and Mr Beattie of Queensland share just about all of the</p>
<p>   views. We might have some differences of emphasis in a few areas but on</p>
<p>   most of the issues our views are very similar, because as human beings we're</p>
<p>   distressed at the human misery that's involved. We know people who have</p>
<p>   lost loved ones. None of us in public life can ever forget the experience</p>
<p>   of sitting down with a parent and going through the details of the loss</p>
<p>   and deprivation they suffer when they lose a child to a drug overdose or</p>
<p>   some other event that is influenced by drug abuse.</p>
<p>  So I am delighted to announce today that we have reached that framework</p>
<p>   agreement. We've already had a very detailed proposal put to us by New South</p>
<p>   Wales and I expect to conclude an agreement on the detailed operation of</p>
<p>   the scheme with the New South Wales Government very very shortly. Now this</p>
<p>   is something that pleases me no end because it is the next stage of the</p>
<p>   agreement that I reached when all of us met in Canberra in April. And we</p>
<p>   announced a further commitment of money in cooperation with the states.</p>
<p>   We, of course, will provide the money for the diversionary programme, they</p>
<p>   will provide the supporting facilities, that is the police services, and</p>
<p>   many of the rehabilitation facilities the states have an involvement in.</p>
<p>   But it is a very comprehensive approach and the important thing that I am</p>
<p>   announcing today is that we have been able to set aside political differences,</p>
<p>   we have been able to reach an overall framework agreement. And over the</p>
<p>   next few months we will sign individual agreements with the different states</p>
<p>   and the process will then begin.</p>
<p>  It will open up another new approach, I am not saying that this is going</p>
<p>   to solve the problem. The last thing anybody in a position of responsibility</p>
<p>   on the drug issue should ever do is ever dream of declaring victory. But</p>
<p>   the other thing you should ever do is ever dream of admitting defeat. It</p>
<p>   is tremendously important that we persevere. I have learnt in life the most</p>
<p>   important capacity that any nation, or any group of people can have is perseverance</p>
<p>   because you are always in dealing with a difficult problem, you are always</p>
<p>   going to go through moments of absolute exasperation and desperation. I</p>
<p>   would make this same appeal to the media, please by all means report things</p>
<p>   objectively as you see fit, but also understand that there are some wonderfully</p>
<p>   successful stories in the fight against drugs. And it is important that</p>
<p>   those stories be reported as well as the stories and the pictures of death</p>
<p>   and addiction and the impression being created that all is hopeless and</p>
<p>   nothing can be done and everybody's given up the fight.</p>
<p>  Wherever I go in Australia, I don't find the police have given up the fight,</p>
<p>   I don't find that people in the great volunteer organisations have given</p>
<p>   up the fight, I don't find that parents who have lost children through drugs</p>
<p>   have given up the fight, in fact they are wanting to give something back</p>
<p>   and perhaps prevent the heartache that they have experienced from being</p>
<p>   experienced by other Australian parents.</p>
<p>  So ladies and gentleman, I do feel a deep personal commitment to this issue.</p>
<p>   There is nothing that horrifies me more as a parent or as an Australian,</p>
<p>   let alone as Prime Minister, than the notion and the concept that drug addiction</p>
<p>   in this country can get out of control. And the experience, half an hour</p>
<p>   ago, of talking to some young men and women who've had a problem and are</p>
<p>   now seeing a way out of it, who have found a vehicle to do so and to hear</p>
<p>   them talk optimistically about what they are going to do with their lives,</p>
<p>   that is about as rewarding as it can get, as far as I am concerned, in this</p>
<p>   position. That is far more important to me than the latest implicit price</p>
<p>   deflator or whatever description that you want to give to some kind of economic</p>
<p>   statistic. But of course, the stronger our economy is the greater capacity</p>
<p>   we have to assist those areas of our community that need help.</p>
<p>  I often talk about the notion of a social coalition. A social coalition</p>
<p>   is a word I, or a description I use to outline a reality, that is that when</p>
<p>   we have got a problem, the Government can't do everything to solve it, although</p>
<p>   it can do a lot, because the government is in command of the nation's resources</p>
<p>   and can divert them in a special direction. Individuals acting alone can't</p>
<p>   solve the problem either, although they have to realise that they have got</p>
<p>   a problem, to begin to find a solution. The business community is often</p>
<p>   willing to help, it can have resources but perhaps not the expertise. And</p>
<p>   the great welfare organisations, and many of them are represented here today,</p>
<p>   the large, like the Salvation Army, the smaller, such as We Help Ourselves,</p>
<p>   all of them playing a magnificent role.</p>
<p>  But none of those groups acting alone can do it. But if they work together,</p>
<p>   if they pool their resources, if you bring about a social coalition, and</p>
<p>   this is a social coalition, you have got the Government, you've got the</p>
<p>   community organisations, you've got the individual commitment and you have</p>
<p>   also got the sympathy and the help of many in the business community. And</p>
<p>   increasingly I see our country in a particular and a special Australian</p>
<p>   way, solving our problems, tackling our challenges by a coalition of all</p>
<p>   of those elements in society.</p>
<p>  So ladies and gentlemen, I want to declare open, five months after it commenced</p>
<p>   it's magnificent work, but nonetheless officially, this magnificent We Help</p>
<p>   Ourselves Centre, which provides for a methadone to abstinence transition</p>
<p>   programme. If the experiences relayed to me, by the men and women to whom</p>
<p>   I spoke, they in such an optimistic way, and me in listening in an admiring</p>
<p>   way, half an hour ago, if this is a sample of what the social coalition</p>
<p>   can do here in Lidcombe, in Sydney, and I am sure it can be duplicated all</p>
<p>   around Australia. It fills me with an enormous sense of hope.</p>
<p>  And what also fills me with a great sense of hope is that we are making</p>
<p>   progress on the diversion approach. We are offering people what will be</p>
<p>   widely regarded as a realistic choice. We will help you break your drug</p>
<p>   habit, provided you're prepared to undertake the treatment and the rehabilitation.</p>
<p>   But if you are not, you run the risk of being caught up in the criminal</p>
<p>   justice system. I think that is a nice balance, it reminds people of the</p>
<p>   consequences but it does it in a non-threatening and I think realistic way.</p>
<p>  Can I again, can I thank Brian Watters, the Chairman of the Drug Council,</p>
<p>   who is doing a magnificent job as spokesman for the Council. He has got</p>
<p>   a vigorous Council and I acknowledge the presence today of other members</p>
<p>   of the Council. They represent a variety of views from a variety of perspectives.</p>
<p>   It doesn't really matter, what is important is that their collective heart</p>
<p>   is in the right place and they are all heading in the right direction and</p>
<p>   that is to try and fight and reduce and in some parts of the country eliminate</p>
<p>   the scourge of drugs. It is a noble cause, as we come to the end of this</p>
<p>   Century and we look upon the Third Millennium, it's become almost a clich</p>
<p>   to talk about the Millennium atmosphere and what do we hope for the next</p>
<p>   Millennium? I am sure greater progress in fighting the scourge of drugs</p>
<p>   in Australia will be something which would spring readily to mind to most</p>
<p>   of the people in this audience. I congratulate the State governments on</p>
<p>   their cooperation. I thank them for their willingness to work with the Federal</p>
<p>   Government. I thank the Council and most particularly, Garth, I thank you</p>
<p>   for your personal contribution and leadership in this area. I congratulate</p>
<p>   you on such a magnificent facility. I am very impressed with it and I hope</p>
<p>   to see many more around Australia.</p>
