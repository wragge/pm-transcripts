TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA,<br />
26 NOVEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Well you might recall that in my speech on United Nations Day on<br />
24 October on the 50th anniversary of the birth of the United Nations<br />
and the adoption of its charter I said that I didn't believe that the<br />
strategic framework which now exists in the world that first of all it<br />
would persist forever and that the strategic framework had changed<br />
substantially from that which obtained in the Cold War period. And<br />
I believed it was now possible to think about and develop a concrete<br />
program of making the world free of nuclear weapons because I think<br />
that the sort of world which now exists where you have nuclear powers<br />
committed to reducing their arsenals as we have the Russians and<br />
the United States and the unlikelihood of using their weapons<br />
defensively won't continue forever. I think the one thing we can be<br />
sure of is that this position will not obtain forever. There is a view<br />
amongst some of the nuclear powers that they have nuclear weapons<br />
and they will commit themselves to the non-proliferation treaty and not<br />
use them offensively. But this is not a static model. It is not going to<br />
be the half a dozen weapons states and the rest of the countries<br />
without weapons. Unless something is done about this, there will be<br />
many states with nuclear weapons. And now, I think, is the time to<br />
move. Unless we take action now, we won't make the appropriate<br />
steps to begin reducing that 50,000 warhead inventory which is now<br />
laying around the world and unless we address the issues of<br />
proliferation and the threshold states that is those on the edge of<br />
getting nuclear weapons as well as nuclear terrorism the nuclear<br />
competition which characterised much of the last half century will<br />
continue again after this pause. But one thing will be certain, it won't<br />
even have the stability of the bipolarity of the Cold War. It will be a<br />
multi-polar, unstable world where no one is certain what the policy of<br />
deterrence really means and no one would be able to guarantee what<br />
that action will really imply. And I think we are reminded powerfully of<br />
this by the French fourth test in the Pacific and also the claims of </p>
<p>nuclear terrorism in Russia with the Chechen rebels claiming to have<br />
placed nuclear materials and explosives in Moscow. We are just going<br />
to see more and more of this as these materials, the mechanisms, all<br />
of these devices and, of course, intellectual property start moving<br />
around the world. So this Government believes that this is a time to<br />
make a start and that is actually beyond the Comprehensive Test Ban<br />
Treaty to which we will be deeply involved, that is beyond the cut-off<br />
convention, beyond the conventional framework. But, rather, to<br />
actually start hoeing into the problem of the 50,000 warheads because<br />
we won't actually get the whole notion of non-proliferation moving<br />
unless we actually see the warhead numbers coming down and, of<br />
course, part of this will be enjoining the United States and Russia to<br />
move swiftly under their START obligations. Now I announced in my<br />
speech in October that we had decided to set up a Commission<br />
because there has got to be a starting point for all this where do you<br />
begin on this very large task? And you might recall that Australia was<br />
very deeply involved in the Chemical Weapons Convention and<br />
therein we removed one whole category of weapons and, of course,<br />
the verification procedures with chemical weapons are even more<br />
difficult than nuclear weapons. So this is why we have decided to<br />
think about a beginning and the beginning is getting together a group<br />
of recognised specialists on this subject, getting a group of people who<br />
have had experience on this issue and try to come to terms with how<br />
we might begin to actually take the arsenals down. So we have<br />
decided to set up a Commission of eminent individuals who prepare a<br />
group which would try to work through the difficult and complex issues<br />
of how we get to a nuclear weapons free world and how to make<br />
practical recommendations towards it. And I am happy today to<br />
announce the names of the individuals who have agreed to participate<br />
in the Commission. I think they are an outstanding and authoritative<br />
group of thinkers, statesmen, scientists, disarmament experts, military<br />
strategists, people who have lived with and in the Cold War and who<br />
have a wide experience of international security and disarmament<br />
issues. They include: Mr Michel Rocard, the former Prime Minister of<br />
France; Mr Robert McNamara, the former United States Secretary of<br />
Defense; Professor Joseph Rotblat, the winner of the 1995 Nobel<br />
Prize for Peace and founder of the Pugwash Conference; Field<br />
Marshal the Lord Carver, the former Chief of the British Defence Staff;<br />
the distinguished Australian analyst, Professor Robert ONeill, from<br />
Oxford University; Dr Maj-Britt Theorin, who is a Member of the<br />
European Parliament and former President of the International Peace<br />
Bureau; Ambassador Rolf Ekeus, who is Executive Chairman of<br />
UNSCOM which has worked to eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass<br />
destruction; Professor Roald Sagdeev, the Science Adviser to former<br />
President Gorbachev; and, General Lee Butler, who was formerly the<br />
head of the United States Strategic Air Command. Other members<br />
Ambassador Celso Amorim, from Brazil; Ambassador Jayantha<br />
Dhanapala, from Sri Lanka; Ambassador Dr Nabil Elaraby, from Egypt;<br />
Professor Ryukichi Imai, from Japan; and, Datuk Dr Ronald McCoy,<br />
from Malaysia have a distinguished record of achievement in arms </p>
<p>control and international diplomacy. The convenor of the group will be<br />
Mr Richard Butler, who is Australia's Permanent Representative to the<br />
United Nations and many, of course, know him and remember him as<br />
our Ambassador for Disarmament from 1983 to 1988. 1 don't think we<br />
could have hoped for a more impressive and distinguished group and<br />
I am very grateful to all of them for agreeing to participate. That they<br />
have done so despite their busy schedules, I think is a reflection of the<br />
seriousness with which they regard the issues in the Commission<br />
which we will address. I think they bring a wide range of expertise, the<br />
experience and views to the task and while they won't be representing<br />
Governments, they include people from nuclear and non-nuclear<br />
powers and from a range of regions. So I am very confident that the<br />
Commission's report will make a substantive and serious contribution<br />
to the question of how we can rid the world of the threat of nuclear<br />
weapons. I might add that the first meeting of the Commission will be<br />
in Australia in January and we envisage two or three other meetings,<br />
some of which will be overseas. Its final report will be submitted to the<br />
1996 session of the United Nations General Assembly and to the<br />
Committee on Disarmament. Could I record here my gratitude to the<br />
Foreign Minister, Gareth Evans, for his assistance in putting this group<br />
together. The Commission will be supported by a Secretariat drawn<br />
from the Arms Control and Disarmament area of the Department of<br />
Foreign Affairs and Trade, which you might know has got a very high<br />
international reputation and, of course, we will be liaising with<br />
Government and non-Government organisations as the work of the<br />
group progresses. So, in all, this is I hope the kind of beginning that,<br />
certainly in my generation, we could have only dreamt about through<br />
the Cold War years. And going beyond the actual commitments by the<br />
United States and by Russia, under their START obligations, to take<br />
this opportunity while we do have this strategic pause and to see if we<br />
can't stop the spread and proliferation of nuclear weapons and to<br />
make that believable and to make it stick we really have to start pulling<br />
the stockpiles down and Australia is a non-nuclear power but with<br />
reasonable credentials in disarmament. I mean as a medium-sized<br />
country we have, I think, fought beyond our weight in disarmament<br />
issues over the years and, I think, we can bring to the line again the<br />
sort of vitality and integrity which we have brought to the<br />
Chemical Weapons Convention and do something positive here.<br />
J: Given the recent behaviour of the French though, Prime Minister, at<br />
the end of the day can you see a country like France agreeing with any<br />
recommendations to start pulling the stockpiles apart?<br />
PM: Well I think the answer to that is yes for the obvious reasons. I mean<br />
you had former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing saying the greatest<br />
threat against France is really from the proliferators of nuclear<br />
weapons, from the states which now no longer have them or from<br />
terrorism. And having a nuclear stockpile is not going to deal with that.<br />
Now, you know, there is a clear understanding on this. Where there<br />
isn't a clear understanding amongst the nuclear powers, I believe, is </p>
<p>that they see some sort of static model that there are so many of them<br />
and that is all there will be. Of course this is just, in the end, not true.<br />
What will happen is that other states will gather nuclear weapons and<br />
there is no moral reason why one state should claim the right to have<br />
them say Britain or France on the basis they say that they are<br />
democracies, or the United States, but other countries who say they<br />
shouldn't have them because they are not a democratic state,<br />
for instance. I mean there is no criteria for the possession of nuclear<br />
weapons and so they will continue to proliferate.<br />
J: You put the argument about the possibility of proliferation of weapons<br />
amongst smaller states at CHOGM and it didn't really seem to me to<br />
get a lot of agreement from British Prime Minister Major. Do you think<br />
that he will come to see your point of view and why?<br />
PM: Well I think it is just not our point of view, it will be in the end an<br />
international point of view. What we are seeking to do is to draw the<br />
threads together on the argument from people who have been involved<br />
with it and around it over a long period of time. And then produce this<br />
report to the United Nations and it will then be, in a sense, a wider<br />
body and certainly not just Australia sort of putting that view and I think<br />
anybody who then takes the view, well it is a static situation and there<br />
won't be anymore nuclear weapons than there currently are has a very<br />
naive view of the world.<br />
J: What has been the international response so far to this initiative?<br />
PM: Well I think the international response is the acceptances. I mean that<br />
is the best guide to the international response.<br />
J: Wouldn't there still be a danger of nuclear warfare even if you got rid<br />
of all of the weapons given that many of these western countries<br />
actually have the technology to rebuild them quickly in a time of<br />
conflict?<br />
PM: Yes, that is going to be there. But I just don't think that the impetus to<br />
non-proliferation is going to be as successful if the world takes the<br />
view that we will keep the absurd 50,000 stockpile. In other words, are<br />
you to be believed by these states when you say there shouldn't be<br />
any further proliferation, but we will hang on to this absurd stockpile<br />
with all of the attendant risks that that brings. Now no doubt, one of<br />
the major issues in this discussion will be where the deterrent policy<br />
goes as the stockpile comes down. But, as you know, you still have an<br />
effective set of deterrents with 200 weapons, let alone 50,000.<br />
J: Have you spoken directly to any of the participants in the group to<br />
encourage their involvement?<br />
PM: I have. I spoke to a number. But, by and large, what has happened<br />
here is the Foreign Minister and I have talked about the nature of the </p>
<p>group, some of the potential candidates and tried to, you know, get<br />
down to a choice of people who we think can reflect all of the various<br />
views strategic; political; that come to it with a scientific background;<br />
a moral, philosophical background; a technical background;<br />
experience in disarmament and we have narrowed it down to a<br />
choice of people and between us we have spoken to them.<br />
The Foreign Minister has spoken to most of them.<br />
J: Will there be a Canberra-based secretariat to support this and will we<br />
be financing that?<br />
PM: Yes, it will be supported by the group who have traditionally, in the<br />
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, focussed on this issue and<br />
we will be carrying the cost of it.<br />
J: At the end of the day, what do you expect this group to produce? Is it<br />
a report that will simply be a focus for discussion, or will it contain<br />
within it concrete recommendations for further pragmatic steps?<br />
PM: Well if the United Nations itself were to commission such a study, it<br />
would probably go to if not the same people similar people.<br />
But then, of course, to get such a study going would require, you know,<br />
the general political difficulties that are required to be encountered by<br />
the United Nations in any such initiative. In a sense, we have by<br />
taking our initiative we can take this initiative in a unilateral sense<br />
and then present this report to the United Nations and to the<br />
Conference on Disarmament.<br />
J: Mr Keating, just on another matter. This final week of Parliament, how<br />
crucial is that in terms of setting the scene for next year's election?<br />
PM: Not very crucial I don't think. I think, you know, people in this country<br />
will decide what they want to do, who they want to govern them on<br />
what the parties have done, how credible they are, how effective they<br />
are and how effectively they are led.<br />
J: On the forest debate in Cabinet tomorrow, it seems that the<br />
environment movement isn't happy with the process that has been set<br />
up and that the outcomes under that process are not going to satisfy<br />
them. Does that concern you in the lead up to an election?<br />
PM: Well let's wait and see how we go at it first.<br />
J: Mr Keating, on Meet the Press Peter Reith has said today that the<br />
Coalition will not guarantee necessarily equal pay for equal work?<br />
PM: Well that is the issue. You see, in that sense, nothing in the CRA<br />
dispute changed the Coalition's position. They don't believe in equal<br />
pay for equal work. They won't ever have the no disadvantage test for<br />
enterprise bargaining that the Government has. In short, they are </p>
<p>committed to cutting the wages of working Australians. That is their<br />
business, it has always been their business, it will remain their<br />
business and what you will see is, as Mr Reith refused to give the<br />
commitment on the no disadvantage test on ABC Radio about three or<br />
four weeks ago you have seen him today refuse to give the same<br />
commitment on equal pay for equal work. You have got Mr Howard<br />
slipping and sliding on the Commission saying he will keep it. Yet he<br />
said he will " stab it in the stomach", to use his own words and then he<br />
tried to get out of that by saying the Government was in fact talking<br />
about coming at it from the rear or something. In fact, he was just<br />
asked directly, if I remember it, " so you are going to abolish it?".<br />
" As I have said before, we will stab it in the stomach." I mean,<br />
basically, they have been opposed to the Commission being in the<br />
system and it is the Commission which guaranteed the equal work for<br />
equal pay. The Commission would go. But whether the Commission<br />
went or not, they don't believe in the principle of equal work for equal<br />
pay.<br />
J: Mr Howard says that prospective buyers of the Sydney Airport aren't<br />
worried by [ inaudible]?<br />
PM: I mean on what basis did he make that claim. I mean it is just<br />
nonsense. But I noticed he did say, it was not just about my seat.<br />
So he has admitted that the view from the Headland of Bennelong has<br />
been completely central to this process for him and I noticed that some<br />
reporting of the Senate Committee, of course which was chaired by the<br />
Coalition, and the report didn't make reference to the fact that,<br />
of course, Sydney Airport's capacity would be cut by about<br />
per cent. I mean what Mr Howard has done here is just for the most<br />
base political motives, saving his own skin and his own seat, he has<br />
decided not only to press his view about opening up the cross-wind<br />
runway at Sydney and dramatically reduce Sydney's capacity.<br />
But, in doing it, actually do something which knocks around the<br />
budget, delays the process and, more than that, I think calls into the<br />
question the efficiency of Sydney as the hub for airline operations in<br />
Australia and particularly as we approach the Olympics.<br />
J: Mr Keating have you spoken to Bill Kelty since you returned home?<br />
PM: Well, Russell, I have got no intention at these press conferences of<br />
telling you who I have spoken to in the last day or two, or week or two.<br />
I speak to Bill Kelty quite often. But, you know, you can put your<br />
glasses down on asking me questions about that. I will tell you one<br />
thing I would like to say, though. I noticed that John Howard, today,<br />
made very clear that he would basically walk away from the<br />
Government's 25 per cent commitment to the aged pension,<br />
per cent of average weekly earnings relativity to the aged pension.<br />
He was asked repeatedly and all he would say is that he would go for<br />
the indexation and you might have seen a press release by my<br />
colleague, Peter Baldwin, today and he said the fact is that Labor has </p>
<p>increased pensions by 14 per cent in real terms when measured<br />
against the Consumer Price Index. Mr Howard says he will only<br />
maintain pensions in line with the Consumer Price Index. If this is all<br />
we had done, then single pensions would now be $ 20 a week worse<br />
off and couples would be about $ 30 a week worse off. And even this<br />
promise is suspect given that pensions fell by 2 per cent in real terms<br />
during Mr Howard's tenure as Treasurer. So he was pressed a<br />
number of times and he wouldn't give the commitment. He finally said,<br />
weakly, " well that is the Government's policy". Yes, that is this<br />
Government's policy, but that made no reference to what any<br />
Government he might lead, to its policies. In other words, he has<br />
effectively refused not effectively, blatantly refused to say that he<br />
would maintain the aged pension at 25 per cent of average weekly<br />
earnings.<br />
J Mr Keating, on another contentious privatisation the Government<br />
has got a week to resolve the sale of ANL. Do you hold out much<br />
hope of the MUA [ inaudible]?<br />
PM: Well I have got to go through those issues. I have been out of them<br />
for a couple of weeks being abroad unfortunately. But I will get back to<br />
it this week. Can I just say on a couple of other points, Mr Howard<br />
said he wouldn't be dismantling Medicare. He said precisely that.<br />
He said " we will effectively dismantle Medicare". He said this when he<br />
was Leader of the Opposition heading for an election. He has made<br />
similar references in the run up to the 1993 election. They have<br />
opposed Medicare always and when John Howard says he will keep<br />
Medicare, he is just simply not to be believed. It is just, basically, a<br />
political lie. He will tear Medicare apart and junk it at the first<br />
opportunity. On the cross-media rules he was asked a question about<br />
Mr Black and he said that " any increase in equity for Mr Black would<br />
need to be considered in the future". But when asked what the criteria<br />
would be to give Mr Black extra equity in the Sydney Morning Herald,<br />
The Age and the Financial Review, he said " he wasn't there to put<br />
Mr Black's case." But it was not there putting Mr Black's case, if he<br />
was the Government it would be the approving authority. He was quite<br />
reasonably asked what would be the criteria for increased equity in the<br />
Sydney Morning herald, The Age and the Financial Review and he<br />
wouldn't say. He is trying to have the best of all worlds. To tell Black<br />
he will give him more, but not tell the public on what basis he will give<br />
him more. And he also, when asked about the cross-media rules,<br />
talked about again, he wouldn't come clean there having voted<br />
against the 15 per cent cross-media rule in the Senate, he wouldn't<br />
come clean other than to say that he believed in Australian ownership<br />
which is code for giving Mr Packer, I am sure, more equity in the<br />
Sydney Morning Herald. So, essentially, what he is telling us is under<br />
a Coalition Government, somebody could own a major television<br />
network and capital city newspaper in the same city. Now I don't know<br />
whether Mr Howard thinks that that sort of slipping and sliding is going<br />
to get him around the real issues. But he was slipping and sliding all </p>
<p>over the place today and making it very clear that he is going to be as<br />
duplicitous and as tricky as he possibly can be.<br />
J: Just to be clear on that, Mr Keating, are you saying that Mr Howard<br />
would approve Mr Packer getting Fairfax?<br />
PM: Well don't take any notice of what I say. Take notice of what he has<br />
done. This week he has voted against the proposition that there be a<br />
per cent upper limit on newspaper proprietors holding interests in<br />
television and vice versa. He has voted against it. So he has made it<br />
very clear where he stands.<br />
J: But that is what you think?<br />
PM: What?<br />
J: You think he would approve of Mr Packer owning Fairfax and the<br />
television station?<br />
PM: Absolutely. I said that earlier in the year and all that happened this<br />
week is that it was borne out.<br />
ends. </p>
