STATEMENT BY THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER, THE HON KIM BEAZLEY MP<br />
ANOTHER EMPTY HOWARDITE HEADLAND<br />
Mr Howard's second headland speech has much in common with his first: namely, an<br />
absence of both originality and detail, a great deal of misinformation and distortion, an<br />
unwillingness to acknowledge or concede any of Australia's remarkable achievements<br />
in the past decade, and the repetition of tired and reactionary themes.<br />
Indeed it is a classic Howardite speech meaning it is one part Old Right, one part<br />
New Right, one part rank opportunism and the other part entirely empty.<br />
The original offerings of a concrete kind consist of three committees. This is another<br />
characteristic of Howardism: If the question is an Australian Head of State, have a<br />
convention; if it's infrastructure, form a committee; if it's productivity, have a<br />
commission. The golden rule for John Howard is under no circumstances commit<br />
yourself to a position. Do not let them know what John Howard thinks, or what John<br />
Howard would do form a committee.<br />
Distortion and misinformation thread their way-throughout the speech. For instance:<br />
The " unemployment rate has trended upwards under Labor". Untrue. In 1983<br />
aggregate unemployment was 10 per cent. It is now 8.3 per cent.<br />
" Our labour market institutions have proven incapable of making -the<br />
necessary adjustments in response to the pressures of structural change<br />
Untrue. Leaving aside the fact that the structural change was made by a<br />
Labor Government, labour market productivity has increased dramatically since<br />
1980, and this has substantially underwritten the 20 per cent increase in real<br />
household disposable income per capita since the early eighties.<br />
" Labor's promised [ unfair dismissal] amendments" are " all talk Untrue. In<br />
fact the amendments, which have been uniformly applauded by the business<br />
community, were introduced into the Parliament on 29 June. </p>
<p>These untruths are compounded by other examples of monumental disingenuousness<br />
and dishonesty. Mr Howard complains that real wages have faen: yet Mr Howard has<br />
opposed virtually every wage rise since 1983 and if his social policies had ever<br />
been implemented the income disparities he now complains about would be<br />
infinitely worse. In fact, because of the Labor Government's policies, income<br />
disparity in Australia is far less acute than it is in those countries whose<br />
economidc models Mr Howard admires.<br />
Mr Howard also deliberately ignores the fact that wage restraint through the<br />
Accord has contained inflation and encouraged rapid employment growth. He<br />
makes no mention of the fact that the fall in the unemployment rate in Australia<br />
in 1994 was the largest in the OECD; or that job growth in Australia continues<br />
to be outstanding.<br />
Mr Howard has tried to change his spots but they reappear whenever he talks about<br />
industrial relations.<br />
He says " If workes want to stay in an award they can. This is Jobsback with<br />
a new deceit built in. Mr Howard must know how the labour market works;<br />
he must know that every year about 1.6 million Australian workers get a new<br />
employer, meaning every two years up to 35 per cent of the workforce will not<br />
have a choice between the existing award and a contract that suits the<br />
employer.<br />
He says " Alli workplace agreements will be subject to guaranteed minimum<br />
conditions. But Mr Howard's minimum conditions do not include guarantees<br />
of overtime rates, shift allowances or holiday loadings, and will abolish the<br />
" no disadvantage" test which currently protects workers making new<br />
agreements. When Mr Howard says that award conditions will remain he does<br />
not say how they will be maintained in real terms and without penalty rates<br />
those real terms could be cut by 10-15 per cent.<br />
All this adds up to very bad news for those Australians Mr Howard has recently<br />
discovered and called " battlers".<br />
Mr Howard has also discovered New Zealand. He seems to want to import its<br />
economic system as a model. It is not clear why he thinks New Zealand's example is<br />
one we should folow unless it is because in New Zealand much less weight has been<br />
given to the social results of economic policy or because the labour contract system<br />
there approximates to the one he has in mind for Australia, or simply because he<br />
cannot find enough fault with Australia without resorting to unlikely comparisons.<br />
Mr Howard ought to say very clearly what essential elements of the New Zealand<br />
economy he wishes to import to Australia. The New Zealand labour contract system?<br />
The New Zealand social safety net? The New Zealand GST? </p>
<p>3<br />
Mr Howard says in various ways throughout his speech that he is for growth, low<br />
inflation, higher productivity and competitiveness. We have to ask has he been<br />
outside lately? We have economic growth and labour market growth. We have low<br />
inflation. Labour productivity has grown by at least 25 per cent since the early<br />
eighties. We are about 40 per cent more competitive.<br />
Mr Howard's second " headland" speech is much the same confection of dishonesty and<br />
distortion as his first. And to think that he is threatening to make more of them!<br />
