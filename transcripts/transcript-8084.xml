PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 15 AUGUST 1990<br />
The National Road Trauma Advisory Council will meet for the<br />
first time later this year following Government agreement on<br />
detailed arrangements. The Council is a bipartisan initiative<br />
based on a proposal made last year by the Australian Medical<br />
Association, and in particular Sir Dennis Paterson, Head of<br />
Orthopaedic Surgery at Adelaide Children's Hospital.<br />
The Council will allow health professionals and other<br />
community groups to have a direct input into the process for<br />
establishing and reviewing road and vehicle safety standards<br />
and related issues, on a national basis. The advice of the<br />
Council will be invaluable in saving lives on our roads and in<br />
reducing the toll, both in a personal sense and in health and<br />
social security resources, of serious injury.<br />
The main functions of the Council will be to:<br />
assess the major national causes of road trauma in<br />
Australia; advise Governments on policies to reduce road trauma<br />
levels; identify areas of research into road safety<br />
issues; and<br />
identify national solutions to the road trauma<br />
level.<br />
The Australian Medical Association's involvement, and the work<br />
of its officials, has resulted in a rare level of State and<br />
Territory agreement on the establishment of the Council. It<br />
is my Government's hope that this will extend to national<br />
agreement to advice which the Council will provide on road<br />
safety. The Council will liaise closely with relevant Commonwealth,<br />
State and Territory bodies in its work of targeting road<br />
safety and health efforts to areas where maximum reductions<br />
can be made in road fatalities and serious injuries.<br />
It will comprise a maximum of seven members with experience in<br />
the fields of road safety and health. It will report annually<br />
to me and to the Premiers and its reports will be tabled in<br />
Parliament. The Director of the Federal Office of Road Safety<br />
will be the Executive Director of the Council and the<br />
Department of Community Services and Health will be<br />
represented at meetings.<br />
Appointments to the Council will be announced shortly. </p>
