<p>Gas manufacturer and supplier BOC Limited will use almost $10 million in carbon price revenue to upgrade its Kwinana site in Western Australia with a modern air gas liquefaction plant.</p>
<p>The upgrade will cut the carbon emissions intensity of BOC Limited's production process by up to 54 per cent and help reduce energy costs by up to $3.5 million per year.</p>
<p>The upgrade is also a significant project for the Kwinana region and will support the local economy and local jobs.</p>
<p>The $9.9 million funding grant will be delivered under the Gillard Labor Government's Clean Technology Investment Program.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government has been working with manufacturers across Australia to reduce energy costs and improve competitiveness.</p>
<p>BOC is an example of this partnership. The company is investing in its future and showing how manufacturers can cut energy costs, reduce emissions and improve productivity.</p>
<p>In addition to the Gillard Labor Government's contribution, BOC will invest almost $25 million in the air gas liquefaction plant.</p>
<p>This grant will replace BOC's existing air separation unit and nitrogen liquefier unit with a state-of-the-art gas liquefaction plant.</p>
<p>The $800 million Clean Technology Investment Program and the $200 million Clean Technology Food and Foundries Investment Program are providing grants to assist manufacturers to invest in energy efficient capital equipment and low emissions technologies, processes and products.</p>
<p>The $200 million Clean Technology Innovation Program is providing grants to businesses to develop new clean technologies. All three programs are funded by carbon price revenue and are open for applications.</p>
