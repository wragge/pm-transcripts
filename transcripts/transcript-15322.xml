<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Climate change is a major issue facing both Australia and the world.</p>
<p>It is an issue that must be tackled in a measured and practical way.</p>
<p>While Australia contributes very little to global emissions we have a responsibility to tackle the problem none-the-less.</p>
<p>Talkfests, debates and purely symbolic gestures won't remove a gram of greenhouse gas from the atmosphere. My Government is investing in tangible projects that will deliver major cuts to Australia's emissions. </p>
<p>The Government has announced seed-funding for more than $3 billion worth of projects that will help significantly cut the amount of climate-changing carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere.</p>
<p>These include a $750 million clean coal power station in Victoria's La Trobe Valley, an $841 million carbon burying project in Western Australia, the world's largest solar power station near Mildura and a $445 million methane-based power plant in Queensland. </p>
<p>We have also announced other practical measures like the phasing out of incandescent light bulbs for more energy efficient globes. Australia was the first country to do this and is now being followed by many others around the world.</p>
<p>These are all practical and sensible measures to deal with the problem of climate change, not dangerous knee-jerk responses to the issue which could damage our economy, reduce our competitive advantage and, most importantly, cost jobs. </p>
