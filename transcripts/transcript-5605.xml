PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIATUESDAY, 16 JUNE, 1981<br />
SIR THOMAS PLAYFORD I<br />
I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of Sir Thomas Playford.<br />
He was one of South Australia's greatest sons.<br />
His term of office as Premier of South Australia for 26 years,<br />
from 1938 to 1965, stands as testimony to his greatness.<br />
No Australian Premier nor for that matter any Australian<br />
political leader has served a longer term in office.<br />
Sir Thomas Playford grandson of a former Premier of the<br />
same hame led South Australia from its dependence upon<br />
rural industry to its emergence as an industrially-based<br />
State. His vision, foresight, and commitment to Liberal principleswereresponsible<br />
for an outstanding period of growth.<br />
I offer my deepest sympathy to his family'.<br />
