EXTRACT FROM AN ADDRESS AT<br />
THE GREEK
The attitude of the Australian Labor Party to Australi~ Al<br />
domestic and international challenges has no relc-vance for<br />
Avstralia in the 80s. The policy statem~ ent of the Lealder<br />

extravagance and waste i~ n the<br />
Then, deficient pplicies and defective~ economic ianagement<br />
by the ALP cost Australia dearly. The spending promisas<br />
outl-l-n-eby MY-" yen latt-ight are just the tip of the<br />
Labor iceberg. Nothing was said about the hundrads of<br />
uncosted Labor program~ mes which~ f4r Hayden has proriised to<br />
force upon tile AUStralian electorate. And of thoSe promises<br />
announced, tile costings were decceptive.<br />
The pol icy statenicnt was significant for wqhat it otmitted to<br />
say, rather thati what it said. It oinitted to say that the<br />
$ 300 million tax cut would cost $ 900 million in a full year.<br />
It omitted to spell out the explicit commitment made m~ any. tires<br />
by the -stratms, tubor-Party to increased anid higjher taxation.<br />
It omitted to say which Australians would suffer frtomn Iaborfs<br />

who would be liable for a weal. th tax undur the Labor Party.<br />
It omitted to say which Australians would be struck with a<br />
capitalgais-tax.--rittd-to say which businesses would<br />
fail and what would be the extent of privato sector urnetplon,,' ent<br />
as a result of the Labor Party's massive and expailded entry into<br />
businesses already handled successfully by the private sector.<br />
Anid) it~ oall-it-t ed--t-indicatc the extent of its massive<br />
spending programmes on inflation, TJhe ALP policy speach ignored<br />
the fact that Lab-or spending would skyrocket inflattion to a<br />
level approaching<br />
The polio ysp a-h did not-rciid Australians that the strategy<br />
of increased governmenrt spending, biggor government. and higher<br />
deficits, has been rejected by : major induntrialised countries<br />
and international authorities.<br />
Continuim4g-hjs po. lcy.. speech.. of omission, the Leader of the<br />
Opposition gave the Australian public no indication of the<br />
extent to which he is a prisoner of the Socialist Left faction<br />
of the AUstralian Labor Party. There was no indication that the<br />
