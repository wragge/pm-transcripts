SOUTH AFRICA AND THE COMMOMW1I J TH<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon, R. G. Menzies<br />
The following is the full text of the Statement<br />
made by the Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, in London, on the<br />
South African situation<br />
" This is a very unhappy day for those who<br />
attach value to the Commonwealth as an association of<br />
0independent nations each managing its own affairs in<br />
its own way, but all co-operating for common purposes.<br />
The criticisms which we all had to make of South African<br />
policies were plainly expressed in the Conference in a<br />
debate which took place with the complete concurrence<br />
of Dr. Verwoerd. The debate was of a frankness and<br />
intimacy which, in my experience, is possible only in a<br />
meeting of Prime Ministers. It is, I think, deplorable<br />
that it can never be conducted in such a forum and<br />
atmosphore again. What the implications for the future<br />
nature of the Commonwealth may be we do not as yet know.<br />
For myself, I an deeply troubled."<br />
