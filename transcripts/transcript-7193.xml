PRIME MWNISTER<br />
For media 2 July, 1967<br />
GAINERS AND LOSERS UND3R THE<br />
LXDZRAL TAX/ FAIIILY PAYMENTS PACKAGES<br />
The attached tables and graphs provide a comparison o2 the<br />
position of various types of families under the Liberal<br />
proposals cc compared with Labor's well targetted family<br />
package. They show:<br />
Labor's proposals benefit the needy, the Liberals the<br />
well oHf allowing for the effects of extra health<br />
costs, the loss of the 1.5 per cent second<br />
tier wage increase and the potential impact<br />
of the promised massive Liberal spending<br />
cuts a single income family ( the Liberals'<br />
" best" case) would need to be earning<br />
$ 750 per week before they would be better off<br />
under the Liberals.<br />
after that the gains come rapidly<br />
It is not true that the average family is $ 26 per week<br />
better off under the Liberals.<br />
single income families on $ 500 per week are<br />
net losers by $ 10.77 per week;<br />
but most wage earners earn $ 19,000 or less;<br />
moreover less than 20 per cent of households<br />
conform to the case quoted by the Liberals of<br />
2 parents, single income with kids.<br />
the table shows clearly that at $ 19,000,<br />
every household with kids is substantially<br />
worse off under the Liberals' proposals and<br />
substantially better off under Labor's. </p>
