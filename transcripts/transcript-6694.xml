FOR MEDIA 16 August 1985<br />
With the agreement of Her Majesty The Queen, the Commonwealth<br />
and the United Kingdom Governments, and the Governments of all<br />
Australian States, the way has been opened for the major<br />
historical step of severing remaining constitutional links<br />
between Australia and the United Kingdom.<br />
The Australian Government and the Governments of all the<br />
Australian States have held extensive consultations over a number<br />
of years with a view to removing the outmoded links between<br />
Australia and the United Kingdom parliamentary, government and<br />
judicial systems.<br />
The agreement reflects Australia's status as an independent and<br />
sovereign nation.<br />
The Queen's position as the Australian Head of State remains<br />
unchanged. Major elements of the package include:<br />
* an end to appeals from Australian courts of law to the Privy<br />
Council, making the High Court of Australia the final court of<br />
appeal for all Australian courts<br />
* an end to the powers of the United Kingdom Parliament and<br />
Government with respect to the States<br />
* an end to United Kingdom legislation still restricting the<br />
legislative powers of the States<br />
A complete list of the proposals is attached.<br />
Spec ial arrangements will apply in relation to State Governors and<br />
recommendations for imperial honours, so that United Kingdom<br />
Ministers will no longer advise the Queen:<br />
* The proposed legislation will establish a new constitutional<br />
principle by allowing the Premiers to advise the Queen directly<br />
on the appointment and dismissal of Governors. The present<br />
anachronistic requirement for advice from United Kingdom<br />
Ministers will cease. </p>
<p>* Honours are the perso nal prerogative of the Queen and are<br />
therefore not affected by the legislation. However, an<br />
arrangement will apply whereby any Government wishing to<br />
continue to recommend imperial honours may do so directly to<br />
the Queen<br />
All other powers in respect of the State which are formally<br />
vested in the Queen will be exercised by the State Governor.<br />
ibowever, when the Queen is present in a State and there is<br />
mutual and prior agreement between the Queen and the Premier<br />
that it would be appropriate for her to exercise any of those<br />
powers, the legislation will enable this. All States have<br />
indicated their understanding that on such occasions mutual and<br />
prior agreement is a necessary and important ingredient of any<br />
such arrangements.<br />
These matters have been resolved in a manner which will preserve<br />
the authority of the respective State Governments within their<br />
constitutional limits.<br />
The Queen has been pleased. to agree to the arranae7rents which<br />
directly affect her.<br />
The measures for implementing the package will be as follows:<br />
* the States will pass Acts requesting the Commonwealth and<br />
United Kingdom Parliaments to enact the legislation severing<br />
the residual links.<br />
* the Commonwealth Parliament will then pass an ' Australia Act'<br />
severing residual links to the extent of its powers and a<br />
second Act requesting the United Kingdom Parliament to pass<br />
mirror legislation.<br />
* the United Kingdom Parliament will then pass an ' Australia Act'<br />
in the same terms as the Australia Act.<br />
* the Australia Acts of the Commonwealth and United Kingdom<br />
Parliaments will be proclaimed to come into effect at the same<br />
t ime.<br />
These steps are required by the provisions of the Constitution and<br />
the Statute of Westminster.<br />
The proposals have the support of the Federal Opposition and all<br />
State Governments Labor, Liberal and National Party hive<br />
agreed to them.<br />
It is pleasing that this coming-of-age of Australia's<br />
constitutional development has been achieved by the co-operative<br />
efforts of the governments in Canberra, London and each of the<br />
States. </p>
<p>ATTACHMENT<br />
Residual Constitutional Links<br />
The constitutional links that the legislation seeks to end are<br />
these: Judicial Appeals to the Privy Council from State Courts.<br />
Legislative Power of United Kingdom Parliament to legislate to<br />
affect the Commonwealth and the States.<br />
Implied limitations on powers of State Parliaments.<br />
Colonial Laws Validity Act and " repugnancy" rule ( Acts<br />
of a State inconsistent with United Kingdom laws<br />
extending to the States are invalid to that extent).<br />
merchant Shipping Act ( limitations on State powers to<br />
regulate merchant shipping).<br />
Queen's power to withhold assent from, or disallow,<br />
State laws on the advice of United Kingdom Ministers.<br />
Executive Residual executive responsibilities of United Kingdom<br />
Government with respect to a State, which derived from<br />
the States' former status as colonies; for example, the<br />
need for a Premier to provide advice on appointment of<br />
Governors to the Queen through United Kingdom Ministers.<br />
Other sections of the bills will deal with:<br />
assigning to the State Governors the powers and<br />
functions of the Queen ( both prerogative and statutory)<br />
with respect to the States, other than the power to<br />
appoint and dismiss State Governors<br />
the appointment and dismissal of State Governors by the<br />
Queen on the advice of the Premiers<br />
the future application of the Statute of Westminster and<br />
the manner and form of future laws amending State<br />
Constitutions.<br />
Further sections will directly amend the Constitutions of Western<br />
Australia and Queensland, to remove some provisions concerning<br />
State Governors which are inconsistent with the new agreement and<br />
the Australia Acts. </p>
