PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA November 27 1985<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR HAWKE, AND THE SOUTH<br />
AUSTRALIAN PREMIER, MR BANNON<br />
An agreement to transfer the Port Augusta-Woomera high tension<br />
power line from Commonwealth to South Australian Government<br />
ownership was signed today.<br />
Mr Hawke and Mr Bannon said the transfer was a significant step<br />
towards transforming the Woomera village from a Defence<br />
Department establishment into a normal Australian town.<br />
They said Commonwealth and State officials had been discussing<br />
the transfer of other facilities such as the water supply.<br />
The long term objective was for the Department of Defence to<br />
relinquish control of Woomera Village to local government.<br />
The transfer of the power line will allow the South Australian<br />
Government to service the development of the Roxby Downs copper<br />
and gold mining project at Olympic Dam.<br />
Construction of Woomera Village, which the power line services,<br />
began in 1946.<br />
The Village was the adminsitrative, technical and residential<br />
centre of the Woomera rocket range which was used for British<br />
missile and space tests for more than 30 years.<br />
The Department of Defence maintains a limited capability at the<br />
Woomera range for short range guided weapons and other trials.<br />
The range area is also used for Defence Force exercises.<br />
Mr Hawke said he expected this Defence use of the range would<br />
continue into the forseeable future and Defence personnel would<br />
continue to live in Woomera Village.<br />
The agreement to transfer ownership of the power line was signed<br />
by the Minister for Defence, Mr Kim Beazley, and the South<br />
Australian Minister for mines and Energy, Mr R G Payne. </p>
