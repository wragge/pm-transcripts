CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA,<br />
MR E. G. WHITLAM,<br />
AT THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY, NEW YORK,<br />
MONDAY, 30 SEPTEMBER, 1974<br />
Mr President, In this year in which Australia has established<br />
diplomatic relation~ s with Algeria, it gives me particular<br />
pleasure, as head of the Australian Government, to congratulate<br />
you upon your election as President of this 29th Session of<br />
the General Assembly. The Algerian experience has encompassed<br />
many of the deepest problems facing the world and this world<br />
Organisation today. Sir your nation's experience and your<br />
own ensure distinction and significance to your occupancy of<br />
this high post.<br />
As head of the first Australian social democratic<br />
government since Australia helped to found the United Nations<br />
and to frame its Charter more than a quarter of a century ago,<br />
I re-affirm our loyalty to both. Such pledges are easily<br />
enough given; yet no nation makes them more sincerely, more<br />
earnestly today than Australia.<br />
No country needs more than Australia the fulfilment of<br />
the international objectives of the United Nations to reach<br />
the fulfilment of her own national objectives. There are few<br />
countries in which the paradox is demonstrated with such force<br />
1K 4% 44 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
that true national independence depends upon international<br />
interdependence. There are few nations to which the mirage<br />
of national self-sufficiency can be made so tempting; yet<br />
there are few nations for which that mirage can be so easily<br />
shattered. Australia, fortunate In possession of great<br />
resources, confident in the ability of her own people to<br />
develop those resources, is nevertheless not ashamed to admit<br />
her interdependence with her neighbours and her partners<br />
across the world and her dependence upon them. We are a<br />
people without illusions; we Australians neither falsely<br />
exaggerate our strengths nor fearfully exaggerate our<br />
weaknesses. It is precisely because we make a rational<br />
assessment of our strengths and weaknesses that we recognise<br />
that we depend upon a better international order to preserve<br />
those things we most value about our national independence.<br />
In seeking a better international order, we give primacy to<br />
the United Nations.<br />
It is therefore with growing concern that we witness<br />
what can only be called a drift away from international order<br />
and international co-operation at present occurring in world<br />
affairs. Australia's concern springs not just from the real<br />
difficulties created by recent events but, even more, from the<br />
feeling that there has been a weakening of will, a loss of<br />
momentum in Internationai determination to meet and overcome<br />
those difficulties. Great hopes were born two years ago. The Australian<br />
Government wholeheartedly endorsed the movement towards detente<br />
between the United States and the Soviet Union. We wholeheartedly<br />
supported China's return to her true place in the<br />
family of nations in this Organisation and ' in the worldo We<br />
wholeheartedly endorsed the Paris Agreement to end the war in<br />
Vietnam. We therefore ratified the nuclear non-proliferation<br />
treaty, moved our Chtna Embassy from Taipeh to Peking, and<br />
ended Australia's own military Involvement In Indo-China.<br />
Above all, we have been determined to do all we can -to<br />
ensure that our region and the world should not for a second<br />
time lose the opportunity for a new settlement, a new step<br />
towards peace and progress, in the way that the chance was<br />
thrown away after the war In Korea and after the Geneva<br />
meetings in 1954. Yet we have to acknowledge that the hopes<br />
springing from the remarkable events of 1971 and 1972 are<br />
beginning to sour. There is increasingly a sense of drift, a<br />
sense of events out of control. The task of~ this Assembly<br />
should be to help stop that drift. Our natu,? l preoccupation<br />
with our national problems -and for most of us<br />
they are very great indeed must not lead to a loss of </p>
<p>-3-<br />
international concern and involvement. We cannot turn inwards.<br />
E-en the ,! ost immediate problems of domestic worry such as<br />
inflation which so many of us share, the strongest, the most<br />
highly developed along with the weakest and the least<br />
developed are in essence international problems, for which<br />
there can be no ultimate, no complete national solution<br />
without an international solution. No nation, no group of<br />
nations, no bloc, no alliance, can live alone, can live<br />
entirely to itself in this new world. We are all internationalists<br />
now by necessity. Australia is internationalist<br />
by necessity and by choice. Each of us has our bilateral<br />
arrangements and our regional arrangements. Many, like<br />
Australia, through treaty or trade or tradition, have<br />
honourable alignments and valuable associations.<br />
It is however through this Organisation, its Assembly<br />
and its councils and through the specialised agencies, that<br />
the enduring international settlements must ultimately be<br />
sought and the drift away from international co-operation<br />
must be arrested.<br />
So there must be no loss of nerve, no loss of will<br />
here. If we here lose our nerve, if we here allow that<br />
drift to continue unchecked, we face the breakdown of the<br />
nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the breakdown of world<br />
economic order, the breakdown of all our high hopes and high<br />
words about closing the gap between the developed and<br />
developing nations and the breakdown of any claims of the<br />
United Nations OrgA~ iisation to be an effective peace-keeper<br />
and peace-maker.<br />
We should all stand guilty of betrayal of our peoples<br />
if we did not act now to stop the drift in these matters0<br />
The special obligations which the might of the superpowers<br />
imposes upon them should not be made an excuse for<br />
indifference or~ Indecision on the part of? the rest of us0 We<br />
continue to urge upon the superpowers the need for them both<br />
to maintain the utmost mutual restraint in their relations<br />
between themselves and towards us. They can, of course,<br />
easily destroy each other; they can also destroy all of us0<br />
!, 4e are entitled to ask them to move forward to a stage of<br />
complete detente where their tremendous power can be used<br />
jointly for the betterment of the whole civilizationo We<br />
are entitled to insist upon restraint In their deployment<br />
of forces overseas, in areas such as the Indian Ocean.<br />
Australia is strongly opposed to the Indian Ocean becoming<br />
a ground for competition, much less confrontation between the<br />
great powers. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Mutual restraint is also essential to prevent the<br />
excesses and dangers of the nuclear arms race.<br />
Let me recall that those of us who are so far parties<br />
to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons<br />
have given the nuclear powers certain rights; they in turn<br />
have accepted certain responsibilities and given guarantees,<br />
as part of a two-way process. We undertook not to develop<br />
nuclear weapons in return for guarantees of protection and<br />
assistance in the development of nuclear knowledge for peace.<br />
Above all, the sponsoring powers undertook to promote and<br />
maintain a world order based upon comprehensive disarmament.<br />
Unless these obligations are sincerely fulfilled, the incentive<br />
abroad and the pressure at home for more and more nations to<br />
get nuclear weapons will increase. A co-operative effort by<br />
all leaders must find effective means of halting the arms race<br />
and preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. There is<br />
nothing more urgent facing any of us today.<br />
Australia there~ ore sees with deepest anxiety the<br />
continuing and new testing of nuclear devices, the prospect<br />
of an ever-increasing number of nat~ ons possessing nuclear<br />
weapons, and an even greater number possessing the capability<br />
of exploding nuclear devices. Where It has been open to<br />
Australia, we have expressed our concern in action before<br />
the International Court of Justice.<br />
All of us face a nightmare world in which as many as<br />
fifteen or twenty nations may possess nuclear weapons by the<br />
early ' 080s. There is time to prevent it, We have perhaps<br />
about a year, two years at the most in which to prevent it.<br />
Now is the time; it may be our last chance.<br />
For our part, the Australian Government pledges that<br />
it will neither develop nor acquire nuclear weapons.<br />
Our first aim must be to strengthen the Non-<br />
Proliferation Treaty and work for Its acceptance everywhere.<br />
Real and rapid progress can best be made through this Treaty.<br />
We should build on what we have. We have not time to start<br />
all over again. Six years after it was concluded and more<br />
than four years after it came Into force, some States have<br />
still to ratify the Treaty, or to make clear their<br />
renunciation of nuclear weapons development. Certainly<br />
we understand the difficulties the Treaty presents to some<br />
nations. We understand their reservations0 We acknowledge<br />
discriminatory aspects of the Treaty as it now stands0We </p>
<p>would hope that the forthcoming Review Conference will remove<br />
some of these difficulties, but the Conference will be more<br />
successful and meaningful if more nation3 ratify the Treaty<br />
and work within its framework to improve it and apply it.<br />
Secondly, we should make a comprehensive treaty to ban<br />
nuclear weapons testing an urgent priority. The treaties<br />
which have been concluded and resolutions which have been<br />
adopted are Important achievements, but they have not gone<br />
far enough towards stopping the nuclear arms race. They are<br />
only steps towards unive-sal and comprehensive agreement on<br />
nuclear weapons testing. We must complete the journey.<br />
Thirdly, we need effective international arrangements<br />
to govern and control ruclear experiments for peaceful<br />
purposes. We all recognise the promise which scientific<br />
collaboration on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy holds<br />
for economic development in the interests of all mankind.<br />
But the world cannot afford the risks which lie in the<br />
prospect where increasing numbers of countries possess<br />
nuclear devices e'-en if they profess to have them for<br />
peaceful purposes only. We cannot shrug off nuclear<br />
explosions which present us with such a threat, particularly<br />
those conducted outside existing safeguards and without<br />
international inspection0 Australia seeks support for an<br />
international arrangement by which all states could gain<br />
access to nuclear explosive services under agreed and secure<br />
international controls for peaceful purposes0 We urge all<br />
nuclear states to co-operate In establishing such a service,<br />
preferably under the auspices of the International Atomic<br />
Energy Agency. I join with the Foreign Minister of Canada in<br />
this call. Another approach to the goal of disarmament worth<br />
serious exploration is the concept of peace zones. They are<br />
of course no substitute for comprehensive disarmament and no<br />
substitute f'or an effective Non-Proliferation Treaty.<br />
Australia, however, takes a particular interest in the<br />
agreements and proposals embodying this concept, because<br />
most of them affect our continent and our region directly.<br />
The Antarctic Treaty, the Indian Ocean peace zone, the ASEAN<br />
declaration, the Treaty of Tlatelolco, and the proposal by<br />
Iran for a nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle East all<br />
move in the right direction. They command Australia's broad<br />
support since they assert the dangers inherent in an<br />
uncontrolled, unregulated use of our planet for the deployment<br />
of nuclear weapons; they seek to limit the development,<br />
emplacement and use of nuclear weapons in the areas and </p>
<p>-6-<br />
environments they cover; they all express growing anxiety<br />
about the spread of nuclear weapons; they all seek paths<br />
towards reducing tensions among the nuclear powers. For the<br />
Australian Government, these initiatives not only represent<br />
ends In themselves but, we believe serve to stimulate<br />
progress on other important measures intended to bring to<br />
fulfilment the hopes of !. nkind to live in security, free<br />
from the threat of nuclear war,<br />
Let me say that Australia's anxiety about the nuclear<br />
arms race does not blind us to the risks to international<br />
peace and security from localised conflicts using conventional<br />
weapons. We, the members of the international community,<br />
stand condemned for our failure so far to find the sense of<br />
responsibility and the means of authority to stop regional<br />
disputes being settled by force. It is equally bad that<br />
some members of the international community have made<br />
possible for profit massive recourse to arms and the means<br />
of waging wars about to start or already begun. A world order<br />
which pcovmits. or which, by default, sanctions the large scale<br />
transfer of weapons from one country to another where the risk<br />
of conflict is high, is gravely at fault and very foolish. It<br />
shortcircults the process of peaceful negotiation and puts<br />
primacy upon settlement of disputes by war, by bloodshed, and<br />
as always happens must always happen in modern war by the<br />
bloodshed of the innocent.<br />
Clearly, we still have far to go before the international<br />
community will agree collectively to forsake the short term<br />
gains on arms sales abroad in return for the longer term but<br />
less tangible benefits that this self-denying ordinance would<br />
confer on the weapons prn~ ucers. Nevertheless, we now ask<br />
that the major weapons producing countries should set an<br />
exo~ mple by imposing the strictest restrictions on the export<br />
of arms abroad to areas where there is a clear risk of conflict.<br />
Recent events have shown that preservation of peace is<br />
more than a matter of arms control. It is also a matter of<br />
keeping the peace when violence threatens or occurs. It is<br />
not enough for members o the United Nations to pay lip service<br />
to the United Nations' peace-keeping role. Individual members<br />
have the duty to provide the material and financial resources<br />
to allow the United Nations to deal with threats to security,<br />
breaches of the peace and acts of aggression.<br />
Australia stands ready to participate in peace-keeping<br />
operations in whatever way would be most useful. Australia is<br />
of course allied by trep-ty with the United States, and we make </p>
<p>-7-<br />
no apologies for it. There is however no area of actual or<br />
potential conflict anywhere in the world where loyalties,<br />
ideology or interests, should make an Australian involvement<br />
in peace-keeping unacceptable or unwelcome. We wish<br />
Australba to be always among the first nations from which<br />
the United Nations would ask for peace-keeping forces; we<br />
shall be among the first~ to respond. We undertake to keep<br />
the Secretary-General regularly informed on the nature and<br />
size of contributions we are able to provide over a given<br />
period. Australia fuirther believes that the importance of<br />
preventive diplomacy must come to be more widely recognised<br />
and accepted and that the ample provisions offered by this<br />
Organisation for peace-keeping and good offices should be<br />
reinvigorated, explored more thoroughly and more thoroughly<br />
exploited. It is time, thern~ ore, to look again at the<br />
hitherto untapped provisions of the United Nations Charter,<br />
to make all that we can of its capacity to provide useful<br />
contributions to such activ,: ties as fact-finding,<br />
conciliation mediation and negotiation.<br />
We here should particularly devote increased attention<br />
to the role of the International Court of Justice. Not enough<br />
nations use the Court. Members of the international community<br />
cannot be compelled to take their cases before the Court but<br />
we should strive to build confidence in its worth, its wisdom,<br />
its worl rbility as one way of rationalising and harmonising<br />
international relations. If the rule of international law<br />
and justice is to prevail, then an international tribunal is<br />
indispensable. The Court's jurisdiction should be widened0<br />
Jurisdiction should become compulsory and universal. New<br />
multilate~ al treaty arrangements like that which will<br />
emerge from the Law of the Sea conference should enforce<br />
compulsory settlement oP disputes, with the International<br />
Court as the final court' 0o' appeal0 By such steps the rule<br />
of law can be established and strengthened in a better world<br />
order. In this difficult, complicated, crowded world we all<br />
are creating for ourselves, the causes of conflict multiply.<br />
Nuclear brinkmanship, ideology, border disputes, race hate,<br />
religious bigotry, national ambitions, foreign exploitation<br />
all provide actual or potential sources of tension, conflict,<br />
bloodshed and war. Yet there remains for the future one of<br />
the oldest of all the causes of war the threat of war for<br />
the possession of resources. Huge population increases, the<br />
revolution of rising expectations, the enormous and often </p>
<p>-8-<br />
wasteful demands our technological civilization makes upon the<br />
world's resources, have increased the pressures on our world<br />
civilization to the very threshold of the tolerable.<br />
. For countries which lack resources the situation has<br />
become critical. The developing countries have been grossly<br />
disadvantaged. Last year's oil crisis brought this sharply<br />
home to all of us developed and developing alike.<br />
It is proper that In this world forum I should state<br />
the Australian Government's attitude to the use and development<br />
of Australia's own very considerable resources. There is no<br />
place in our thinking f'or " economic nationalism" in its crudest<br />
sense. We do, of course, wish to ensure steady markets at<br />
fair prices for what we produce. We recognise the great scope<br />
for increased co-operation between producers of raw materials<br />
and for groups of exporting countries to associate to build a<br />
better fr%-)-ework for orderly and rational development of<br />
production and trade0 As a relatively developed and thriving<br />
nation, which also produces many resources shared by developing<br />
and poorer nations, Australia recognises its duty to cooperate<br />
with such nations in obtaining fair and reasonable<br />
return for our products. And we are co-operating. Equally<br />
however we in Australia accept our responsibility to reassure<br />
countries which depend upon our resources that they shall<br />
have steady, secure access to those resources at fair prices.<br />
We must protect our interests and we shall, but Australia is<br />
not in the business of resources blackmail0 That is the way<br />
to international disaster for producers and users alike0<br />
Let us accept the plain fact that war for resources<br />
or food or markets by any nation or group of nations would,<br />
in modern times, represent the supreme folly0 There is no<br />
war, nuclear or " conventional" by which the victor so-called,<br />
assuming there was one, could conceivably win back by war the<br />
resour0ces used and destroyed in waging it0 If we choose not<br />
to listen to the voice of humanity against war, we might at<br />
least listen to the voice of commonsense and indeed ordinary,<br />
rational self-interest0<br />
As a major food producer, Australia is particularly<br />
interested in the proposals on~ food which President Ford and<br />
Secretary of State Kissinger have made at this session0<br />
Australia undertakes to work constructively and cooperatively<br />
towards implementation of these proposals.<br />
Suggestions such as the establishment of an international<br />
system of grain reserves are thoroughly commendable and<br />
deserve our most serious attention0 </p>
<p>-9-<br />
Of all the changes which have occurred in the international<br />
community since World War 11 none has more<br />
profoundly altered the r7ace of the world than the accession<br />
to independence by those peoples and states formerly under<br />
colonial rule. The process is not yet complete, but we look<br />
to a time in the near future when no territory will be<br />
controlled against 4ts choice by a metropolitan power with<br />
whom it has no geographical, social, racial, cultural<br />
affinity. In this regard we particularly welcome recent<br />
decisions of the Government of Portugal.<br />
Australia has acted with determination and vigour to<br />
apply the relevant artic', es of the Charter. Papua New Guinea<br />
became self-governing on I December, 1973. It will become<br />
fully independent as soon as the House of Assembly of Papua<br />
New Guinea decides. We expect this decision soon. Let me<br />
emphasise the decision we await is by the House of Assembly.<br />
The Australian Government made its own decision long ago<br />
we utterly reject a colonial role for Australia. Meanwhile<br />
the Australian Government deals with the Government of Papua<br />
New Guinea in all significant respects as that of a nation<br />
already independent.<br />
There is to me, I must say, a most satisfying symmetry<br />
in the march of events by which Portugal the oldest, and<br />
Australia the newest, of the colonial powers are acting at<br />
the same time towards the liquidation of colonialism. Across<br />
the distance of 400 years the new world in Australia clasps<br />
hands with the old, in ending a false, demeaning, unworthy<br />
power over others.*<br />
The dramatic and welcome progress made towards the<br />
dissolution of the oldest and last of the colonial empires<br />
now enables -che United Nations to direct even more con%<br />
centrated attention upon the twin evil of racism<br />
particularly its posc-colonial manifestations in Southern<br />
Africa. We must be unremitting in the efforts sanctioned<br />
by the Assembly to break the illegal regime in Rhodesia, to<br />
end South Africa's unlawful control over Nambibia and to end<br />
apartheid. We should all make determined efforts to see<br />
that the momentum which launched the Decade for Action to<br />
Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination is not lost. My<br />
Government conscious that Australia's own record is<br />
seriously flawed is determined to remove all forms of<br />
racial discrimination within our own shores, notably now,<br />
as notoriously in the past, against our own Aboriginals. </p>
<p>While racism remains as cruel as any example of man's<br />
inhumanity to man, we should not, however, overlook the<br />
existence of other forms of discrimination which rob men<br />
and women of their right to live in dignity and peace of<br />
mind. Throughout the world political prisoners languish in<br />
jails or are otherwise deprived of their civil liberties.<br />
There are thoroughly unacceptable constraints on the right<br />
of political asylum. Religious and ethnic minorities are<br />
persecuted, workers are denied the protection of ILO<br />
Conventions, women are denied equal opportunities. The<br />
Australian Foreign Minister, Senator Willesee will during<br />
the discussion be putting Australian submissions to express<br />
our views and proposals on these matters.<br />
There has never been a time in human history when the<br />
truth of the one-ness, the indivisibility of humanity, has<br />
been so manifest. It is no longer only a philosophical or<br />
religious proposition but an assertion of sheer reason and<br />
commanding commonsense, All the momentous recent developments<br />
have profound implications for the future conduct of international<br />
relations since they have one common theme the<br />
interdependence of us all. That interdependence is now almost<br />
total. An attempt by any state to bring about political or<br />
economic change in another through unconstitutional,<br />
clandestine, corrupt methods, by assassination or<br />
terrorism, undermines the rule of international law,<br />
encourages adventurism and anarchy, endangers world peace<br />
and turns quite quickly against even the most powerful<br />
nations who would seek to advance their cause by such<br />
methods, The wilful erection of trade barriers by one state or<br />
a group of states without regard to the hardship caused to<br />
others can cr-eate economic dislocation around the world by<br />
curtailing or closing export markets to which their<br />
industries have become geared and on which their foreign<br />
exchange earnings depend.<br />
Refusal to recognise the inalienable rights of all<br />
people to freedom and independence produces tension and<br />
conflict not only between the oppressed and the oppressors<br />
but between them and other nations which become associated<br />
or involved in these just and legitimate struggles. </p>
<p>-11-<br />
Now more than ever, we look to the United Nations.<br />
It has the experience, the stature and the capacity to help<br />
us identify the sources of tension between nations, to<br />
prescribe collective measures to mitigate and eventually<br />
remove the causes of conflict, and to anticipate and prevent<br />
situations developing which have the potential for disturbing<br />
world peace.<br />
Mr President, It is claimed that the world is now short on leadership.<br />
It's truer to say that the nature, complexity and<br />
universality of the problems rushing in upon us render<br />
irrelevant and obsolete that concept of world leadership<br />
whereby a handful of powerful men in charge of the most<br />
powerful nations can chart the course for the rest of us to<br />
follow. So the challenge of the United Nations to provide<br />
a genuine and continuing source of leadership, of hope and<br />
purpose for the world is more urgent, the opportunity more<br />
real, than at any time in the Organlsation's history. In<br />
the response we here make to that challenge, we shall be<br />
judged as nations, as representatives of our nations and<br />
as men and women not by our power or size or wealth, but<br />
by the honesty of our efforts to promote and practice the<br />
principles of the Charter of this United Nations. </p>
