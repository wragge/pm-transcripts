FOR MEDIA 17 M4ARCH 1988<br />
This morning, I summoned the South African Ambassador in<br />
Canberra to my office to make representations on behalf of<br />
the Sharpeville Six, who are due to be hanged on Friday<br />
18 March 1988.<br />
I asked the Ambassador to pass my representations to the<br />
South African President, Mr P. W. Botha. This afte Ynoon in<br />
Parliament, in answering a question, I referred to,, my<br />
representations. I expressed the hope that I was speaking<br />
on behalf of all members of Parliament in making an appeal<br />
for clemency on behalf of the Sharpeville Six.<br />
At the time, I was somewhat concerned that the Leader of the<br />
opposition did not seek to associate the Opposition with my<br />
remarks, because I believe that they would ha. e more impact<br />
with the South African Government if they clearly reflected<br />
a bi-partisan position of the Australian Parliament.<br />
I was utterly horrified by the subsequent remarks made in<br />
the Parliament by the opposition spokesman on Foreign<br />
Affairs, the Honourable Member for North Sydney, who in<br />
effect acted as a prosecutor of the Sharpeville Six, on the<br />
basis of information supplied to him by the South African<br />
Embassy. I would remind the Opposition that no evidence has been<br />
produced in the case sufficient to establish a direct causal<br />
connection between the conduct of the accused and the death<br />
of the victim.<br />
moreover, a key prosecution witness in the case stated<br />
publicly yesterday that he had perjured himself in the trial<br />
at the behest of the police. This has led to a last minute<br />
appeal to the South African Supreme Court, which will be<br />
heard tomorrow.<br />
I appreciate that there are policy differences between the<br />
Government and the opposition on the general situation in<br />
South Africa and the need for sanctions.<br />
But I appeal to the Leader of the opposition to put aside<br />
partisan differences on this issue, in the interests of the<br />
overriding humanitarian concern for the fate of the<br />
Sharpeville Six.<br />
I ask him to join the Government in appealing to the,<br />
Government of South Africa to spare their lives, as<br />
President Reagan, Prime Minister Thatcher and other world<br />
leaders have done. 005136 </p>
