E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
CLOSING REMARKS NATIONAL TAXATION SUMMIT 4 JULY 1985<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, what I would like to do in opening up<br />
what I hope will be a very fruitful session is to indicate<br />
as I see it, the areas where I think it is fair to say<br />
there is total agreement that has emerged out of the<br />
proceedings of the Summit to this date. And from that to<br />
move to indicate what we perceive are perhaps what could be<br />
described as areas of majority agreement not total. To<br />
indicate on that basis without any concept of putting to you<br />
a package because I'm not in a position to do that, but to<br />
indicate on the basis of our response to what we'*<br />
perceive to be majority positions, how the Government could<br />
most usefully now proceed on the basis of the nine principlesparticularly<br />
principle nine to discharge its ultimate<br />
obligation of the package of reform.<br />
In those terms then, ladies and gentlemen, let me say that I<br />
see these significant areas of-what I think could be described<br />
as universal agreement having been reached at the Summit to<br />
this point.<br />
Firstly, and most obviously, and certainly ultimately most<br />
importantly, is there is universal agreement that the<br />
existing inherited system inherited by this Government<br />
that that system has disintegrated and that there is need for<br />
reform of that system. As I discern it, every speakar in<br />
this Summit is at one on that point.<br />
Secondly, I believe that there is general agreement that the<br />
principles that the Government enunciated as being<br />
appropriate to apply in achieving reform are the correct ones.<br />
That is the principles of equity, efficiency and greater<br />
simplicity. Let me say in respect of the second of<br />
efficiency, and I -say this insofar as some representatives<br />
of the business community have said, and I believe rightly,<br />
that in talking of efficiency your concerns should not<br />
simply be of efficiency from the point of view of collection.<br />
But also, as the White Paper itself says when it is talking<br />
about efficiency, you are tal] cing about the best allocation<br />
of resources. And in that sense the economic impact of<br />
tax reform measures need to be taken into account and included<br />
with that of course, necessarily, the economic impact of any<br />
suggested changes in the business tax area. </p>
<p>But, I repeat, the second area of universal agreement, I<br />
think, is the appropriate principles to be applied.<br />
Thirdly, there has been no disagreement, as of course<br />
there could be no disagreement, in the proposition that in<br />
the introduction of any tax reform package the least<br />
privileged in the community the under-privileged must<br />
not only not be disadvantaged, but as far as possible their<br />
position be improved. I have not discerned any dissension<br />
from that proposition. And that applies whether the<br />
under-privileged be in employment or in the social welfare<br />
system and I believe that that universal agreement<br />
particularly applied to the lower income areas of our<br />
community with families in particular. And let me say<br />
this in asserting that that is a universal position out of this<br />
Summit that I believe equally there has been a total response<br />
to the proposition I put in the opening of this Summit that<br />
it would be appropriate that in any tax reform package that<br />
is brought to satisfy the community that that third principle<br />
that I have referred of the non-disadvantaging of the least<br />
priveleged in our community. There has been, I think, universal<br />
response to my proposition about the establishment of a<br />
monitoring authority. And I can say to you that we will<br />
establish such an authority. But it gives me very much<br />
pleasure to say that in doing that I have already had some<br />
discussion and that Bishop Peter Hollingworth has responded<br />
positively to my invitation to be the chairman of such a<br />
monitoring authority. An acceptance which I think would<br />
again meet with universal approval.<br />
The fifth principle to which I think there is again general<br />
agreement is that one of the major objectives of tax reform<br />
must be reduction of marginal rates for a whole range of reasons<br />
which are set out in the White Paper and which I believe there<br />
has been no dissension.<br />
And let me also say sixthly, that I think there has been<br />
virtual unanimous agreement to the proposition of the<br />
establishment of a national identification card. It is<br />
true that some people, properly, have referred to the<br />
necessity in any such move to ensure that legitimate<br />
civil libertarian considerations should be taken into<br />
acount. And I give not only the Summit, but the people<br />
of Australia, the unqualified assurance, that in moving<br />
to give effect to that area of general agreement in the<br />
Summit those legi~ timate' considerations will be fully taken<br />
into account.<br />
Now ladies and gentlemen, having said that there are those<br />
important six areas of universal agreement, of course, it<br />
is then appropriate that one should say that beyond that<br />
there is not universal agreement. That it is clear that<br />
there has been qualification opposition, to various aspects<br />
of the proposals that have been put forward. And that is as </p>
<p>it should be. Because from the initiation of this exercise,<br />
the ninth principle has not been there because nine is one<br />
more than eight, l ut because the ninth and final principle<br />
in one sense, is ultimately the most important principle that<br />
any government concerned with trying to get community<br />
involvement in decision-making should attach importance to.<br />
And clearly in terms of principle nine it is not possible to<br />
say that there is broad community support for what was put as<br />
the preferred Government option. We acknowledge that. And<br />
it is appropriate that, straightforwardly without equivocation,<br />
on behalf of the Government I say that. We discharge the<br />
obligation that we believed we had, we put that. And it has<br />
been an option around which useful discussion, productive<br />
discussion has taken place.<br />
Having said that,' it has beenthe responsibility of Government,<br />
particularly the responsibility of myself and the Treasurer,<br />
then to try and distill from the contributions in this Summit<br />
where it is possible to try and distinguish what I call majority<br />
support for certain broad positions. And let me say what I<br />
discern as to broad areas where I think there has been a<br />
majority attitude emerge.<br />
Firstly, while as I say, there has not been acceptance in<br />
terms of principle nine of the Government's preferred option,<br />
it is nevertheless true that listening to what has been said,<br />
reading what has been said, that there is majority support for<br />
the position that it is appropriate for government to look at<br />
the possibility of an extension of the indirect tax base. Not<br />
in terms of option C, but that it is appropriate to look at the<br />
extension of the indirect. And there is a clear majority position<br />
for that I believe. Also, without universality, there has been fran<br />
many quarters, I think reflecting majority position, the view<br />
expressed-that it is appropriate for government in the process<br />
now of discharging its obligation, to move to the creation of<br />
a final patkage, it would be appropriate for government to look<br />
at the question of the threshold. As to whether it may not<br />
be appropriate to look at the abolition of that, and within<br />
that look at the whole question of dependent spouse rebates,<br />
and family allowances. Now obviously, no-one in addressing<br />
themselves to tha~ t issue has either said or implied that there<br />
would not be legitimate concerns and problems that government<br />
would have to address if it was going to look at that as part<br />
of an overall tax reform. Because it goes without saying<br />
that there are problems, actual and potential there, and a<br />
government drawing up a comprehensive total package of tax<br />
reform, in looking at that would have to take account of<br />
those difficulties, both conceptual and administrative. And<br />
so that would be the case.<br />
On that basis, I would say to the Summit that the Government<br />
would proceed, at~ the conclusion of the Summit, to look at<br />
the drawing up of a package which took those factors into<br />
account, the two where I say there is majority support.<br />
Going back to the question of the indirect, the extension<br />
of the indirect tax base. It appears that there would be<br />
support for a propos'ition of doing that by looking perhaps at </p>
<p>a reform of the wholesale tax base, the possible inclusion<br />
of some elements in that not there now. But provided<br />
that such reform and extension met the clear view of the Summit<br />
that nothing be done in that process which would impose unacceptable<br />
burdens on the leaLst privileged in the community.<br />
And in association with that, the concept of a tax on, consumption<br />
tax on services at the rate that has been talked about in the<br />
preferred option., So that you would have the concept of an<br />
extension of the indirect tax but in a way which clearly<br />
excluded food and1 those elements like power, to go to heating.<br />
Those sorts of things, which of themselves, would be unacceptably<br />
regressive and presume to be not sufficiently compensable in<br />
respect of the least privileged in the community.<br />
So that is the sort of concept which it seems to us from<br />
listening to what you have all1 had to sayprovides a majority<br />
basis for looking at tax reform.<br />
As to the area of' business tax and changes in a reform package<br />
which would impinge in the business area. Let us say to you<br />
that as we have said in the White Paper, we would see merit,<br />
as has been said, in the concept of looking at the bringing<br />
in of imputation, full imputationinto the tax in the company<br />
area to deal with what has been this very long standing,<br />
properly perceived problem of double taxation in regard to<br />
company profits and dividends. And we would be looking at<br />
that, and looking at it in terms of the associated question<br />
of trying to bring the top personal rates towards a, an involved<br />
adjusted company tax rate so that you would deal with those<br />
problems which are associated with the divergence between those<br />
two rates.<br />
Now ladies and gentlemen, I believe in putting that to you I<br />
have, I think, accurately distilled the general view of the Suninit.<br />
I repeat in saying that we have full acknowledgement of<br />
the areas where opposition has been expressed to particular<br />
elements and to where qualifications or concern have been<br />
expressed about areas that are thought worthy of investigation.<br />
And I say that particularly in the area of looking at the<br />
possible abolition of the threshold. Anyone that has referred<br />
to that of course has been conscious of the fact that there<br />
are problems'and issues that need to be taken into account in<br />
that area. And of course they would be.<br />
Now before, on that basis of introduction of this sess,-n,<br />
inviting comments, there is one thing that I wish to say.<br />
And to say clearly and without qualification of any sort.<br />
And it is said in.. some sense because of some speculation,<br />
observat"-ion, that may have been made. I believe that if<br />
there is one th ' ing that I have left out of the area in which<br />
there is universalsupport in this Summit, it is the role that<br />
has been played in this whole process by Treasurer Paul Keating.<br />
Now, I believe that, ( applause) it is clear from that response<br />
that I have discerned the mood of the Summit accurately. Now<br />
I simply want to say that the contribution that Paul Keating<br />
has made to lifting the level of community debate, both </p>
<p>before and at this Summit, has been without parallel, and<br />
without equal. And I want to say personally that in the<br />
process that we've gone through from the beginning of this<br />
exercise, and up to and through the Summit itself, that<br />
no Prime Minister could have asked for better, closer,<br />
more effective co-operation, than I have enjoyed with<br />
Paul Keating. Thank you Paul. So the matter is now open<br />
for discussion. </p>
