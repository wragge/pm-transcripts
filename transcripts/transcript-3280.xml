EMBARGO: 8.15 P. m.<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
AT THE OPENING OF THE 21ST SYDNEY FILM FESTIVAL,<br />
STATE THEATRE, SYDNEY, SUNDAY. 2 JUNE 1974<br />
one of the most impressive aspects of the recent<br />
election campaign was the public involvement and commitment of<br />
men and women whose voices are not often heard in political affairs.<br />
For me, there was no better, no more moving an example of this<br />
than a meeting here in the Sydney Opera House only 5 days before<br />
the people went to the polls.<br />
On that day, about 20 men and women stood with me<br />
before a capacity crowd in the Concert Hall and declared their<br />
allegiance. My appreciation of their action was in no way diminished,<br />
of course, by the fact that they declared their support for the<br />
Government which I lead. Those men and women represented various<br />
groups and occupations in our community. But, appropriately, in<br />
Sydney's most striking symbol of cultural endeavour, the biggest<br />
single group consisted of artists: novelists, poets, painters,<br />
actors, producers and the like. I don.' t believe any of them will<br />
feel belittled if I say they were led by bur only Nobel Prize<br />
winner for literature, Patrick White.<br />
These men and women did not talk simply about the<br />
arts. Some stressed their belief in the need for Australia to<br />
maintain a modern and independent stance in foreign policy. Some<br />
stressed their concern about the environment and conservation<br />
a concern which would have been particularly pertinent if stated<br />
in this remarkably ornamented theatre. Some stressed a more<br />
general concern about the type of society they wanted Australia to<br />
be: Patrick White, for example, wanted to ensure the end of what<br />
he described in a somewhat startling phrase as " the mental<br />
constipation" of the past.<br />
Nevertheless, a dominant concern for all of these<br />
people was for the future of their own fields, for the future of<br />
the arts in Australia. I don't think it is vain of me to say that they<br />
believed that the present Australian government has done more for the<br />
arts than any previous Australian government. I appreciated greatly<br />
the willingness of those and other Australian artists to acknowledge<br />
just what we have done. In politics, one doesn't always expect<br />
such acknowledgements to be given. In this case, it was; and, if<br />
I can be so bold, I believe that that recognition was justified.<br />
Indeed through the Australian Council for the Arts alone, the<br />
Australian government is providing $ 14 million for support to the<br />
arts in Australia this financial year. In other words, our assistance<br />
is twice that of 1972/ 73. Response to our new program has been<br />
overwhelming. The Council for the Arts has received about 4,000<br />
applications in the last year for assistance for various art forms<br />
and has provided about 1,600 grants.,<br />
One of the major objectives of our program has been to<br />
help our artists in the pursuit of excellence. This pursuit would<br />
not be possible if they did not have financial security. it is fair<br />
to assume that already hundreds of Australians who would otherwise<br />
be working in other fiplds or in other countries are now pursuing<br />
professional careers in the arts in Australia for the first time.<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The continued security of our artists, however, must<br />
always depend on community support. That i ' s why our program has<br />
emphasised the need to encourage the spread of interest and<br />
participation in the arts throughout our society. In turn, this can<br />
only be aided by the achievement of another major objective; for<br />
the arts to help provide an expression of a national identity.<br />
I believe the aim of community support is already starting to be<br />
achieved. In a small way, the meeting at the Opera House 3 weeks<br />
ago demonstrated this. Not many years ago, one might have expected<br />
a lot of Australians to be unimpressed by a statement of endorsement<br />
by a group of artists. Now, I think, Australians generally have<br />
become sufficiently proud of their . achievements to pay attention<br />
to them. In no area has the need for Australians to have the<br />
opportunity to pursue excellence, to encourage community support and<br />
to express a national identity been greater than in the film industry.<br />
Although it had a vigorous anxd promising beginning, it has languished<br />
for years. Yet there is no question that we have had people of<br />
talent who have craved the chance to restore the industry, to create<br />
worthwhile Australian films and to reach an Australian audience.<br />
We are determined to give them that chance.<br />
The prospects for the film industry look very bright<br />
at present. Last year, seven Australian feature films were produced.<br />
Already in 1974 nine Australian feature films * are in production in<br />
addition to one financed by American interests. A further 16 feature<br />
film projects are being planned and six of them are expected to go<br />
into production during the next 12 months. Not only has there been<br />
a great improvement in the number of films being produced in the<br />
last two years; there has also been a great improvement in the<br />
public response to those films. There have been several notable<br />
examples of films which have attracted large crowds to our main<br />
city cinemas. The Australian Government is seeking to ensure this<br />
recent trend will develop further. It is making financial assistance<br />
for film making available through two government bodies the Film<br />
and Television Board of the Australian Council for the Arts and the<br />
Australian Film Development Corporation. Since its formation in<br />
February last year, the Film and Television Board has made 407 grants<br />
worth nearly $ 2 million. These grants were given to individual film<br />
makers and to organisations, such as film co-operatives to help<br />
establish cinemas and distribute independently produced Australian<br />
films; to the National Film Theatre for nationwide screenings of<br />
films of specialised interests; and to film festivals in Sydney,<br />
Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. The Board has established a number<br />
of community access video centres in the western suburbs of Sydney<br />
and Melbourne and has similar plans for Brisbane, Adelaide, Whyalla<br />
and Fremantle. The Board also plans to provide a cinema in each<br />
capital city to show Australian films and for use by non-commerical<br />
film makers and organisations for screenings, workshops and seminars. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
The other main arm of Government assistance, the<br />
Film Development Corporation, has helped with the financing and<br />
promotion of feature films. It has recently been involved, for<br />
example, in the promotion and exhibition of " The Cars that Ate Paris"<br />
at the Cannes Film Festival. The Film Development Corporation<br />
will soon be replaced by the Australian Film Commission. This<br />
follows the Government's acceptance of a number of major recommendations<br />
by the Tariff Board which enquired last year into motion picture films<br />
and television programs. Cabinet has agreed that the new Film<br />
Commission should be able to provide up to half the budget for an<br />
Australian film. And in addition, to provide a promotion subsidy<br />
for such a film. The precise amount of money to be made available<br />
to the Commission is still being considered but it can expect more<br />
funds than have been available to the Film Development Corporation.<br />
I realise that there is still pressure within the film<br />
industry for a major change in the distribution and exhibition<br />
system for films within Australia. The Tariff Board did make some<br />
recommendations in this area. But Cabinet considered that the<br />
Constitutional barriers to the implementation of these recommendations<br />
were too great. Nevertheless we will continue to watch this area of<br />
the industry carefully to ensure as much as we can that the films<br />
released from Australia's New Wave receive adequate distribution<br />
and exhibition. The Government of course doesn't seek to stifle<br />
the showing of overseas films in Australia. On the contrary, it is<br />
part of our statedpolicy for all the arts that Australians can see<br />
important works from overseas. A large canvas which hangs in<br />
another public building in this city is controversial testimony to<br />
that desire. Similarly, we regard it as important that film makers<br />
and filmgoers are able to see the range of films that is offered at<br />
a festival such as this. As the Sydney Film Festival comes of age,<br />
I am glad, as the Head of a Government which has provided support<br />
for its activities, to declare it open. </p>
