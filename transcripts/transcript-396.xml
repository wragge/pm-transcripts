BROADCAST BY THE PRIME MINISTEIR THE RT. HON. R. G. MENZIES<br />
ON N. :. IONAL STATIONS ._ Ti 7. I P. M.<br />
THURSDAY. 16TH NOVEMBER, lL.<br />
Another Federal Election campaign is on. During the<br />
next few weeks you will no doubt, so long as you can put up with<br />
it, be bombarded with arguments and appeals. Many issues will<br />
be raised and disc-' s-d. Many claims will be made and rejected,<br />
and a good deal of dust will blow about,<br />
So perhaps I should get in early, before you are tired,<br />
with a few broad remarks.<br />
This is an election for the Commonwealth Parliament.<br />
That means an election for every seat in the House of<br />
Representatives, and for the retiring half of the Senate. On<br />
Polling Day, therefore, we vote for individual men or women, but<br />
for the most part we vote for them as the supporters of a Party<br />
with a body of ideas; a Party which hopes to form a Government.<br />
I am a Party man. After many years of experience I<br />
believe that there can be no coherence and stability in<br />
government, and no continuity of policy, unless Ministers have<br />
Party allegiance. Every now and then somebody will ask you to<br />
elect him as an " Independent". Why should you do so? A<br />
Government that was made up of " Independents" ould not last for<br />
a month, for there would be no common policy and no mutual<br />
loyalty. And what becomes of the individual Independent? He<br />
votes as he pleases; nobody can depend upon him from one week<br />
to another; if his vote, because of a near equality in the<br />
Parties is important, no government has any reasonable<br />
expectation of life, nor can it engage in that long term<br />
planning waich a modern and growing country needs.<br />
So, the true question in this election is whether you<br />
want to put my governmert out and put Labour in, or whether you<br />
dontt. There is no middle course.<br />
The business of governrment is the greatest business in<br />
the nation. Some people try to separate business from<br />
government; to set up hostility between them; to treat<br />
politicians as if they were innocent of those economic and<br />
financial matters which affect private citizens.<br />
This is a complete fallacy. A government can, by its<br />
financial and economic measures, create a climate in which<br />
enterprise is encouraged, the resources of the nation developed,<br />
much capital and technical skill invested, and future<br />
employment expanded. A bad goverinment can discourage enterprise,<br />
make the financing of development difficult, frighten off<br />
capital and technical growth, and, by opposing those elements<br />
which create employment opportunity, create the most acute<br />
social problems. Government, in short, is in a basic sense, the<br />
greatest business of all.<br />
What you have to decide at a General Election,<br />
therefore, is the broad business management of our country,<br />
Having set up this test, I want now, quite briefly,<br />
to apply it. </p>
<p>The Commonwealth Governnent has been in office for<br />
twelve years. They have broadly speaking, been twelve years of<br />
remarkable national and Individual progress and prosper! ty, By<br />
reason of good conditions at home and a vigorous policy of<br />
migration from abroad, the population of Australia has grown by<br />
at least a quarter. Production, both primary and secondary has<br />
grown notably. This is important because increased production<br />
is the essential condition of rising living standards. Savings<br />
and investment have increased. The average household has, from<br />
motor cars and refrigerators to radios and television sets, a<br />
degree of equipmeni f. r civilised living which few thought<br />
possible twelve years ago. Employment has been high, and the<br />
degree of ' 9' ustrial peace remarkable. Our international<br />
relations have added to our national security. We have means of<br />
transport which are the envy of most countries in the world. Our<br />
trade has grown so that we are one of the ten loading trading<br />
nations of the world. -e have the most remarkable facilities for<br />
enjoying our earned leisure. , Te are a free country and a happy<br />
one. i. f Australia, as a , ihole, was your business, would you<br />
change the management?<br />
Perhaps you would if you felt reasonably certain that,<br />
under new management, Australia, and you, would do even better.<br />
Let us, therefore, have a look at the proposed new management,<br />
and the new managers.<br />
The new management is that of the Socialist State.<br />
The new managers are the Australian Labour Party, acting under<br />
the binding instructions of the Federal Conference of the<br />
: 2ustralian Labour Party, a small body which y u do not elect at<br />
all. Let me repeat the words of the operative rule; they<br />
deserve to be well known<br />
" The Federal Conference of the Party shall be the supreme<br />
governing authority and policy making body and its<br />
decisions shall be binding upon all State Branches and<br />
affiliates thereto, and upon the Federal and State<br />
Parliamentary Labour Parties and upon the Federal<br />
Executive." The effective new managers who are offering to take<br />
over the national business are, therefore, almost entirely<br />
unknown to you. Those who offer themselves as the ostensible<br />
managers, Mr. Calwell and his Parliamentary colleagues, are<br />
notoriously divided into warring groups, with personal feuds,<br />
with a left-wing so aggressive that the bird finds it difficult<br />
to fly straight! My own government has enjoyed complete cohesion,<br />
internal loyalty and a concerted policy. Our opponents cannot<br />
even pretend to offer you these. They have never been able to<br />
clarify their relationships with the Australian Communist Party,<br />
the faithful local agents of the Communist powers which alone<br />
threaten the world with suicidal war. How can they be trusted<br />
to deal with your affairs?<br />
I referred to the " new management" being that of the<br />
Socialist State. For the Labour Party still stands for<br />
nationalisation and for Constitutional changes to make it<br />
possible. Before you vote for such a reactionary policy, and<br />
abandon the existing management, ask yourselves a few questions. </p>
<p>da 3.<br />
Would the great basic industries of coal, and iron and<br />
steel and copp r, and lead and zinc of engineering production,<br />
of all those things, the recent development of which is one of<br />
the great romances of Australian history, have grown so much or<br />
so fast under Socialist nationalisation? Who . ave provided the<br />
dynamic force in our development? Men and women who, under a<br />
system of free enterprise, have used their skill and capital and<br />
sense of adventure. You are all shareholders in Australia Unlimited. Will<br />
you choose as dire-t: t-s:: people who believe in you in what you<br />
can do given a fair break, and in the free spirit which has<br />
wrought suc'&gt; wonders, or those who believe in the all-powerful<br />
State, in whicih enterprise is discouraged, in which powerful<br />
contributions of capital and skill from overseas are resented<br />
and repelled, and in which the priceless independence of the<br />
individual is to be replaced by a docile dependence upon<br />
Government? These are gre. t basic questions. I hope they will not<br />
be obscured. For your answer to them will determine whether we are,<br />
as a nation, to go on in growth and progress, or fall back into<br />
confusicn and stagnation. </p>
<p>SUPPLEMENT.: RY<br />
The following statements could not, for<br />
reasons of time, be included in a Broadcast Speech<br />
limited to one huar. But they are issued for<br />
publi " tion conjointly , ith the main speech, which in<br />
some respects they amplify and explain. </p>
<p>COMyION JEALTH. AID OE ROADS<br />
In 194+ 9-50 the Comaonwealth paid œ 8,852,000 to the<br />
Stotes for roads. It is estimated that, in the present financial<br />
year, the Commonwealth will pay œ 50 millions!<br />
The present Commonwealth Aid Roads Act was passed in<br />
1959 to give effect to a scheme proposed by the Commonwealth,<br />
under which the Commonwealth undertook to provide over a five<br />
year period a total sun of up to œ 250 million to the States for<br />
roads. Under th". Lrrangement, which forms part of its<br />
developmental policy, the Commonwealth is to pay to the States<br />
during the five year period 1959 to 1964 " basic grants" of œ 220<br />
million and n additional sum of up to œ 30 million which ( subject<br />
to certain annaal limits) is to be payable on the basis of œ 1 for<br />
each œ 1 allocated by the State Governments from their own<br />
resources for expenditure on roads over and above the amounts<br />
they allocated for this purpose in 1958-59. The distribution of<br />
the grants over the five years is as follows:-<br />
Matching<br />
Basic Grant Assistance Total<br />
œ' 000 œ' 000 000<br />
1959-60 40,000 29000 42,000<br />
1960-61 42,000 4,000 46 000<br />
1961-62 44,000 6,000 50 000<br />
1962-63 46,000 8,000 54000<br />
1963-64 48,000 10,000 589000<br />
Total 220,000 30,000 250,000<br />
The amounts being made available by the Commonwealth<br />
will be distributed among the States in each year in the<br />
proportions of 5 per cent of the total for Tasmania and the<br />
balance shared among the other five States on the basis of<br />
one-third according to population as at the last preceding<br />
Census, one-third according to area and one-third according to<br />
vehicles registered at 31st December preceding the year<br />
concerned. The States are required to ensure that not less than<br />
per cent of the funds made available by the Commonwealth in<br />
each year is spent during that year on roads in rural areas,<br />
other than highways, main roads or trunk roads. The States may<br />
among them spend up to œ f1,000,000 of the amount made available<br />
by the Commonwealth in each year on works connected with<br />
transport by road or water, other than the construction,<br />
reconstruction and maintenance of roads. As under the previous<br />
legislation, the States are free to allocate to municipal or<br />
local authorities for roads purposes any part of the moneys<br />
received by them from the Cormmonwealth.<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS<br />
In 1949, towards the end of the term of the Chifley<br />
Government, there was much temporary unemployment caused by the<br />
Communist-inspired Coal Strike.<br />
In that year the basic wage was<br />
œ 6 9. per week </p>
<p>2. A.<br />
For an unemployed man with a wife and child, the<br />
unemployment benefit ( under tfl Labour Government's legislation<br />
of 1945) was 10. 0 per week<br />
In 1961 the Basic Wage was<br />
œ l4. 8. 0 per week<br />
Under the current legislation of the present<br />
Government, the unt.., pjoyment benefit for an unemployed man, wife<br />
and child, is œ 7. j 10. 0 per week<br />
The improvement is clear!<br />
HEALTH<br />
In health and health services the story of the last<br />
12 years is fantastic. In December 1941 there was no<br />
Commonwealth scheme operating to provide medical benefits.<br />
Today, no less than 7,000,000 people are covered by a<br />
great voluntary and co-operative scheme. The total benefits<br />
being paid out for no less than 35000,000 services is over<br />
œ 22 million, of which the Commonwealth pays neaiy œ 10 million.<br />
Under a greatly improved Hospital Benefits arrangement,<br />
the Commonwealth and the registered organisations between them<br />
are now finding over œ 32 million a year.<br />
The Pensioner Medical Service, pharmaceutical benefits<br />
for pensioners, has proved a godsend to pensioners.<br />
The Pharmaceutic. l Benefits Scheme, as a whole, has<br />
risen from a few pounds to over œ 27 million!<br />
Our great contributions to the treatment of T. 3. and<br />
mental ill-health are no doubt well-known, as is what we have<br />
done in the manufacture and free provision of the Salk vaccine<br />
against poliomyelitis. This is a short, but revolutionary, story. A growing<br />
nation must be a healthy one. Our policy of strength and growth<br />
is all pervasive, and expresses itself in many ways.<br />
N2J GUINEA AND PAPUA<br />
We continue to discharge our great responsibilities<br />
for the advancement and good government of these territories,<br />
The statement made a few weeks ago by my colleague, Mr. Hasluck,<br />
on targets for future social and economic progress, has<br />
attracted favourable interest both in Australia and abroad. oe<br />
are spending more each year, and will continue to do so for a<br />
long time. But our record in helping primitive neighbours in<br />
this way will stand comparison anywhere in the world.<br />
ABORIGINES<br />
Despite some carping criticisms, our record in raising<br />
the standards of the aboriginal peoples is a good one. Not long<br />
ago we solved the problem of providing them with social services<br />
of the normal character. In our oun special area of<br />
responsibility, the Northern Territory, great strides have been<br />
taken in the direction of catering for their hunan and social<br />
needs. </p>
<p>3. A<br />
An all-party Parliamentary Select Committee<br />
appointed on the motion of the Government, has recently brought<br />
down a report on the problem of voting by aborigines. We will<br />
give that report careful study and most sympathetic consideration<br />
in the new Parliament. CO, 0STI TUTIONAL<br />
An all-party committee made a close investigction of<br />
the working of the Commonwealth Constitution, and recommended a<br />
large number of ar-nrnentsø Time has not permitted us to reach<br />
conclusions on such complex matters. I therefore need say no<br />
more in a Policy Speech, than that should we decide to promote<br />
any amendmn-' t or amendments, the constitutional procedures for a<br />
referendum w-ll give the people the right to decide the matter.<br />
We do not propose to have a general election confused by<br />
speculative constitutional arguments which may or may not arise,<br />
and which, if they do arise, will be decided by a quite<br />
independent popular vote. HOUSING<br />
The -rowing nation for which we are working, with<br />
increased pcpulation and rising standards of living, must be<br />
given a proper chance to be . rall-housed. Above all things, we<br />
want a home-owning democracy. Though the problem of housing,<br />
whether by governments or private citizens, is under the<br />
constitutional distribution of powers, primarily one for the<br />
States ( except in Commonwealth Territories), my own Goverilment<br />
can present a remarkable record of voluntary performance, a<br />
record which we would wish to add to in the next Parliament,<br />
working as always, in co-operation with State Governments, who<br />
are fully conscious of the needs.<br />
Since 1950, 907,000 houses and flats have been<br />
constructed in Australia, most of them being for ownership.<br />
Towards this remarkable total, which will more than stand<br />
comparison with any other country, the Commonwealth Government<br />
has found no less than C780m' in * ar Service Homes alone, which<br />
are our special and honourable responsibility we have found<br />
œ 350million, which you may care to compare with a total of<br />
œ 3 million over the previous thirty years of the Scheme, which<br />
began in 1919. RESTRICTIVE Ph ICTICES<br />
We desire, in co-operation with State Governments, to<br />
do something to protect and strengthen free productive and<br />
business enterprise against monopoly or restrictive practices.<br />
The attorney-General has done a great deal of work both here and<br />
in overseas countries, such as Great 3ritain and the U. SOAO,<br />
where special laws exist. The matter is very complex and is in<br />
Australia affected by the division of powers between<br />
Commonwealth and States. It would be most undesirable to have an<br />
elaborate system of government controls which restricted true<br />
development, efficiency, and enterprise. On the other hand, the<br />
public interest must be paramount; exploitation must not occur.<br />
The Attorney-General's investigations and conferences<br />
have not yet reached a point at which Cabinet decisions can be<br />
taken. dhen such decisions are taken and legislation prepared,<br />
we will, having introduced the legislation, allow it to be open<br />
to public examination and criticism for six months so that no<br />
proper consideration will be overlooked. </p>
<p>INDUSTRIAL RBLFATI ONS<br />
All the efforts we may make to secure a favourable<br />
economic climate for investment and development can be largely<br />
frustrated if a great deal of working and producing time is lost<br />
by industrial disputes. Our opponents have regularly asserted<br />
that only they, with their Union contacts, can secure<br />
industrial peace. The facts are that in no year since 1951 has<br />
the number of days lost from industrial disputes been as large<br />
as those lost in any year from 1945 to 1949. There are many<br />
thousands of young uen and women who will vote on December 9th<br />
who were children ii, 1949, and who may be tempted to take for<br />
granted the state of affairs which they have known for twelve<br />
years. I ni them to know thiat such things as industrial peace,<br />
continuity Q. work, do not happen by accident. Our industrial<br />
policies, fitting into our whole conception of national growth,<br />
have been directed to these ends. It is not out of place to<br />
point out that today many thousands of employees are also<br />
shareholders in the enterprises in which they work. This<br />
broadens the co-operative spirit which is essential to success<br />
and to continuity of woak. </p>
