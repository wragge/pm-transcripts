    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME gVIINISTER Lj j<br />FOR MEDIA 4 SEPTEMBER<br />PRIME MINISTER'S RESPONSE TO WELCOMING<br />ADDRESSES BY PRESIDENT REDDY AND<br />PRIME MINISTER GANDHI AT CHOGRM<br />Your Excellency, President Reddy, Heads of State, Heads of<br />Government, Secretary General, distinguished guests, ladies<br />and gentlemen. It gives me the greatest pleasure to respond to the<br />gracious words of welcome addressed to us by His Excellency<br />President Reddy and Prime Minister Gandhi.<br />This second regional meeting of Commonwealth leads of<br />Government is, very appropriately, being hosted by the country<br />whose independence, 32 years ago, set in train that iihternational<br />decolonisation movement which eventually led to the creation of<br />the free and equal Commonwealth of Nations whose members we are.<br />This meeting is being held in one of the great democratic<br />capitals of the world. It is a fitting place for our<br />deliberations. I join most readily and happily in welcoming the Heads<br />of Government of those countries whose independence has been<br />achieved since the first meeting Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Solomon<br />Islands and Vanuatu. I trust that they will find this a congenial<br />and rewarding forum.</p>
<p>The first Commonwealth He-ads of Gov, rnjiiert recjicnii*<br />meeting,. the latest in viny innovations in the e-. volving p1t:<br />of Corrurionwealth consultation., was held two and a half years ago<br />' in Sydney. The thinking behind this initiative was that we,<br />unlike most of our other Commonwealth colleagues, lackled an<br />alternative regional arrangement outside the Coji-anonwealth vi-lich<br />brought us all togelther on a regu lar basis: se cond, that scme of<br />the smnaller and more remote imen-ters \*/ oUid find a nicet; Lng<br />particularly beneficial. For Pustralia arid I belie-ve for o'c<br />in the eastern pait of the region the arranc-c-rn had theÃ±<br />particular attiu: Li on of strengthening our lik; with the<br />sub-continent.

<p>Mr President, I have put the stress firmly on the<br />practical and I believe that this is where it should be.<br />But as we meet here we cannot ignore the fact that in the two<br />years since our last meeting in Sydney there have been momentous<br />changes on the wider international scene. It is difficult to<br />see inany of these as anything but changes for the worst.<br />The world is now breathing a harsher air and the decade we<br />have just-entered promises to be a troubled and dangerous<br />one. We in this chamber cannot contemplate these changes<br />with detachment and indifference, since some of them iminge<br />very directly on our region and have implications for its<br />future. I do not think we should be embarrassed or inhibited<br />because there exist among us some differences of interpretation<br />as to the causes and nature of some of these events. We have<br />different perspectives historical as well as geographical<br />and different interests which make such divergences inevit: *. le.<br />It is healthier to recognise this rather than to pretend<br />that it is not so.<br />But there is no need either to dwell on these<br />differences or to make them the focus of our discussions.<br />For I am sure that, however we interpret events, none of us<br />can be complacent about their actual and potential consequences<br />for the region. The intrusion of great power rivalries*,<br />detcriorating relations between some of the states within<br />the region; attempts to divide existing states; the human<br />mI'sery, anid the strain on resources, represented by hundreds<br />of thousands of refugees these are facts which, regardless<br />of what interpretation of causes is accepted, represent<br />impediments to the goal of stable and continuous development<br />in the region.</p>
<p>-4-<br />Insofar as wediscuss recent di. Eturbanccs arnd cocnfLicL.,<br />at this meeting, therEfore, I be'lieve that we should do so<br />looking forward, in terms-of ho-w. we can Jlive with and respond<br />to co. nsequencen, rather than lool-inq back-wards in tcerms OIC<br />origins and the attributing of blaime.<br />In approachingj those questions . we might welbear<br />in mind and tahe heart from the major contributions ~ b<br />the Comnmonwealthi to the resolution of the scemiincily irtreZctibl-:<br />problems of Zirtihal~ we last y e ar That contribution demonstra&amp; ted<br />that the smnaller and iniddlc.-si;, od, countric-s of the world need<br />not be waithout infl. uernce.
