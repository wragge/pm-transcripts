PRIME MINISTER THURSDAY 28 FEBRUARY 1980<br />
From the Press Office SUMMARY OF AM<br />
Afghanistan and. the Olympic boycott: this week saw the issue<br />
become the subject of a bitter and divisive party Political<br />
debate in Federal Parliament, with a scathing attack on the<br />
Prime Minister by the Leader of the Opposition and Mr. Fraser<br />
accusing the Labor Party of trying to find excuses for the<br />
Russian invasion of Afghanistan. The Prime Minister is with us<br />
this morning speaking to Warwick Adderley.<br />
Question<br />
Well Prime Minister do you regret the manner in which Afghanistan<br />
and the question of an Olympic boycott has turned into a bitter<br />
party political debate.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Oh of course I do because the Government set out very firmly to<br />
try and establish the circumstances in which we could have and<br />
would have a bipartisan policy in relation to Afghanistan.<br />
Question<br />
What steps did you take to seek a bipartisan policy Mr. Fraser?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
If you could just let finish an answer please and in the introduction<br />
to this programme you, whoever did the introduction, whoever wrote<br />
it, inadvertently fell into an error, which I think was perpetrated<br />
yesterday when it said that I had put it that the Labor Party as<br />
a whole was trying to find excuses for the Soviets over Afghanistan.<br />
I said there was a thread in the Labor Party. That's quite a<br />
different matter. and it happens to be totally accurate and it is<br />
because of that that the efforts that the Government has taken to<br />
try and establish an effective boycott of the Olympic Gamnes, for<br />
example, and other effective measures, has been sought to be<br />
undermined in the debates and the discussions that have gone on.<br />
I think this is regrettable and most unfortunate.<br />
Question Mr. Hayden claims that by referring to that thread you're impuning<br />
the patriotism of Labor politicians. Was that your intention?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
If Mr. Hayden is taking that view he has an extraordinary sensitivity<br />
which is surprising after his period in the Parliament. Because<br />
let me demonstrate why I said it. There is one Labor member and I<br />
do not want to mention names, but if you wish to look up the Hansard's<br />
it is all there there is one Labor member who has made it plain<br />
that it is a Russian presence, not an invasion, not a suppression,<br />
not an occupation. Now if that isn't making excuses being an<br />
apologist I don't know what is.<br />
Question But in referring to a response to either a Russian invasion or a </p>
<p>Russian occupation or a Russian presence, is opposition to a<br />
boycott un-Australian?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The Leader of the Opposition has said that a boycott of the Olympic<br />
Games would be one of the most effective means of bringing the<br />
abhorrence of the free world through to the Russian Government and<br />
to the Russian people; and with that we are at one. He is record<br />
as having said that very plainly in the Hansard. Then he said if<br />
there is international support of course he will support it. Then<br />
a little later he said there is not sense and no justice in a<br />
continued pressure for a boycott of the Moscow Games by the<br />
Australian athletes.<br />
Question Can I draw your attention to the point of my question Mr. Fraser.<br />
Under the present circumstances is opposition to a boycott<br />
un-Australian?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
If you allow me to answer the question without interrupting and<br />
if you are going to continually interrupt then all right so be it.<br />
But I would be grateful if you would allow me to answer the<br />
question before interrupting and we will make more progress quicker.<br />
I am making the point that Mr. Hayden said quite plainly that a<br />
boycott would bring the message through to the Russians and the<br />
Russian people very effectively. Then he said there is no sense<br />
and no justice in a boycott. And he ended up his statement in<br />
the Parliament yesterday by saying if there is an effective boycott<br />
the opposition supports it. That's fine but if it wants to support<br />
it why won't it work for it? Why does it do everything possible<br />
to try and prevent the effective boycott being established as far<br />
as Australia is concerned when he knows that this is the one thing<br />
that can bring the message home to the whole of the Soviet people.<br />
Now that's a great question that he has to answer.<br />
Question Is not working for a boycott un-Australian?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
You introduced this term ' un-Australian', I didn't.<br />
Question No on the contrary Mr. Fraser, Mr. Hayden introduced the question<br />
of patriotism and I'm trying to explore that issue.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
You have introduced the question of un-Australian, I didn't and I<br />
am not making any charges about patriotism. I said Mr. Hayden<br />
was too sensitive. The question I asked him is if he says a boycott,<br />
as he does, is an effective means of getting the message through to<br />
the Soviet people, and-it is an invasion and a suppression of a<br />
people we are talking about, not a Russian presence, and if he says<br />
there is going to be an effective boycott, the Labor Party then<br />
supports it in those circumstances why will he not work for it?<br />
why does he then have to work against it as he so patently has. </p>
<p>Question Mr. Fraser can we turn to your view that the Russian invasion poses<br />
the most serious threat to world stability and peace since World<br />
War II. It's been reported that the Office of National Assessments<br />
advised you that that wasn't the case before your trip overseas<br />
and that the occupation was merely defensive and didn't pose a<br />
threat to Western oil supplies. Is that true?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No it is not true. And that report happens not to be true. There<br />
is a particular device by which Mr. Hayden can be briefed through<br />
the office of National Assessments. He asked my office and I<br />
would normally approve-and Mr. Furlonger would give him a briefing.<br />
That request was not made. That briefing was not made. Mr.<br />
Hayden was not briefed. Many people differ as to the reasons why<br />
the Soviets went into Afghanistan. But all the Government's<br />
advisors agree that once they are in Afghanistan, as they are, that<br />
opens up opportunities for further adventures by the Soviet Union,<br />
opportunities which in all their history, they have shown themselves<br />
only too willing to take. It's not only in Afghanistan that we have<br />
to look for this lesson, buic in Africa, where they have armed<br />
40,000 Cuban troops, in Vietnam and in Kampuchea, in northeast<br />
Africa and now in Afghanistan, in nearly part of the world they<br />
are the only country that has been promoting and supporting<br />
subversion, invasion, destruction.<br />
Question If then, the situation is as serious as you say, d * o you regret not<br />
having sought a bipartisan approach over Australia's response<br />
before announcing a boycott?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We did take a bipartisan approach and Mr. Hayden has said in the<br />
initial stages that a boycott would be an effective means of<br />
bringing the message home through to the Russian people. And<br />
on that basis, we were entitled to expect that he would support it.<br />
And I still am puzzled as to why he doesn't.<br />
Question You actually approached-Mr. Hayden over it?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Would you please let me answer a question. It is a great habit of<br />
the ABC to interrupt but so be it. Mr. Hayden had made is perfectly<br />
plain that he believed the boycott would be the effective way of<br />
getting a message through. Since he criticised and strongly<br />
criticised, which I applaud, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan<br />
the natural result of that one would have thought would be that Mr.<br />
Hayden would support the boycott now he does not. This time he<br />
has gone on to say if there is ultimately an effective boycott of<br />
course he would support it. But if he believes an effective boycott<br />
is necessary to get the message home you have to work for what you<br />
believe not Just sit on the sidelines and say other people can do<br />
it. .4 </p>
<p>Question If the Government and the Opposition then are divided at the<br />
moment, are you prepared to make that division an election issue?<br />
Prime minister.<br />
Oh look I am not going to talk about elections in this matter.<br />
It would be much much better if Australia can have one policy<br />
in relation to these matters. You have only got to look at the<br />
way the British Labor Party supported the present British Tory<br />
Government in relation to these particular matters. They didn' 1t<br />
seek to get in and undermine and undercut what Prime Minister<br />
Thatcher is doing, but to establish an effective response and<br />
people really do need to understand what all this is about. The<br />
Soviets have moved into Afghanistan.-the largest and most<br />
powerful land army in the world a small non-aligned, inoffensive<br />
State, you said it-was defensive reasons, but Afghanistan could<br />
never have offered any threat to the Soviet Union and the whole<br />
world knows that.<br />
Question<br />
Mr. Fraser that's where we'll have to leave it we are running<br />
out of time. Thank you very much for joining us.<br />
It seems that the Soviet Union may be trying to find a-way out of<br />
its problems in Afghanistan. Reports from London indicate that<br />
the Soviets may support a British proposal to the EEC that<br />
Afghanistan be given the status of a neutral state. Mark Colvin<br />
reports. The British Foreign Office is denying that it has<br />
received messages from the Kremlin expressing support for the idea<br />
of a neutral Afghanistan. But a report published in London's<br />
Evening News states categorically that such messages have been<br />
received in White Hall. The British initiated the proposal at<br />
last week's EEC meeting and Lord Carrington has been following it<br />
up in meetings with his counterparts around Europe. The proposal<br />
was originally something of a gamble based on the theory that<br />
Russia' s invasion had been intended as a stern warning to Soviet<br />
Islamic minorities. The idea was that the Kremlin might now be<br />
searching for just this kind of face-saving device. The political<br />
editor of the Evening News said he has seen informal messages from<br />
high Kremlin sources to White Hall, which indicate that this may<br />
indeed be the case. and which urge Lord Carrington to keep pushing<br />
the neutralisation proposal. There is no question that the United<br />
States is in favour of the EEC proposal. President Carter has<br />
already publicly endorsed it and what could improve its chances of<br />
success with the Soviet Union is its stress on flexibility. I<br />
was given to understand in Rome that an agreement on a neutral<br />
Afghanistan need have no political strings attached and-the British<br />
at any rate, would not object to a communist government in Kabul<br />
as long as it was an elected government. However Lord Carrington<br />
made it clear then that many details had still to be worked out.<br />
David Willis reports from Moscow that it has been equally hard to<br />
obtain an unequivocal indication of Soviet reaction to the proposal<br />
for a neutral Afghanistan.<br />
Diplomats, including an American Ambassador have been taken<br />
hostage in yet another guerrilla attack on an Embassy. This one<br />
in Colombia in South America. Geoff McMullen reports from<br />
Washington. </p>
