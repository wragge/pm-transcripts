rIBtAUU: 7 IP. M. OUNDAY<br />
QUEENSLAND BROADCAST NO, 16<br />
THE SENATE<br />
SUNDAY 6 JULY 1975<br />
WHEN SENATOR BERT MILLINER DIED LAST<br />
WEEK QUEENSLAND LOST ONE OF ITS ABLEST AND BEST LOV ED<br />
PARLIAMENTARIANS. BERT MILLINER WAS A FAMILY FRIEND<br />
OF MINE, SO IT'IS NATURAL THAT I SHOULD FEEL STRONGLY.<br />
ABOUT HIM. BUT LET ME JUST SAY THIS: HE SERVED HIS<br />
UNION, HIS PARTY AND THE AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT FOR<br />
MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY WITH GREAT<br />
DISTINCTION AND THE UTMOST INTEGRITY. MY COLLEAGUES<br />
ADIWILL M1i33 HIM KEENLY.<br />
WAS SORRY TO SEE, WITHIN A FEW HOURS.<br />
OF HIS DEATH, A WELTER OF SPECULATION IN THE MEDIA ABOUT<br />
WHETHER THE lQUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT WOULD APPOINT<br />
ANOTHER LABOR SE-NATOR TO REPLACE HIM. IDON'IT WANT<br />
TO SOUND SANCTIMONIOUS ABOUT THESE THINGS, BECAUSE WE<br />
ALWAYS HAVE TO FACE THE REALITIES OF POLITICS; BUT THE<br />
POINT IS THAT AT NO STAGE SHOULD THERE HAVE BEEN THE<br />
SLIGHTEST DOUBT ABOUT THE PROPER AND HONOURABLE COURSE<br />
FOR THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.<br />
YET WHAT HAPPENS? THE QUEENSLAND PREMIER STALLED.<br />
HE REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS CLEAR OBLIGATION TO REPLACE<br />
SENATOR MILLINER WITH ANOTHER SENATOR FROM THE SAME PARTY.<br />
HE WENT ON ABOUT THE NEED TO CONSIDER THE MATTER, TO KEEP<br />
THE PRIME-MINISTER. GUESSING AS IF THE INTERESTS OF<br />
QUEENSLAND VOTERS WERE THE LAST THING THAT MATTERED. </p>
<p>2.<br />
YOU'LL REMEMBER THAT WHEN SENATOR LIONEL<br />
MURPHY RESIGNED FROM THE SENATE EARLIER THIS YEAR,<br />
THE NEW SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT FLEW IN THE FACE OF THE<br />
LONG-ESTABLISHED AND HITHERTO UNBROKEN CONVENTION<br />
THAT CASUAL VACANCIES IN THE SENATE SHOULD BE FILLED<br />
BY A PERSON OF THE SAME PARTY AS THE SENATOR WHOSE<br />
PLACE WAS BEING TAKEN. MR LEWIS SHOULD HAVE HAD NO<br />
HESITATION IN DOING THE RIGHT AND PROPER THING<br />
IN STICKING BY THE RULES OF THE GAME. INSTEAD HE<br />
DECIDED TO PLAY IT SMART. HE BROKE THE RULES<br />
AND APPOINTED A NON-LABOR MAN. IT DIDN'T MATTER TO HIM<br />
THAT HIS OWN PARTY, INCLUDING MR SNEDDEN WHO WAS<br />
TIHEN ITS LEADER AND EVEN THE SENATE ITSELF URGED<br />
HIM TO STICK 3Y THE RULES AND DO THE PROPER THING.<br />
HE BROKE ONE : F ThE FUNDAMENTAL CONVENTIONS OF OUR<br />
DEMOCRATIC E~ 1, AND WHENEVER THAT HAPPENS THERE<br />
IS ALWAYS A 7EMPTATION TO BREAK THE RULES AGAIN, THE<br />
ROT SETS IN. ONCE A RULE IS BROKEN, OR A CONVENTION<br />
DEFIED FOR THE SAKE OF SHORT TERM POLITICAL ADVANTAGE,<br />
THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS WEAKENED. So IT'S NOT SURPRISING<br />
THAT MR BJELKE-PETERSEN HAS BEEN TEMPTED, AND Nd DOUBT<br />
ENCOURAGED, TO " DO A LEWIS". I CAN ONLY SAY THAT WHILE<br />
MR BJELKE-PETERSEN ANDI HAVE OUR DISAGREEMENTS<br />
OCCASIONALLY, I HAVE A CERTAIN RESPECT FOR<br />
I AM HOPEFUL THAT IN SENATOR MILLINER'S CASE HE WILL DO<br />
THE RIGHT AND PROPER THING AND APPOINT A LABOR PARTY<br />
SUCCESSOR. QUITE FRANKLY, IT WILL BE SCANDALOUS IF<br />
HE DOES OTHERWISE. s ./ 3 </p>
<p>3,<br />
NO DOUBT THERE ARE ELEMENTS IN THE<br />
OPPOSITION WHO FEEL THAT, BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF<br />
A SENATOR'S DEATH, THEY CAN BOOST THEIR OWN<br />
NUMBERS IN THE SENATE AND BE ABLE MORE EASILY TO<br />
BLOCK THE GOVERNMENT'S LEGISLATION, WHAT WE HAVE<br />
TO REMEMBER IS THE SHEER INIQUITY OF THESE TACTICS,<br />
IT CANNOT BE STRESSED TOO OFTEN THAT THE OPPOSITION<br />
HAS NO RIGHT WHATEVER TO BLOCK GOVERNMENT MEASURES<br />
FOR WHICH THE PEOPLE HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR SUPPORT<br />
THROUGH THE BALLOT BOX. A LITTLE WHILE AGO MR<br />
FRASER WAS MAKING MUCH OF HIS NEW-FOUND SENSE<br />
OF RESPONSIBILITY IN DECLARING THAT THE OPPOSITION..<br />
iOULD NOT FRUSTRATE THE ELECTED GOVERNMENT'S<br />
PROGRAM. IN FACT, THE OLD CAMPAIGN OF OBSTRUCTION<br />
HAS CONT-INUE AS BEFORE. I CAN GIVE YOU A WHOLE<br />
LIST OF BILLS WHICH HAVE BEEN REJECTED OR DELAYED<br />
OR UNACCE. PTALY AMENDED IN THE SENATE OUR<br />
REDISTRIBUTION PROPOSALS, OUR BILL TO MODERNISE<br />
AND SIMPLIFY THE ELECTORAL LAWS, OUR BILLS TO<br />
ABOLISH APPEALS TO THE PRIVY COUNCIL, TO ESTABLISH<br />
A SUPERIOR COURT OF AUSTRALIA, TO DEAL WITH SHADY<br />
PRACTICES IN THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY AND W<br />
THE STOCK MARKETS, TO ESTABLISH A GOVERNMENT<br />
PURCHASING COMMISSION, TO PROVIDE SIMULTANEOUS<br />
ELECTIONS FOR THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF<br />
REPRESENTATIVES. .9 / 4 </p>
<p>EVEN MORE SERIOUS THAN THESE ABUSES<br />
IS THE BELIEF, FOSTERED BY THE OPPOSITION AND ITS<br />
FRIENDS, THAT THE OPPOSITION CAN FORCE AN ELECTION<br />
WHENEVER IT SUITS THEM. I ASK AUSTRALIANS TO<br />
KEEP IN MIND THE ENORMITY, THE MONSTROUS INJUSTICE<br />
OF THIS PROPOSITION. UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS ONE MORE<br />
CASE OF A RULE ONCE BROKEN BEING EASIER TO BREAK<br />
AGAIN. WE ALL KNOW THAT THE OPPOSITION LAST YEAR<br />
FORCED AN ELECTION AHEAD OF TIME BY REFUSING SUPPLY<br />
IN THE SENATE. THE SENATE WAS ABLE TO TURN OUT<br />
A GOVERNMENT DULY ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE ONLY<br />
16 MONTHS BEFORE' THE OPPOSITION PAID HEAVILY FOR<br />
THAT, BUT THERE IS LITTLE SIGN THAT THEY HAVE<br />
LEARNT THEIR LESSON OR ACKNOWLEDGED, NOT JUST THE<br />
FOLLY, 3UT SHEER IMMORALITY OF THEIR ACTION.<br />
GOVERNMENTS ':-EVITABLY HAVE THEIR UPS AND DOWNS,<br />
AND Ji<br />
GOVERNMENT S GOING THROUGH A VERY STICKY PATCH AT<br />
THE MOMENT. BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THE<br />
FUNDAMENTAL ? RINCIPLE OF ALL WESTMINSTER-STYLE<br />
DEMOCRACIES: GOVERNMENTS ARE MADE AND UNMADE, NOT<br />
IN THE UPPER SOUSE, NOT IN THE SENATE, BUT IN THE LOWER<br />
HOUSE, THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE, THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,<br />
GOVERNMENTS WOULD BE QUITE UNWORKABLE IF THEY COULD<br />
BE TOSSED OUT BY AN UPPER HOUSE HALF WAY, OR EVEN A<br />
THIRD OR A QUARTER OF THE WAY THROUGH THEIR TERMS<br />
MERELY BECAUSE IT SUITED THE OPPOSITION TO EXPLOIT<br />
A TEMPORARY ADVANTAGEa </p>
<p>I WAS APPALLED THE OTHER DAY, FOR EXAMPLE.<br />
WHEN THE VIESTERN AUSTRALIAN PREMIER, SIR CHARLES<br />
COURT, SAID THAT THE DECISION ON WHETHER TO HAVE AN<br />
ELECTION WAS ENTIRELY ONE FOR MR FRASER. THE DECISION<br />
HAS NEVER BEEN ONE FOR MR FRASER, IT IS NOT A DECISION<br />
FOR THE SENATE; STILL LESS IS IT A DECISION FOR THE<br />
LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION. BUT IF PEOPLE KEEP<br />
SAYING THAT MIR FRASER IS THE ONE TO DECIDE,<br />
EVENTUALLY A FEW PEOPLE WILL BELIEVE IT. IT'S THE<br />
OLD TECHNIQUE OF-THE BIG LIE THE LIE REPEATED<br />
OFTEN ENOUGH TILL IT GAINS RESPECTABILITY.<br />
THE WHOLE IDEA IS INTOLERABLE, A TRAVESTY OF JUSTICE<br />
AND DEMOCRACY. IHE PEOPLE ELECTED THE GOVERNMENT<br />
A NORMAL 7-. EE--YEAR TERM. THEY ELECTED US TO<br />
-ARRY OUT A WE ARE DOING JUST THAT AND<br />
DUE COURSE, E-N THE TIME COMES, WE WILL SUBMIT<br />
*: LURSELVES TO 7T-E PEOPLE' S JUDGMENT. IT WOULD BE<br />
" 3SURD IF AN El-ECT-D GOVERNMENT IN THE HOUSE OF<br />
-R. RESENTATiVEWSE RE TO DEPEND ON THE CHANCE<br />
EXPLOITATION CF THE HEALTH OF INDIVIDUAL SENATORS OR<br />
OBSCURE TECHNICALITIES IN THE SENATE VOTING SYSTEM.<br />
AMID ALL THE CLAPOUR AND HYSTERIA OF THE MOMENT,<br />
ALL THE RED HERRINGS AND UNSUBSTANTIATED CHARGES<br />
OF THE OPPOSITION AND THE SENSATIONALISM OF THE PRESS,<br />
REMEMBER THAT IT IS THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WHICH<br />
ALONE DETERMINES WHO SHALL BE THE GOVERNMENT OF THIS<br />
COUNTRY, </p>
