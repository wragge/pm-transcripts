CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THlE PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA<br />
THE NON R J7 L HAWKE AC 14P<br />
ARRIVAL STATEMENT<br />
WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON 27 JUNE 1989<br />
Mr President,<br />
It's an immense pleasure for me, in these three days in<br />
Washington, to renew our long friendship; and it is a<br />
special pleasure and privilege to join with you, as the<br />
elected chief of the greatest democracy, in re-affirming the<br />
deep and enduring friendship of our two countries. In you,<br />
Hr President, the Western world has an experienced and<br />
forward-looking leader and Australia has a valued and<br />
long-standing friend.<br />
Today, Hr President, I look forward to continuing the<br />
exchange of views, on all the issues affecting our<br />
countries, in the spirit of friendship and frankness which<br />
has always characterised our association, and which befits<br />
the relationship the partnership between Australia and,<br />
the United States.<br />
Mr President, we are meeting at a time of historic and<br />
far-reaching change across the world.<br />
There now exist unparalled new opportunities, challenges and<br />
responsibilities for leadership and positive achievement on<br />
crucial issues of peace and security, East-West relations,<br />
economic progress, world trade, and the protection of the<br />
world environment.<br />
You have already demonstrated, Mr President, your<br />
determination to give leadership. Your constructive<br />
approach to East-West relations is demonstrated by your<br />
creative and bold proposal for the reduction of conventional<br />
weapons in Europe. In this, and other arms control<br />
endeavours, aimed at reducing nuclear armaments and banning<br />
chemical weapons, you know you can count on Australia's<br />
support. </p>
<p>In this new and challenging era, the constancy, depth and<br />
vitality of the alliance between Australia and the United<br />
States will remain critically important to the national<br />
interests of both our countries. But it has a wider<br />
regional and, indeed, global significance. Under ANZUS, the<br />
joint Australia-US defence facilities in Australia are<br />
significant elements in maintaining the peace and supporting<br />
the effectiveness of arms control and disarmament<br />
agreements.<br />
over recent years our co-operation and consultations at the<br />
highest levels have been stronger, broader and more<br />
productive than at any other time since ANZUS was formed.<br />
But our relationship goes far beyond our defence alliance.<br />
It encompasses dynamic economic links and broad and deep<br />
human and cultural associations.<br />
Above all, it is based on the firmest of foundations: our<br />
shared commitment to democracy and to individual liberty<br />
within the rule of law.<br />
Mr President, it is precisely because of the depth and<br />
maturity of our relationship that the differences of views<br />
that do exist between us can be faced openly and honestly<br />
as, for example, on some trade matters, particularly aspects<br />
of agricultural policy.<br />
I am confident that today we will be able to focus on ways<br />
to minimise, if not entirely resolve, such differences. I<br />
look forward to exploring with you means of co-operating in<br />
the current Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations<br />
to achieve some progress towards the goal we both want an<br />
international trading system based on free and fair<br />
competition. I know we both understand that moving in the<br />
opposite direction, towards a world of separate and<br />
competing trade blocs, would be economically disastrous and,<br />
quite possibly, strategically destabilising.<br />
That is one of the reasons, I might add, why earlier this<br />
year I suggested the development of closer regional economic<br />
co-operation in the Asia-Pacific region. The implementation<br />
of my proposal could, I believe, improve significantly the<br />
chances for success in the Uruguay Round as well as acting<br />
as a catalyst for further growth in our dynamic region.<br />
I am very keen, Mr President, to exchange views with you on<br />
this proposal. I welcome, indeed, secretary Baker's support<br />
last night for a new mechanism for multilateral co-operation<br />
among the nations of the region as an idea whose time has<br />
come. I am delighted that the United States supports my<br />
call for a Ministerial meeting this year as a first step, if<br />
-as I hope and expect there is a consensus in the region. </p>
<p>And I make this final point: the American presence has been<br />
a prime factor in creating and maintaining the conditions<br />
for stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
America's continuing involvement in our region remains a key<br />
to its future progress.<br />
Mr President, we have before us an imposing agenda for<br />
dialogue. What gives this visit arnd our discussions their<br />
real substance, however, and what will make them so mutually<br />
beneficial, is the sense of common purpose we bring to these<br />
matters based on our common national and international<br />
interests and our common commitment to peace and freedom.<br />
I thank you again, Mr President, for the warmth of your<br />
welcome. You have visited Australia as Vice-President. I<br />
look forward to welcoming you to our country as President<br />
of the United States, as a true friend of Australia. </p>
