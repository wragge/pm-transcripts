    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce funding of $4 million for 63 projects across</p>
<p> Australia that involve local community groups and the government working</p>
<p> together to combat illicit drug use, especially among young people.</p>
<p>This is an important component of the government's Tough on Drugs</p>
<p> Strategy and is another example of the social coalition at work to address</p>
<p> difficult social issues.</p>
<p>By working in partnership, the government, community groups, business</p>
<p> and committed individuals can be more effective in the fight against drug</p>
<p> abuse.</p>
<p>The Community Partnerships Initiative began in 1997 and has marked Australia</p>
<p> as a world leader in encouraging responses that involve the whole community</p>
<p> working together to solve drug problems.</p>
<p>Today's funding announcement will directly assist groups like the</p>
<p> Plenty Valley Community Health Service in Victoria with its "Youth</p>
<p> Input" project which will involve young people directly in developing</p>
<p> preventative measures to combat illicit drug use.</p>
<p>The grants cover projects in all states and territories. Recipients in</p>
<p> New South Wales include the Macarthur Drug and Alcohol Youth Project's</p>
<p> "Parent Links" programme to run information and awareness sessions</p>
<p> for parents to encourage greater involvement in drug prevention and education.</p>
<p>These are grass roots projects that involve practical steps to fight</p>
<p> drug abuse in local communities by drawing on the skills and understanding</p>
<p> of community organisations, supported by government funding.</p>
<p>I commend each of the programme recipients for their work in this difficult</p>
<p> area.</p>
