    <content><![CDATA[<p>Parliament will honour Australiaâs World Champion netballers with an official reception on Thursday.</p>
<p>As the ânetball dadâ in a family of ânetball tragicsâ, I was particularly excited by the Diamondsâ World Cup victory.</p>
<p>This was our eleventh Netball World Cup win and, remarkably, the third in a row. I congratulate the Diamonds, magnificently led by Laura Geitz, on their brilliant victory.</p>
<p>The team showed exceptional skill, commitment, professionalism and courage â the last quality exemplified by Julie Corletto, who played the final with a broken foot.</p>
<p>Womenâs sport does not always get the attention it deserves.</p>
<p>On behalf of our country and its more than one million netballers, I look forward to hosting the reception and congratulating the Diamonds in person.</p>
