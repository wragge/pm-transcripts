PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELVIERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
" JULIUS STONE HUMANIST, JURIST AND INTERNATIONALIST"<br />
INAUGURAL JULIUS AND RECA STONE MEMORIAL LECTURE<br />
3 DECENBER 1985 SYDNEY<br />
RECA STONE, MEMBERS OF THE STONE FAMILY, DISTINGUISHED<br />
GUESTS, LADIES AND GENTLEIIIEN, N<br />
I AM DEEPLY MOVED AND HONOURED TO PRESENT THIS, THE<br />
INAUGURAL JULIUS AND RECA STONE MEMORIAL LECTURE.<br />
JULIUS STONE, WITH THE AID AND ASSISTANCE OF HIS BELOVED<br />
WIFE RECA, DID MORE THAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF<br />
AUSTRALIAN INTELLECTUAL LIFE. HE BROUGHT TO THIS COUNTRY,<br />
AND TO THE WORLD, AN APPRECIATION OF THE NATURE OF HUMAN<br />
ENDEAVOUR, THR REALISATION THAT THE INTERESTS ON WHICH WE<br />
BASE LAW AND JUSTICE MUST BE THOSE OF ALL PEOPLE.<br />
HIS GREAT CONTRIBUTION WAS TO SEE BOTH LAW AND JUSTICE AS<br />
DEVELOPING IDEALS, FORGED IN CONCRETE HISTORICAL<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES, ADMITTING OF STRUGGLE, INTERNAL CONFLICT,<br />
DIFFERING SOCIAL PERCEPTION4S AND HUMAN INTERESTS FROM4 ONE<br />
GENERATION TO THE OTHER.<br />
GIVEN THAT THIS IS THE FIRST OF THE JULIUS AND RECA STONE<br />
MEMORIAL LECTURES, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING ON HIS LIFE<br />
AND WORK BEFORE FOCUSSING ON THREE ASPECTS OF JULIUS'<br />
WRITINGS AND ACTIVITIES WHICH HAVE IMPRESSED ME<br />
PARTICULARLY. IN THIS WAY, I SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO PROVIDE<br />
INSIGHTS INTO JULIUS-STONE THE MAN, HIS IDEAS AND THE<br />
CONTINUING RELEVANCE OF HIS WORK.<br />
I FIRST BECAME AWARE OF JULIUS STONE WHEN, AS A LAW STUDENT<br />
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA, I WAS INTRODUCED TO<br />
HIS PROVINCE AND FUNCTION OF LAW. AT THE TIME I KNEW<br />
NOTHING OF? THE MAN, AND LITTLE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH<br />
HAD MOULDED HIM. I WAS LESS THAN FULLY AWARE OF THE<br />
EUROPEAN JEWISH INTELLECTUAL TRADITION WJHICH NOT ONLY WAS TO<br />
SHAPE THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIALISM, BUT WHICH WAS ALSO TO<br />
NURTURE THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN GROUPS AND GROUPS<br />
WITHIN A SOCIETY. </p>
<p>IN LATER YEARS I WAS TO COME TO ADMIRE AND LOVE JULIUS.( AND<br />
I WAS HONOURED WHEN HE WROTE THE INTRODUCTION TO HAI-IKE ON<br />
ISRAEL). I TREASURE THE MEMORY OF HIS CONVERSATIW92.<br />
THROUGH HIM, AND THROUGH OTHERS, I WAS TO UNDERSTAND AND<br />
ADMIRE THE TENACITY DISPLAYED BY THE JEWISH PEOPLE IN THE<br />
ESTABLISHMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL.<br />
JULIUS STONE TOOK TO THE LAW AFTER HIS OXFORD TUTOR HAD<br />
DESPAIRED OF HIM AS A HISTORIAN. AT OXFORD IN 1925, JULIUS<br />
STONE, PRODUCT OF WORKING-CLASS LEEDS AND ONE OF THE FEW<br />
STUDENTS ( LIKE RECA) TO WIN A STATE UNIVERSITY SCHOLARSHIP<br />
TO A MAJOR UNIVERSITY, WAS CONFRONTED BY HIS HISTORY TUTOR<br />
WITH THE WORDS: " STONE, YOU REALISE THAT YOUR IDEAS OF<br />
HISTORY AND MINE HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON". THE TUTOR<br />
SUGGESTED THAT STONE TAKE HIS TALENTS -AND HIS TALENTS WERE<br />
RECOGNISED AS CONSIDERABLE EVEN THEN -SOMEWHERE ELSE. TO<br />
DENTISTRY. OR CHEMISTRY. OR EVEN TO THE LAW.<br />
SO JULIUS STONE CROSSED THE QUADRANGLE AT HIS OXFORD<br />
COLLEGE, EXETER, AND G. S. CHESHIRE, FATHER OF LEONARD<br />
CHESHIRE ACCEPTED HIM AS A STUDENT. IN THIS RATHER<br />
OFF-HAND UNGUARDED WAY BEGAN A LIFE-LONG ASSOCIATION WITH<br />
THE LAW WHICH, IN THE COURSE OF THE ENSUING 60 YEARS, FIRMLY<br />
ESTABLISHED JULIUS STONE AS* ONE OF THE LEADING LEGAL<br />
PHILOSOPHERS OF HIS DAY.<br />
THE STUDY OF LAW HAS BEEN, EVER SINCE, THE RICHER FOR THAT<br />
DECISION. THERE ARE TWO ELEMENTS OF THE EARLY STORY THAT SEEM<br />
IMPORTANT TO ME. FIRSTLY, JULIUS STONE CLASHED WITH HIS<br />
HISTORY TUTOR BECAUSE HE, JULIUS, SAW HISTORY IN TERMS OF<br />
ITS SOCIOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT ON ORDINARY PEOPLE,<br />
WHILE HIS MORE CONVENTIONAL TUTOR AN EXPERT, INCIDENTALLY,<br />
ON NAPOLEON BONAPARTE SAW IT AS PRINCIPALLY A RECORD OF<br />
THE DEEDS OF KINGS AND PRINCES.<br />
IN HIS EMPHASIS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ORDINARY PEOPLE IN THE<br />
SCHEME OF THINGS, I BELIEVE ONE CAN SEE THlE SEEDS OF ONE OF<br />
JULIUS STONE'S LIFELONG PREOCCUPATIONS: A PREOCCUPATION<br />
WITH THE RIGHT OF INDIVIDUALS IN A WORLD TOO LONG DOMINATED<br />
BY KINGS AND PRINCES.<br />
THE OTHER IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE STORY IS THAT IT<br />
DEMONSTRATES STONE'S TOTALLY HONEST AND UNCOMPROMISING<br />
APPROACH TO HIS LEARNING. MANY A LESSER MORTAL, ONCE WARNED<br />
HOW THE WIND BLEW WITH HIS TUTOR, WOULD HAVE TRIMMED HIS<br />
SAILS TO THE PREVAILING WEATHER. NOT SO JULIUS STONE, AND<br />
IT IS A REVEALING SIDELIGHT ON HIS INHERENT MODESTY THAT IN<br />
RELATING THESE EVENTS IN LATER YEARS HE SEEMED COMPLETELY<br />
OBLIVIOUS TO THE TREMENDOUS COURAGE IT MUST HAVE TAKEN NOT<br />
TO SUCCUMB EASILY TO THE PRESSURES UPON HIM.<br />
AT OXFORD, THE YOUNG JULIUS STONE HAD TO CONTEND WITH THE<br />
BRITISH CLASS SYSTEM AND THE STRONG ELEMENTS OF<br />
ANTI-SEMITISM WITHIN IT. IT WAS NOT A HAPPY TIME FOR HIM<br />
AND HE FOUND, AS DID OTHERS, THAT TO SURVIVE HE HAD TO DO A<br />
LOT OF PRETENDING. BUT HE HATED " THE GUTS OF THE PLACE" AND </p>
<p>3<br />
CONTINUED TO DO SO UNTIL THE END OF HIS LIFE, APART FROM HIS<br />
LAW TUTOR, WHOM HE-LEARNED TO LOVE. IN PARTICULAR, HE<br />
DESPISED THE DISTORTED CLASS-VALUE SYSTEM OF OXFORD AN<br />
OPINION WHICH I, WITH MY AUSTRALIAN EGALITARIAN BACKGROUND,<br />
COULD READILY UNDERSTAND.<br />
JULIUS' ACADEMIC LIFE FROM THE BEGINNING WAS MARKED-BY<br />
COURAGE, AND UNCOMPROMISING LOYALTY TO HIS BELIEFS AND A<br />
SELF-IMPOSED DISCIPLINE FOR HARD WORK. AND HE NEEDED ALL<br />
THESE ATTRIBUTES TO SUCCEED IN LEEDS, AT OXFORD, IN AMERICA<br />
AND IN AUSTRALIA.<br />
JULIUS STONE WAS FORTUNATE IN THAT HE WAS RAISED IN A<br />
TRADITION WHICH ENDOWED HIM WITH IMMENSE FAITH IN THE HUMAN<br />
SPIRIT. HIS DIFFICULT PHYSICAL EXISTENCE IN LEEDS SHARPENED HIS<br />
RESOLVE TO SUCCEED AND GAVE HIM AN IMMENSE CAPACITY FOR<br />
WORK. IT WAS FROM A POOR, HUMBLE BACKGROUND THAT JULIUS WON HIS<br />
WAY TO OXFORD AND GAINED A BRILLIANT FIRST IN THE B. A.<br />
( JURISPRUDENCE) EXAMINATION. UNABLE TO REMAIN AT OXFORD FOR<br />
LACK OF FUNDS, JULIUS TOOK HIS B. C. L. PART-TIME AND<br />
SUPPLICATED THE SAME DAY AS ANTHONY EDEN. KEEN TO OBTAIN<br />
HIS JULIUS WAS INFORMED IT WOULD TAKE 10 YEARS. BUT<br />
WHILE WORKING IN LEEDS, HE WROTE REGIONAL GUARANTEES OF<br />
MINORITY RIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL GUARANTEES OF MINORITY<br />
RIGHTS AND SUBMITTED THEM FOR THE D. C. L.<br />
THE OXFORD FELLOWS AND EXAMINERS WERE, AS RECA SAYS, NOT<br />
" ENTHUSIASTIC" ABOUT AWARDING THE DEGREE SO EARLY AND TO A<br />
JEW BUT THEIR DECISION WAS " UNANIMOUS". JULIUS CARRIED<br />
THE POSTCARD CONTAINING THE NEWS WITH HIM FOR MANY MANY<br />
YEARS. IN 1931 JULIUS ACCEPTED THE POSITION OF ROCKEFELLER FELLOW<br />
IN SOCIAL SCIENCES AT HARVARD, WHERE HE WORKED WITH ONE OF<br />
THE PIONEERS OF THE SOCIOLOGICAL SCHOOL OF JURISPRUDENCE,<br />
ROSCOE POUND. HE STAYED ON AT HARVARD AS AN ASSISTANT<br />
PROFESSOR OF LAW, AND EVENTUALLY RETURNED TO ENGLAND WHERE<br />
THERE WAS THE PROMISE OF A UNIVERSITY POSITION. THIS,<br />
HOWEVER, DID NOT EVENTUATE, BECAUSE HE WAS TOLD HE WAS A<br />
JEW. DISGUSTED, JULIUS ACCEPTED A POSITION AT AUCKLAND<br />
UNIVERSITY IN NEW ZEALAND AND, AS RECA HAS RECALLED, THEY<br />
" SCATTERED AND LIVED". WHILE IN NEW ZEALAND, A CHAIR IN<br />
INTERNATIONAL LAW AND JURISPRUDENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF<br />
SYDNEY WAS ADVERTISED AND JULIUS WAS APPOINTED. A FEW WEEKS<br />
LATER, HIS APPOINTMENT WAS RESCINDED BY THE UNIVERSITY<br />
SENATE. HIS EVENTUAL APPOINTMENT AS CHALLIS PROFESSOR OF LAW AND<br />
JURISPRUDENCE AT SYDNEY UNIVERSITY WAS SURROUNDED BY<br />
CONTROVERSY AND PREJUDICE AN INDICTMENT OF AUSTRALIAN<br />
SOCIETY AND THE LEGAL PROFESSION AT THAT TIME. HE WAS<br />
SUSPECTED BY THE CONSERVATIVE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DAY BOTH<br />
BECAUSE HE WAS A JEW, AND BECAUSE OF THE EMPHASIS HE PUT ON<br />
THE SOCIOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF LAW. AS HE HIMSELF PUT IT </p>
<p>WITH UNDUE CHARITY, I THINK " THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND<br />
THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY IN GOOD FAITH MISTOOK<br />
' SOCIOLOGY' FOR SOCIALISM". EVEN THOUGH THEY DID NOT SAY<br />
IT, THERE WAS UNDERLYING THE STONE AFFAIR A HORROR OF THE<br />
POSSIBILITY OF THIS CLOSED PROFESSION SUDDENLY BEING INVADED<br />
AND INSPIRED BY A SUPPOSED BOLSHEVIK.<br />
AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY HAS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE<br />
19401S, AND IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE A SIMILAR<br />
INCIDENT OCCURRING TODAY. NEVERTHELESS, AS TONY HORWITZ HAS<br />
POINTED OUT IN A RECENT ARTICLE IN THE SMH, INFORMAL<br />
ANTI-JEWISH DISCRIMINATION CONTINUES TO EXIST IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
PARTICULARLY IN CIRCLES THAT NO DOUBT SEE THEMSELVES AS THEPINACLE<br />
OF OUR SOCIETY. AS HORWITZ WROTE IT IS " EASIER FOR<br />
A JEW TO BECOME A KNIGHT OF THE REALM THAN TO PENETRATE THE<br />
INNER SANCTUM OF THE SOCIAL ESTABLISHMENT". JULIUS STONE<br />
WOULD, LIKE ME, HAVE A LOFTY DISDAIN FOR THAT SORT OF<br />
PREJUDICE. JULIUS STONE WAS NO BOLSHEVIK, THOUGH HE LED THE RESISTANCE<br />
TO THE COMMUNIST PARTY DISSOLUTION ACT WHEN SIR ROBERT<br />
MENZIES TRIED TO OUTLAW THE COMMUNIST PARTY IN THE 1950' S.<br />
HE TOOK ON OTHER UNPOPULAR CAUSES. HE SPOKE UP FOR ACADEMIC<br />
FREEDOM DURING WHAT HAS COME TO BE KNOWN AS THE MCCARTHY<br />
PERIOD. HE WAS A PIONEER OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN DEFENCE<br />
LEAGUE, WHICH FOUGHT APARTHEID IN SOUTH AFRICA, AND THE<br />
IMMIGRATION REFORM MOVEMENT IN NEW SOUTH WALES, WHICH FOUGHT<br />
AGAINST DISCRIMINATORY IMMIGRATION POLICIES. HE WORKED FOR<br />
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL AND FOUGHT FOR THE RIGHTS OF SOVIET<br />
JEWRY AND POLITICAL PRISONERS EVERYWHERE.<br />
IN SUCH ACTIVITIES, JULIUS' ESSENTIAL HUMANISM AND<br />
INTERNATIONALISM STOOD OUT.<br />
IT WAS AT SYDNEY UNIVERSITY THAT' JULIUS ESTABLISHED HIS<br />
GREAT INTERNATIONAL STANDING. DURING HIS 30 YEAR TE1NURE OF<br />
THE CHAIR, JULIUS AS SIR ZELMAN COWAN WROTE " SECURELY<br />
ESTABLISHED A GREAT REPUTATION AS A SCHOLAR, PUBLICIST AND<br />
TEACHER, AND HIS MAIN WORK IN THE ANGLO-AMERICAN LEGAL WORLD<br />
WAS DONE FROM THIS AUSTRALIAN BASE".<br />
THE PROVINCE AND FUNCTION OF LAW, THE THREE DRAFTS OF WHICH<br />
WERE TYPED BY RECA, FIRST APPEARED IN 1946 AND ATTRACTED<br />
WIDE AND HIGHLY FAVOURABLE ATTENTION. THE PERIOD SINCE HAS<br />
FULLY VALIDATED THE CONTEMPORARY CONCLUSION OF MR JUSTICE<br />
ELSE MITCHELL ( AS HE NOW IS) THAT THE BOOK ' IS ONE OF THE<br />
OUTSTANDING JURISTIC WORKS OF THE PRESENT CENTURY'. IN 1964<br />
IT RECEIVED THE SWINEY PRIZE FOR JURISPRUDENCE OF THE ROYAL<br />
SOCIETY OF ARTS, ENGLAND'S HIGHEST AWARD IN THIS FIELD.<br />
FROM IT HAVE COME LEGAL SYSTEM AND LAWYERS' REASONINGS<br />
( 1964). HUMAN LAW AND HUMAN JUSTICE ( 196-5) AND SOCIAL<br />
DIMENSIONS OF LAW AND JUSTICE ( n19' T, DESCRIBED AS THE MOST<br />
COMPREHENSIVE'ACCOUNT YET WRITTEN OF MODERN JURISPRUDENTIAL<br />
THOUGHT. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SPEAK OF JULIUS AND HIS WORK WITHOUT<br />
REFERENCE TO HIS BELOVED WIFE, RECA, WHO IS WITH US THIS<br />
EVENING. SHE WAS HIS BOON COMPANION AND INTELLECTUAL </p>
<p>SUPPORT FROM THE TIME THEY MET IN A RESOURCE LIBRARY FOR<br />
POOR STUDENTS IN LEEDS AND JULIUS CARRIED HER BOOKS HOME.<br />
THIS ACT OF KINDNESS WAS THE BEGINNING OF A LIFE-LONG<br />
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN TWO INDIVIDUALS OF GREAT INTELLECTUAL<br />
AND SPIRITUAL STRENGTH.<br />
LIKE HER HUSBAND, RECA GREW UP IN THE DESPERATELY<br />
UNDERPRIVILEGED SLUMS OF LEEDS. LIKE HIM, RECA EARNED<br />
SUCCESS IN LIFE THROUGH ACADEMIC ABILITY AND SHEER HARD<br />
WORK. SHE ALSO WON ONE OF BRITAIN'S RARE AND<br />
HARD-FOUGHT-FOR STATE SCHOLARSHIPS, AND COULD ALSO HAVE GONE<br />
UP TO ONE OF THE MAJOR UNIVERSITIES; INSTEAD SHE CHOSE TO<br />
DO A DEGREE IN CHEMISTRY AND ZOOLOGY AT LEEDS, AND THEN<br />
DENTISTRY. DURING WORLD WAR II, SHE BECAME INVOLVED IN THE YOUTH ALIYAH<br />
MOVEMENT CONCERNED WITH SENDING JEWISH CHILDREN TO ISRAEL.<br />
HER " REVOLT IN THE GHETTO" WHICH RAISED FUNDS FOR YOUTH<br />
ALIYAH, IS A MOVING ACCOUNT OF THE STORY OF THE JEWS OF THE<br />
WARSAW GHETTO.<br />
FROM THE EARLIEST DAYS, RECA PARTICIPATED FULLY IN HER<br />
HUSBAND'S WORK, DISCUSSING THE CONTENT OF HIS PROJECTED<br />
WRITINGS, EDITING THE MANUSCRIPTS AS THEY SAW THE LIGHT OF<br />
DAY, AND GENERALLY PROVIDING THE STRONG INTELLECTUAL, MORAL<br />
AND EMOTIONAL SUPPORT HE NEEDED.<br />
TONIGHT, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO JUSTICE TO JULIUS' SCHOLARLY<br />
ACTIVITIES, HIS WRITINGS, HIS DEGREES, THE AWARDS AND<br />
ACCOLADES HE RECEIVED AND HIS COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES THEY<br />
ARE TOO NUMEROUS AND TOO DIVERSE. I DO, WANT HOWEVER, IN<br />
THE REMAINDER OF MY ADDRESS, TO FOCUS ON THOSE 3 ASPECTS OF<br />
HIS WORK WHICH HAVE IMPRESSED ME PARTICULARLY:<br />
HIS DEFENCE OF HUM4AN RIGHTS AND HIS HOSTILITY TO ANY<br />
FORM OF PREJUDICE AND DISCRIMINATION;<br />
HIS BELIEF IN DIALOGUE AND DISCUSSION IN THE RESOLUTION<br />
OF CONFLICT; AND<br />
HIS CONCERN FOR THE PEACEFUL MANAGEMENT OF RELATIONS<br />
BETWEEN STATES.<br />
JULIUS' BELIEFS RECOGNISED THE RIGHTS OF ALL MEN AND WOMEN<br />
TO BE TREATED EQUALLY BEFORE THE LAW. THROUGHOUT HIS. LIFE,<br />
JULIUS CONSISTENTLY WORKED FOR SOMETHING WHICH IS EASY TO<br />
SAY IN WORDS EQUALITY FOR ALL BUT IMMENSELY HARD TO<br />
ACHIEVE IN PRACTICE. AS A SPECIALIST IN INTERNATIONAL LAW,<br />
JULIUS WAS TORMENTED BY THE MAGNITUDE OF INSTITUTIONALISED,<br />
STATE SANCTIONED CRUELTY, INJUSTICE AND SAVAGERY. HE FOUGHT<br />
AGAINST WHAT HE CALLED THIS JUNGLE IN HIS PUBLICATIONS, AND<br />
IN HIS WORK WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF JURISTS.<br />
JULIUS STONE SAW INTERNATIONAL LAW AS A CONCEPT OF JUSTICE<br />
SHARED BY THE WHOLE HUM4AN COMMUNITY, A SYSTEM WHEREBY PEOPLE<br />
AND NATIONS REACH AGREEMENTS ON WHAT IS UNJUST. IN THIS<br />
REGARD, HE WAS NOTED FOR HIS REFUSAL TO ACCEPT FACILE,<br />
OPTIMISTIC ASSESSMENTS OF THE EFFICACY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW </p>
<p>WHICH CANNOT BE SUPPORTED IN THE LIGHT OF THE FACTS; AND, ON<br />
THE OTHER HAND, FOR HIS CONCERN FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN<br />
RIGHTS ACROSS STATE FRONTIERS. THIS LATTER THEME WAS<br />
DEVELOPED IN HIS FIRST PUBLISHED WORK ON INTERNATIONAL LAW<br />
IN 1932, INTERNATIONAL GUARANTEES OF MINORITY RIGHTS,<br />
DEALING MAINLY WITH THE THEN EXISTING SYSTEM FOR THE<br />
PROTECTION OF MINORITIES, AND RECEIVED FURTHER ILLUSTRATION<br />
IN HIS LATER BOOK, THE LEGAL CONTROLS OF INTERNATIONAL<br />
CONFLICT. AS I MENTIONED BEFORE, JULIUS STONE WAS A PIONEER IN THE<br />
FIGHT AGAINST APARTHEID.<br />
TODAY, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS BECOMING MORE CLOSELY<br />
CONCERNED WITH THE CONTINUING DISREGARD AND ABUSE OF<br />
PEOPLE'S RIGHTS BY THE GOVERNMENT OF SOUTH AFRICA.<br />
UNLIKE THIS COUNTRY, WHICH HAS LONG RECOGNIZED<br />
INTERNATIONALLY AGREED HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS IN GUIDING<br />
LEGISLATION AND PUBLIC OPINION ON THE RIGHTS OF GROUPS<br />
WITHIN OUR SOCIETY, THE GOVERNMENT OF SOUTH AFRICA HAS NOT.<br />
AS WAS RECENTLY DEMONSTRATED AT THE COMMONWEALTH HEADS OF<br />
GOVERNMENT MEETING IN THE BAHAMIAS, AND IN THE UNITED NATIONS<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT SHARES WITH AN INFLUENTIAL<br />
PROPORTION OF THE WORLD COMMUNITY THE BELIEF THAT<br />
INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE MUST BE BROUGHT TO BEAR ON SOUTH<br />
AFRICA TO RECOGNISE THE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS OF ALL ITS<br />
PEOPLE. WE BELIEVE WE MUST TOGETHER SEEK A SOLUTION WHICH<br />
TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE INTERESTS OF ALL PARTIES IN SOUTH<br />
AFRICA, WHICH ENDS RACIAL DISCRIMINATION, AND WHICH<br />
ESTABLISHES A JUST AND DEM4OCRATIC SOCIETY. AT THE SAME<br />
TIME, WE RECOGNISE, IN JULIUS' TERMS, THE LIMITS OF THE<br />
FEASIBLE AND THE NEED TO PRESERVE THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC<br />
ACHIEVEMENTS-AND INFRASTRUCTURE.<br />
JULIUS' WRITINGS AND LIFE WORK WAS UNDERPINNED BY A<br />
PASSIONATE COMMITMENT TO DIALOGUE, TO DISCUSSION AND TO<br />
DEBATE. HE BELIEVED IN PEOPLE GETTING TOGETHER TO RESOLVE<br />
THEIR DIFFERENCES AND HE HAD A MARVELLOUS CAPACITY TO<br />
UNDERSTAND OTHER VIEWPOINTS.<br />
IT WAS JULIUS' DESIRE FOR DISCUSSION AND FOR DIALOGUE WHICH<br />
LED TO HIS ESTABLISHING THE HARVARD CLUB TO PROMOTE THE<br />
MEETING OF MINDS; HE WAS ONE OF A GROUP WHO FOUNDED THE<br />
SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH COUNCIL, WHICH LATER BECAME THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN ACADEMY OF SOCIAL SCIENCES; HE CREATED THE<br />
AUSTRALASIAN UNIVERSITIES LAW SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION AND HE<br />
PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THE SYDNEY LAW REVIEW AND THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY OF LEGAL PHILOSOPHY.<br />
JULIUS WAS ALSO CONSCIOUS OF THE NEED TO PROMOTE DIALOGUE<br />
NOT ONLY IN THE ACADEMIC COMMUNITY, BUT ALSO IN THE WIDER<br />
COMMUNITY AND FROM 1945 HE WAS A REGULAR A. B. C. BROADCASTER<br />
ON INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS. HE WAS ALSO A STRONG PROPONENT OF<br />
DIALOGUE BETWEEN EAST AND WEST. OF PARTICULAR INTEREST IS<br />
THE FACT THAT THE FIRST PUBLISHED SUGGESTION FOR THE " HOT<br />
LINE" BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND MOSCOW WAS MADE BY JULIUS IN A </p>
<p>SERIES OF LECTURES DELIVERED IN LATE 1960 OVER THE NATIONAL<br />
RADIO NETWORK OF THE AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING COMMISSION.<br />
LATER THAT YEAR, WHEN HIS LECTURES WERE MADE INTO A BOOK,<br />
QUEST FOR SURVIVAL: THE ROLE OF LAW AND FOREIGN POLICY, THE<br />
IDEA WAS FIRST PRESENTED IN THE UNITED STATES. TWENTY-FIVE<br />
SETS OF PAGE PROOFS OF THIS BOOK WERE REQUISITIONED IN<br />
ADVANCE BY THE CARNEGIE FOUNDATION OF INTERNATIONAL PEACE,<br />
AND SENT BY THE FOUNDATION TO KEY MEMBERS OF THE THEN<br />
INCOMING KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION. A TOP LEVEL COMMUNICATIONS<br />
LINK FOR USE IN TIMES OF* CRISIS WAS ACTUALLY ESTABLISHED IN<br />
1963. ITS WORTH HAS BEEN EVIDENT ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS.<br />
UNTIL THE END OF HIS LIFE JULIUS STONE CONSTANTLY ADDRESSED<br />
THE QUESTION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN STATES, PARTICULARLY<br />
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE SUPERPOWERS. HIS BOOK, VISIONS OF<br />
WORLD ORDER, BETWEEN STATE POWER AND HUMAN JUSTICE,<br />
PUBLISHED EARLIER THIS YEAR, EXEMPLIFIED A KEY PREOCCUPATION<br />
OF HIS PROFESSIONAL LIFE: THE QUESTION OF HOW ORDER CAN BE<br />
MAINTAINED BETWEEN STATES. HE WAS ALWAYS VIGILANT AGAINST<br />
POLITICAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL THREATS TO SUCH ORDER.<br />
THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE, HE CONTINUED TO MAINTAIN A LIVELY<br />
INTEREST IN AND CONCERN FOR MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN<br />
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. IN AUGUST THIS YEAR, HE WROTE TO<br />
ME PRIVATELY CONCERNING THE UNITED STATES STRATEGIC DEFENCE<br />
INITIATIVE, EXPRESSING DISQUIET AT ITS LONG-TERM<br />
RAMIFICATIONS AND FORWARDING SOME THOUGHTS HE HAD PREVIOUSLY<br />
PENNED ON STRATEGIC DEFENCE INITIATIVE ( SDI) RESEARCH.<br />
JULIUSI ARTICLE WAS CHARACTERISTIC IN ITS RATIONALITY AND IN<br />
ITS PURPOSE AND I FOUND IT A BREATH OF FRESH AIR. JULIUS'<br />
MISGIVINGS ABOUT THE PROBLEMS INHERENT IN SDI WERE<br />
ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THOSE WHICH HAVE LED THE GOVERNMENT,<br />
WHILE RECOGNISING THE INTEGRITY OF THE US ADMINISTRATION'S<br />
POSITION, TO DECLINE TO ENDORSE THE INITIATIVE.<br />
JULIUS' SUGGESTED SOLUTION TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF SDI WAS<br />
THAT THE RESEARCH SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN JOINTLY BY THE TWO<br />
SUPERPOWERS. IN HIS WORDS:<br />
" WHAT IS URGENTLY REQUIRED IS AN UNRELENTING CAMPAIGN<br />
PRESSING ON BOTH WASHINGTON AND MOSCOW THE ABSOLUTE<br />
NECESSITY OF MAKING THE ATTEMPT TO PERFECT THE STRATEGIC<br />
DEFENSE INITIATIVE AS A JOINT SOVIET-UNITED STATES<br />
PROJECT. THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY FOR SUCH<br />
CO-OPERATION SHOULD NOW BECOME A CENTRAL PLATFORM OF ALL<br />
GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS WHO WISH TO CHECK ( AND ULTIMATELY<br />
RENDER OBSOLETE) THE MONSTROSITY OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS."<br />
I NOTE IN THIS CONNECTION THAT PRESIDENT REAGAN HAS ON A<br />
NUMBER OF OCCASIONS, INCLUDING AT THE RECENT GENEVA SUMMIT,<br />
TALKED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SHARING THE SDI TECHNOLOGY.<br />
JULIUS' APPROACH TO THE SDI DILEMMA ECHOED IN M4ANY WAYS HIS<br />
EARLIER SUGGESTION, TO WHICH I HAVE ALREADY REFERRED, NAMELY<br />
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A " HOT LINE" BETWEEN MOSCOW AND<br />
WASHINGTON. </p>
<p>8<br />
IN ALL HIS SCHOLARSHIP JULIUS ALWAYS REMEMBERED THE<br />
ESSENTIAL HUMANITY. WHICH BINDS NATIONS TO EACH OTHER. THIS<br />
OFTEN NEGLECTED ELEMENT OF DIPLOMACY HAS BEEN REINFORCED BY<br />
THE REAGAN/ GORBACHEV SUMMIT. AT LEAST A DIALOGUE BETWEEN<br />
IDEOLOGICAL ADVERSARIES MEANS THAT HOPE EXISTS THAT THOSE<br />
THINGS THEY HAVE IN COMMON WILL OUTWEIGH THEIR IRREVOCABLE<br />
DIFFERENCES AND ALLOW US ALL TO BUILD A MORE STABLE WORLD.<br />
WERE JULIUS WITH US TODAY, I FEEL SURE HE WOULD TAKE HEART<br />
FROM THE PROSPECTS FOR IMPROVED DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE UNITED<br />
STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION.<br />
HIS CONCERN WITH THE PRACTICAL ISSUES OF ARMS CONTROL AND<br />
DISARMAMENT AND THE REDUCTION OF THE TENSIONS BETWEEN EAST<br />
AND WEST IS SHARED BY MY GOVERNMENT. OUR POLICIES PLACE A<br />
HEAVY EMPHASIS ON PEACE, DISARMAMENT AND ARMS CONTROL.<br />
THESE POLICIES ARE NOW WELL ESTABLISHED. WE HAVE APPOINTED<br />
AN AMBASSADOR FOR DISARMAMENT TO ENSURE THAT OUR VOICE FOR<br />
PEACE IS HEARD IN INTERNATIONAL FORUMS. WE PLAYED A LEADING<br />
ROLE IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SOUTH PACIFIC NUCLEAR FREE<br />
ZONE AT THE AUGUST MEETING OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM. OUR<br />
STRINGENT SAFEGUARD AGREEMENTS STRENGTHEN THE REGIME OF THE<br />
NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY. WE HAVE JOINED OUR<br />
NEIGHBOURS IN STRONGLY OPPOSING FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING IN<br />
THE SOUTH PACIFIC. WE ARE AT THE FOREFRONT OF INTERNATIONAL<br />
EFFORTS AIMED AT ACHIEVING A COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY.<br />
AND WE WILL GIVE ACTIVE SUPPORT TO THE UN'S INTERNATIONAL<br />
YEAR OF PEACE IN 1986.<br />
THESE AND OTHER POLICIES HAVE GIVEN AUSTRALIA AN<br />
UNPRECEDENTED VOICE FOR PEACE ! N WORLD FORUMS. THEY HAVE<br />
STRENGTHENED OUR RIGHT TO A ROLE IN ADVOCATING BALANCED AND<br />
VERIFIABLE NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT AND ARMS CONTROL. OUR VERY<br />
CLOSE RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES GIVE US AN EFFECTIVE<br />
BASIS ON WHICH TO DEVELOP THIS ROLE. AT THE SAME TIME, THIS<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH A DIALOGUE WITH THE USSR<br />
ON THESE ISSUES, NOTWITHSTANDING THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES<br />
OF PRINCIPLE BETWEEN US.<br />
HUMANITY AND VISION ARE PERHAPS JULIUS' GREATEST BEQUESTS TO<br />
US ALL. DESPITE THE DANGEROUS JUNGLE WHICH HE COULD ALL TOO<br />
CLEARLY SEE, JULIUS WAS AT HEART AN OPTIMIST. HE SAW<br />
HUMANITY AS SLOWLY, HESITATINGLY, BEATING PATHS TO CREATE<br />
SMALL, PRECIOUS ENCLAVES OF JUSTICE AND PEACE. HE EXHORTED<br />
US NOT TO LOSE HOPE BUT TO FIGHT ON TO ENLARGE THESE<br />
ENCLAVES, TO BROADEN WHAT HE CALLED " POCKETS OF HOPE".<br />
HIS VISION WAS ESSENTIALLY A PRODUCT OF HIS JEWISH<br />
TRADITION. AFTER THE NIGHT MUST COME THE DAY.<br />
AND HIS WORK CAN BE SUMMED UP BY ANOTHER OF HIS FAVOURITE<br />
SAYINGS -THIS ONE FROM THE RABBINICAL ETHICS OF THE<br />
FATHER " IT IS NOT FOR YOU TO COMPLETE THE TASK, BUT<br />
NEITHER ARE YOU FREE TO DESIST FROM IT." t </p>
<p>I 9<br />
JULIUS' TASK ENDURES DESPITE HIS DEATH LAST SEPTEMBER. IT<br />
ENDURES IN THE EFFECT WHICH HIS WRITINGS WILL SURELY HAVE ON<br />
FUTURE GENERATIONS OF SCHOLARS. IT ENDURES IN THE WORK OF<br />
THE INSTITUTIONS WHICH HE INSPIRED OR WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN<br />
FOUNDING, SUCH AS THE PRESTIGIOUS INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION<br />
OF JURISTS. PERHAPS IT ENDURES MOST FRUITFULLY OF ALL IN<br />
THE STUDENTS WHOM HE TAUGHT AND INSPIRED PARTICULARLY AT<br />
SYDNEY UNIVERSITY, WHERE JURISPRUDENCE BECAME KNOWN AS<br />
" JULES PRUDENCE". ONE OF HIS FORMER STUDENTS, MR JUSTICE<br />
KIRBY, SAID OF STONE'S INFLUENCE: " SOME ANGRY SPIRIT<br />
CONSTANTLY URGED JULIUS STONE ON TO MORE AND MORE ENDEAVOUR.<br />
IT WAS AN INFECTIOUS SPIRIT."<br />
JULIUS' SPIRIT INSPIRED MANY OF HIS STUDENTS WHO HAVE<br />
SHAPED, AND CONTINUE TO SHAPE, OUR SOCIETY. THEY INCLUDE<br />
HIGH COURT JUDGES, SUPREME COURT JUDGES, PROMINENT QUEEN'S<br />
COUNSEL AND SUCH PROMINENT LAWYERS AS NSW'S CHIEF JUSTICE<br />
SIR LAWRENCE STREET, JUSTICE ELIZABETH EVATT AND JUSTICE<br />
MICHAEL MCHUGH. NEVILLE WRAN, FRANK WALKER AND AUSTRALIA'S<br />
PRESENT AMBASSADOR TO UNESCO, GOUGH WHITLAM, WERE ACOLYTES<br />
OF PROFESSOR STONE WHO HAVE, IN THEIR WAY, ATTEMPTED TO<br />
TRANSLATE THE STONE PHILOSOPHY INTO POLITICAL REALITY.<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.<br />
AUSTRALIA, AND THE WORLD, ARE IMMEASURABLY THE BETTER FOR<br />
THE CONTRIBUTION OF P'EOPLE LIKE JULIUS AND RECA. THEIR<br />
IDEALS AND THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO HUMANITY, WILL CONTINUE TO<br />
BE A TREASURED RESOURCE AND INSPIRATION TO US ALL.<br />
RECA, YOUR HUSBAND'S GREAT CONTRIBUTION LIVES ON. IT LIVES<br />
ON IN HIS WORK AND IN THE MANY WHO WERE TOUCHED BY HIS<br />
WRITINGS, HIS TEACHING, HIS EXAMPLES OF INTELLECTUAL VIGOUR,<br />
HIS BREADTH OF INTERESTS, HIS CONCERN FOR CURRENT ISSUES<br />
AND, AS IN MY. OWN FORTUNATE CASE, HIS FRIENDSHIP.<br />
LIKE THE HANUKKAH [ HAH-NU-KAH] FLAME THE WORLD WILL CONTINUE<br />
TO BE LIT BY HIS WORKS. </p>
