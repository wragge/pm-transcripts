J&gt; AUSTRAL IA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 29 Marqh 1983<br />
In my invitation to representatives of many sectors of the<br />
Australian community to the National Economic Summit conference<br />
I sought views as to matters that should be covered by the<br />
Conference Agenda.<br />
I have been gratified by the many considered and detailed<br />
responses that I have received.<br />
Consultations have also been taking place with representatives<br />
of employers and the A. C. T. U. on the broad shape of an agenda<br />
for the conference.<br />
In addition, a number of inquiries about the agenda have been<br />
received from conference participants who are preparing<br />
submissions.<br />
I have decided therefore, to release the attached draft agenda<br />
for the conference.<br />
The draft will be discussed further with a Conference Steering<br />
Committee that I will be convening shortly, and will be subject<br />
to adoption by the conference itself.<br />
This conference will be dealing with some of the most pressing<br />
national economic issues ever faced in this country and I am<br />
confident that participants will wish to see discussion<br />
concentrated on those fundamental issues.<br />
The draft agenda has, therefore, been couched in broad terms<br />
so as not to restrict discussion that will make a real<br />
contribution to an understanding of our current economic<br />
difficulties, while at the same time focussing discussion<br />
of possible solutions on the crucial issues.<br />
The structure of the Conference Steering Committee will be<br />
myself, two of the Premiers, two employer representatives and<br />
two ACTU representatives.<br />
However, the conference cannot be an occasion for detailed<br />
discussion of specific sectoral problems and measures.<br />
The Government will be providing other forums for discussion of<br />
such problems, including the Economic Planning Advisory Council,<br />
industry advisory councils, advisory councils to ministers<br />
and pre-Budget discussions. </p>
