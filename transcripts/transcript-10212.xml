22 January 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE SYDNEY<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, this morning was a very useful meeting between myself and the<br />
State Premiers and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and the Acting Chief<br />
Minister of the ACT. No doubt you've spoken to them in different configurations on<br />
the way out. This is an immensely difficult issue. The Wik decision overturned one of<br />
the basic tenets of the Native Title Act. Perhaps to dramatise it, could I read if I may,<br />
from the recital to the Native Title Act on page 2 when it reads as follows:<br />
The High Court has a) rejected the doctrine that Australia was terra nullius at<br />
the ltme of European settlement and held that Native Title is extinguished by<br />
valid government acts that are inconsistent with the continued existence Of<br />
Native Title rights and interests such as the grant offteehold or leasehold<br />
estates.<br />
Now the language, the underpinning contained in the recital could not have been<br />
clearer. I must say that I was surprised at the Wik decision but like any other citizen of<br />
Australia I accept it as an authoritative interpretation of the law of Australia at the time<br />
the decision was given. I think in all of these things it's very important to distinguish<br />
the roles of the courts and the parliament. It is the role of the court to interpret the<br />
law, it is the role of the Parliament to make the law and to amend the law, it is in the<br />
public interest that that ought to happen.<br />
The discussions I had today are the beginning of a process of consultation. I'll be<br />
talking to representatives of the Aboriginal community. I'll be having two discussions<br />
with them. The first will take place with Mr Djerrkura and the ATSIC Commissioner<br />
dealing with Native Title matters on, I think, the third of February and then there'll be<br />
a larger meeting between myself and those two gentlemen and other representatives of<br />
the Aboriginal community on the sixth. I'll also talk to the representatives of the<br />
pastoral industry and the mining industry, the former have asked that that meeting take<br />
place not before the 29th of January. I think I could have done it before then any way. </p>
<p>The point of mentioning this is to make it plain that I intend to talk people who are<br />
very directly affected. I may talk again to the Premiers, they are putting certain<br />
proposals in more detail by way of discussion papers to the Government. And then<br />
without too much delay I hope the Federal Government can reach a view as to what<br />
ought to be done.<br />
It's not an option to do nothing because the Wik decision has really made an Act that<br />
was regarded by many people as unworkable even more unworkable. There is a view<br />
amongst the Government's legal advisers that some provisions of the Native Title Act<br />
in fact render compliance with the legal affect of the Wik decision impossible because<br />
there's a clause, 227 I think it is in the Native Title Act, which says that a holder of<br />
land cannot deal with that land which is in any way inconsistent with the interests of<br />
the native title holder and yet the Wik decision is meant to say that if there is a conflict<br />
between the interests and the rights of a lease holder and a native title holder then the<br />
rights of the lease holder will prevail, or to use the words of one of the other judges,<br />
the rights of the native title holder must yield to the rights and the interests of the lease<br />
holder. Now on the face of it that represents a fundamental conflict and there's also<br />
the very obvious question of what about post 1994 leases that perhaps could be<br />
regarded as invalid because of the operation of the Native Title Act. Now the<br />
Aboriginal community has an immense interest in this issue, it has a lot at stake and I<br />
understand that and I respect their interests. The miners do, the farmers do and of<br />
course the State Governments have the enduring responsibility for land management.<br />
There is, of course, the interest of the 18 million people of Australia and the 18 million<br />
people of Australia want a just outcome, they want a commonsense outcome, they<br />
don't want an outcome that is going to paralyse investment and threaten existing jobs<br />
and destroy potential jobs. There is, I believe, in the community a desire for a<br />
commonsense, fair and reasonably speedy response.<br />
We did have a very useful meeting this morning and I don't think anybody relishes the<br />
fact that we have had a lot of confusion arise out of this decision, but it's happened. I<br />
don't criticise the decision, it's not my place to do that I accept it but I also assert the<br />
right as the leader of the national Government to consider changes to the law which we<br />
might think are necessary in the wake of that decision. I think it's very important that<br />
we distinguish those things from the very beginning. Yes, Mr..<br />
JOURNALIST: What is the value of it seems the magistrate can downgrade<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We haven't taken decisions to do anything, there is always value in talk if that talk<br />
takes place in an atmosphere of goodwill. I don't believe at the end of the day we're<br />
going to be able to devise a solution that completely satisfies everybody. In the end<br />
I've got to devise a solution which I think best promotes the national interest, taking<br />
into account all of the things that feed into the national interest, not only economic<br />
stability and legal certainty but also a sense of basic fairness and justice that all sections<br />
of the community feel. I've got to say again that the Wik decision has fundamentally<br />
altered one of the key understandings of the Native Title Act and it was never </p>
<p>envisaged. The former Prime Minister positively asserted in his second reading speech<br />
that it was the view of his Government and he so assured the pastoral industry and he<br />
so assured the mining industry that the grant of a leasehold estate extinguished native<br />
title. Now that has changed. It is just not real life for anybody to say that that having<br />
changed it we just, sort of, don't have to look at the thing again. Now I think it's<br />
going to be very, very hard but a lot of talk and a lot of discussion is very desirable.<br />
Mr Harvey.<br />
HARVEY: package of amendments for the Native Title Act, sort of, in the pipeline. Does this<br />
mean you'll, sort of, rip them up and start again because a more fundamental plan is<br />
needed? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No I wouldn't say that. There are a lot of those amendments that I would like to see<br />
go ahead, I would like to see go ahead any way. The question of whether they<br />
proceed in some amended form separately from any other amendments post Wik or<br />
whether we hold back the existing amendments for a few weeks and try and<br />
incorporate with those some further amendments is something that I haven't decided<br />
yet because it will depend on the talks I have with the Aboriginal community and with<br />
the farmers and the miners. We haven't taken a decision. We've had views put to us,<br />
there have been a lot of options canvassed, many of them are out in the public domain<br />
and that is no bad thing. I think it would be a good thing if there is a very wide public<br />
understanding of some of the complexities that are thrown up. I haven't made up my<br />
mind about that but it's possible that we'll wrap them all up, maybe we won't, I don't<br />
know yet.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it an option to extinguish native title.. ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
All options are on the table obviously. I think the one option that is not on the table is<br />
any sort of comprehensive repudiation of the notion of native title and any idea that we<br />
would return to a sort of a Terra Nullius, that is not on the table.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you've said that doing nothing is not an option. You're also saying<br />
that ( inaudible) Can you give us a guarantee now that you won't in any amendments<br />
breach the spirit of the Racial Discriminiation Act?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I wouldn't have thought that we will do anything to breach the spirit of racial harmony<br />
or racial discrimination. If you're asking me for a guarantee that we won't touch </p>
<p>existing legislation, I can't give that. What I said before the election, what I said after<br />
the election was not breaching the thrust of the Racial Discrimfinationi Act. I'd remind<br />
you of course that the Keating Government amended the Racial Discriminiation Act in<br />
order to validate leases which had been issued after 1975 and before the coming into<br />
operation of the Native Title Act. So any suggestion that an amendment per se to the<br />
Racial DiscrimitiatiotiA ct has always been sort of verboten. As a matter of principle<br />
it is just wrong.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister when you say a speedy response, are you talking what, before the<br />
middle of the year, before...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, don't start tying me down. I'm not getting into this months and weeks. I think<br />
it is evident from the fact that I came back from holiday on Monday and I've had this<br />
meeting today and I'm arranging all of these meetings that I am giving this matter a<br />
certain amount of, a lot of priority and that will continue to be the case. Look, I am<br />
not going to start locking myself in to particular dates so forget it. I am not going to<br />
get into that game. Peter?<br />
HARVEY: legislation becomes necessary, what do you do about the Senate?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Let's wait and see. I mean, the Senate has proved to be an interesting second chamber<br />
over the last twelve months and I don't think we will be disappointed in 1997 but what<br />
I want to try and do Peter is, what I will do is to talk to all of the people who have an<br />
interest in this. I've stressed that and I have made no, I have reached no<br />
understandings or given no commitments to anybody. I have talked to the States. I<br />
frankly think they have a big problem. New South Wales now has a much bigger<br />
problem than previously thought. You're looking at 48% of the land area of New<br />
South Wales, I have advice, which is potentially claimable. I have advice from the<br />
Federal Attorney General's Department that the action taken by Mr Hobbs, was it, in<br />
Queensland that was widely criticised by a lot of people. It was in fact quite justified<br />
according to the Federal Attorney General's analysis of the legislation. 1, in fact, am<br />
examining the possibility of releasing the legal advice which has been given to me by<br />
the Federal Attorney General's Department on the impact of the Wik decision.<br />
So I mean, the States are dealing with a difficult situation but I am, as far as the Senate<br />
is concerned, what we want to do is to make up our minds about what is the right<br />
response and if that response involves legislation then we'll put that legislation to the<br />
Parliament. Now whether the Senate ends up passing it or not, I don't know. I mean,<br />
you never know, as we found out last year. It's a very exciting game. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Why should Aboriginals regard any decision to nullify the impact of the High Court<br />
decision as a fundamental breach of their rights?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It has never been the law or custom of this country that every decision made by the<br />
High Court in relation to the rights of individual Australians is absolutely sacrosanct. I<br />
mean, High Court decisions from time, not from time immemorial, from the time the<br />
High Court was established are constantly being amended or revised or changed by<br />
Parliament. I mean, I think there is a fuindamental misunderstanding in too wide a<br />
section of the Australian community about the respective roles of the Parliament and<br />
the courts in this country and under the Anglo-Australian legal system, under which we<br />
operate. The courts are there to declare the law as it now is and always has been. And<br />
if Parliament thinks fit it will try and change that law but if it doesn't think fit it won't<br />
and if it can't change the law well it can't. That is our system.<br />
JOURNALIST: concerned ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I do not accept the proposition that it is the role of the courts to actively seek out areas<br />
where they do not believe Parliament has done what they think fit and seek to fill that<br />
role. JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I wouldn't seek to categorise that. I'm stating the principle and I think we do have to<br />
accept that the more judges in our community take a public stance on issues, they can<br />
no longer expect to have the traditional immunity from criticism and reactions from<br />
other public figures. Now at no stage either in the Mabo case debate or in the wake of<br />
the Wik decision did I ever criticise myself the High Court and in fact I invite you to<br />
search the record and find indeed any criticism of the original Mabo decision. I had no<br />
quarrel with the original Mabo decision. I said that frequently. I thought the former<br />
Government made a real hash of the Native Title Act and we have seen plenty of<br />
evidence of that. I think the pastoralists of Australia were badly deceived and misled<br />
by quite a number of people at the time that legislation was passed. I am surprised at<br />
the Wik decision but I accept it. I don't criticise it but it certainly went against my<br />
understanding and it certainly went against the recital in this Act. I mean, you couldn't<br />
get anything clearer than that. The same clause that deals with Terra Nullius tells us<br />
that the grant of the leasehold or freehold estate gets rid of native title. </p>
<p>Now as far as judicial activism is concerned I state the general principle. But we do<br />
have to have an understanding. I mean, we're all the time talking about having a big<br />
constitutional debate about the future of our head of state. There seems to be a lot of<br />
misunderstanding in Australia about the respective roles of Parliament and the courts.<br />
The courts' role is to declare the law. The role of the Parliament is to make the law.<br />
The role of the people of course is to control both the law and the Parliament.<br />
JOURNALIST: You said that it's the High Court that declares what the law is...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
As the law now is, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: As the law now is, it is declared that Aboriginal people have common law rights to<br />
native title. If you are then going to amend to move those rights, why shouldn't<br />
Aboriginal people feel that their rights are being quashed?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I wasn't denying, I think I said at the beginning, that whatever decision that is finally<br />
taken some or others in the community may not agree, but we haven't taken any<br />
decision, any decision at all. I'm not quite sure what you are getting at Laura, I'm<br />
sorry. TINGLE: arguing that in response to questions about rights that the High Court has some<br />
power, the Parliament has some power....<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
What I'm as far as changing the law is concerned, parliaments subject to the<br />
constitution have the right....<br />
TINGLE: distinguish that...<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard,...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'm sorry, I'm just pursuing this interesting intellectual.... </p>
<p>TINGLE: All I'm saying is that those rights guarantee, so I'm just trying to clarify' that you<br />
recognise that some of those rights might...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, what I accept is that the High Court of Australia has said that the amplitude of<br />
Native Title includes the notion of co-existence of Native Title in relation to land over<br />
which a leasehold interest has been created. I accept that the law, that is the current<br />
law of Australia. and what we have to ask ourselves is whether, what are the<br />
consequences of that and having analysed the consequences of it, and I mean, for<br />
example, one of the consequences could be on our advice that it is not possible for a<br />
pastoralist to construct a dam on the leaseholder's estate without getting the<br />
permission of the native title holder who might have a right of coexistence. The<br />
problem is that the future act regime of the native title act potentially applies to<br />
anything that can be done on the land. Not only Section 227 but others.<br />
JOURNALIST: Given the preamble of the native title act and Labor Party.... support amendments<br />
to the native title act.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I've never given the Labor Party lectures on moral obligations no. Never. I do think<br />
though the Labor Party carries and the current Leader of the Opposition carries a very<br />
heavy responsibility for having connived in misleading the pastoralists and many other<br />
people in the Australian community at the time the native title act was passed. I mean<br />
you have this, this so-called deal that was hammered out between the former<br />
government and representatives of the Aboriginal industry and the pastoral industry<br />
and it is very obvious from what has now unfolded... I mean, you had the clear words<br />
of the preamble to which one constituency was directed and then you had another, you<br />
had the government simultaneously saying ' oh don't worry we'll leave it to the courts<br />
to decide', well, I mean, they didn't leave Terra Nullius to the courts to decide. That<br />
had been decided, and what they were basically saying, they were saying one thing to<br />
one group of the Australian community and they were saying another thing to another<br />
group and I think this decision had exposed that duplicity.<br />
COLE-ADAMS:<br />
Is your advice that there may be some legislative which would not involve the<br />
Commonwealth and perhaps the States in and potentially very large compensation<br />
payouts? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we are still assembling advice. Obviously compensation is an issue and we're<br />
very conscious of that. It's easy, I mean, you can sort of talk in ' how long is a piece of<br />
string' terms about compensation in this area although there is also another view that<br />
because of the difficulty of establishing claims to entitlements, it is easy to overestimate<br />
compensation. We are still gathering advice on that and we are seeking outside<br />
counsel's advice as well as internal advice, and that outside advice hasn't come yet.<br />
Look, I don't want anybody to think that we have made any firm decisions of any kind,<br />
we haven't. It is a hugely difficult problem. I understand the strength of feeling in the<br />
Aboriginal community, I do. I understand they feel that after long years they have got<br />
justice in relation to native title under the original Mabo decision. I also understand<br />
that as a result of the Wik decision that Native Title thi ng may seem greater than they<br />
themselves had thought. I understand that. I also want them and the rest of the<br />
community to understand that on the advice available to me at the present time, this<br />
decision has the potential to create enormous uncertainty and we have an obligation to<br />
the Australian people to make certain that that uncertainty does not go on any longer<br />
than necessary and I have to say that the idea that you can just sort of walk away from<br />
it and leave it to people to sit down and talk about over a very very long period of<br />
time, perhaps years, I don't think that with the best will in the world that that is going<br />
to work. Now, I haven't found in my discussions with the Premiers any kind of<br />
narrow minded belligerence towards the Aboriginal community. I think in many<br />
respects the Native Title Act has not served the Aboriginal community well at all.<br />
There's only been on plain established and I don't want to behave in a way that does<br />
the Aboriginal community any ire, I really don't, I mean that. But it is a very difficult<br />
issue and at the end of the day everybody may have to give a bit in order to have a<br />
compromise in the national interest and that comment is directed at the Aboriginal<br />
community as much as it is directed at the pastoralists and the miners and the various<br />
State governments and I am genuinely seeking a solution.<br />
MILNE:<br />
Do you regard co-existence of rights between native title holders and pastoral lease<br />
holders as a viable option or is that non-viable?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it depends somewhat in the form that those rights take. In some circumstances it<br />
could be quite a viable option yes. In other circumstances it could be a very difficult<br />
option. It entirely depends on how those rights are defined and what type of rights<br />
they are and their legal character. From a practical point of view pastoralists and<br />
Aborigines co-exist in many parts of Australia very easily, very easily indeed, and so<br />
it's not beyond the wit of Governments and people with good will to devise a system<br />
which allows co-existence to go on. So I don't from a practical point of view coexistence<br />
is really the problem. </p>
<p>BONGIORNO: Given that you don't have the numbers in the Senate, will your round of negotiations<br />
and consultations involve the Opposition especially as Kim Beazley yesterday said that<br />
Labor wasn't opposed to amending the Native Title Act?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh yes, I'd be very happy to talk to Mr Beazley at some stage and I understand that<br />
Senator Minchin's already had some discussion with Mr Melham about the matter but<br />
I'd be happy to talk to the Democrats and Senator Harradine and to Senator Colston<br />
and anybody, but it is a very difficult issue, it can't be left as it is. The world has<br />
changed as a result of Wik and we have to try and get a solution that is acceptable to,<br />
reasonably acceptable to all of the people involved but one at the end of the day that<br />
serves the overall national interest.<br />
ends </p>
