A PRIME MINISTER<br />
MESSAGE FROM THE PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRAjIA<br />
THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P., P<br />
FOR THE 50th ANNIVERSARY ISSUE OF<br />
THE U. S. " SATURDAY REVIEW"<br />
DECEMBER, 1974<br />
CONTRIBUTION FOR THE " INVENTOR11 OF HOPE"<br />
( BY GOUGA WHITLAM, PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA)<br />
Bertrand Russell once described himself as a cheerful<br />
pessimis',,. and if I may adapt the phrase of so illustrious a<br />
man, -I should call myself a sanguine optimist. It is not,<br />
difficult to be optimistic about Australia. With her moderately<br />
small population, basically sound economy and vast natural<br />
resources, her prospects are considerably brighter than average,<br />
though there is a danger that these blessings, combined with<br />
isolation,. may make her heedless of other nations' misfortunes.<br />
We must resist that tendency, not simply on grounds of morality,<br />
but because the survival of humanity and civilized democracy<br />
will require from all nations an unprecedented measure of<br />
international cooperation. The opportunity for such cooperation<br />
exists in the United Nations. There is as yet no substitute<br />
for it and there is a-good chance that it will survive as a<br />
workable and practical forum.<br />
There are three other things on which I base my hopes.<br />
I base them on science, or rather on the scientific method, which<br />
is our ultimate defence against dogma and mysticism. I base<br />
them on the idealism of youth, of a generation which has already<br />
rejected war and which displays a greater capacity for love<br />
and human tolerance than any before it. And I base them on<br />
man's instinctive common sense, his natural will to survive,<br />
which has carried him through crises in the past and will do so.<br />
again. </p>
