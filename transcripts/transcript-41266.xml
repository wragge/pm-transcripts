    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia has lost a great statesman; Sir Ninian Stephen has died, aged 94.</p>
<p>A former Governor-General, Justice of the High Court of Australia, and Australian infantryman, Sir Ninian’s long and highly distinguished career was dedicated to the service of the Australian public.</p>
<p>Moving to Australia at age 17, he studied to become a lawyer at the University of Melbourne, before joining the Australian Imperial Force in the Second World War.</p>
<p>Sir Ninian served as Governor-General from 1982 to 1989, bringing a gentle dignity to the role and representing the very best of Australia while encouraging the very best from all Australians.</p>
<p>There are very few honours that Sir Ninian doesn’t have to his name—he’s been knighted five times, was a Justice of the High Court of Australia and Supreme Court of Victoria, member of the Privy Council and Australian Ambassador for the Environment.</p>
<p>Internationally, he will be remembered for his work on the Northern Ireland peace talks and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, among other sensitive diplomatic and legal assignments.</p>
<p>Australia will remember Sir Ninian for his humility, his intellect, and his lifelong commitment to justice and the rule of law.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Government and the people of Australia, I send our heartfelt condolences to his wife Lady Stephen and their family at this sad time.</p>
<p>Sir Ninian’s family has accepted my offer of a State Funeral.</p>
