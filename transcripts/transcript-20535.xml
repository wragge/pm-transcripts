    <content><![CDATA[<p>Well thank you very much Wilson, to the Speaker, the Chairman of the National Capital Development Authority, Air Marshal Evans, Peter Lucas Smith, Mike Castles, the Commissioner of the Federal Police Mike Keelty, members of various emergency services organisations, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p> I'm particularly honoured to be associated with this event. Australia has long needed a national memorial to mark the nation's respect for the enormous sacrifices that so many people in our emergency services make in the interests of our own personal safety and in the interests of our national well-being. It is especially appropriate that this unveiling ceremony, if I can put it that way, this announcement takes place only a short period of time after the Australian community living here in Canberra being particularly reminded of the ferocity of natural events, and has had the opportunity of seeing on full and such effective display the capacity of our emergency services. We were all greatly touched by what they did, we're all very grateful to them for what they did and it is very appropriate that all of us coming together as Australians, mark the sacrifices of those who've died in the service of our community. And at a time when people are... young Australians, young Australian men and women have their lives on the line in the service of the nation around the world we are particularly conscious of people who do things that involve a great personal risk to them for their fellow Australians.</p>
<p> And today's an opportunity to announce the winner of this competition and to recommit the Government, of course, to the construction of the Memorial and to look forward to its opening. The National Emergency Services Memorial will honour both career personnel and volunteers. And when we think of Australian mateship, nothing better expresses it than the way in which people work together at a time of adversity. You all saw it here in the Canberra community quite magnificently and other communities have seen it over the years, not only in relation to bushfires and floods but also in relation to events and tragedies such as... some of them were remarked upon in the earlier speeches that involve significant loss of life through accident and disaster.</p>
<p> And on every occasion there's a magnificent willingness on the part of Australians to come together - career people, as well as volunteers, the community generally - differences are forgotten, inhibitions fall away and people work together. You saw it in Canberra and you've seen it on so many other occasions. And it is a special expression of the special character of the Australian people that makes all of us feel especially proud. So, this Memorial is going to honour the contribution of both career people and also volunteers, it will honour especially those who've died making Australia a safer place and helping their fellow Australians. The Memorial will be located at the western edge of Kings Park, adjacent to the Rond Terraces and is scheduled for completion within the next 12 months. The Minister's already announced the three runners up in the national design competition.</p>
<p> And I have great pleasure in announcing the winning design, and the winning design fulfils very much the requirements of the design brief to commemorate the contribution and sacrifice of emergency services personnel in a sensitive, yet very powerful way. A simple yet moving design that allows for visits to the Memorial to be both private and shared. And the winner - the design was submitted by ASPECT Melbourne Proprietary Limited and I ask Kirsten Bauer to come forward to accept the congratulations and the certificate.</p>
<p> Congratulations to your company and I'd like you to say a few words.</p>
