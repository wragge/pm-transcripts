<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I appreciate you taking the time. I hope you didn't have a</p>
<p>   glass of water with it in it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I didn't. Gee, it's one of those unexpected things</p>
<p>   and everybody here's hoping it will be fixed up as soon as</p>
<p>   possible. It's a reminder though of things we take for granted,</p>
<p>   isn't it?</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yeah, a bit embarrassing too, though, isn't it, for Sydney?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Of course it's embarrassing and everybody does feel embarrassed</p>
<p>   and we hope it's fixed as soon as possible. Meanwhile, boil</p>
<p>   your water and brush your teeth in bottled water.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Does something like this, I don't know, does it impact on</p>
<p>   Sydney as an Olympic City, or do you think or will it be gone by</p>
<p>   then?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's expected to be gone by the weekend, so I don't</p>
<p>   think it will have any impact at all on that. It is one of those</p>
<p>   embarrassing things that can happen to any city anywhere in the</p>
<p>   world. Let's be realistic about it.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>They just tell me if it can't happen in Melbourne, we're</p>
<p>   very delighted by that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I see, I see. Well, I won't buy into that. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>No, fair enough. Now the GST, as I understand it you have briefed</p>
<p>   members of the Parliament, your members of Parliament today. Is</p>
<p>   that right?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We're going through the process of briefing different groups</p>
<p>   of people. Neil, I would like this plan to be out in the streets</p>
<p>   and on the airwaves as soon as humanly possible. I know there's</p>
<p>   a lot of interest in it and in no way are we holding it back or</p>
<p>   are we playing games with the public and we're certainly not</p>
<p>   leaking out selective bits of information to try and manage the</p>
<p>   news. It's just that it's such a big thing that once it's</p>
<p>   been approved by the people who must approve it then takes a little</p>
<p>   time to get everything printed, to get all the figures checked,</p>
<p>   to get all the calculations absolutely A1 perfect and that's</p>
<p>   the reason why a little bit more time will go by before it comes</p>
<p>   out.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I guess that my concern about the way it's coming out is that</p>
<p>   it's creating quite a climate of fear because of the dribs</p>
<p>   and drabs that are there, and the extrapolation that the newspapers</p>
<p>   are putting on to it. Do you think it is dangerous in that sense,</p>
<p>   it's frightening people?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Neil there's nothing we can do about that and I'm</p>
<p>   quite certain, when the whole plan comes out and people see the</p>
<p>   whole picture and not part of the picture, they will lose their</p>
<p>   fear. Until that happens and naturally the only responses I can</p>
<p>   give are the sort of ones I'm now giving. We are working overtime</p>
<p>   to get all the details together in a presentable understandable</p>
<p>   form. It is a very comprehensive change. This is the biggest change</p>
<p>   to Australia's taxation system since World War II and we have to</p>
<p>   be certain that it's plain and simple in its presentation.</p>
<p>   We are not trying to hold it back, we are not trying to play games</p>
<p>   with the public. If I could announce the whole thing at the weekend</p>
<p>   and if I could miraculously complete all the consultation processes</p>
<p>   I would do so. But I just can't do that and I just ask my fellow</p>
<p>   Australians to be a little patient. I don't expect the press</p>
<p>   to be patient. That is not your job and I accept that. I accept</p>
<p>   that it's part of the role of the press to try and get information</p>
<p>   before it's meant to be released. I understand all of that.</p>
<p>   I do complain occasionally about the media's behaviour on some</p>
<p>   issues. I don't blame it for trying to get a story a day out</p>
<p>   of the tax reform policy. I wouldn't be so nave. But, please,</p>
<p>   take it from me, we're not trying to manage the news. There's</p>
<p>   a lot of speculation about what's in it. Can I say to your</p>
<p>   listeners it is no more than that. It is speculation. And people</p>
<p>   should suspend a final judgement until, or any judgement, until</p>
<p>   they see the full plan.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is any of it right, are you willing to say that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I'm not willing to say that. I'm just willing to</p>
<p>   neither confirm nor deny any of the speculation that's been</p>
<p>   in the papers. And I will, of course, see that the plan is fully</p>
<p>   and publicly announced as soon as possible. But before that happens</p>
<p>   there's more work to be done. There are still one or two details</p>
<p>   yet to be finalised. The idea that every single detail was nailed</p>
<p>   down a few days ago is not correct. There are a few things left</p>
<p>   to be finalised and they are being...in the process of being</p>
<p>   finalised and when that happens, then you've got to complete</p>
<p>   calculations and cross-checking and printing and all sorts of things</p>
<p>   and that does take a little while.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you think it will be available next week?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm not going to talk about time at this stage. It will be</p>
<p>   out as soon as possible. I wish I could say more, but it will be</p>
<p>   well worth the wait when it comes out, can I put it that way? </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The sort of detail that isn't finalised, is that around the</p>
<p>   edges or are we talking about main parts of it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, everything's important in something like this. It's</p>
<p>   not something that's an absolute central core, but there are</p>
<p>   one or two important details.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I assume that when you  talking about leaks  when you</p>
<p>   talk to the members of Parliament about it, I mean, the leaks will</p>
<p>   really take off then, won't they?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we'll wait and see. We'll wait and see. I'm</p>
<p>   not - as I say, there's a lot of speculation in the newspapers,</p>
<p>   it is no more than that and I'm not going to say which bit</p>
<p>   is closer to the mark or which bit is further away from the mark.</p>
<p>   It is all speculation and I'm not going to confirm or deny</p>
<p>   it. I'm naturally happy to talk about the goals of the policy.</p>
<p>   I'm naturally happy to describe it for what it is. It's</p>
<p>   more than just changing the way the taxation system works, it's</p>
<p>   a bold attempt to give Australia a more competitive edge for the</p>
<p>   future. It is very much about the Australian economy in the 21st</p>
<p>   Century. And I know there are political risks involved in such a</p>
<p>   bold plan but if it's in the national interest then you have</p>
<p>   a duty to take that risk. I mean, what I'm risking is the political</p>
<p>   position of myself and the Liberal Party. I'm not risking Australia's</p>
<p>   position.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yes, I wanted to ask you about that because the Premier, Mr Kennett,</p>
<p>   here yesterday, was saying he thought you were, well, he said you</p>
<p>   are so committed and excited by what was ahead. I sort of got the</p>
<p>   feeling that you were very much putting yourself and your Government</p>
<p>   on the line over this, that this either  in the old Gough</p>
<p>   Whitlam terms  it's either crash or crash through, that</p>
<p>   this goes ahead and is accepted by the people or it's the end</p>
<p>   of John Howard. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I wouldn't ever seek to compare the Government with</p>
<p>   the Whitlam Government, please, never. However, I have taken the</p>
<p>   view, and I have this view very strongly, that this plan, this reform,</p>
<p>   this change, is very much to the benefit of Australia's future.</p>
<p>   Now, I accept, in the conventional wisdom of politics, there is</p>
<p>   some personal and party political risk for the Government. But the</p>
<p>   important thing is what is in the national interest and I have an</p>
<p>   obligation to risk my own political position in order to achieve</p>
<p>   something for Australia. It's not, in my terms, an acceptable</p>
<p>   trade-off to say, well, I'll consider our political position</p>
<p>   and to hell with the public interest. What really matters is Australia's</p>
<p>   future. And everybody knows, Kim Beazley knows, Gareth Evans knows,</p>
<p>   you know, Jeff Kennett knows, everybody knows we need a new tax</p>
<p>   system. </p>
<p>I mean, for heaven's sake, Kim Beazley and Gareth Evans supported</p>
<p>   Paul Keating 12 years ago when he said we needed a new tax system.</p>
<p>   I mean, we all know that. We can't go on forever with the present</p>
<p>   system. Okay, there is a risk. People can react negatively. Mr Beazley</p>
<p>   will run a fear campaign. I mean they will try and scare everybody</p>
<p>   but, in the end, is the country going to be any better off? Paul</p>
<p>   Keating scared everybody in 1993 and the country was not better</p>
<p>   off when he won the election. He then went ahead without notice</p>
<p>   and without warning and put up all our indirect taxes. So, in the</p>
<p>   end, I have an obligation to argue for what is good for Australia's</p>
<p>   future and if I suffer politically, well, that is the process.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But you either get it up or you're gone, don't you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that is a matter for the Australian public. What I am doing</p>
<p>   is saying that the Australian economic interest and public interest</p>
<p>   is more important than my political hide.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay. Once it's released, whenever that is, next week, week</p>
<p>   after, whenever it is, is that it, is it not open to further change?</p>
<p>   We saw the situation the last time this was tried with last minute</p>
<p>   changes. Once it's there, is that it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, yes. There'll be provision made in the announcement in</p>
<p>   a number of areas for consultation. But the essential elements are</p>
<p>   not going to be changed, no. We have spent months thinking about</p>
<p>   it and testing ideas with various people, with thinking about different</p>
<p>   combinations and what we release in the very near future will be</p>
<p>   it. We will naturally reserve some areas for discussion, particularly</p>
<p>   in relation to transition and implementation and we'll establish</p>
<p>   a mechanism for people's views about those transitional arrangements</p>
<p>   to be put. However, the rates that are announced and all the other</p>
<p>   details and all of those things, they will naturally not be open</p>
<p>   to negotiation.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>One of the things that's coming through to me from people</p>
<p>   is a fear that there'll be profiteering possibly around it</p>
<p>   where prices which should go down, won't go down because people</p>
<p>   will be making the extra dollar out of it. Will there be a mechanism</p>
<p>   to prevent that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There will. We've given a lot of thought to that. And part</p>
<p>   of the announcement will be a mechanism to ensure that price decreases,</p>
<p>   as a result of changes in taxation arrangements, will occur. We're</p>
<p>   not going to cop any attempt by anybody to profiteer. The purpose</p>
<p>   of this plan is to deliver to all Australians a better taxation</p>
<p>   system. There'll be mechanisms to compensate and protect low-income</p>
<p>   earners and we intend to see that those mechanisms work to the full.</p>
<p>   And there will be arrangements which will crackdown hard on anybody</p>
<p>   who attempts to profiteer.</p>
<p>[COMMERCIAL BREAK]</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>We're speaking to the Prime Minister, talking about GST, but</p>
<p>   you can raise anything you wish. Hello, Annette, go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Neil. I would just like to ask Mr Howard  with</p>
<p>   the GST, as far as buying and selling or buying, especially young</p>
<p>   couples, buying a home, are they going to put 10 per cent on the</p>
<p>   cost of that purchase of the home?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Annette, I won't answer that because it is to go into</p>
<p>   the details of what may or may not be in the plan and until I'm</p>
<p>   ready to announce the whole lot I'm not going to announce bits</p>
<p>   and pieces of it. I understand your interest. Let me respond by</p>
<p>   saying that when you see the whole package, having in mind you interest</p>
<p>   in buying a home, I think you'll be well satisfied.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>You must be a bit frustrated by this, Prime Minister, because you</p>
<p>   know the answers and you can't say them.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am, but what else can one do if you want a proper launch and</p>
<p>   proper explanation of something. You're damned if you do and</p>
<p>   you're damned if you don't. I don't want to disappear</p>
<p>   into a cocoon until it comes out and then be accused of running</p>
<p>   from answering questions on it. I'm happy, to the best of the</p>
<p>   limitation that I've got, to deal with people's answers.</p>
<p>   But, gee, when it comes out I think this few days of frustration</p>
<p>   will be forgotten in 10 minutes because people will have so much</p>
<p>   to occupy themselves and there'll be so many different aspects</p>
<p>   of the plan that people haven't thought of that will enthuse</p>
<p>   them.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>How broadly will you debate it once it's released? For example,</p>
<p>   will you debate the Opposition on it, debate Kim Beazley?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'll debate Kim Beazley during any election campaign.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. The other thing  Jeff Kennett here said</p>
<p>   that he'd be keen to get on the road to help sell it. Do you</p>
<p>   want him out there with you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I do. Jeff has been an enthusiastic advocate of taxation reform</p>
<p>   and I would expect, when the whole plan is announced, that Jeff</p>
<p>   will be one of its strongest supporters because he's been calling,</p>
<p>   for a long time, for taxation reform. And, on this issue, I believe</p>
<p>   that Jeff Kennett and John Howard will be working together very,</p>
<p>   very closely indeed.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I think you might, in general terms, be able to answer this. But</p>
<p>   I noticed the Chamber of Commerce is talking about the dangers of</p>
<p>   it being inflationary and the need for, well, perhaps even the need</p>
<p>   for an interest rate rise.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't believe there'll be any need for an interest</p>
<p>   rate rise, definitely not. When it all comes out I don't think</p>
<p>   people will be concerned in the least bit about any possible inflationary</p>
<p>   consequences. And bear in mind that Australia now has the lowest</p>
<p>   inflation rate in the western world. There could not, therefore,</p>
<p>   be a more ideal time to introduce a plan of this character.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I should, in fairness, say the American Chamber of Commerce in</p>
<p>   Australia, not the Australian Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, well, I assumed it had to be an overseas Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>   because the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry have been</p>
<p>   a very, very strong supporter of taxation reform, very strong indeed.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>And on the business side, will there be significant business tax</p>
<p>   reform or are you going to save some of that for a later stage?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we've already indicated that an option in this area</p>
<p>   would be to lay out a general framework for future reform and that</p>
<p>   there should be consultation with the business community against</p>
<p>   the background of that framework. And that is an option that both</p>
<p>   the Treasurer and I have spoken of earlier. And certainly there</p>
<p>   will be a number of changes and reforms that affect the business</p>
<p>   area, but there's also the option of laying out a framework</p>
<p>   and taking part in a consultative process in relation to that. Bear</p>
<p>   in mind that any fundamental restructuring of the taxation system,</p>
<p>   particularly in the area of indirect taxation where you might replace</p>
<p>   existing indirect taxes with a goods and services tax at a single</p>
<p>   rate, bear in mind that that, of itself, delivers enormous cost</p>
<p>   savings to the business community and is, therefore, of particular</p>
<p>   benefit to exporters and particularly, again, within that group</p>
<p>   of exporters, to people who are manufacturing exporters.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>We'll take another call. Hello, Mark, go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes, Neil, good morning and good morning Mr Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, I wanted to draw your attention to a decision taken</p>
<p>   by the ATO in respect to a movie production which I believe has</p>
<p>   been discussed at Federal Liberal Party meetings. Basically what's</p>
<p>   happened is, four years ago I, along with 900 other investors, invested</p>
<p>   in a movie. Now, at that stage the Assistant Commissioner, Kevin</p>
<p>   Hockter, had given an opinion on movies in general to say that they</p>
<p>   would be allowed as a tax deduction. Now, we've received, along</p>
<p>   with 900 other people, a letter from the Tax Office, saying </p>
<p>   four years after that event and despite auditing that production</p>
<p>   company for the last four or five years  they've decided</p>
<p>   that they're not going to have that allowed as a tax deduction.</p>
<p>   In addition, they're going to put penalty interest and a penalty</p>
<p>   on people who have claimed that as a deduction. And we're getting,</p>
<p>   unfortunately, no assistance at the ATO. We've actually had</p>
<p>   meetings with the ATO on Monday. We've had a collection of</p>
<p>   people drawn together with our solicitor and we've also had</p>
<p>   meetings with a local Federal member who said that this has been</p>
<p>   brought up with the Federal Liberal Party.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay, thanks Mark. I think that's explained it and it obviously</p>
<p>   has implications for other film investments as well.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Mark, I gather that you said you had been told four years ago by</p>
<p>   Mr Hockter, was it, Kevin Hockter?</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yes, I think that's right. Mark, was that it?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>...that this investment would be an acceptable tax deduction.</p>
<p>   Now, if you can provide the evidence, the letter or whatever was</p>
<p>   provided at the time, if you could provide that to my office - I</p>
<p>   have heard reference to this issue in a number of contexts. I think</p>
<p>   there was a press report in the Financial Review about it,</p>
<p>   an article written by Trevor Sykes a few days ago - I will have</p>
<p>   a look at it. Bear in mind that under the Tax Act the Commissioner</p>
<p>   has an independent authority and I can't overturn his decisions</p>
<p>   but I can make representations to him in a quite open way if I think</p>
<p>   he's done the wrong thing. And I'm not reluctant to do</p>
<p>   that if I do think he's done the wrong thing. So could you</p>
<p>   and anybody else affected by this who may happen to be listening,</p>
<p>   if you can get to my office the material evidence of the assurance</p>
<p>   to which you refer, plus, of course, the subsequent communication</p>
<p>   which disregarded that earlier assurance, I'll have a look</p>
<p>   it.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Okay, Mark, hold on and we'll arrange, if you wish </p>
<p>   I'd like to see a copy of that as well if you don't mind,</p>
<p>   just hang on.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>We'll take another quick call or we're running out of</p>
<p>   time for the Prime Minister. Judy-Anne, go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Neil. Mr Prime Minister, it's Judy-Anne from</p>
<p>   the National Office of Disability Support Pensioners Australia.</p>
<p>   You probably had a couple of faxes from us in the last...</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Judy-Anne, I reluctantly sort of continue here because this is</p>
<p>   not normally for lobby groups, it's for members of the public.</p>
<p>   But seeing you're here...</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Well, that's what we are Neil.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yes, I understand that, but you have other means of access. So</p>
<p>   let's make it a very quick question if you don't mind.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes, certainly. Mr Prime Minister, has consideration been given</p>
<p>   to those on a disability support pension, the young pensioners,</p>
<p>   with the GST for affordability in our pensioners to pay for health</p>
<p>   purposes and medications when it comes down to the pharmaceuticals</p>
<p>   level? Also, we're looking at utility bills and the list goes</p>
<p>   on. We're a bit concerned that we may not be able to afford</p>
<p>   these things on such a low fixed income.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, when you see the plan you won't have those concerns.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, I want to ask you about something else. Now the full</p>
<p>   Telstra sale is not on, what happens...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, now, that's not right.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Put on yet.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, all that's happened is that it will now be done in stages.</p>
<p>   We remain committed to the full sale of Telstra but we will do it</p>
<p>   in stages  49 per cent first  then if we're told</p>
<p>   by an independent committee that the community service obligations</p>
<p>   of Telstra will be met, we then proceed to sell the rest.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What happens to the social bonus?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, the social bonus remains. We have announced some details of</p>
<p>   it and some further details will be announced in the future. Obviously</p>
<p>   the payment of that social bonus is conditional upon the sale, first</p>
<p>   of all, of 49 per cent and then the sale of the subsequent government</p>
<p>   interest in the company.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
