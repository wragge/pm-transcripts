    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was dismayed to read that an international non-government agency is seeking to burden businesses in measuring their environmental performance with further costly and unnecessary paperwork.</p>
<p>I cannot condone such moves and would join with Australian industry in rejecting further so-called standards being imposed upon them in the name of quality.</p>
<p>My government is committed to reducing the paperwork impost that businesses face.</p>
<p>The processes and paperwork required to achieve an ISO Standard might provide firms with a certificate, but it certainly does not guarantee excellence or improvement which is what consumers of goods and services expect.</p>
<p>However, the Commonwealth remains committed to good quality value when<br />
purchasing goods and services. The market place quickly determines which goods and services are of quality and the others, quite rightly, should improve their standards to meet and even exceed the market's expectations. Certficates based on burdensome paper trails will not improve Australia's standing in world markets.</p>
<p>As a further demonstration of its commitment to reduce the paper burden on small business, the government intends reducing the compliance cost of trading and dealing with the Commonwealth. Imposing yet another barrier to business is entirely inconsistent with this approach and will not be pursued.</p>
