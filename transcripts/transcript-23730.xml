    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>I look forward to the security and intelligence briefings that Iâll be receiving this morning, and I am looking forward very much to meeting with the Foreign Secretary and with the Secretary of State for Defence later on today. </p>
<p>This is a difficult and dangerous world and itâs important that Australia stays in the closest possible touch with our friends and partners, particularly with this developing situation in the Middle East. </p>
<p>So I am pleased to be here and I look forward to having more to say about the discussions later on.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
<p>How far are you willing to go on Iraq?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>As is already the case, we are preparing to involve ourselves in the humanitarian airdrop. Weâll continue talking to our friends and partners about other issues, but at this stage I want to stress that this is very much a humanitarian mission to try to ensure that tens of thousands of people are not exposed to the murderous zealotry of the Islamic State.</p>
