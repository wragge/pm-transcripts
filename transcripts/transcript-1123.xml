PRESS CONFERNCE GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES, IN LONDON, ON 27TH JUNE. 196S.<br />
PRIME MINISTER,: There is a passage in the communique about the<br />
voluntary contributions to the United Nations to get it out<br />
of its present financial troubles, Great Britain and Canada<br />
having made announcements. I reserved the decision of<br />
Australia and perhaps that requires a little explanation.<br />
What I said was there were two aspects to the<br />
matter. One was that we all wanted to see the United Nations<br />
solvent but that the nations who hadn't paid and about whom<br />
the Article 19 argument was being waged, must consider whether<br />
their position was being weakened or strengthened by these<br />
voluntary conti butions. In other words, if the people who<br />
hadn't paid comt to the conclusion they can go on refusing<br />
to pay because the other people will make up the difference<br />
by voluntary contributions, it may be that the Article 19<br />
point will never be determined and I think it should be<br />
determined and determined quite soon.<br />
I indicated that we had a good record of voluntary<br />
contributions but I did want to discuss that with my colleagues<br />
as to which way the balance might lie. You might have noticed<br />
that the United States had not announced any voluntary contributions<br />
yet and I don't know whether they will at all. They<br />
may have similar considerations in their mind. This question<br />
requires a little thought from the point of view of are we<br />
handicapping ourselves in the Article 19 argument.<br />
There was some discussion about whether the<br />
Prime Minister of Great Britain should be Chairman of the<br />
Mission. The overwhelming view of the conference was that he<br />
was doing it as Chairman of the conference not as Pr~ ime Minister<br />
of Great Britain. There was a great deal of argument if one might<br />
call it such about Great Britain being committed against the<br />
North Vietnamese, Some members of the Conference appeared to think<br />
that they were not committed one way or the other. The fact is<br />
that most of them were. They think Australia is committed<br />
as indeed Australia is because Australia has produced troops.<br />
Australia was committed before then quite clearly as a matter<br />
of publicly-stated policy.<br />
Countries like Tanzania and so on are equally<br />
committed not by troops but by the plainest public declarations<br />
in favour of China and against America.<br />
I think there is a good deal of double talk<br />
about committed people and uncommitted people on this matter.<br />
In fact I think on two or three occasions I said so,<br />
The end result on Malaysia I thought was not<br />
unsa t isfa ctory. The shadow of the Afro-Asian conference at<br />
Algiers has been rather heavily cast upon this conference.<br />
It may seem odd because it has nothing to do with the Commonwealth.<br />
It is an entirely different body which has some<br />
membership in common, Still it was very much in evidence and<br />
I thought at one stage there was a disposition to go a little<br />
cautiously on the subject of Malaysia and the Indonesian o 12 </p>
<p>-2<br />
confrontation and this might muddy the waters at Algiers and<br />
therefore the end result was very satisfactory from our point<br />
of view because they once more quoted what we said last year and<br />
added words bringing it up to date, so I think the Malaysian matter<br />
came out pretty well.<br />
There are a few comments I would make on disarmament.<br />
You know or can guess how these communiques are hammered out over<br />
a long day, but you get to a conclusion which isn't exactly in the<br />
form you would have liked yourself but in substance is near enough<br />
to be acceptable. This disarmament question includes one or two<br />
illustrations of that<br />
" They hoped that early progress would be made towards<br />
an acceptable agreement on some of these measures<br />
including the limitation and reduction of stocks of<br />
nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles,"<br />
Now this standing by itself, a reduction of stocks of nuclear weapons<br />
unaccompanied by reductions in conventional arms and armaments<br />
seems to me to be inadequate, and so I made the point and the words<br />
were added " and a phased reduction in conventional armaments"<br />
which brought it back into balance. Everybody agreed that that<br />
was right but it had perhaps been overlooked in the draft.<br />
This reference to nuclear-free zones arises because<br />
the Organisation of African unity and the Latin American States<br />
have been working out the idea of a nuclear-free zone in their own<br />
countries. I explained the reason why my Government rejected the<br />
idea of a nuclear-free zone South of the Equator.<br />
Somebody credited me with talking about nuclear<br />
visitors, which was a new phrase to me and I not having uttered it,<br />
don't know what it is, but I can repeat the point that I made with<br />
the greatest of pleasure, because I have made it elsewhere.<br />
I said that if we were to enter into agreement for a nu clea r-free:. zone<br />
south of the equator and were in a position to enforce suchagreements<br />
as we had miade, the only effect would be that our<br />
opponents being situated north of the equator could fire nuclear<br />
weapons at us or at our friends without retaliation because we<br />
would have banned our friends from discharging nuclear weapons<br />
from south of the equator. That would be a ridiculous position<br />
it would help our enemies and hurt our friends.<br />
We are not starting a nuclear war and Australia is<br />
not a nuclear power and has no intention of becoming one, wIe<br />
agree that there should not be a proliferation of nuclear weapons.<br />
We think they ought to be kept in as few hands as possible,<br />
responsible hands, and we would fear very much the escalation of<br />
small wars if a number of powers themse~, ves possessed nuclear<br />
weapons. This has been stated by me many times in the Commonwealth<br />
Parliament, If some other people in entirely different circumstances<br />
want to set up a nuclear-free zone, that is their business.<br />
That is the background to the disarmament passage.<br />
Now letts turn to Rhodesia which occupied an<br />
enormous amount of time this year as it did last,<br />
From the very beginning of this meeting, the British<br />
Government made it clear through Mr. Bottomley that they wanted<br />
a state Of affairs in which there would be steady progress towards<br />
majority rule unimpeded by reactionary constitutional changes,<br />
immediate improvement in the Political status of the African<br />
population and the progressive elimination of racial discrimination. P a e ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
They also made it quite clear that they wouldn't recommend to<br />
Parliament Parliament being the one authority on this matter<br />
the grant of independence to Rhodesia unless they were satisfied<br />
it was on a basis acceptable to the people of the country taken<br />
as a whole. In other words, to the majority of the people on a<br />
conception of adult suffrage, Now this seemed to me to be clear<br />
enough. Over what period the change to complete majority rule<br />
should occur that is of course a different matter. Nobody but<br />
the extremisis could imagine that it could be created tomorrow<br />
morning and perhaps none but an extremist on the other side would<br />
believe that it could never be created. This is the problem of<br />
Southern Rhodesia, the two extreme views no change complete<br />
change tomorrow morning. I think there is a growing support for<br />
the idea that this has to be phased in some careful way so that<br />
over a period of time the movement is steadily towards increasing<br />
the African vote until you get a majority and they will be in<br />
charge of Parliament. This, I imagine, is the view of the British<br />
Government and it was the view of several of us who spoke on this<br />
matter. Now the communique itself as in the case of last year's<br />
set out first of all what the British Minister said and then what<br />
some other Prime Ministers said. The British Prime Minister was<br />
urged by other not the other Prime Ministers you will observe<br />
but other Prime Ministers, because I was not one of them nor were<br />
indeed two or three others..., was urged to convene a constitutional<br />
conferenge at an early date, say within three months and there<br />
were certain other, in effect, directions contained in that<br />
paragraph. These were the viei~ s expressed to the British Government,<br />
not by the conference, but by certain Prime Ministers with<br />
strong views on these matters, principally African Prime Ministers.<br />
My approach to the matter was and is that I think that<br />
the British Government having the complete responsibility on this<br />
matter is having to deal not with a Crowm colony but with a selfgoverning<br />
colony which has been self-governing for many years, that<br />
the British Government should not be handicapped by too much<br />
iiublic instruction, that it was rather a mistake to be talking<br />
a ' bout a conference within three months. It was quite unrealistic,<br />
particularly as obviously there must first of all be some rnegotiations<br />
continued between Great Britain and Southern Rhodesia and as<br />
Mr. Wilson pointed out in the last paragraph of the communique on<br />
this point if there is undue tardiness, if there is no willingness<br />
to engage In these discussions then the British Government would<br />
consider whether it should call a constitutional conference between<br />
all the relevant parties.<br />
Now it is quite clear that the United Kingdom understands<br />
the difficulty of this matter. This is not a problem which lends<br />
itself to shouting from the sidelines, It is a very serious and<br />
difficult problem and so far as I am concerned I would like to<br />
see an attitude of mind on both sides in which discussions continued<br />
in a constructive way between the Governments of Britain and<br />
Southern Rhodesia, leading in due course whenever that may be, to<br />
the holding of a conference in which all aspects of the matter can<br />
be thrashed out from a constitutional point of view.<br />
All this cannot be done in three months, but I think<br />
this is rather a bravura touch put in to exhibit their sense of<br />
the urgency of the matter. A little quietness and a little<br />
deliberation would be of great value on this matter. 0 0 0 / 4 </p>
<p>I must say I thaought Mr. ' Wilson and his Government<br />
went as far as any Government could go on this matter.<br />
Later on there is a reference to immigration to<br />
Britain. I would like to point out that this was not discussed<br />
by the conference as a conference. I take the strongest possible<br />
view that every countryts immigration policy is its own business<br />
and this is not open to debate at a Prime Ministers' Conference*<br />
It happened that bilaterally the Prime Minister of Great Britain<br />
had talks with some of the countries affected by the immigigtion<br />
laws and that is why the matter was referred to. One or two of<br />
them mentioned it in the conference itself, but there was no doubt<br />
whatever no lack of unanimity about the proposition that the<br />
extent ol immigration into Britain was entirely a matter for the<br />
British Government. I want to emphasise that there was no immigration policy,<br />
for example, of Australia's mentioned. It i-s, in this case,<br />
entirely a matter for the British Government, and obviously our<br />
own is entirely a matter for us. Now this is a very vital<br />
principle. There's a little disposition in the new Commonwealth<br />
I'm using words with extreme moderation to want to discuss and<br />
deal with domestic problems in other countries and this, of course,<br />
if pursued will become fatal to the Commonwealth. An association<br />
of free, independent, autonomous nations are not going to have<br />
their internal business tossed around in conference and the<br />
inurigation policy is, of course, a perfect example. Every country<br />
there at the table has its own policy and I think would agree must<br />
jealously guard its own rights to determine the composition of its<br />
own population. The reference that was made to the meeting of Commonwealth<br />
trade ministers is preceded by a reference to an offi* cials?<br />
meeting. I myself pointed out that there was no value in convening<br />
a meeting of Commonwealth trade ministers just out of the blue to<br />
sit down to discuss an almost infinite variety of trading problems,<br />
some of which concern one country, some two, some three, but very<br />
few of which concern the lot and if such a meeting occurred., they<br />
would be bound to say we musi refer these matters to officials.<br />
Therefore, commonsense suggested that the officials should meet<br />
first and do a bit of work on this matter before the ministers<br />
themselves met. Well that view was accepted and was included in<br />
the communique. The Commonwealth Foundation speaks for itself; that was<br />
accepted all round without any difficulty.<br />
The Commonwealth Assembly didn't leave the barrier.<br />
Well perhaps I'm wrong, The starter started it but it didn't go<br />
for a furlong for the fairly obvious reasons thai we have the<br />
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the Inter-Parliamentary<br />
Union and this seems to all of us here to be merely duplication.<br />
The Commonwealth Secretariat. There had been a difference<br />
of opinion about what the functions of the Secretariat ought to be.<br />
Some of my colleagues obviously felt it ought have a very wide<br />
commission and be able to conduct investigations and make economic<br />
recommendations, exercise some supervisory power over works of<br />
development. There were others of us who said that that would be<br />
fatal, that it would require an enormous secretariat for a start<br />
and would give rise to a good deal of resentment around the Commonwealth<br />
on the part of people who thought they were quite capable<br />
of conducting their own developmental ideas. In the long run, the<br />
ea e so o o </p>
<p>limited proposition was approved. The Secretariat is to be what<br />
I will call a facilitating body, not to be an executive body. It<br />
is not to seek to extend its jurisdiction in a hurry and must<br />
proceed cautiously in a pragmatic way, and that being accepted as<br />
it was, I think the Secretariat might serve a very useful purpose.<br />
As you already know, Arnold Smith was appointed. In<br />
fact, I gather that during the discussions he had an overwhelming<br />
volume of support and in the conference where his nomination was<br />
approved unanimously. I'm supposed to have had strong views about<br />
various people. I don't know why. I read in one paperthat used<br />
to be a pretty accurate paper, to the effect that I have been<br />
carrying since Suez a sort of vendetta with a gentleman called<br />
George Ivan Smith. I had never heard of him at the time of Suez;<br />
in fact I wasn't conscious of his existence until his name appeared<br />
on the list of nominees. Sir John Bunting reminded me that he<br />
was once at a dinner which I attended. That's the nearest I have<br />
ever got to him. I have no views good, bad or indifferent<br />
a bout him. It has to be remembered that there is great advantage<br />
in a venture of this kind in having a man who has what I will call<br />
civil service experience, who is accustomed to the processes of<br />
government and how they are worked out, who knows how the political<br />
animal operates as all senior civil servants do, and of course in<br />
this field this man was outstanding.<br />
Peiris of Ceylon, whom we didn't nominate, but whose<br />
name we said ought to be under consideration because people have<br />
a very high opinion of him turned out to be not available because<br />
he has been appointed the Lbassador of Ceylon to W~ est Germany.<br />
There is no reason why if the Secretariat carries out<br />
its designed functions and doesn't extend them there is no reason<br />
why the whole experiment should not be extremely useful.<br />
I'm told that one or two points ought to be made on the<br />
guide lines of the Commonwealth mission.<br />
It must be remembered that this mission has been appointad<br />
by the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference and is responsible<br />
to it as a conference. Men are not appointed to the mission simply<br />
in order to air their own views, but to represent what is<br />
undoubtedly a wide cross-section of opinion in the Commonwealth<br />
itself. It became desirable to set out what ultimate objectives<br />
are during their consultations with the parties principally<br />
concerned, You will notice that paragraph is the suspension<br />
of air attacks on North Vietnam. This is accompanied by and<br />
these are regarded as completely hanging together, a North Vietnamese<br />
undertaking to prevent the movement of any military forces.<br />
I make no secret of my view that in the second paragraph<br />
we should have said " a suspension by North Vietnam" to balance<br />
the suspension in the first paragraph, but the general view was<br />
that the United States was not likely to suspend attacking the<br />
lines of communication and supply of the enemy merely on an<br />
undertaking, The undertaking would have to be effective before<br />
any result appeared under I dare say that is right.<br />
Total cease fire on all sides, I might say, includes<br />
a cease fire by the Viet Cong; whether the parties involved will<br />
include the Viet Cong is not a matter for me, but for the mission. .6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
They will go around and see if they can establish<br />
a basis for a conference. I don't quite know how you establish<br />
the basis for a conference with people who live in ambush and<br />
who come out of ambush and who presently have a nice healthy<br />
cover from cloud and rain. This is a physica problem, but<br />
following the usual communist technique, they have a political<br />
aspect and call themselves the National Liberation Front and<br />
these are designed for political purposes.<br />
It may be that if the mission ever reaches Hanoi,<br />
Hanoi may say " tie want to have some representative of the<br />
Viet Cong." 1 That would be entirely intelligible, since the<br />
Viet Cong are obviously working under their direction. There<br />
is no reason at all why they shouldn't send for one or two of<br />
them, but the mission will determine that.<br />
The difficulties of the mission are very great, but<br />
at the same time I think there was merit in the Commonwealth<br />
as such taking the initiative to indicate that whatever our views<br />
are, if a genuine conference could occur and be brought to accept<br />
genuine propositions which involved the freedom of South Vietnam,<br />
then the experiment was worth making,<br />
Q. You told us Mr. Wilson talked at length with you before<br />
putting up the proposal for a mission. Could you tell us what<br />
influence on his thinking that talk might have had?<br />
PM. I haven't a clue.<br />
Q. Has the Australian Government had any indication of the<br />
Viet Cong's willingness or otherwise to talk with the mission?<br />
PM. No, We have no means of communicating with them.<br />
I asked because there was a new Chinese agency report<br />
this morning that they would not meet the mission, but this did<br />
not come directly from them. It came from China.<br />
Pm. Yes, that would not surprise me. Let's be sensible about<br />
this matter. As long as North Vietnam and the Viet Cong think<br />
they are on a good wicket and are making headway, they won't talk.<br />
When they come to the conclusion they are not winning, that will<br />
be a different matter and that is why the United States an4 the<br />
rest of us who aro involved have to keep banging away at it.<br />
Q. Some days ago when someone asked you about the future of<br />
the Commonwealth you said you were " unclear". Do you feel any<br />
more inclined to be clearer after the last week?<br />
PM. No. I have no views to offer on that at all.<br />
Q* Do you regard the declaration on Malaysia this year as<br />
being stronger or more valuable than last year?<br />
Pm.* Temi No. I think that approximately it has the same effect.<br />
The ainthing was to get a recognition of Malaysiats place and<br />
Malaysia's right to preserve her integrity and to ask her friends<br />
for support which, of course, is the precise principle that any<br />
of the African countries would apply in their own case,<br />
Q. Might it not be slightly stronger because it refers to<br />
the country's integrity and gives support to the country, whereas<br />
last year they gave support only to the Prime Minister? 9 a e e e/ 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
P. M. I see the point you make. Yes from that point of<br />
view it might be regarded as more comprehensive. Yes, thank<br />
you very much.<br />
Q. In his second statement on the peace mission, Nkrumah<br />
said the mission had been placed in the absurd position of<br />
having to discuss with one of those who authorised the mission<br />
the terms upon which Australia itself was prepared to<br />
disengage itself, Do you accept the premise here that we<br />
are engaged in the struggle and therefore we ought to be one<br />
of the countries with whom the mission should confer?<br />
P. M. Oh no. That is quite unreal. True we have a force<br />
there and in that sense we are engaged in the struggle and<br />
we strongly support the American action, but the mission<br />
doesn't need to come and talk to us. Its main problem is<br />
to get in touch with those whom I may call " the other side".<br />
QG Do you want to comment on his proposition that the<br />
National Liberation Front and the Saigon authorities are<br />
rival governments engaged in a civil war?<br />
P. M. I think that is the communist line and 11m sorry that<br />
he has succumbed to it if he has. Civil war, really. Here is<br />
a settlement made and ihere is a line of demarcation. -There<br />
is a guarantee of no fighting across the frontier, no attack<br />
on South Vietnam, but yet you have all these attacks plainly<br />
organised by the Viet Cong, obviously organised from the<br />
north. In fact they hardly make any secret of it and their<br />
supplies all come from the north. They don't produce any<br />
munitions themselves, except for a few homemade things. They<br />
all come from the north, so the north is intervening in breach<br />
of the treaty on a large scale and to convert that into a<br />
civil war when it is really a war by the north against the<br />
south is just playing with words. W~ e don't accept that<br />
proposition any more than we would have accepted the<br />
proposition with Malaya a few years ago, when the communist<br />
bandits up in the north were engaged in a civil war. At that<br />
time nobody thought of it, but now it's the line,<br />
Q6 Do you think the Peking Government is making headway<br />
with some countries of the Commonwealh?<br />
P. M. Yes, I do. I think that the influence Le~ t's<br />
put it this way. I found this year perceptible signs of<br />
penetration by China in at least an ideological way, I<br />
think they have a real influence and perhaps a growing<br />
influence in some African countries. I won't particularise<br />
who they are.<br />
Q9 Were you heartened by the fact that the Commonwealth<br />
nations appear to have rather snubbed China over the Algiers<br />
Conference?<br />
P. M. Oh, don't ask me what their reasons are. I know<br />
nothing about the Afro-. Asian conference, but after all, when<br />
the erstwhile revolutionary head of the Algerian Government<br />
is plucked out of his place and, I gather, put on trial and<br />
another goes in, I think if I had been one of the Afro-Asian<br />
countries, I would have said we had better determine how<br />
this thing settles down otherwise we might be holding a<br />
conference in the middle of a counter-revolution. * 9 e 9 / 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
Q Would you regard the communique as a victory for<br />
the moderate elements in the conference?<br />
P. M. I won't adopt those words but I'll say I think the<br />
ultimate communique was a good deai better than at one stage<br />
I feared it might be,<br />
QO Ther'e is one-line reference to some discussion of<br />
Chinese membership of the United Nations. Could you tell us<br />
something about that?<br />
P. M. You hardly need to be told that some of us don't<br />
recognise Communist China and are not to be told at a country<br />
Commonwealth meeting that we should. What any Commonwealth!<br />
does in its diplomatic recognition of another nation is its<br />
business and nobody else's, There have always been a number<br />
who either have recognised Communist China or want to persuade<br />
other people to do so, but if it had a one-line reference, it<br />
had a one-minute discussion. There is a reference to the<br />
importance of China being a party to any genuine disarmament<br />
scheme but I've said that myself, more than once. Tht'<br />
a praclical problem.<br />
Q, Given the fact that most of the current disarmament<br />
negotiations of any value take place in the framework of<br />
United Nations, doesn't it make some sense that China might<br />
be brought<br />
P. M. Now you want to argue with me. The Australian<br />
Government's view on the recognition of Communist China....<br />
Q6 Not the recognition of Communist China, but its<br />
place vis-a-vis the United Nations.<br />
P. M. Well, one seems to be almost consequential on the<br />
other, if you recognise them. You first of all have to solve<br />
the problem of Formosa and this is a problem which is neatly<br />
dodged by almost everybody who discusses this matter, but<br />
I don't want to make a long statement on that. We have stated<br />
our views and our reasons many times in Parliament,<br />
Q6 Can you see an alternative way in which China could<br />
be brought into disarmament talks of some kinds outside the<br />
United Nations?<br />
P. M. Well, after all China has been involved in some<br />
discussions in relation Lo South-East Asia I don't think<br />
it is at all impossible on an overwhelming matter of world<br />
significance like disarmament to have people coming to.<br />
conference whether they are members of the United Nations or<br />
not, simply in their capacity as significant powers,<br />
QO One last question on a subject which has become<br />
rather touchy Could you tell us whether you have discussed<br />
the Governor-6reneralship with The Queen since you have been<br />
here?<br />
P. M. Why has it become rather touchy? Only because some<br />
fellow in the " Sunday Mirror" has to write a think-piece<br />
about somebody, You know, it is most awful nonsense. There<br />
is a limit to folly on these matters, When a Governor-General<br />
is appointed, The Queen will announce it. 0 0 a./ </p>
<p>9<br />
Q. But have you discussed it yet with The Queen?<br />
P. M. I have had a preliminary talk with her. All these<br />
names that have been bandied around, they dwell in beauty<br />
as in the eye of the beholder.<br />
Q. Could you go further Sir?<br />
P. M. No. I have a strict sense of courtesy in my<br />
dealings with The Queen.<br />
