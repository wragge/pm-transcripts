    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.....................................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much to my colleague and friend, Ricky Johnston,</p>
<p>   to Senator Chris Ellison, the Minister for Schools, Education and</p>
<p>   Vocational Training, Mr Mayor, other members of the Armadale City</p>
<p>   Council, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>I am delighted to be again in the electorate of Canning. I think</p>
<p>   it's the second or third occasion since the last election that</p>
<p>   I've been here and I come very willingly and very keenly because</p>
<p>   Ricky is an outstandingly energetic representative of the division</p>
<p>   of Canning in the Federal Parliament. I can tell all of you that</p>
<p>   she does work very hard on behalf of your interests in Canberra.</p>
<p>   She's constantly jawboning ministers, collaring them in the</p>
<p>   corridor and elsewhere and pushing the case for local business men</p>
<p>   and women, for local aged care establishments and generally putting</p>
<p>   forward in a very forthright manner the interest and the cause of</p>
<p>   small business. </p>
<p>She mentioned a number of the changes that my Government has undertaken</p>
<p>   since it came into Government. We are very conscious at the moment</p>
<p>   of the economic difficulties of the Asian Pacific region. There</p>
<p>   is no doubt in the world that if we had not set about getting the</p>
<p>   Budget into surplus, if we had not set about getting control of</p>
<p>   the large amount of debt that we were left by the former Labor Government,</p>
<p>   if we had not set about making certain that we were living within</p>
<p>   our means, the Australian economy now would be in a much sicker</p>
<p>   shape than it is. We would have been hurt a lot more because the</p>
<p>   lesson that is coming out of recent economic events is that if you</p>
<p>   don't have your own economic house in order you are going to</p>
<p>   be knocked around and knocked around very badly. </p>
<p> So anybody who says that we've done the wrong thing</p>
<p>   over the last two and a quarter years to get the budget into surplus,</p>
<p>   to cut unnecessary expenditure, to undertake industrial relations</p>
<p>   reforms and, very importantly, in immediate prospect, to undertake</p>
<p>   the cause of taxation reform, is taking a very short-sighted view.</p>
<p>   Now I know there are some other things that have been done may have</p>
<p>   been unpopular with some sections of the community but if we hadn't</p>
<p>   of done anything, if we just sat there and allowed Mr Beazley's</p>
<p>   $10.5 billion deficit to continue and to grow even bigger then our</p>
<p>   economic vulnerability now would have been much greater. And you</p>
<p>   can all see that even if you run a good economy there can be difficulties</p>
<p>   in the international environment and it is therefore very important</p>
<p>   that Australia and the people of Australia hold their resolve to</p>
<p>   good policy. And they don't be seduced by snake oil solutions,</p>
<p>   they don't get attracted by people coming along offering overnight,</p>
<p>   simplistic solutions to problems that are very difficult and require</p>
<p>   carefully thought out solutions. And everything that we've</p>
<p>   done over the last two and a quarter years has been designed to</p>
<p>   strengthen the fundamentals of the Australian economy. </p>
<p>And you know that we have much lower inflation now than we had</p>
<p>   a few years ago. Over the last two and a quarter years there have</p>
<p>   been significant falls in interest rates both in relation to housing</p>
<p>   and in relation to small business. We've undertaken major industrial</p>
<p>   relations reforms. We've implemented all of the specific commitments</p>
<p>   we made to the small business sector. We've improved the taxation</p>
<p>   arrangements regarding provisional tax. We've introduced a</p>
<p>   very generous rollover provision in relation to the sales of small</p>
<p>   businesses whereby if you sell a small business and invest in any</p>
<p>   other kind of business up to a value of $5 million, that reinvestment</p>
<p>   is free of Capital Gains tax. And that, in fact, took that commitment</p>
<p>   a long way beyond what was said during the election campaign. </p>
<p>I place great importance on the small business sector. I came from</p>
<p>   a small business family. As a young boy I was taught the value and</p>
<p>   the importance in the Australian economy and in the local community</p>
<p>   of small business. It therefore has always occupied a very special</p>
<p>   place in my political heart so to speak because it is the engine</p>
<p>   room of greatest employment growth and the hope of the side for</p>
<p>   future employment growth in this country remains the small business</p>
<p>   sector. </p>
<p>Now the next thing that we have got to do to further strengthen</p>
<p>   the Australian economy is to change our taxation system to make</p>
<p>   it fairer and better for the benefit of Australia. And I don't</p>
<p>   intend to walk away from taxation reform because it is good for</p>
<p>   Australia. It's very easy when you cop a bit of criticism on</p>
<p>   a proposed reform to say Â‘oh well it's too hard, I'll</p>
<p>   walk away'. But what's the point of having a Government</p>
<p>   that says that something is too hard. What's the point of having</p>
<p>   a Government that says that well if there's a bit of criticism</p>
<p>   of something we'll walk away from it. I know, I guess most</p>
<p>   of you know, and I know that Mr Beazley knows in his own heart and</p>
<p>   in his private thoughts that we can't go on forever with the</p>
<p>   present taxation system. I think most sensible thinking Australians,</p>
<p>   forgetting the politics, forgetting the point scoring and the rhetoric</p>
<p>   of politics, when you look at it calmly and analytically and in</p>
<p>   the interests of Australia, you have to conclude that the present</p>
<p>   taxation system is not working as it should. You have to conclude</p>
<p>   that it is unfair. You have to conclude that it discriminates against</p>
<p>   our exporters. You have to conclude that it's confusing to</p>
<p>   many people in small business - the various classifications between</p>
<p>   what's exempt from wholesale sales tax and what isn't.</p>
<p>   You have to conclude that it provides a rich opportunity for people</p>
<p>   using the black economy to evade any of their taxation obligations.</p>
<p>   And you really have to conclude that it needs to be fundamentally</p>
<p>   changed and we are committed to doing that. There is a lot of talk</p>
<p>   about a goods and services tax. Let me make it plain, of course,</p>
<p>   that if we were to introduce a broad based indirect tax or a goods</p>
<p>   and services tax, whatever you might call it. It would, of course,</p>
<p>   be introduced in replacement of existing taxes. And any attempt</p>
<p>   by our opponents to suggest that it's going to be put on top</p>
<p>   of the existing system is absolutely and totally wrong and completely</p>
<p>   dishonest. </p>
<p>What we are in the business of doing is not increasing the tax</p>
<p>   burden, rather we are in the business of where possible reducing</p>
<p>   it but very importantly improving its fairness and improving it</p>
<p>   in a way that makes the Australian economy more competitive. It</p>
<p>   is an essential message from the rest of the world that every country</p>
<p>   if it is to survive and if it is to grow and to provide more jobs,</p>
<p>   it must be as competitive as possible. And to be competitive we</p>
<p>   have to have a better taxation system. We have to have one that</p>
<p>   takes the load that the present one imposes on the backs of Australian</p>
<p>   exporters off those exporters. So we are very strongly committed</p>
<p>   to a fair, decent change to the Australian taxation system and the</p>
<p>   details of that will be made known and available to the Australian</p>
<p>   public before the next election. And they can have a look at it,</p>
<p>   they can make a judgement and they can decide whether they want</p>
<p>   a Government that is prepared to tackle problems to make Australia</p>
<p>   stronger and better or whether they want a Government that will</p>
<p>   just stick its head in the sand and against its own internal beliefs</p>
<p>   and its own best instincts will say, we are not going to change</p>
<p>   that because it's all too hard and it's more politically</p>
<p>   expedient to try and score points off a Government that is trying</p>
<p>   to do the right thing.</p>
<p>It is easy in public life to be negative, it is easy in public</p>
<p>   life when you don't have any responsibility to say that if</p>
<p>   only I had the responsibility I could fix this problem overnight.</p>
<p>   It's only when you have the responsibility of actually delivering</p>
<p>   that you have to live up to your rhetoric and you have to persuade</p>
<p>   the public that your simplistic, one line solution can, in fact,</p>
<p>   be made to work. We live in a nation which has enormous opportunity,</p>
<p>   it has a very rich history and of all the nations on earth, it has</p>
<p>   the best prospects if we take the right decisions for the 21st Century.</p>
<p>   We are a harmonious country. We've brought millions of people</p>
<p>   from different parts of the world and I am very proud of the fact</p>
<p>   that my own party has within its ranks people who are born in many</p>
<p>   parts of the world and they have come to Australia to make this</p>
<p>   their home. </p>
<p>We've welcomed people from Europe, we've welcomed people</p>
<p>   from the Middle East, we've welcomed people from Asia and all</p>
<p>   of them have become fine Australians and all of them are making</p>
<p>   a magnificent contribution to a cohesive and harmonious society.</p>
<p>   And instead of us every being apologetic about what this country</p>
<p>   has done we ought to be immensely proud that we have built the civil,</p>
<p>   harmonious society which is without parallel anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>   And I think sometimes we don't feel enough pride about what</p>
<p>   we have achieved on that score but we are inclined to be intimidated</p>
<p>   by those who would preach that we have a rather intolerant and insensitive</p>
<p>   past. Of course like any nation we have blemishes in our past, that</p>
<p>   can't be denied, but we have been remarkably successful in</p>
<p>   blending into one united nation people from the four corners of</p>
<p>   the earth and it has been a very important part of the psychology</p>
<p>   of the modern Australia.</p>
<p>So, ladies and gentlemen, can I thank the city of Armadale for</p>
<p>   according me the civic and civil welcome that it has, can I thank</p>
<p>   you for coming along. Can I say what a very important role local</p>
<p>   government plays in our community, but most importantly what a very</p>
<p>   important role the various organisations that are represented here</p>
<p>   today play in keeping our society together. I'm a great believer</p>
<p>   in tackling problems on the basis that we need a shared endeavour</p>
<p>   between individuals, governments, and community organisations.</p>
<p>Individuals can't do it on their own although they're</p>
<p>   very important and self reliance and individual initiative is a</p>
<p>   very significant element of our society. Governments can't</p>
<p>   do it on their own. Governments are good at some things but they're</p>
<p>   very bad at other things. They're very bad at running businesses,</p>
<p>   I think they ought to get out of businesses that should be left</p>
<p>   to the private sector to run. And I think that underlies the philosophy</p>
<p>   in relation to our approach to privatisation and many other things.</p>
<p>But community organisations are the third arm of that shared endeavour</p>
<p>   and many of them are represented here today. And I thank them for</p>
<p>   the contribution that they make to Australian society. I had the</p>
<p>   opportunity earlier this week in Sydney to release the interim report</p>
<p>   of my taskforce on youth homelessness and I released it at an outreach</p>
<p>   project jointly operated by the Salvation Army and the Sydney City</p>
<p>   Mission, and it's designed to reach out to homeless children</p>
<p>   in Sydney and to try and, importantly, reunite them with their parents,</p>
<p>   and if that fails, well to provide them with a decent future. And</p>
<p>   I want more emphasis placed in relation to homelessness for young</p>
<p>   people on efforts being made to reconcile them and reunite them</p>
<p>   with their parents. Too often in the past perhaps parents have been</p>
<p>   shut out of that equation and have been ignore, but I think more</p>
<p>   effort ought to be made, if it's possible, to bring about a</p>
<p>   reconciliation, because a united, stable family environment still</p>
<p>   provides above and beyond anything else, the best security and the</p>
<p>   best hope for children as they grow up.</p>
<p>So ladies and gentlemen thank you very much for coming this morning.</p>
<p>   I've enjoyed the opportunity of sharing some thoughts with</p>
<p>   you. I've appreciated the welcome with its various forms it</p>
<p>   has taken as I've come here and again can I commend you on</p>
<p>   the wisdom of the choice you made on the 2 March 1996 in sending</p>
<p>   Ricky to Canberra as the Federal Member for the division of Canning.</p>
<p>   And I hope very earnestly that you hold to that wisdom, maintain</p>
<p>   that skilful resolve and make certain that she's sent back</p>
<p>   whenever the next election is held. Thank you very much. </p>
