<p>Western Australian schools now stand to gain $2.8 billion over six years under the Australian Government's National Plan for School Improvement.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister has made a revised offer to the Western Australian Government, including around $920 million extra over six years to bring all schools up to the new Schooling Resource Standard on top of better indexation. This is up from the $300 million previously on offer.</p>
<p>The Australian Government is willing to invest $2 for every $1 from the Western Australian Government to bring schools up to the new funding standard.  This means the Australian Government would invest an extra $590 million and the Western Australian Government would invest about $330 million into improving local schools.</p>
<p>With improved indexation, this revised offer will deliver about an extra $1.9 billion for government schools, about $360 million extra for Catholic schools and about $480 million extra for independent schools across Western Australia over six years.</p>
<p>This reflects the benefits of locking in better and more stable rates of indexation, as well as the funding increase required to bring schools up to the new standard.</p>
<p>The new offer is based on more up to date information about the relative costs of schooling across the country.</p>
<p>Under the original offer, the cost of delivering school education in Western Australia was calculated to be 8 per cent, higher because of the size of Western Australia, the remote locations of many schools, and higher teacher wages.</p>
<p>Further work by Commonwealth officials has since confirmed the extra cost of education in Western Australia is 11 per cent, so we have revised our offer to take this into account.</p>
<p>There is now $2.8 billion over six years on the table to help make every school in Western Australia better, so that local students get the best possible start in life.</p>
<p>The National Plan for School Improvement will deliver:</p>
<p> * 	More one on one attention and support in the classroom for every child.<br />
 * 	Specialist literacy and numeracy programs for those children in danger of being left behind.<br />
 * 	Greater assistance for those students with disability or special need.<br />
 * 	Building the skills and knowledge of teachers and providing mentoring support for those who are new to the profession.</p>
<p>This is a fair and generous offer which will deliver benefits to Western Australia for generations to come.</p>
<p>Premier Barnett has until 30 June 2013 to sign up to the National Plan for School Improvement, contribute WA's share and secure a better deal for every school in his state.</p>
