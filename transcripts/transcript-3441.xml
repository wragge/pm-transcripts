PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 360<br />
1 November 1974<br />
AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO WORLD" FOOD<br />
CONFERENCE<br />
The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs announced that<br />
the Minister for Agriculture, Senator Wriedt would be leaving<br />
Australia for Rome during the week-end to lead the thirteen<br />
member Australian Delegation to the World Food Conference.<br />
( 5-16 November). The Deputy Leader of the Australian<br />
Delegation will be Mr R. S. Swift, Deputy Secretary of the<br />
Department of Agriculture. The delegation will comprise<br />
Australia's Ambassador to Italy, His Excellency Mr J. E. Ryan,<br />
the Research Adviser to the Minister for Agriculture,<br />
Mr David Thomas, and Senior officers from the Departments of<br />
Agriculture, Overseas Trade, Treasury and Foreign Affairs.<br />
The delegation will be accompanied by an adviser, Mr Allan Smith,<br />
National Director of the Australian Freedom From Hunger Campaign.<br />
The Conference is being convened in order to devise<br />
measures for dealing with the world's present food crisis, which,<br />
although it had been developing over a long period, suddenly<br />
emerged in dramatic form in 1972 when, as a result of adverse<br />
weather conditions, world food output declined.<br />
The Conference's work will be divided into three main<br />
areas: measures to increase agricultural production in developing<br />
countries; world food security; and world food trade. Australia<br />
intends taking an active role in the Conference's discussions in<br />
these three areas and the delegation has accordingly been briefed<br />
to adopt a positive and constructive approach towards proposals<br />
for programs and objectives which will contribute to reducing<br />
the food gap in developing countries.<br />
