    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that Her Majesty The Queen has approved the</p>
<p> establishment of a specific campaign medal for members of the Australian</p>
<p> Defence Force in East Timor. This will be known as the International</p>
<p> Force East Timor Medal.</p>
<p>Personnel who serve in the East Timor operational area for 30 days or</p>
<p> more will qualify for the campaign medal.</p>
<p>The Australian Active Service Medal clasp Â‘East Timor'</p>
<p> will also be awarded to members of the Australian Defence Force and certain</p>
<p> associated personnel</p>
<p>with one day's service on the posted strength of a unit or formation,</p>
<p> or personally assigned to or actually stationed in the operational area</p>
<p> of East Timor.</p>
<p>The service by Australian troops in East Timor represents Australia's</p>
<p> most significant commitment of troops since World War II. In addition</p>
<p> the INTERFET coalition of 17 nations was led by Australia.</p>
<p>Australia will be inviting other nations which have contributed personnel</p>
<p> to INTERFET to use the International Force East Timor Medal as the means</p>
<p> of recognising their forces. This will be the first time that an Australian</p>
<p> medal has been used in this way.</p>
<p>On behalf of the nation I thank all those members of the Australian Defence</p>
<p> Force and all associated personnel who have served with such distinction</p>
<p> in East Timor.</p>
