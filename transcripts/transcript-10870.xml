    <content><![CDATA[<p> The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Gareth Evans, made it</p>
<p> abundantly clear this morning that his Party has no stomach for removing</p>
<p> the huge unfairness in Australia's taxation system.</p>
<p>On "Meet the Press" he foreshadowed yet another adhoc, Bandaid</p>
<p> approach to an ailing unfair system.</p>
<p>He admitted that under a Labor government some wholesale tax rates</p>
<p> could go up.</p>
<p>This is ominously similar to Labor's performance in 1993.</p>
<p>Then it campaigned against genuine tax reform, yet back in office</p>
<p> it slugged low income earners with huge increases in indirect taxation</p>
<p> without any compensation.</p>
<p>It is in the interests of all Australians that the unfairness of the</p>
<p> present system be removed.</p>
<p>This will not be achieved through tinkering at the edges which is</p>
<p> what Mr Evans has in mind.</p>
<p>That would be a repeat of 1993 which left the whole system even more</p>
<p> unfair.</p>
<p>The government's reform package will remove the unfairness of</p>
<p> the present system. Labor's adhoc approach will not.</p>
<p>For the good of Australia we need a new, fairer taxation system. The</p>
<p> Beazley / Evans approach ignores the national interests. It is all</p>
<p> about political point scoring.</p>
<p> 5 July 1998</p>
