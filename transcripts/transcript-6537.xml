    <content><![CDATA[<p>FOR MEDIA </p>
<p>I have sent the following message to the Indian Prime Minister, Mr Rajiv Gandhi: </p>
<p>" On behalf of the Government and people of Australia, I extend to you our deepest sympathy on the tragic death of your mother. </p>
<p>In the very sad circumstances in which you assume your high office, I am sure you will be able to draw inspiration from Indira Gandhi's courage, strong leadership and statemanship. India's firm democratic<br />
traditions and the high regard in which it is held around the world will also prove sources of strength in these difficult times. </p>
<p>Australia and India are linked in many ways, including through the Commonwealth, and I look forward to working with you to strengthen further t: he friendly and constructive relations our countries enjoy. </p>
<p>Shortly before yesterday's appalling act of terrorism, I extended an invitation to Mrs Gandhi to visit Australia. I very much hope that you will find an opportunity to take up the invitation. </p>
<p>On behalf of all Australians, I congratulate you and wish you well as you assume your new responsibilities as Prime Minister of India." </p>
<p>1 November 1984.</p>
