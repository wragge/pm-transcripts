<p>Good evening. As Australians we have every reason to be very optimistic</p>
<p> about the future. No country in the world has better prospects as</p>
<p> we enter the new century.</p>
<p>We are a united, resourceful and talented people. Our economic strength</p>
<p> as a country is undoubted as we now enjoy the strongest economic fundamentals</p>
<p> in a generation.</p>
<p>We have:</p>
<p>   * the lowest unemployment rate in almost a decade;</p>
<p> * the lowest number of unemployed teenagers looking for full-time</p>
<p> work in over 20 years; and</p>
<p> * the lowest levels of inflation and interest rates in around</p>
<p> 30 years.</p>
<p>These strong economic results have not come about by accident. They</p>
<p> are the result of sensible and practical reforms in earlier years</p>
<p> including strong but fair decisions to return the budget to surplus</p>
<p> and to remove the debt burden on future generations.</p>
<p>Just as past decisions have produced today's economic strength so</p>
<p> it is that the right decisions taken today will deliver an even stronger</p>
<p> economy in the future.</p>
<p>That is why Australia needs taxation reform because that reform will</p>
<p> deliver an even stronger and better Australian economy tomorrow.</p>
<p>That is why I committed the Government to a plan for a new tax system</p>
<p> before the last election.</p>
<p>A plan to put behind us once and for all an outdated, complex and</p>
<p> unfair taxation system.</p>
<p>A plan to reward Australian workers who have endured high rates of</p>
<p> personal income tax, to encourage Australian exporters to take on</p>
<p> the world without an inefficient wholesale sales tax system, and to</p>
<p> give Australian families even more choice about how they raise their</p>
<p> children.</p>
<p>I can report to you tonight that our new tax system has become law.</p>
<p>From July next year Australia will have a modern, fairer and simpler</p>
<p> taxation system - one that is good for Australia.</p>
<p>The new system will strengthen the Australian economy because it will</p>
<p> cut the cost of exports, reduce business costs and, through lower</p>
<p> personal tax, give middle Australia more incentive.</p>
<p>At the heart of our new tax system lies the largest personal income</p>
<p> tax cut in Australia's history - $12 billion - to give Australian</p>
<p> workers genuine reward for their efforts.</p>
<p>At present, 80 per cent of all Australians earn less than $50,000</p>
<p> a year. Depending on their income their top tax rate can be up to</p>
<p> 43 cents in the dollar. Under our plan it can be no more than 30 cents</p>
<p> in the dollar. We propose that between $20,000 and $50,000 a year</p>
<p> workers will be able to earn more without paying a higher rate of</p>
<p> tax.</p>
<p>Families with children are the greatest beneficiaries of our tax plan.</p>
<p> In addition to lower income tax, families will receive $2.5 billion</p>
<p> more in family benefits each year.</p>
<p>Parents will enjoy greater choice as to whether they stay at home</p>
<p> when their children are young and will not be penalised should they</p>
<p> choose to rejoin the workforce.</p>
<p>Families already benefit from our 30 per cent rebate for private health</p>
<p> insurance which rewards those who take personal responsibility for</p>
<p> their family's health care.</p>
<p>From July next year the 10 per cent Goods and Services Tax replaces</p>
<p> the ramshackle, hidden, wholesales sales tax, with all its six rates</p>
<p> with many household items taxed at 32 per cent.</p>
<p>When the hidden tax is abolished, many everyday household items will</p>
<p> actually fall in price.</p>
<p>Fresh food, as well as health, education, childcare, nursing homes</p>
<p> and hostels, local government rates, water and sewerage charges and</p>
<p> charitable activities will all be free of the GST.</p>
<p>It is expected that next month the price of goods such as radios,</p>
<p> televisions and video recorders will fall when the 32 per cent rate</p>
<p> of wholesale sales tax is reduced to 22 per cent on the way to its</p>
<p> complete abolition.</p>
<p>We have ensured that the rate of the GST is locked in at 10 per cent.</p>
<p>Overall, under our new tax system, typical families with either one</p>
<p> or both parents in the workforce, will be $40 to $50 a week better</p>
<p> off even after the GST.</p>
<p>Our new tax system also protects older Australians, pensioners and</p>
<p> low income earners.</p>
<p>From July next year pensions will be increased by 4 per cent and we</p>
<p> guarantee that they will always remain 2 per cent ahead of any rise</p>
<p> in the cost of living.</p>
<p>We will provide additional tax rebates for pensioners and self funded</p>
<p> retirees and a one off savings bonus. Older Australians as well as</p>
<p> many small businesses will also benefit from the abolition of provisional</p>
<p> taxation.</p>
<p>Our tax plan also recognises the special needs of the bush.</p>
<p>The cost of diesel excise for heavy transport will fall by 23 cents</p>
<p> a litre and the cost of petrol used in the commercial operations of</p>
<p> farmers and other businesses by about 7 cents a litre.</p>
<p>We are also completely removing excise from the rail sector.</p>
<p>More than $7 billion of taxes a year will be removed from business</p>
<p> and costs for exporters will fall by several billion dollars a year.</p>
<p>This will help Australian business to take on the world, generate</p>
<p> profits and create more jobs, especially for our young.</p>
<p>To help small business and others adapt to the new tax system we will</p>
<p> provide $500 million for start up costs.</p>
<p>Our agreement with the states and territories will at last give them</p>
<p> a secure revenue base to provide the essential community services</p>
<p> such as roads, police, schools and hospitals that we all know are</p>
<p> needed.</p>
<p>Never have I been more convinced that we are doing the right thing</p>
<p> for Australia than I am on taxation reform. We have done much to restore</p>
<p> the economic foundations of our country. Now we have created a new</p>
<p> tax system which will make those foundations even stronger for the</p>
<p> future.</p>
<p>But there is more to be done.</p>
<p>We can only realise our full potential as a nation if we continue</p>
<p> to seize at every opportunity the chances that lie before us.</p>
<p>And my Government will not rest in its efforts to improve Australia's</p>
<p> prospects. We will continue to govern in the national interest, hard</p>
<p> at work for an even stronger Australia. Good night. </p>
