The Prime Minister today congratulated Steve Gibbons MP on his long service to the Bendigo community following his announcement that he will not seek preselection for the Federal election due in 2013.</p>
<p>As the longest serving federal MP for Bendigo since Federation, Steve leaves a strong legacy.</p>
<p>Since Steve won his seat for Labor in 1998 he has been the best kind of local member: representing his party in his community, and representing his community in the Parliament.</p>
<p>I know that commitment will be undiminished in the coming two years.</p>
<p>And beyond the next election, I'm sure he is looking forward to some good times noodling on his bass guitar and working on his motorbikes.</p>
<p>While I will be sorry to see Steve go, I will wish him well when he does embark on this new phase in his life. </p>
