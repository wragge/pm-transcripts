TRANSCRIPT PRESS CONFERENCE 1 NOVEMBER 1984<br />
E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: Well ladies and gentlemen you've had the opportunity of<br />
reading the Government's response to the final report of<br />
CommissioneruCostigan. I simply want at the outset to refer to<br />
that aspect of the statement which draws attention to the position<br />
of the Leader of the opposition and . i'm certain that the people of<br />
Australia will contrast the wild and totally baseless allegations<br />
that were made inside and outside the Parliament by the Leader of<br />
the Opposition attacking me and the Government, suggesting that<br />
there was going to be all sorts of bombshells for the Government:<br />
in the Costigan Report. The Report itself and the statements of<br />
Commissioner Costigan expose those allegations for the baseless<br />
things that they were and, as I say, further evidence that the<br />
Leader of the opposition is not fit to the office to which he<br />
aspires. I'm open to your questions.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what do you think is the major<br />
achievement of Mr Costigan?<br />
PM: Well I don't think. there is one. If you'll excuse me I'll<br />
just go to a few aspects of it. I think Mr Costigan is certainly<br />
to be remembered for his exposure of the tax avoidance industry<br />
the dimension of it. That commenced with his interim report. of<br />
December 1981 and as a result of that dramatic exposure I think<br />
the community has become aware of the fact that for a considerable<br />
period of time they have been mulct by a wealthy minority who have<br />
been protected by the conservatives in government and continue -to<br />
be protected by them in Opposition. And that is a matter of<br />
continuing substance and will always stand to the credit of<br />
Commissioner Costigan. He has also brought new techniques to the<br />
processes of investigation and it was for that reason that in our<br />
first Budget we were prepared, happy to, double the resources<br />
available to him and all those resources have been transferred<br />
over to the National Crime Authority. So that that means as a<br />
result of the new investigative techniques that he developed that<br />
the permanent authority, the National Crime Authority, will be as<br />
well equipped as I think it possibly can be. Thirdly, hehas I<br />
think exposed the dimensions of orgjanised crime in this country.<br />
He has I think done this signal service, there has ' bee'n a tendenacy </p>
<p>PM: cont... _ n th2 past to think of the criminal elements of<br />
societ' as some shadowy, and publicly disreputable figures. What.<br />
Commissioner Cosliga-i has done is to show that the services of a<br />
wide range of professional people accou~ ntants and lawyers anid<br />
directors and so on have been and continuously have been<br />
utilised in the processes of crime. So without being exhaustive! I<br />
would think that those sorts of things are major contributions.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke have you got a view at all on some of the<br />
things 1Mr Costigan said about Mr Packer taking away files, being;<br />
associated with a person who initially looked like a suicide<br />
attempt and was murder and there should be another murder<br />
e xam i na tion.<br />
PM: Well let me make two or three general-~ observations and then a<br />
particular observation in regard to the last point. I think you<br />
will appreciate that it's made perfectly clear in the detailed<br />
statement that you've had the opportunity of studying that he<br />
says you will recall this in the public section of volume 1<br />
where at the last chapter he goes to his recommendations,<br />
including the recommendations in regdrd to the non-published<br />
chapters page 274 of volume 1 dealing with volume 9,<br />
unpublished, ofActivities of Ray Packer he says I recommend that<br />
matters described in chapters 2 to 5 be referred to the Director<br />
of Public Prosecutions. Now that, of course, has been done. The<br />
Director of Public Prosecutions under the statute has received all<br />
the reports, published and the unpublished. And I make this point<br />
in regard to your question the very reasons for the<br />
establishment of the office of Director of Public Prosecutions is<br />
to have an office independent of Government to assess material and<br />
make recommendations as to what should happen. And I believe<br />
therefore it is totally inappropriate for me or for anyone else<br />
for that matter to intrude into this area of what we have ensured,<br />
as we should do, is that all the material goes to the relevant<br />
authorities the Director of Public Prosecutions and the National<br />
Crime Authority. And they will make the de! cisions which they<br />
regard as appropriate in regard to their full assessment of the<br />
material. And what I've said in the report. on behalf of the<br />
Government, the response on behalf of the Government, is that it's<br />
appropriate that all matters mentioned by Commissioner Costigan<br />
should be considered by the appropriate authorities and that they<br />
should take the action that's necessary. I go to the further<br />
point which I think youi'll understand is appropriate in answer to<br />
your question that we have the view that the existing<br />
authorities and institutions are fully equipped to proceed with<br />
appropriate action in regard to all recommendations of<br />
Commissioner Costigan. I have said in the report that in regard<br />
to any substantive decisions we are in the caretaker period and we<br />
will not make decisions against the principles of the period of<br />
caretaker Government, which I would remind you we as a Cabinet<br />
acknowledged on 11 October. But I have sai~ d beyond that that if<br />
the Director of Public Prosecutions o r the National Crime<br />
Authority should come to the conclusion that there is some<br />
immediate decisions that the public interest required of the </p>
<p>Government now, we will of course rezcoond to such requests from<br />
them. Now I just want to miake the final point. You ref-rred to<br />
the : c: servations in regard to murder as it's<br />
suggested by Commissioner Costiqan, I think fairness demands the<br />
observation that there is nothing there on the record which<br />
involves an assertion by Commissioner Costigan that Mr Packer is<br />
guilty in that respect. I think fairness demands that<br />
observation.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke you've criticised in your statement the use<br />
of some names by Commissioner Costigan. Does that criticism<br />
include the use of the Packer name publicly or do you think that<br />
that was inevitale after Packer's own statement.<br />
PM: Well I was stating a principle and I h~ ope on behalf of the<br />
Government stating it quite unequivocally. And clearly that<br />
statement of principle embraces Mr -Packer. It wasn't concerned<br />
with Mr Packer alone. But I think you'll remember the language of<br />
the statement, I think at page 12, where I referred to the<br />
circumstances surrounding the report, excuse me on page 13, where<br />
I said " in thc circumstances surrounding this Report", therefore I<br />
went on to say on behalf of the Government that I thought the<br />
principles that we were putting were not capable in these<br />
circumstances of being adhered to. But the general statement of<br />
principle that I put there obviously includes the person to whom<br />
you refer.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Mr Costigan's top secret memoranda<br />
of relevant criminal activity which he says contained the various<br />
answers it leaked to the National Times to the obvious detriment<br />
of Mr Packer. How can the public be satisfied that Mr Costigan<br />
isn't satisfied that references to the National Crime Authority<br />
with a much wider distribution will not appear in the newspapers.<br />
PM: Well that's a fair question. I can only say in response to<br />
it Peter that the statement itself here refers to the care which<br />
was taken by the Special Minister of State in the reference, I<br />
think it'ls 19 October is it?<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes.<br />
PM: And we can only take every precaution that we can as a<br />
Government. I'm certai'n that the National Crime Authority and it~ s<br />
membership will itself attempt to exercise every care and I would<br />
expect that all state Governments would do the same thing. You're<br />
in an area, Peter, here where there's a question of human<br />
frailties and I would be deluding everyone if I said that where<br />
you are dealing with those sorts of things that a guarantee can be<br />
given. I merely express the fervent wish on behalf of the<br />
Government, the Federal Government, that everyone involved will<br />
attempt to exercise all the requirements that go with the need for<br />
confidentiality because I believe that' there is an acceptance in<br />
the community of the requirement to protect two basic<br />
considerations. One, the public interest in ensuring that </p>
<p>PM: cont... investigations with a view to possible prosecutions of<br />
criminal activities are not prejudiced and at the same time, the<br />
requirements of the civil liberc. ies cf individual-, concerned. Now<br />
if we as a community attach significance c~ o those two criteria, as<br />
I believe we should, then there is an obligation onl people to<br />
exercise extreme care and I hope they will.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you be avoiding contact with Mr Packer?<br />
PM: Well I haven't addressed my mind to the question of avoiding<br />
or not. I don't know whether I have in my program in the weeks<br />
ahead any engagements which involve . Mr Packer or not. I honestly<br />
don't know whether I have. I am not reviewing my program. I will<br />
not be reviewing my program. I believe that every individual in<br />
this society is entitled to the proper processes of the law. That<br />
applies to Mr Packer as well as to anyone else.<br />
JOURNALIST: Just on that point Mr Hawke. Could you say whether<br />
after you received the March 5 letter from Mr Costigan mentioning<br />
Mr Packer whether you formed any particular attitude about Mr<br />
Packer and whether that in any way the contacts you've had<br />
with him subsequent to March<br />
PM: No, I think the answer to that question, Mike, is containe, 2<br />
in the previous answer that I gave. At all points, as Mr Costi-gan<br />
has made crystal clear both in his report and in his subsequent<br />
statements, the Government has acted with complete propriety in<br />
regard to how the affairs of the Commission should operate and<br />
that comment of his applies to the Government as a whole and to<br />
myself personally. And I'm not in the business, I never have<br />
been, of making judgements about people until all the appropriate<br />
processes have been exhausted. That's always been the practice<br />
and I don't intend to change now.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, if you are re-elected and if these matters<br />
haven't been resolved, what action would the Government take when<br />
Mr Packer's licence hearings come up next March and April?<br />
PM: . You're obviously not a regular on this circuit. I don't<br />
answer hypothetical questions.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke was there anything in the Report which you<br />
found shocking as to either the activities of individuals or the<br />
extent of organised crime?<br />
PM: Yes, there is a considerable amount in all the Reports that<br />
are shocking to anyone, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, could the community feel justifiably<br />
disappointed if as a result of Mr Costigan's investigations and<br />
the on-going investigations of the National Crime Authority, we<br />
don't see some very big trials of some very big criminals in<br />
Australia, within a nominal time? </p>
<p>PMI: Let me make two points, and I think thlEy are relevant in<br />
answer to that. As Mr Costigan himself say; there have been many<br />
prosecutions and successful protecutinns that have taken place<br />
since the inception of his Commission. Ard yu will recall he<br />
goes out of hiis way to make it clear that he hasn't sought<br />
continuously to claim credit or connection with those.<br />
Nevertheless, much has happened in the area of effective<br />
prosecution of criminal activity as a result: of the actions of the<br />
Costigan Commission since its inception. So I make that point<br />
simply to say we are not waiting for someth-Ing to happen on the<br />
basis of nothing has happened already. There is a continuum, if<br />
you like. The second point I would make is this. I believe that<br />
in fact there will be a continuation. You will appreciate that<br />
the reasons for the deletion of certain passages from the reports<br />
that have been published have been clearly * on the basis of advice<br />
to us from Federal and State authorities that the publication of<br />
those names would in fact in some cases prejudice existing or<br />
pending trials. So we have got what has happened which Mr<br />
Costigan refers to, what is pending now, and I believe, yes, as<br />
the National Crime Authority and other relevant authorities pick.<br />
up now the work of Commissioner Costigan there will be further<br />
trials and I think they could go to substantial matters.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Big?<br />
PM: Well you could not have heard what Commissioner Costigan has<br />
been at pains, and I think also Mr Meagher has been at pains, to<br />
say that there is no single Mr Big. 1 think they have said that:<br />
on man" occasions. Rather there are congeries of, perhaps we<br />
might say Mr Larges. We may be seeing a number of the Mr Larges<br />
and as we are a non-discriminatory society, Ms Larges, perhaps too.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you said that the Government was<br />
reluctant to the interregnum period, that was the<br />
Costigan recommendations. But in fact you did make a decision In<br />
relation to the.......... concerning the references to the National<br />
Crime Authority. Why dild the Government consider it necessary to<br />
take that decision now in light of the<br />
PM: -Well, there is a cut-off point on this question of the<br />
operation of the caretaker period, Milton. I drew the attention<br />
of Cabinet to the conventions of the caretaker period on 11<br />
October. It didn't sta~ rt to operate until 26 October when the<br />
House was dissolved. From that period on the caretaker<br />
conventions operated.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, can I ask you on the eve of the<br />
Melbourne Cup what your..<br />
PM: I haven't got a tip.<br />
JOURNALIST: No, I was just going to ' ask you what your thoughts<br />
are at this moment on Mr Costigan's recommendation for a crackdown<br />
on SP bookmakers. </p>
<p>PM: Well, I don't quite see the connection. The propensity of<br />
Australians tu, gamn) ol is not simply related to the first Tuesday<br />
in Nov~ mber. The recommendations of '. Ir Costigan in that area<br />
will, I believ, he aidressed by all relevant governments and. I<br />
notice in the statement of my colleague, John Cain, that he<br />
indicates the responses that have already been taken. I think on<br />
recollection there is reference to fines of some $ 800,000 which<br />
have been paid over recent periods. So action has clearly been<br />
taken there and to the extent that this comes into the area of<br />
Commonwealth jurisdiction which is relatively less, it is more a<br />
State matter, then we will receive the recommendations of our<br />
relevant advisory authorities and do what is necessary to assist:.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what is your attitude towards Mr<br />
Costigan's recommendations and the attack on the financial<br />
structure and structures of criminal organisations involved in<br />
that public disclosure also of the-criminals?<br />
PM: If I understand your question correctly, the effect of Mr<br />
Costigan's work in regard to the financial structure is that he<br />
has exposed the capacity of criminal elements to use the financial<br />
system not just the formal banking system, but other elements of<br />
it to advance their various activities and so what is necessary<br />
is that the governments of Australia consider very carefully those<br />
parts of the recommendations of CommissionEr Costigan's Report<br />
which are directed towards trying to Lighten up in that area. And<br />
I can say as far as my Government is concerned that we will be<br />
taking a very positive approach to that area of his<br />
recommendations, as we will to all others.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Mr Costigan said the transition<br />
failed and indeed that is what the Opposition Leader has said both<br />
inside and outside the House. What is your view on that?<br />
PM: Well I think it is necessary, Ian, to look at the totality of<br />
Mr Costigan's statements, both in the report and what he has said<br />
since. Mr Costigan had firm views which I think his language is<br />
that he~ has robustly put to successive governments in which he<br />
expressed his idea both as to the nature of the National Crime<br />
Authority and transition and I think the position that he has put<br />
is that there is room for legitimate differences on these two<br />
matters. But if you look at what Commissioner Costigan is saying<br />
in his Report and his ' Observations in the last few days, he is<br />
making it quite clear that he believes that the National Crime<br />
Authority is now placed to go ahead and pick up his work and he<br />
obviously wishes it well. I am not going to expose the<br />
confidentiality of the discussions that I have had with<br />
Commissioner Costigan this week, but: I can say that the<br />
observations I have just made which are based on his public<br />
statements were fully reflected in the conversations I have had<br />
with him. </p>
<p>J OU RNA; L IST: Prim--~ Minister, what is the Government's view on the<br />
Costigz n recommendation for a new Royal Com: aission to investigate<br />
a particular matter?<br />
PM: No, I've simply got to say to that what I have said in my<br />
statement that we will have consultation with all the authoritiE! s<br />
within our direct domain and that is, let me~ list them. There is<br />
the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Australian Federal Police<br />
and the National Crime Authority as well as the Attorney-cGeneral's<br />
Department. And we will be considering their advice to us on all<br />
these issues, including the one that you put and it is<br />
appropriate, of course, that I remind you of what I have said<br />
about the conventions. That that will be a matter for our<br />
incoming government and we will make the decision in the light of<br />
the recommendations put to us.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, how does th-e Government go around about<br />
preventing a repeat of what you obviously consider the excesses of<br />
this Costigan Royal Commission in relation to civil liberties<br />
questions?<br />
PM: Well, I think, to be fair to Commissioner Costigan, you have<br />
gtto see what I have said. I have talked about the<br />
circumstances surrounding the Report, the fact that sections of Mr<br />
Commissioner Costigan's work went into the public domain of itself<br />
created an area of problem and so the observations that I have<br />
made in regard to the principles of non-publication have been se-t<br />
out clearly, I think, in this Report. The important point to<br />
make, Greg, as to the present and the future is as I have pointe~ d<br />
out in the response that the provisions of the statute under<br />
which the National Crime Authority operates will mean that that<br />
can't happen.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what would the Government's reaction be to<br />
Mr Costigan's recommendation for legislation to produce criminal<br />
sanctions<br />
PM: I niust give you the same answer as I just gave here.<br />
JOURNALIST: For the extortion in the trade union area?<br />
PM: I must give you the same answer. It's not a question of<br />
anything other than making it clear that we must abide by the<br />
conventions that apply In a caretaker government period now. We<br />
will ensure, it has happened, the total reports have gone to the<br />
relevant authorities. in that case, as well as the ones I have<br />
mentioned there would be recommendations to us from the Department<br />
of Employment and Industrial Relations. They would obviously have<br />
an input in that area. Now, we will, when re-elected, we will<br />
consider all the advice to us from thiose relevant authorities and<br />
departments and then as the authorised government, make the<br />
decisions which are necessary to be made. Now that is the<br />
convention situation under which this government in this period<br />
must operate. And the answer to you is exactly therefore the same<br />
as the one I gave to the question before last. </p>
<p>JOUR NALIST: BeaLing that in mind, Prime m'inister, aren't you<br />
sucjges'ing at the same time that the Government doesn't believe<br />
that there is a neccssity to establish the extra investigative<br />
framevwork that Costigan recommends?<br />
PM: I am not saying that. I mean, I don't: know how many times I<br />
have to say it, but I will put it again, Paul. There is a whole<br />
series of recommendations that have been made by Commissioner<br />
Costigan. All of those recommendations warrant and will receive<br />
full consideration by my Government on the basis of the advice<br />
that we receive from the range of relevant authorities. We are at<br />
this period in a care-taker position and w. e can't make decisions.<br />
And indeed, let me make it clear, if we started to make decisions<br />
against the conventions that have operated for previous<br />
governments, we would be immediately attacked by the Opposition<br />
and they would be entitled to. But the imp: ortant point that is<br />
made clear, and I am endebdted to Commissioner Costigan for the<br />
unequivocal clarity with which he puts the point. He acknowledges<br />
the total commitment of myself and my Government to the fight<br />
against organised crime in all its manifestations. I don't have<br />
to put that case. I have put it. ir was right. It has been<br />
confirmed by the Commissioner. What is necessary now is that we<br />
act with propriety at this time. We will. And I give the people<br />
of Australia the unqualified assurance that every single<br />
recommendation of Commissioner Costigan will be closely examined<br />
and on the basis of the advice that we receive as Lo the wisdom of<br />
proceeding w: ith those recommendations to achieve the objectives.<br />
that we all share, then that will be done.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, for the pictorial record, could I<br />
just get you to react to the news of the death of Indira Gandhi?<br />
PM: Yes, I have now sent two messages which I am glad to takr!<br />
this opportunity of again repeating the substance of those two<br />
messages. The first was to the Governor General of India, and<br />
then today to the new Prime Minister, the son of Indira Gandhi.<br />
Those messages have been in these terms that on behalf of the<br />
Australian people I have expressed the horror of Australians at<br />
this monstrous and wanton act of terrorism which has claimed the<br />
life of a person who was not only an outstanding leader of her<br />
country, the world's largest democracy, but also a woman who<br />
loomed extraordinarily. large in world affairs. My predecessors,<br />
Mr Whitlam and Mr Fraser and I have had the opportunity,<br />
particularly in the context of the Commonwealth to work closely<br />
with Mrs Gandhi and we have been able to understand the enormous<br />
impact that she has had upon the affairs of her own country and<br />
the influence that she has had elsewhere. And on behalf of the<br />
people of Australia I extend directly to the members of her family<br />
and broadly to the people of India the profound sympathy of the<br />
people of Australia. </p>
