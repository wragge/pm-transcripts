SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
JOINT LABOR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH WALES<br />
AND ALP EXECUTIVE DINNER<br />
SYDNEY 30 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
I am d3lighted to note, Mr President, that the New South<br />
Wales Labor Council continues to demonstrate its grasp of<br />
basic industrial principles, which has been a key to its<br />
remarkable achievement over the past 120 years.<br />
And one of those first principles is: get your claim in<br />
early, and make it as ambitious as possible.<br />
We are here tonight to register the Council's comprehensive<br />
claim to primacy in the foundation of the Australian Labor<br />
Party in New South Wales.<br />
And on the Churchillian principle that the best way to get a<br />
favourable verdict from History is to write it yourself, the<br />
Council has produced its own history, in the shape of this<br />
excellent little book ThA Foundtion nfLahnr ahead of<br />
all the other publications, official and otherwise, we may<br />
expect in the course of Labor's Centenary Year.<br />
So first, let me congratulate the Council on its initiative,<br />
its enterprise and its justified self confidence at the<br />
bar of history.<br />
Mr President, this is by any measure a genuinely historic<br />
occasion not only for the Labor Council and the unions it<br />
represents in Newa South Wales.<br />
In commemorating one of the landmark events in the formation<br />
of the Australian Labor Party, we are taking part in a<br />
celebration of Australia itself a celebration of<br />
Australian democracy.<br />
And in the official Centenary next year we shall celebrate<br />
not just 100 years of our Party, but 100 years of<br />
Australia's greatest political, industrial and social force<br />
this continuing, enduring, authentic Australian<br />
institution which, 1 more than any other, has shaped the lives<br />
of the Australian people and the destinies of this nation. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Tonidght we commemorate a clear, precise, public event the<br />
ad-option on 28 November 1890 of the Labor Council resolution<br />
in these terms:<br />
That with a view of securing better representation of<br />
labour in Parliament, and to effectively organise all<br />
that are favourable to the said object, this Council<br />
deems it advisable to establish Labor Electoral Leagues<br />
in every centre where practicable throughout the<br />
colony, and the Parliamentary Committee be instructed<br />
to prepare a scheme for the organisation and government<br />
of same.<br />
Now, Mr President, that resolution was in fact the last of a<br />
long series of resolutions and recommendations adopted by<br />
the Council over the previous two years all designed to<br />
advance the Council's long-held plan for direct labour<br />
representation in the New South Wales Parliament.<br />
And these efforts were to be crowned with tremendous success<br />
barely six months later, when 35 endorsed Labor candidates<br />
were elected to the Legislative Assembly in June and July<br />
1891 the first parliamentary Labor Party in the world.<br />
Sco great a work as the creation of a Party like ours had to<br />
bet, of course, the work of many hands and many years.<br />
But it is fitting tonight that we should remember and honour<br />
two of the Labor pioneers in particular Frank Dixon and<br />
Peter Brennan, both of whom served as President of the Labor<br />
Council. Until his untimely death in 1884, Dixon was the chief<br />
advocate for a political Labor Party, and Brennan thereafter<br />
was its chief architect.<br />
Brennan's special achievement was to give the idea a form<br />
and a structure to establish, indeed, the essential<br />
elements of the structure of the Party in New South Wales to<br />
this day.<br />
Mr President, there is another event another centenarywhich<br />
adds a dimension to the tributes we pay tonight.<br />
This month, 100 years ago, marks at the end of more than<br />
three months of bitter struggle and sacrifice -the defeat<br />
of the maritime and shearers' strike of 1890 -always, in<br />
the annals of Labor, the Great Strike.<br />
In New South Wales the Labor Council's work to form the<br />
Labor Party Was Well advanced before the Strike, and may in<br />
fact have been delayed by it.<br />
Nevertheless, the failure of the Great Strike reinforced the<br />
case for direct parliamentary representation; and gave the<br />
cause a new urgency, a new and passionate determination that<br />
Labor's cause would be pursued through Parliamentary action,<br />
and ultimately succeed through parliamentary power.<br />
13748 </p>
<p>I, 3.<br />
And that, Mr President, is the fundamental achievement we<br />
celebrate tonight the fundamental commitment to<br />
parliamentary democracy which the union movement made 100<br />
years ago and to which we as a party and a movement hold,<br />
undiminished, today.<br />
Mr President, following the November resolution, there took<br />
place in New South Wales what the first historians of the<br />
Labor Party, Roydhouse and Taperell, described as " the<br />
greatest burst of political activity ever seen on this<br />
continent." By May 1891, more than 40 Leagues the branches had been<br />
established throughout New South Wales. The Parliamentary<br />
Committee, constituted as the first Labor executive, drew up<br />
the first Platform a solid, realistic fighting Platform<br />
for industrial, social, electoral and education reform a<br />
program deliberately designed for broad electoral appeal.<br />
And they stated the Party's objective:<br />
" To secur7e for the wealth producers of this colony such<br />
legislation as will advance their interests by the<br />
return to Parliament of candidates pledged to uphold<br />
the Platform of this association; and to bring all<br />
electors who are in favour of democracy and progressive<br />
legislation under one common banner."<br />
That was the cobjective for which we were founded.<br />
It is the objective for which we continue to fight.<br />
Mr President, in a century of infinite change, in a century<br />
which has transformed six colonies into a great nation, in a<br />
century which has seen the collapse of empires, the<br />
discrediting of ideologies and dogmas never more<br />
dramatically than in our own time the foresight and clear<br />
vision of our founders shines out a constant star which<br />
has guided us for a century.<br />
And that of course, Mr President, is the real point of this<br />
historic occasion tonight and our centenary celebrations<br />
next year.<br />
We of the Labor Party and the Labor movement do not<br />
commemorate some dead past.<br />
We celebrate the past as the unbroken and unbreakable link<br />
to the living present and even more important to the future.<br />
We do right to honour our past. We are right to be proud of<br />
our history not least because it is so very much the<br />
history of the Australian people.<br />
But its real importance lies in the strength we draw from it<br />
for the present and the future. </p>
<p>And in this context, ladies and gentlemen, we have every<br />
right to draw the contrast with our political opponents.<br />
I will not say of them, as was said of the DLP remember<br />
the DLP? that, like the mule, they were born without pride<br />
of ancestry or hope of posterity.<br />
Well.... . perhaps I will say it.<br />
But I thought Bob Carr summed it up neatly when he<br />
introduced Paul Keating as the William McKell Lecturer at<br />
Parliament House, here in Sydney, last Friday.<br />
And Bob said that he might concede that the Liberals had<br />
some sense of pride in their history on the day Peter Reith<br />
delivered the Bob Askin Memorial Lecture.<br />
But perhaps, the Leader of the Federal Opposition put it<br />
even better himself.<br />
Because, only a few days ago, trying to explain away his<br />
cave-in on family allowances when he was rolled by his<br />
rural rump and failed the first test of his leadership-<br />
Dr Hewson said this:<br />
" One of the things that I have been doing since I<br />
became Leader is trying to put a lot of our history<br />
behind us."<br />
Now, of course, we can all understand why this new-look<br />
leader of the Tories would seek to put their past behind<br />
him. For the truth is this<br />
Their unprecedented electoral success over three post-war<br />
decades represented an unprecedented failure of performance.<br />
Theirs were the decades of opportunities 1nnt for the<br />
Australian nation a record of wilfully creating a<br />
second-class economy, sheltered behind the high walls of<br />
Country Party tariffs and isolated from the challenge of<br />
international competition.<br />
And theirs were the decades of opportunities denied for the<br />
bulk of the Australian people the entrenchment of<br />
privilege, the deliberate creation of division.<br />
That is why it was so vital for Labor in 1983 to embark on<br />
the task of reconciliation, recovery and reconstruction.<br />
And in a very real sense, our mission in 1983 was what it<br />
had been 40 years earlier to save this nation.<br />
No wonder Dr Hewson seeks to put his party's history behind<br />
him. But history is not so easily cut away. </p>
<p>And on this occasion -this celebration of the workers' part<br />
in founding the workers' party let us look briefly at<br />
their record for the working men and women of this country.<br />
What does Tory history tell us about the most basic concern<br />
of working Australians their jobs?<br />
By the end of their last term in office in 1963 they had<br />
created double-dLgit unemployment. They were prepared to<br />
stand idly by while whole industries closed down not least<br />
in importance, the steel industry, with its thousands of<br />
employees and its3 millions of dollars of exports.<br />
We have created more than 1.6 million new jobs. Jobs for<br />
bread-winners. Jobs for women. Jobs for young people.<br />
For those still without jobs, we have created new<br />
opportunities for training and re-training.<br />
Visit a SkillShare Centre in the suburbs and the country<br />
towns and you seo those opportunities being taken up by<br />
people with hope and plans for the future. Yet our<br />
opponents are on record as wanting to shut down the<br />
SkillShare Centres.<br />
Where do they stand on wages policy?<br />
Simply, they havet opposed every wage increase that has been<br />
offered for the last seven and a half years.<br />
that is, at no stage in the life of this<br />
Governmient, in the Tory view, have the times been<br />
right for the workers to get a wage increase.<br />
What about superannuation? When the Liberals were in<br />
office, superannuation was a privilege reserved for the<br />
wealthy, white-collared few. But we have opened up this<br />
erstwhile privilege, and put the legitimate expectation of<br />
superannuation within the grasp of ordinary workers. The<br />
number of people covered by superannuation has increased by<br />
almost a half in our time in office and is steadily<br />
rising, guaranteeing security to individuals and boosting<br />
the savings of the nation.<br />
What about health care surely one of the most basic<br />
concerns of working Australians.<br />
Labor has erected Medicare to provide, for the first time in<br />
the history of this nation, affordable and accessible health<br />
care for all Australians.<br />
The Tory health policy consists of nothing but a<br />
determination to knock down Medicare. Remember Peter Shack?<br />
There, I must acknowledge, was a man with a sense of<br />
history: " The Liberal and National Parties do not have a<br />
particularly goad track record in health, and you don't need<br />
me to remind you of our last period in Government." </p>
<p>What about taxation? Our Government has consistently and<br />
steadily cut income taxes. We're doing it again from 1<br />
January. We have made sure that everyone pays their fair<br />
share: through capital gains and fringe benefits taxes. At<br />
last Australia has a fair taxation system.<br />
Yet now our opponents want to skew the system back again by<br />
making sure that working people pay a consumption tax<br />
whenever they visit a supermarket or corner store. And<br />
behind this public commitment to a consumption tax lurks<br />
their hankering for the flat tax.<br />
And now we have the good doctor declaring that abolishing<br />
the Department of Social Security might be a good idea so<br />
that the needy can make their own way down to the voluntary<br />
agencies like the Salvation Army and the Sydney City<br />
Mission, and get their welfare assistance from them.<br />
Then his Social Security spokesman, Senator Alston ( I can't<br />
ask you to remember him because you have probably never<br />
heard of him) but anyway, he said, well hang on, let's not<br />
limit this to the welfare agencies. This Senator thought it<br />
could be that a firm of accountants might like to deliver<br />
all the welfare services give Price Waterhouse the job of<br />
paying the pension I<br />
It would be easy but it would be dangerous to dismiss<br />
all these things as passing fads. The truth is that they<br />
express the oldest convictions of Toryism in this country<br />
their deep-seated conviction that the system of social<br />
justice we of the Labor Party have fought to build, must be<br />
destroyed, because in the words of Dr Heweon, it is only<br />
' the bnd-nut mentality'. Those are his words. That is<br />
their real attitude.<br />
Some things never change.<br />
what has changed since 1927, for instance, when one,<br />
Theodore Hooke Hill, holding a Beat in the Legislative<br />
Assembly in the very same area now represented federally by<br />
Dr Hewson, rose to denounce Labor's legislation for widows'<br />
pensions, in these terms:<br />
' It was Just such a system of diseased humanitarianism<br />
which led to the fall of the Roman Empire.'<br />
Scratch the paint off one of these new Liberals and you will<br />
find a good old-fashioned unrepentant Tory.<br />
on all the main issues jobs, wages, health, taxation,<br />
welfare their words and their quack remedies and their pet<br />
schemes reveal their true colours and their real priorities.<br />
Sure, they have a new nominal leader who gives himself<br />
only two more years in the job that's staying power for<br />
you.<br />
3' 75~ i i </p>
<p>7.<br />
But can anyone believe their party itself has changed -in<br />
its pursuit of privilege in its commitment to the one,<br />
permanent principl. e of Tory thinking: to get into power and<br />
to keep Labor out at all costs?<br />
One hundred years ago, Labor's first platform correctly<br />
described Australia's workers as ' the wealth producers'.<br />
Nowhere today is the Tories' unrelenting opposition to the<br />
true interests of those wealth producers more starkly<br />
revealed in no way do they more clearly demonstrate their<br />
commitment to privilege than in this: their instinctive<br />
repugnance for the solidarity of the political and<br />
industrial wings of the Labor movement<br />
a solidarity which for the past 100 years has<br />
worked tirelessly on behalf of those wealth<br />
producers a solidarity that today finds its fullest<br />
expression in the spirit of the Accord between the<br />
Federal Labor Government and the national trade<br />
union movement.<br />
Tonight we pay tribute to the central role the New South<br />
Wales Labor Council played in the foundation of the<br />
Australian Labor Party this Council which is the oldest<br />
peak council of unions in Australia and one of the very<br />
oldest in the world.<br />
It is most fitting that this occasion should take place at<br />
the end of a month which has seen another step of very great<br />
importance to the welfare of the people of Australia and the<br />
well-being of the Australian economy; another step in the<br />
historic partnership between the Australian trade union<br />
movement and the Australian Labor Government the<br />
renegotiation of Mark Six of the Accord, which will deliver<br />
lasting improvements in family living standards through<br />
lower inflation, further cuts in income tax, and save jobs.<br />
My friends,<br />
Tonight we re-affirm our faith in the partnership between<br />
political and industrial Labor, which was forged one hundred<br />
years ago.<br />
Never in all those hundred years has the strength of that<br />
partnership been more important for Australia.<br />
These are testing times for us all.<br />
I do not for a moment deny the difficulties and hardships of<br />
the recessionary phase through which we are passing.<br />
But ours has never been just a fairweather partnership.<br />
It was created at a time of tremendous challenge for the<br />
Labor movement. </p>
<p>8.<br />
It has been sustained through tines of desperate peril for<br />
the movement and for the nation.<br />
Now, its~ continued strength is the key to economic recovery.<br />
And the foundation for the sustained recovery, which we<br />
shall achieve, will be the immense structural changes we<br />
have wrought in creating a nore modern and competitive<br />
economy. And the indispensable condition for this<br />
transformation has been and remains, the partnership of<br />
Labor. These aire the supreme facts of the economic life of this<br />
nation : Ln 1990.<br />
And they are facts which in themselves stand as testimony to<br />
the extraordinary importance of the work which began at the<br />
Sydney Trrades Hall in 1890.<br />
And that: is the measure of the debt we all owe -first, as<br />
AustraliLans, and as the heirs and successors of those who<br />
put the: Lr hands to the great work, in the great cause of<br />
Labor, one hundred years ago.<br />
