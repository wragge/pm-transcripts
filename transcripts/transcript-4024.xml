PRIME MINISTER'S INTERVIEW WITH KEN BRADDICK OF 12 JANUARY 1976<br />
QUESTION: You came out the other day in support of development in Diego Garcia.<br />
At the moment it's before Congress. Do you want the US to go ahead<br />
with it and what can Australia do to either offer some inducement or to<br />
become partfof Indtan Ocean defence?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is a very long story in the sense that discussion over Diego Garcia<br />
has been going on for many years. I strongly supported it when I was<br />
Defence Minister. Also, when I was Defence Minister, I had an understanding<br />
with the United States Secretary of State for Defence who was then Mel Laird;<br />
and with the British Secretary of State for Defence, that Cockburn Sound when<br />
it was properly developed could be used from time to time. We hoped<br />
, that it would be used and that it would be help them in maintaining a<br />
balance in the Indian Ocean. At that time we expressed a strong view that<br />
' Diego Garcia ought to proceed. They expressed the same view again the other<br />
day. It i not only necessary for an Indian Ocean balance and to equalise<br />
facilities that the Soviet is establishing, but it could under certain<br />
circumstances, be fairly important for the resupply of Israel, Middle<br />
East strategy. It ts also important in helping guarantee the sea lanes<br />
and oil supplies that come out of the Middle East. This is of quite<br />
critical significance to Japan in particular-It may be of-more-significance<br />
' to . japan than it is to us, because they are dependent on Middle East oil.<br />
So. the facility of Diego Garcia has not just got one reason for being, it<br />
has really got many. I understand that certain Senators in the United States<br />
want there to be discussions with the Soviet to. try and achieve a ceiling<br />
on the level of naval activity in the Indian Ocean. Let me only say that<br />
their activity would have to come down very, very much indeed to reach the<br />
level of the United States' activity. The prospects of the Soviet Union<br />
reducing it's level of activity, I would have thought are very remote. She's<br />
already started to use the Suez Canal as a means of getting elements of the<br />
Middle East fleet into the Indian Ocean. There has been a careful<br />
and slow build-up of movement of military vessels.. For the first several<br />
months I don't think there were any, or maybe not more than one or two,<br />
military uses of the Suez Canal, but the use of. the Canal for military purposes<br />
has certainly been significant.<br />
QUESTION: What's your information about the level of Soviet military forces in the<br />
Middle East, Persian. Gulf, around the Cape, in Angola, off Angola? / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I think some of this information doesn't come to us from our<br />
sources, so it's not just our information. I therefore don't want to give<br />
figures. But it's much more significant than that of the United States.<br />
QUESTION: And offensive?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: In some elements of it, yes, very definitely. But the mere presence<br />
of naval ships from the Soviets point of view in the right place and<br />
the right time, it can certainly be criticaL on having an impact<br />
on domestic events in one of the Littoral States. In the Angola activity in<br />
which the Soviet is, I'm advised quite heavily involved, the appearance<br />
of Soviet naval units from their point of view at the right time can be<br />
critcalin . achieving a final solution which suits their purpose.<br />
And it ought~ to be noted that the sea power's very often been used to achieve<br />
political ends without firing a shot. During difficult times between Israel<br />
and Egypt, the presence of Soviet ships in Alexandria made it quite impossible<br />
virtually , for Israel to take Alexandria. I don't know if they wanted to or<br />
planned to but the danger of hitting a Soviet ship was too great.<br />
JESTIONi Of course ong of the greatest confrontations of all time, Cuba.<br />
RIME MINISTER: Yes, actly. I don't really think that there was much chance of the<br />
! Soviet agreeing to a limitation in sailing time. That's being very kind about it.<br />
I don't think there's any chance really. It's part of their planned<br />
development, as they would believe -the largest most powerful navy in the world<br />
capable of-exercising a dominating role in any ocean of the world. They<br />
obviously want to be able to link up the Mediterranean and Vladivostok Pacific<br />
fleets. The Indian Ocean and the waterways to the north of us are quite<br />
critical to their capacity to do that.<br />
) UESTION: There have been, the South African Government has recently, has been conducting<br />
a publicity campaign in New York and Washington suggesting that ( inaudible)<br />
Nato so'uthern anchor. You mention Cockburn Sound in Australia and Diego<br />
Garcia and Simonstown. It would make a lot of sense ( inaudible)<br />
Indian Ocean along with Bahrain for the U. S. fleet. Would that be in your<br />
thinking as to the kind of defence that ought to occur in the Indian Ocean?<br />
1IME MINISTER: Well South Africa has sometimes suggested this sort of thing. They<br />
have not suggested it to me. I don't know how the United States would react </p>
<p>3..<br />
but I don't think Australia has forces that would enable that to take place.<br />
Our Navy, because of lack of ordering of vessels, is very much stretched.<br />
in its own immediate environment. The number of escorts we. can keep at<br />
sea is goinig to.-become quite critital because of the lead times involved.<br />
QUESTION': What can Australia actually offer on the West Coast for Diego Garcia<br />
support, because Cockburn Sound, as I understand, it is not developed?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There is a fair bit been done there but there is still a lot remaining<br />
to be done. I don't think the facilities at the moment would really be<br />
adequate to ! do much to assist the United States. This is a matter we will be<br />
looking at just as it is out objective to establish a navy with a capacity<br />
to survey adequately in the areas that are obviously closer and more immediate<br />
. interest oflAustralia. Two oceans I don't really think the navy has<br />
got that capacity at the moment and this is'because of the lack of ships.<br />
QUESTION: What do yqu: have in mind for the future of the Navy?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is a matter that the Defence Minister has under consideration<br />
at the momept. The former Government had ordered two patrol frigates.<br />
We had been~ examining earlier--the DDL approach. We do believe the escort capacity of<br />
the Navy nepeds increasing and I have no doubt that the Department of Defence<br />
I A<br />
is examining this in the best way we can achieve this objective.<br />
QUESTION: For what' sort of a role?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well its surveillance, and a country like Australia buying ships<br />
has got to buy for a fair degree of multi-purpose capacity. A very large<br />
Navy like the United States can much better afford to have specialist ships<br />
that are good for one particular purpose. A much smaller navy like Australia's<br />
needs ships that not only have an anti-submarine capacity but that have<br />
surface capacity as well.<br />
1UESTION: For coastal defence or further ranging?<br />
' RIME MINISTER: The Patrol boats were originally ordered for coastal defences,<br />
coastal surveillance. I think the larger ships in the'navy, any one of the<br />
multiple roles that the navy can sometimes be involved, but you can't<br />
point to some particular purpose and say that the ships are there for that </p>
<p>4.<br />
particular purpose. It's like the old question of what do you have defences<br />
for. Whereas the enemy have defence forces so that there is never going to<br />
be an enemy.<br />
QUESTION: I guess that the point I am really tryingto ask is forward defence<br />
no longer plays the role it once did.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It doesn't play the role but there is still part of our defence<br />
agreement which even the Labor Government maintained in some form.<br />
QUESTION: ( Inaudible) Butterworth. Do you foresee that continuing indefinitely?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There~. have been no proposals to withdraw them.<br />
QUESTION: Any expansi n that you can see?<br />
PRIME-MINISTER: I would not have thought there would be any expansion in the<br />
Air Force there, no:<br />
QUESTION: What about any other kind of ground elements. or naval?<br />
' RIME MINISTER: I donlt think you turn the clock back in that sort of way, but all I<br />
am pointing out is that the arrangement still exists. Under the Labor<br />
Government the-arrangement was conti-nued and while it. wa s saying it is<br />
continental defence alone Australians have got to have in mind the security<br />
of Australia doesn't just depend on what happens within the shores of Australia.<br />
Events outside that can affect us, can have implications for us.<br />
QUESTION: Another aspect of defence forces I've read that you are going to have<br />
to find a replacement for fighters, mirages and also I think for trainers too.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Always at some stage in the future you have got to have replacements<br />
for these things but I would have thought the Macchier. You know I don't<br />
want to be too precise or too definitive in some of these elements becuase<br />
I haven't had a report from Mr Killen yet on the state of the defences which<br />
I know he is preparing for the Government to examine.<br />
UESTION: There is one aspect of this fighter aircraft simply becuase there<br />
have been so many people offered planes.<br />
I I </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: But there always are. There were in my time. They come round<br />
quite regularly every six months and sometimes every three months.<br />
QUESTION: Are you interested in any particular aircraft or have some kind of<br />
arrangement where it could be partially built, assembled in Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well an arrangement that could enable aircraft to be partially built<br />
in Australia would certainly be one much better than one in which all had<br />
to be bought overseas and this applied to the Macchie, it applied to the<br />
Mirage, it applied to the Amen Sailors. There is not significant elements<br />
of construction in Australia.<br />
QUESTION: But not to the Flll?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, there were only 24 of them and that was a much more highly<br />
specialized operation. There were other arrangements that I had negotiated<br />
in earlier times about the construction of helicopters here which would have<br />
given the Australian aircraft industry a reasonably continuous work load<br />
but the Labor Government virtually cancelled the programme.<br />
QUESTION: Are you still interested in that sort of a project?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Again you can't revive the past. The arrangement was that they built<br />
a large number of aircraft and helicopters. The company concerned would accept<br />
the obligation either to get the commercial ones sold in Australia or somewhere<br />
in the world, and part of the price of this was the defence forces would take<br />
a certain number of these aircraft. Well the previous Government collapsed<br />
the defence order and that virtually collapsed the whole deal. The number that<br />
were ultimately taken by the defence force was very much less. We do need an<br />
aircraft industry. If you are going to be able to maintain and keep your<br />
own aircraft going, you need to have a capacity in Australia. So it's not<br />
just a question of buying aircraft overseas. If you had two equal aircraft<br />
the company that was prepared to go much more significantly into local<br />
construction offsetting arrangements would obviously be presenting us with<br />
a much more attractive arrangement than others. You should not draw implications<br />
from this. Mr Killen will be bringing these matters up in proper time and<br />
in proper order and the fact that you get aircraft salesmen around the state,<br />
around the place trying to sell the produce well it's just part of their<br />
business and it's a pretty regular process. </p>
<p>6.<br />
QUESTION: ( Inaudible) and United Nations Secretary-General. Kurt Waldheim visiting the<br />
region over Timor.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I rather thought that he was due to come but here anyway, but<br />
he is visiting Australia. I think that the arrangement for him to come here<br />
was one that preceded the events in Timor.<br />
QUESTION: But his arrival here gives you at least the chance to talk about Timor.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It gives us the chance to talk about a lot of things, yes.<br />
QUESTION: Timor is of particular interest to Australia. Is there anything at all that<br />
Australia can or should do in Timor?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think we can do much more that Mr Peacock has indicated in the<br />
various statements he has made. Those statements have been quite forthright.<br />
The real time for action in relation to Timor was 12-15 months ago when<br />
administration in Portugal had started to disintegrate. It started<br />
to become plain that Portugal was losing interest in overseeing<br />
the decolonisation process in the proper manner. Had this been undertaken<br />
earlier enough action in the United Nations or some sort of regional approach...<br />
would have had a much better chance of success.<br />
QUESTION: You think that day has passed?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well that day certainly has passed and options are now much less obvious.<br />
QUESTION: Do you see anything that might provide a solution bloodless or as bloodless<br />
as possible?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There has already been a good deal of blood spilt so in part that<br />
question is based on a possibility that is no longer real. Australia<br />
will go on pressing the point of view that Mr Peacock has expressed on<br />
behalf of the Government. He has maintained close contact with me on these<br />
matters throughout but beyond that it is difficult to see What Australia can do.<br />
QUESTION: Well there is a lot of oil and gas in the. ground and Labor had a policy<br />
which didn't exactly provide any incentive for anybody to do anything about it<br />
or to invest in it, what are you going to do about it? Do you want foreign<br />
investment and what restrictions are you going to put on it? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: We want foreign investment most certainly. We want to get major<br />
development projects operating and moving forward and we want this to happen<br />
as rapidly-as possible. Our objective is to get 50 percent Australian<br />
equity in major new developments. We also recognise that in a number<br />
of places -because of the amount of funds involved this. is probably<br />
not going-to be possible. Where it's not possible and this is putting<br />
a fairly comprehensive policy in the briefest terms, projects will be<br />
referred to the Foreigo Investment Review Board which will examine against<br />
publicly stated criteria whether ot not it is in Australia's nation interest<br />
for a certain project to go ahead even though the level of Australian equity<br />
might well be less than would be desired but if there is a project that is in our<br />
interest and if overseas corporations have genuinely sought to get Australian<br />
c apital to participate, and have not been able to, the question then remains:<br />
should the project be prevented from going ahead or should we allow it to go<br />
ahead? If against publicly known and statedCriteria which is in our own<br />
foreign investment policy, which now in GovEirnment will be further elaborated<br />
and refined, 1we believe it to be in the national interest well, then, we would<br />
want it togo ahead. This is against the background that we want foreign<br />
investment and we want major development in Australia to begin again.<br />
The previous. Government seemed to be much more concerned with cutting up<br />
AusIt ralian resources or much more concerned with using Australian resources<br />
than building and developing Av. stralian resources and we are just not going<br />
, to hive h ud to enable people to lead the sort of lives they want to lead,<br />
thefund<br />
provide the-sort of schools they want, and to provide the sort of welfare<br />
services that people believe ought to be available in a , modern Australia unless<br />
the real wealth of Australia is also-developed.<br />
JUESTION: There is a lot of oil and gas that has not been developed. I may be incorrect,<br />
but, just as a basic principle, I thought the Labor policy was that this should<br />
be used for Australia, no real regard given to export of this even if it meant<br />
obviously better prices that could lead to faster development. Will you allow<br />
development as a general policy of major resources such as, particularly oil,<br />
and gas, where at least a large part of it would be exported?<br />
RIME MINISTER: If export permits will help to get a developmental project off the<br />
ground that certainly is an advantage and something we would consider<br />
and in cases we would allow it. If it is a question of oil, well we still<br />
don't produce all our own needs, that might be a different matter. But if<br />
there were discoverie's so great that we not only had e nough for our own </p>
<p>needs but also significant amounts in addition, then we would have<br />
to fact up to the question of export. Our natural gas supplies seem to<br />
be enormous, and the export of natural gas would seem to provide a<br />
possibility for getting developments underway where otherwise getting the<br />
thing moving might-be difficult.-In many of these instances we would<br />
have * to make the judgement on a case by case approach but again our<br />
judgements in relation to foreign investment matters of this kind will be<br />
against publicly known and stated principles by which we will judge<br />
Australia's national interest and we want to establish the circumstances<br />
i6 which corporations will know where they stand with the Australian<br />
, Government that there are not going to be a series of ad hoc secret<br />
deals behind closed doors with nobody really knowing what's happening<br />
and what rules are being applied because I don't think that encourages<br />
: investment or confidence in what you are doing.<br />
QUESTION: The automobjle industry here d6esn't seem to be invery good shape.<br />
-There have-been discussions about whether the Government should do something<br />
whether Japanese investors should do something, what is going to be the<br />
policy or have you lready decided what will be the policy of this Government<br />
in general.'<br />
PRIME MINISTERS Well it's a fairly complex'matter that involves not only local<br />
producers. f It involves subsiduar suppliers. It involves importers.<br />
It involves overseas manufacturers. It involves Japan and it is not<br />
a matter, you can sort out in a day-or a week but I know that Senator Cotton<br />
is treating it as a matter of high priority because the industry got plunged<br />
into difficultires for two reasons: the changes from 1971-72 plan and downgrading<br />
of the content which leads us to doubt as to whether local skins are going to go on<br />
being produced, for examole, as the Labor plan continues. The other difficulties<br />
occur because of the currency devaluation, the tariff cuts and inflation<br />
which for a while-make imports so much more attractive than many Australian<br />
products and that then led of course to import quotas. and a continuing<br />
difficult situation for Australian producers. Now this is the sort of legacy<br />
we are left with, and that we have to sort out as soon as possible to establish<br />
guidelines so that industry knows where it is going. Our objective will be to<br />
have a plan for the industry which provides encouragement, security, continuity.<br />
QUESTION: Protection perhaps? </p>
<p>9.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There is already protection and quotas in addition.<br />
QUESTION: Well I ask this because being a private enterprise economy if they<br />
can't make it wouldn't it be better to let them go down?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: What does that apply to? Does it apply to everything we . produce?<br />
QUESTION: I'm asking a question. I don't know what it applies to.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: A country with a domestic market as small as Australia's is going to continue<br />
to need a reasonable degree of protection. People point to some overseas<br />
' countries they point to smaller European countries by comparison, but they<br />
have access: to the~ total European market at their door step. The European<br />
-Economic Community has developed into a reasonably protective and inward<br />
looking tralIing block. If the Australian people are to be fully and properly<br />
employed welare going to need I believe for' quite a long while in the future,<br />
a significant degree of protection for many Austratian industries.<br />
Now the need for this has become all the greater because of the dislocation<br />
over the -paft three years and the rate of inflation over and above that of<br />
many of our, trading partners quite apart from the other things I have mentioned.<br />
The only otper thing I-would want to add is that it must be a level of protection<br />
. that is still consistent with. IAustralia stili-. being a good trading partner.<br />
QUESTION:: You don't want to see the loss of jobs?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No I don't. There has already been enough loss of jobs. If you want<br />
to restructure an industry if a Government does so in cooperation with that<br />
industry it needs to be done on an industry by industry basis knowing<br />
where you are going, knowing. where people are going to find alternative<br />
employment. One of the problems of Labor was that they tried to restructure<br />
the whole economy and virtually destroyed the whole economy at once.<br />
They just didn't understand where they were going and the decisions we make<br />
have to be taken against an extraordinary difficult background that has been<br />
created over the past three years.<br />
UESTION: Relations with the communist countries, Vietnam, North Korea, are they<br />
in general, going to continue?<br />
') RIME MINISTER: We would want to have relationships with as many countries as possible. It<br />
enables us to put a point off view. We are not going to seek out new friends </p>
<p>at the expense of old ones but decisions to establish diplomatic<br />
relationships with other countries I think is only a sensible one.<br />
QUESTION: And the matter of an Ambassador to Washington, the successor to Sir Patrick.<br />
Has any dectsion-been made?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, it hasn't.<br />
