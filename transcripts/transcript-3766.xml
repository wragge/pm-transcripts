STATEM'ENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM,<br />
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.<br />
THURSDAY, 5 JUNE 1975<br />
W'HEN I LAST REPORTED TO THE PARLIAMENT ON THE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S ACHIEVEMENTS AT THE END OF THE SITTINGS<br />
IN DECEMBER 1974, I STRESSED THE CONTINUING IMPORTANCE<br />
OF THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAMS. I EMPHASISED THAT WE<br />
WOULD PRESS AHEAD WITH * OUR PROGRAMS IN FULFILMENT OF<br />
THE UNDERTAKINGS WE HAD ' GIVEN TO THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE HAD TWICE ENDORSED THOSE PROGRAMS<br />
AT THE ELECTIONS OF 1972 AND 1974. THEY HAD TWICE<br />
CONFIRMED THE TRUST PLACED IN us, THE LAST SIX MONTHSTHIS<br />
FIRST SESSIONAL PERIOD OF 1975 -HAVE BROUGHT US<br />
CLOSER TO THE GREAT GOALS WE PROCLAIMED. FOR ALL OUR<br />
DIFFICULTIES, FOR ALL THE DISTRACTIONS AND DIVERSIONS<br />
WE HAVE FACED IN THIS PLACE AND OUTSIDE, FOR ALL THE<br />
PROPAGANDA OF OUR OPPONENTSFOR ALL THE OBSTRUCTION<br />
OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND VESTED INTERESTS, FOR ALL<br />
THE DENIGRATION OF THE PRESS, THIS HAS BEEN A PERIOD<br />
OF GREAT AND POSITIVE ACHIEVEMENT BY THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT. THIS IS VERY MUCH A TIME TO KEEP THOSE<br />
ACHIEVEMENTS IN MIND, TO PUT THE RECORD IN PERSPECTIVEP<br />
TO REFLECT ON THE BASIC STRENGTH AND PROSPERITY OF THE<br />
NATION, THE UNDERLYING STRENGTH OF THE ECONOMY, THE REAL<br />
GAINS WE HAVE MADE IN SOCIAL REFORM AND SOCIAL JUSTICE<br />
AND IN THE LIVING STANDARDS OF THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE. o/ 2 </p>
<p>THE LAST SIX MO NTHS HAV E CE RTA INLY NOT BEEN<br />
EASY, WHEN HAS THERE BEEN A TIME WHEN THE TASK OF<br />
G OVERNMENT WAS EASY? WHERE * IS THERE A COUNTRY WHERE<br />
GOVERNMENT IS EASY? WE BEGAN THE YEAR IN THE<br />
AFTERMATH OF THE DARWIN CYCLONE THE GREATEST<br />
NATURAL DISASTER AUSTRALIA HAS KNOWN, IT WAS<br />
FOLLOWED BY A SECOND CALAMIlTY * IN HOBART INVOLV* ING<br />
APPALLING SOCIAL DISRUPTION AND LOSS OF LIFE. THE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S RESPONS* E TO THESE CALAMITIES WAS PROMPT<br />
AND GENEROUS. IKNOW THAT ALL HONOURABLE MEMBERS<br />
WILL JOIN ME IN A TRIBUTE TO THE NATURAL DISASTER<br />
ORGANISATION FOR ITS HANDLING OF THE DARWIN CRISIS.-<br />
AND TO THE DARWIN PEOPLE THEMSELVES FOR THEIR FORTITUDE<br />
AND UNDAUNTED SPIRIT. WE IMMEDIATELY ESTABLISHED A<br />
DARWIN RECONSTRUCTION COMMISSION AND ENTRUSTED IT<br />
WITH THE MASSIVE TASK OF REBUILDING THE CITY. WE AGREED<br />
TO ESTABLISH A JOINT TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION COMMISSION.<br />
WE HAVE COMMITTED MORE THAN $ 58 MILLION TO THE DARWIN<br />
RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM AND AN INITIAL GRANT OF $ 6 MILLION<br />
FOR HOBART. I NEED HARDLY STRESS THAT IN TIMES OF<br />
ECONOMIC DIFFICULTY, DISASTERS OF THIS MAGNITUDE PLACE<br />
NEW AND UNPRECEDENTED DEMANDS ON THE NATION'I S MATERIAL<br />
AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. UNSTINTING AND UNQUESTIONING<br />
THOUGH OUR RESPONSE HAS BEEN,. THE DARWIN AND HOBART<br />
DISASTERS HAVE CERTAINLY NOT MADE IT EASIER TO CONTEND<br />
WITH THE ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES FACING AUSTRALIADIFFICULTIES<br />
WE SHARE WITH ALL OTHER COMPARABLE COUNTRIES. </p>
<p>I' 4Ei CAN, HOWEVER, TAKE HEART FROM SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT<br />
ALREADY AP1PARENT IN THE ECONOMY. OF COURSE IT'S NOT A<br />
TIME FOR COMPLACENCY; THERE IS STILL A NEED FOR STEADY<br />
JUDGMENT AND A CALM, RATIONAL APPROACH TO OUR DIFFICULTIES.<br />
BUT THERE IS GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT A RECOVERY IS<br />
UNDERWAY. CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, REFLECTED IN RISING RETAIL<br />
SALES AND HIGHER DISPOSABLE INCOMES, HAS SHOWN SIGNIFICANT<br />
GAINS. PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN THE BASIC AREAS OF THE ECONOMY<br />
IS RISING. THE IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT THE<br />
GOVERNMENT' S POLICIES HAVE PUT MONEY IN THE POCKETS OF<br />
AUSTRALIANS. PEOPLE ARE MORE PROSPEROUS TODAY THAN THEY<br />
HAVE EVER BEEN, li-0HENEVER WE HEAR CRITICISM OF THIS GOVERNMENT'S<br />
POLICIES REMEMBER THIS SIMPLE FACT: THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE<br />
HAVE NEVER BEEN BETTER OFF BETTER OFF IN THE MONEY THEY<br />
HAVE TO SPEND,, BETTER OFF IN THEIR REAL INCOMES, BETTER OFF<br />
IN THE RANGE OF SERVICES AND OPPORTU11ITIES AVAILABLE TO. THEM<br />
FROM THIS GOVERNMENT'S AGENCIES AND PROGRAMS. SINCE<br />
DECEMBER 1972 INCOMES OF WAGE AND SALARY EARNERS HAVE GROWN<br />
MUCH FASTER THAN THE COST OF LIVING. AVERAGE MINIMUM WEEKLY<br />
AWARD RATES FOR MEN HAVE INCREASED BY 53. PE: R CENT; FOR WOMEN<br />
BY NO LESS THAN 755 PER CENT. REAL AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS<br />
AFTER TAX FOR ALL WAGE AND SALARY( EARNERS HAVE INCREASED<br />
By 7.3 PER CENT SINCE THIS GOVERNMENT CAME TO OFFICE. IN<br />
ADDITION, WE HAVE TACKLED THE GREAT AND DIFFICULT PROBLEM<br />
OF WAGE INDEXATION. IN ITS HISTORIC JUDGMENT OF 30 APRIL<br />
THE CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION COMMISSION ACCEPTED THE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S CA'SE FOR A RESTORATIO14 OF QUARTERLY COST OF<br />
LIVING ADJUSTMENTS, WIITH REASON AND GOODWILL WE CAN MAKE<br />
THIS REFORM WORK. -Jf </p>
<p>-4JPROPERLY<br />
APPLIED, IT CAi4 BRING GREATER BENEFITS AND GREATER<br />
MATERIAL SECURITY TO ALL WAGE EARNERS AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE<br />
SOLUTION OF OUR LONG-TERM ECONOMIC PROBLEMS,<br />
FOR ALL THAT, WE DO NOT SEE REAL LIVING STANDARDS<br />
SOLELY IN MONiEY TERMS, WE HAVE NEVER DONE SO, THE REAL<br />
PROSPERITY OF THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE LIES INCREASINGLY IN THE<br />
QUALITY OF THE SERVICES GOVERNMENTS PROVIDE FOR THE WHOLE<br />
COMMUNITY, THAT HIGHER ORDER OF PROSPERITY THAT WIDER AND<br />
DEEPER COMMITMENT TO THE PEOPLE S GOOD DEPENDS ON THE<br />
SUCCESS OF OUR SOCIAL PROGRAMS, flY GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN<br />
PRIMACY TO THIS PARLIAMENT AS THE CHIEF INSTRUMENT OF SOCIAL<br />
REFORM. OUR PROGRAMS ARE ESSENTIALLY LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMS;<br />
THE MEASURE OF THEIR SCOPE AND IMPORTANCE CAN BE SEEN IN THE<br />
NUMBER OF BILLS PASSED THROUGH THIS PARLIAMENT. OUR<br />
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM il OUR FIRST TWO YEARS SURPASSED ALL<br />
RECORDS SINCE FEDERATION 254 BILLS INTRODUCED IN 1973,<br />
229 IN 1974. SO FAR THIS YEAR, TO THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS<br />
LAST NIGHT, PARLIAMENT HAS SAT FOR 1ZI HOURS AND A TOTAL<br />
OF 126 BILLS HAS BEEN INTRODUCED. IT IS A FORMIDABLE<br />
ACHIEVEMENT, I THINK IT PROPER TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE<br />
OPPOSITION, UNDER ITS NEW LEADERSHIP, HAS BEHAVED WITH<br />
GREATER DECORUM IN THIS PARLIAMENT THAN PREVIOISLY, THIS HAS<br />
CERTAINLY MEANT A MORE RATIONAL AND MORE ORDERLY DESPATCH<br />
OF BUSINESS, IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS<br />
ABANDONED ITS TACTICS OF OBSTRUCTION. IT DOES MEAN THAT<br />
THE PROCEEDINGS OF THIS HOUSE HAVE BEEN LESS DEMEANING TO<br />
THE REPUTATION OF PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY, </p>
<p>WE HAVE SEEN THIS YEAR A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT<br />
GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS BROUGHT TO FRUITION. OTHERS HAVE<br />
BEEN BROUGHT TO THE POINT OF IMPLEMENTATION. THEIR<br />
BENEFITS WILL SOON BE FLOWING TO THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE'<br />
AND THE PARTICULAR GROUPS WHO NEED THEM THE Low-<br />
INCOME EARNERS, THE CHILDREN.-THE SICK, THE* HANDICAPPED.<br />
RADICAL AND ENDURING SOCIAL REFORM IS NOT ACHIEVED<br />
OVERNIGHT; IT IS NOT ACHIEVED BY SPENDING MORE<br />
MONEY, THOUGH MONEY IS CERTAINL Y NEEDED. IT REQUIRES<br />
NEW INSTITUTIONS, NEW SCALES AND PRIORITIES, NEW<br />
SOCIAL ATTITUDES.-NEW POLITICAL. GUIDELINES, NEW EFFORTS<br />
AT CO-OPERATION, NEW MEN AND WOMEN IN POSITIONS OF<br />
AUTHORITY. THIS PROCESS CAN BE DIFFICULT AND PAINFULLY<br />
PROTRACTED, BUT EVENTUALLY THE RESULTS WILL SHOW$<br />
WE HAVE SEEN IT IN THE CREATION OF MEDIBANK, NOW THE<br />
LAW OF THE LAND, A GREAT PIONEERING REFORM WHICH THE<br />
RELUCTANT STATES HAVE BEEN DRIVEN INEXORABLY TO ACCEPT,<br />
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY THEMSELVES WILL BENEFIT<br />
AND ABOVE ALL THAT THE PEOPLE WILL BENEFIT. WHAT A LESSON<br />
OUR OPPONENTS HAVE LEARNED1 AFTER ALL THE-OBSTRUCTION<br />
IN THIS PARLIAMENT, AFTER ALL THE ATTEMPTS TO DELAY<br />
THE MEDIBANK BILLS NOT JUST THE BASIC LEGISLATION WHICH<br />
THE PEOPLE SPECIFICALLY ENDORSED, BUT THE ANCILLARY BILLS<br />
TO ESTABLISH AND FINANCE THE PROGRAM THE ANTI-LABOR<br />
STATES ARE NOW SEEKING TO JOIN THE MEDIBANK SCHEME$<br />
AND IF THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS CAN BE BELIEVED, EVEN<br />
TAKING SOME OF THE CREDIT FOR IT, Bs .1/ 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
ONE OF THE THEMES OF ALL OUR REFORMS HAS BEEN TO<br />
ASSERT THE PRINCIPLE OF COMPETITION FREE AND FAIR COMPETITION<br />
IN A MIXED ECONOMY, PRODUCTIVE COMPETITION BETWEEN PRIVATE<br />
AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISE. WE HAVE SEEN THE BENEFITS OF SUCH<br />
COMPETITION IN THE AIRLINES AND THE BANKS, WE SHALL EXTEND IT<br />
TO OTHER FIELDS. IN THE FACE OF AN UNSCRUPULOUS AND<br />
CONTINUING CAMPAIGN OF MISREPRESENTATIONj WE HAVE PASSED<br />
'. EGISLATION IN THIS HOUSE TO ESTABLISH AN AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
INSURANCE CORPORATION. IT WILL PROVIDE THE WIDEST POSSIBLt<br />
COVER FOR HOMES AT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE PREMIUMS AND OFFER<br />
A WIDE RANGE OF INSURANCE SERVICES. WHAT PUBLIC INITIATIVE<br />
CAN ACHIEVE IN HEALTH INSURANCE IT CAN ACHIEVE IN FAIR<br />
COMPETITION IN GENERAL INSURANCE.<br />
WE HAVE DEVELOPED AND EXTENDED OUR LEGAL AID SERVICE.<br />
SIX REGIONAL OFFICES OF THE AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE HAVE<br />
BEEN OPENED THIS YEAR AND MORE THAN 60,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN<br />
ASSISTED. WE HAVE SET UP AN AUSTRALIAN HOUSING CORPORATION<br />
TO TAKE ACTION IN AREAS WHERE THE EXISTING HOUSING SY( STEM<br />
IS UNABLE TO MEET EXISTING HOUSING NEEDS; ALREADY THIS YEAR<br />
WE HAVE FUNDED THE CONSTRUCTION BY STATE HOUSING AUTHORITIES<br />
OF 13,580 HOMES FOR LOW-INCOME EARNERS 5,000 MORE THAN THE<br />
NUMBER BUILT IN 1973-741, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
FILM COMMISSION TO PROMOTE LOCAL FILM PRODUCTION, THESE ARE<br />
ALL AREAS HOUSING, MEDIBANK, GENERAL INSURANCE, LEGAL AID,<br />
FILM PRODUCTION W1HERE EXISTING SERVICES HAVE FAILED TO MEET<br />
DEMONSTRABLE HUMAN OR SOCIAL NEEDS, OR WHERE COMPETITION IS<br />
LIKELY TO BRING NEW BENEFITS TO THE CONSUMER, 17 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
LET ME GIVE A FURTHER EXAMPLE IN A FIELD<br />
WHERE PROGRESS THIS YEAR HAS BEEN REMARKABLE. I REFER TO<br />
TRANSPORT. IN MY LAST STATEMENT OF THIS KIND I MENTIONED<br />
OUR MASSIVE CONTRIBUTION TO NATIONAL AND URBAN ROADS<br />
PROGRAMS. THOSE PROGRAMS ARE WELL IN HAND. THE OUTSTANDINGAREA<br />
OF PROGRESS THIS YEAR, HOWEVER, HAS BEEN THE<br />
RAILWAYS, SUBURBAN COMMUTERS, IN SYDNEY ESPECIALLY, MAY<br />
WONDER AT THAT STATEMENT. THEIR OVERCROWDED AND<br />
INCREASINGLY INADEQUATE RAIL SERVICES CONTINUE TO DECLINE<br />
IN FREQUENCY AND QUALITY WHILE THE STATES REFUSE OUR<br />
OFFERS, REPEATEDLY MADE, TO ASSUME FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY<br />
FOR RAIL SYSTEMS AND RAISE THEIR PRESENT ATROCIOUS STANDARDS.<br />
BUT IN THE AREA OF NATIONAL RAILWAYS WE HAVE SEEN<br />
GREAT AND PERMANENT DEVELOPMENT. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
MORE THAN ANY OF ITS PREDECESSORS, THE GOVERNMENT<br />
HAS RECOGNISED THE NEED FOR A NATIONAL APPROACH TO<br />
RAILWAYS;' ' E HAVE RECOGNISED THAT THE RAILWAYS CANNOT<br />
EFFECTIVELY SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS WITHIN THE PRESENT<br />
FRAGMENTED SYSTEM, IT WAS THIS RECOGNITION THAT PROMPTED<br />
MY OFFER IN MY 1972 POLICY SPEECH TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY<br />
FOR THE RAILWAYS OF ANY STATES PREPARED TO TRANSFER THEM.<br />
DURING THIS SESSION THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS<br />
COMMISSION BILL, THE RAILWAYS ( SOUTH AUSTRALIA) BILL AND THE<br />
RAILWAYS ( TASMANIA) BILL HAVE BEEN PASSED, FOLLOWING<br />
APPROPRIATE LEGISLATION IN THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN AND<br />
TASMANIAN PARLIAMENTS THEY WILL ALLOW THE TRANSFER OF<br />
THE NON-METROPOLITAN SOUTH AUSTRALIAN AND THE TASMANIAN<br />
RAILWAYS TO THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, THIS IS THE<br />
FIRST MAJOR STEP TOWARD THE CREATION OF A TRULY NATIONAL<br />
RAILWAY. THE ANR WILL HAVE THE ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE<br />
AND OPERATIONAL POWERS NECESSARY TO CONSOLIDATE INTO A<br />
SINGLE SYSTEM THE COMMONWEALTH RAILWAYS AND THE<br />
TRANSFERRED STATE RAILWAYS, ,, 1/ 9 </p>
<p>-9-<br />
WE HAVE DONE MUCH TO RELIEVE THE SHORT-TERM<br />
PROBLEMS OF RAILWAYS, THERE IS A DESPERATE LACK OF<br />
MODERN INTERSYSTEM ROLLING STOCK, WE HAVE INSTITUTED<br />
A PROGRAM TO PURCHASE MODERN HIGH-SPEED WAGONS WHICH<br />
WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR LEASE TO THE STATES, THIS PROGRAM<br />
PROVIDES FOR THE PURCHASE OF 1,300 WAGONS OVER THE<br />
NEXT TWO YEARS, CONTRACTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN LET FOR<br />
THE FIRST ORDER FOR 500 WAGONS; TENDER DOCUMENTS<br />
ARE BEING PREPARED. FOR AN ADDITIONAL 800 VEHICLES,<br />
AND FINALLY, TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF MOULDING A TRULY<br />
NATIONAL TRANSPORT SYSTEM INCLUDING THE RAILWAYS AND<br />
OTHER FORMS OF TRANSPORT WE.: HAVE SOUGHT TO RESTORE<br />
THE INTER-STATE COMMISSION SPECIFIED IN SECTION 101 OF<br />
THE CONSTITUTION, </p>
<p>Two OTHER ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE PRESENT SESSION<br />
REFLECT SOMETHING OF THE GOVERNMENT'S FUNDAMENTAL<br />
SOCIAL AND HUMAN PRIORITIES. THE FAMILY LAW BILL<br />
A MONUMENT TO THE FORMER ATTORNEY-GENERAL, NOW<br />
MR JUSTICE MURPHY HAS COMPLETELY REFURBISHED THE<br />
MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE LAWS OF AUSTRALIA AND DONE<br />
AWAY WITH THE MEDIEVAL CONCEPTS OF GUILT AND FAULT.<br />
THE BILL HAS ESTABLISHED A FAMILY COURT OF AUSTRALIA<br />
WHICH WILL EXPLORE METHODS OF RECONCILIATION AND PROTECT<br />
THE RIGHTS OF ALL PARTIES IN DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS IN AN<br />
ATMOSPHERE OF DIGNITY AND HUMANITY. THIS WAS A<br />
MAJOR SOCIAL REFORM, I AM PROUD THAT IT WAS BROUGHT<br />
FORWARD UNDER THIS GOVERNMENT. IN THE SAME SPIRIT WE<br />
INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO ESTABLISH A CHILDREN'S COMMISSION.<br />
THAT LEGISLATION HAS NOW PASSED BOTH HOUSES. THE<br />
COMMISSION WILL ADMINISTER A COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF<br />
SERVICES FOR CHILDREN PRE-SCHOOL, DAY CARE, PART-TIME<br />
AND EMERGENCY CARE SERVICES, AFTER SCHOOL AND HOLIDAY<br />
PROJECTS. APPROXIMATELY 165,000 CHILDREN HAVE BEEN<br />
CATERED FOR UNDER THIS NEW PROGRAM. I dil </p>
<p>-11-<br />
THE DOCUMENTS I SHALL PRESENTLY TABLE AND<br />
SEEK LEAVE TO INCORPORATE IN HANSARD SET OUT THE FULL<br />
SCOPE AND DETAIL OF THE GOVERNMENT' S ACHIEVEMENTS<br />
DURING THE PAST SIX MONTHS. THAT RECORD SPEAKS FOR<br />
ITSELF. W4HAT IT DOES NOT CONVEY IS THE TRUE NATURE<br />
OF THE OPPOSITION'S BEHAVIOUR IN THIS PERIOD. IT<br />
WOULD BE PLEASING TO BE ABLE TO REPORT THAT THE<br />
OPPOSITION'S NEW DECORUM IN THIS PLACE HAS BEEN MATCHED<br />
BY SANER AND MORE CONCILIATORY ATTITUDES TO THE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM. WE HAVE HAD NOTHING<br />
OF THE SORT. BEHIND THE FACADE OF REASON AND<br />
RESPONSIBILITY THE FAMILIAR CAMPAIGN OF OBSTRUCTION<br />
HAS CONTINUED. OUR OVERDUE REDISTRIBUTION PROPOSALS,<br />
OUR BILL TO MODERNISE AND SIMPLIFY THE ELECTORAL LAWS,<br />
OUR BILLS TO ABOLISH APPEALS TO THE PRIVY COUNCIL,<br />
TO ESTABLISH A SUPERIOR COURT OF AUSTRALIA, TO DEAL<br />
WITH LURKS AND MALPRACTICE IN THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY,<br />
TO ESTABLISH A GOVERNMENT PURCHASING COMMISSION, TO PROVIDE<br />
SIMULTANEOUS ELECTIONS FOR THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF<br />
REPRESENTATIVES ALL THESE HAVE BEEN REJECTED OR<br />
DELAYED OR UNACCEPTABLY AMENDED IN THE SENATE. AND OF<br />
COURSE THE CAMPAIGN OF OBSTRUCTION HAS BEEN PURSUED<br />
BEYOND THIS PARLIAMENT IN THE COURTS AND IN THE STATES.<br />
ONCE AGAIN WE SAW THE FLAUNTING OF AN ESTABLISHED<br />
CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION WHEN THE N. S. W. GOVERNMENT<br />
REFUSED TO APPOINT A SENATOR OF THE GOVERNMENT PARTY TO<br />
FILL THE VACANCY CAUSED BY SENATOR MURPHY'S RESIGNATION. </p>
<p>-12-<br />
WE HAVE SEEN THE SAME STATE GOVERNMENT PURSUE ITS<br />
PELLIFOGGING TACTICS IN BLOCKING APPOINTMENTS* TO<br />
FEDERAL BODIES AND REFUSING TO CO-OPERATE IN SUCH<br />
THINGS AS A SOIL CONSERVATION PROGRAM, WE HAVE<br />
SEEN OUR LEGISLATION PERSISTENTLY CHALLENGED IN THE<br />
COURTS ESPECIALLY THOSE PARTS OF IT MOST LIKELY<br />
TO BENEFIT THE WEAK, THE UNORGANISED, THE<br />
UNREPRESENTED SECTIONS OF SOCIETY,<br />
I LEAVE THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE TO JUDGE THESE<br />
TACTICS FOR THEMSELVES, THEY WILL NOT DETER US FROM<br />
OUR GOALS. THE PAST SIX MONTHS HAVE SHOWN WHAT A<br />
DETERMINED GOVERNMENT CAN ACHIEVE IN THE FACE OF<br />
SENSELESS AND SUSTAINED OBSTRUCTION. DESPITE OUR<br />
DIFFICULTIES IN THE SENATE, DESPITE THE BLIND UNREASON<br />
OF THE ANTI-LABOR STATES, DESPITE THE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS<br />
WITH WHICH EVERY NATION HAS TO CONTEND, WE HAVE BROUGHT<br />
NEW AND PERMANENT REFORMS TO THE STATUTE BOOKS OF<br />
THE NATION; WE HAVE CONTINUED TO ENHANCE AUSTRALIA'S<br />
STANDING IN THE WORLD; WE HAVE PRODUCED A SOCIETY<br />
WHICH HAS NEVER ENJOYED GREATER INDIVIDUAL<br />
PROSPERITY, GREATER OPPORTUNITIES OR GREATER PROSPECTS<br />
FOR THE FUTURE, </p>
