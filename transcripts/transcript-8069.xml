PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, LE LAGON HOTEL, VANUATU<br />
29 JULY 1990<br />
9 OE PROOF ONLy<br />
JOURNALIST:. Mr Hawke, have the Pacific leaders got any need<br />
to worry about Johnston-Atoll?<br />
PM: I think they should obviously ha ve a concern about it<br />
and those concerns ought to be addressed,, as I think they<br />
will be., in discussion at the Forum. I have had a number of<br />
Our scientific experts look at this issue and I'll be<br />
sharing those opinions with my colleagues.<br />
JOURNALIST: *. topic dominate the discussions today-<br />
PK:. No, it certainly didn't dominate the discussion. By no<br />
mans. JOURNALIST: But how worried were the leaders<br />
PM: They expressed-their concerns. They were perfectly<br />
entitled. They should raise questions. I hope that in some<br />
way we'll be able to allay-some of those concerns out of the<br />
scientific opinions that have been provided to me. But as I<br />
say, I don't want to go into those in detail until I've<br />
discussed them under the appropriate heading in the meeting<br />
. with my colleagues.<br />
JOURNALIST: How confident are you there will be a<br />
compromise on the Johnston Atoll issue?<br />
PM: What do you mean a compromise? Do you think we're<br />
going to launch an attack on the Americans?<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you see Australia as being a go-between<br />
between America and the FICs?<br />
PM: No, I don'* t see that as the role of Australia to be a<br />
go-between. I think the role of Australia is to provide our<br />
colleagues with the information that we've got. obviously<br />
Australia has a scientific capacity that is not available to<br />
our friends. Its going to place that material fully before<br />
them and share with them the material that I have.<br />
JOURNALIST: So you're going to distribute the report?<br />
PM: Well just how I will do it will be a matter for me.<br />
I'll certainly either read it all out to them or give them </p>
<p>the copies of it to see. In the meeting I will certainly<br />
fully share it with them.<br />
JOURNALIST: What are the other issues likely to come up?<br />
PM:-Well environmnental issues are obviously important.<br />
Generally I think they'll want to talk about the New Zealand<br />
initiative. our friends from New Zealand are wanting to put<br />
some additional money into SPREP, the South Pacific Regional<br />
Environmental Program. We'll be able to report on the<br />
progress that we are making with the initiative I undertook<br />
two years ago to provide monitoring stations in the region<br />
to look at what is happening to sea levels, which is an<br />
important topic for our friends in this region. so<br />
environmental matters will be important. And I would think<br />
also there'll be some discussion about New Caledonia not I<br />
think a dominating discussion but we want to make sure that<br />
in the United Nations again this year that we can get a<br />
common position on that. Thatfil be a matter for some<br />
discussion. JOURNALIST: of New Caledonia you've got some, well, a<br />
meeting that you're probably not going to look forward to<br />
with Michael Mansell who's here claiming<br />
PM: What meeting an I having with Michael Mansell? You've<br />
got news I haven't got mate.<br />
JOURNALIST: He's here and he wants to<br />
PH: Well he won't be seeing me I can tell you that.<br />
JOURNALIST:* He's seeking recognition that<br />
PM: Look, don't let's get excited about Mr Mansell. You<br />
know what he represents and that's zilch.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does he have the potential to embarrass you<br />
here though?<br />
PM: Do I look embarrassed comrade?<br />
JOURNALIST: He wants to be recognised by the Forum as a<br />
member government representative<br />
PM: Look, it is Sunday and I think you shouldn't joke too<br />
much on the Sabbath. it's not proper.<br />
JOURNALIST: Has he got any right at all to<br />
PM: He's got a right to be here. But he's got no right to<br />
claim to represent anyone other than Michael Mansell.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, when you see Nauru will you be<br />
asking them to reconsider their bid for international court<br />
action, sort of justice action, compensation for the mining<br />
7 </p>
<p>3<br />
PH: It's up to Nauru as to whether they want to pursue<br />
their action in an International Court of Justice. I thiljc,<br />
as is so often the case in these matters, the only people<br />
who will. prosper out of that are the lawyers. They never<br />
miss out.<br />
JOURNALIST: You don't see. Australia as being, should hand<br />
over any money at all in that matter?<br />
PH: if they want to proceed with that matter in the<br />
International Court of Justice wie will fight that<br />
vigorously. But that won't affect our determination to try<br />
and assist that country because their phosphate supplies<br />
will run out in four to five years, seems to be the<br />
estimate. I believe we've got some obligation within our<br />
general approach of assistance in the South Pacific region<br />
to try arnd help them to deal with those problems. But<br />
that's a matter entirely independent of their action in the<br />
IcJ.<br />
ends </p>
