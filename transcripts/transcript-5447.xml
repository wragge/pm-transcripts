AUSTRALIAt, 1-<br />
D&gt; 0M !; W01(<br />
PRIME MINISTER ( j A~<br />
FOR MEDIA FRIDAY 19 SEPTEMBER<br />
THE AUSTRALIA CENTRE IN NEW-YORK<br />
The Prime Minister, The Rt Hon. Malcolm Fraser,<br />
announced today that the Australian Government will establish<br />
an Australian Centre in New York.<br />
The Centre will be located in a prestige highrise<br />
building now under construction at the corner of Third Avenue<br />
and 48th Street, Manhattan.<br />
It will accommodate both the Australian Consulate-<br />
General in New York and the Australian Mission to the United<br />
Nations which at present are situated in separate locations<br />
in the city. The Prime Minister said that agreement in<br />
principle on this has now been reached and letters of intent<br />
exchanged between the Government, represented by the<br />
Australian Consul-General in New York, Sir Rob~ ert Cotton,<br />
and Mr Robert Kaufman, the principal of the building's<br />
owners, The William Kaufman Organisation Ltd of New York.<br />
The William Kaufman Organisation Ltd is one of<br />
New York city's major builders. It currently ovrn and<br />
operates nine highrise office buildings in the city, four<br />
of which are on Third Avenue.<br />
The agreement followed many months of negotiations<br />
by Sir Robert on behalf of the Australian Government. The.<br />
Secretary of the Department of Administrative Services,<br />
M~ r Peter Lawler, and the Assistant Secretary of the Departmentis<br />
Over.-3es Branch, Mr A. A. Hillier, visited New York last<br />
April -to take part in the negotiations. 99~~ 4( 14, </p>

Mr Fraser said the decision to lease part of the<br />
Third Avenue 48th Street building followed detailed<br />
examination of several other options. The site chosen offered<br />
many attractions and advantages for Australia, he said.<br />
The leasing agreement signed would guarantee Australian<br />
Government representatives occupancy rights for up to 80 years.<br />
" This building will provide a unique opportunity<br />
to focus Australian representation in one of the world's<br />
largest cities and most important financial centres, an d<br />
demonstrates Australia's faith in its long-term relations<br />
with the United States", Mr Fraser said.<br />
" It will enable the Australian presence to be<br />
seen ' on the street' and to be visibly identified with all<br />
of the many activities in which Australia is involved in the<br />
United States. " For these reasons we proposed, and the building's<br />
c-, rners agreed, that the building should be nam ed " The<br />
Aus-tralia Centre".<br />
Mr Fraser said the building would be 40 storeys<br />
high, with Australian Government representatives and agencies<br />
occupyin-g the first six floors from street level. The<br />
building would carry the name " Australia Centre" and the<br />
Coat-of-Arms at the street level.<br />
" An op en plaza at Ground floor level would be<br />
one of the design features which would complement the<br />
attractive buildings in the vicinity", Mr Fraser said.<br />
The Consulate-General, administered by the Departnent of Foreign Affairs, includes<br />
representatives of -the Department of Trade and Rtesources,<br />
of the Australian Information Service and of the Departments<br />
of Immigration and' Ethnic Affairs and Business and<br />
Consumer Affairs. </p>
<p>Mr Fraser said that tourism and other aspects<br />
of Australian Government activities would also be able to<br />
be catered for by various authorities concerned which would<br />
be invited to take space in the new building.<br />
State Premiers and Australian Banking and Commercial<br />
interests in New York would be advised by the Government<br />
of its decision so that, if they wished, they could seek<br />
space in what would be a prestige building under Australiats<br />
name. Mr Fraser said that the Government had taken the<br />
view that the site would be very efficient for the purpose<br />
of a total Australian presentation in New York and for the<br />
work at the United Nations Mission.<br />
The existing library at the Consulate-General<br />
in New York is an important and much used research facilitythe<br />
biggest of any overseas post. There was also a large<br />
lending library of Film Australia Productions. The<br />
inclusion of these libraries in the hew Australia Centre<br />
would provide Australian Government officers and the pu blic<br />
easier access to these important information resources.<br />
" Australia intends to further develop its cultural<br />
relations with the United States, and facilities within the<br />
new building would help achieve this," Mr Fraser said.<br />
" For example, provision would be made for atheatrette<br />
where Australian films would be screened, and there would<br />
be provision for exhibitions of Australian paintings,<br />
sculpture and other arts and crafts arranged by the<br />
Government." 1<br />
Mr Fraser said'he expected the Consulate-General<br />
and the U. N. Mission to be operating from the new building<br />
in the third quarter of 1981. He said he had taken a<br />
continuing interest in the matter since it was first i'aised<br />
by Sir Robert Cotton who would be returning to Australia<br />
next year. The Department of Administrative Services, under<br />
the supervision of TIhe H-onourable John McLeay, M. P,,<br />
