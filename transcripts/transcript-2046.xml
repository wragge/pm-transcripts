SECOND TRIP TO THE U. S. 1969<br />
WASHILNGTON<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. JOHN GORTON,<br />
AT THE WHITE HOUSE IDINNER 6 MAY 1969<br />
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
This is a speech, Sir, to which it is very difficult<br />
to reply. I think it is true that there is, between the people of the United<br />
States and the people of my own country, some particular bonds which<br />
are not of recent, birth, but which have matured over the years.<br />
True it is, that in our own country we reached self<br />
government by means of evolution and you by revolution. But nevertheless,<br />
in some degree we think of you as being responsible for us. I know a<br />
lot of other countries do that, too. Because it was only after the<br />
Declaration of Independence and a certain amount of unpleasantness<br />
which culminated at Yorktown following that, that Great Britain looked<br />
to another outlet, if I may put it that way. Put it gave us the first impetus<br />
to the growth of Australia and so perhaps in that indirect way, Sir, you<br />
have helped us in our youth. I<br />
But that was just at the beginning. Since then we have stood<br />
together in many struggles--the First World War, fought far and away<br />
from our shores and yours, but fought for the same reasons, our soldiers<br />
and yours--the Second World War, the Korean War where Australians<br />
were within the first week in action with the United States forces and the<br />
first country so to be in action. And now, the Vietnam War.<br />
I don't know why it is--or perhaps I do--but I am not sure<br />
why it is that when countries talk, as you and I are talking, of the bonds<br />
which unite and have united them, so often one turns to wars and to<br />
struggles in which one has been together. Because, after all, a<br />
successful war does not gain anything new. What it does do, if it is<br />
successful, is prevent the imposition of something bad and obtain an<br />
opportunity for new building upon a proper basis and a proper foundation<br />
of freedom and participation.<br />
Perhaps it is because men have for so long had to struggle,<br />
and probably always will have to struggle, against the idea of absolute<br />
and arbitrary power; against the idea of the secret police and the<br />
hangman; against the philosophy that in order to be free and live in peace<br />
one must subject one's self to the rule--without law--of dictatorship.<br />
Perhaps it is because the fainthearted all through the years have been<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>prepared to say, " if you wish to eat you must sell your immortal soul. If<br />
you wish peace you must submit to dictation. perhaps it is because there<br />
is in the human spirit a refusal to accept this that one talks of nations<br />
standing together in war, not because it is in war, but because of the<br />
objectives sought by such struggles.<br />
You, Sir, are bearing today a burden, greater, I think,<br />
than that borne by any other man in the world I know. And in a way, here,<br />
history is repeating itself because as I look up there and see a former<br />
Republican-I hope no Democrats will be upset-I see a former Republican<br />
looking down upon us, my mind goes back to those times and that burden<br />
and the turmoil in this country in that period.<br />
Too often do we now look back at Lincoln and tend to think<br />
the speeches he made were well received and tend to think the ideals<br />
he professed were accepted by all the people of the United States. But<br />
not enough do we look back and think of the burden for five long years he<br />
bore during a period when the United States lost more dead than it has<br />
in the many wars since. And hie bore this.<br />
During a period when Copperheads were inciting riots in<br />
order to bring peace and not allow the war to continue; during the period<br />
when the Horace Greeleys and others of the press were attacking not only<br />
his ideas, but him personally; during the period when regiments from<br />
the army of the Potomac had to be brought back to quell draft riots in New<br />
York--that was a burden. But if it had not been carried by the man there<br />
would be no United States today. There would have been, at any rate, a<br />
slave autocracy of the South and what that, in junction with South America,<br />
could then have lead to in the world no-one can tell. But there would have<br />
been no United States.<br />
And so the bearing of these burdens and the successful<br />
consummation of these struggles is something which is not for that time<br />
alone or for this time alone, but which, having been successful in that<br />
time, led to the United States being able to be what it is today, and which,<br />
if it is successful in this time, will lead to there being able to be<br />
throughout the world an opportunity for us, when we next speak, when<br />
we next meet, or at least communicate or whatever it may be, to talk not<br />
of war but of the other progress which is the other part of which you spoke,<br />
Sir, of which the United States and ourselves, you helping us economically,<br />
building us, helping us to build ourselves, the other part may be the real<br />
outcome of successful resistance to aggression. I think it will be.<br />
I think that we will stand together in the future as we have<br />
in the past, the great, the small, the comparatively small, but fired by<br />
the same motives, inspired by the same ideas, resolute in the same way.<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
I hope that this will be true. It has been true and I believe<br />
it will be true. And for our part, speaking for Australians, wherever the<br />
United States is resisting aggre-sinn, wherever the United States or the<br />
United Kingdom or any other country is seeking to ensure that there will<br />
be a chance for the free expression of the spirit of man from himself and<br />
not from dictatorship; wherever there is a joint attempt to improve not<br />
only the material but the spiritual standards of life of the peoples of the<br />
world, then, Sir, we will go Waltzing Matilda with you. </p>
