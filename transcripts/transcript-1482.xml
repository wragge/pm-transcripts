NEW ZEALAND TOUR 1967<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. HAROLD<br />
HOLT, ON ARRIVAL AT WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND 2ND FEBRUARY, 1967<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
I bring to you a very warm and friendly greeting to you,<br />
Prime Minister, to your Government, and to the people of New Zealand<br />
from the Government and people of Australia.<br />
I am sure there is in my own country a strengthening<br />
feeling that our two countries should be closer together in terms of<br />
physical contact, in our policies, and in the mutual beneficial trade that can<br />
develop between us, and as I made in my first year of office visits to our own<br />
Forces abroad, I felt that my next priority, having got our Prime Ministers'<br />
Conferen ce and the Manila Conference and matters of that sort, in which<br />
both your Prime Minister and I were directly and personally involved, that<br />
high on the list of priorities indeed, the first journey of the year in this<br />
year after re-election should be a visit to New Zealand. I was delighted<br />
to accept the invitation which my old friend, your Prime Minister, Keith<br />
Holyoake, extended to me.<br />
My wife has had the most fleeting contact only with New<br />
Zealand. S" he was on a journey to America and had lunch in Auckland, I<br />
think, some years ago. It is sixteen years since I was here, leading the<br />
Australian delegation to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference at<br />
Wellington.<br />
( Mr. Holyoake: Too long.)<br />
It is much too long, as you say, Keith. I think one of<br />
the reasons why you have not seen more of Australian Prime Ministers is<br />
that we do meet, and my predecessor did meet with you frequently, at the<br />
Prime Ministers' Conferences abroad and at other g atherings of that sort,<br />
but there is no substitute, if one wishes to understand a country and get to<br />
know it, for the physical contact with the people and with the country. I<br />
think I have learned more about New Zealand in the last seven days as I<br />
tried to brief myself on what I might find here and on what we might discuss<br />
here than I have learned in all the earlier years I have had in public life.<br />
And there have been some very interecsting revelations for me coming from<br />
that. I knew that we had won Davis Cups together. I did not realise that<br />
the first time we ever won a Davis Cup was an Anzac combination, or<br />
before there was an Anzac in those days in 1907, and I learned too<br />
( Mr. Holyoake I will have to learn this, too)<br />
Oh, yes, Norman Brookes and Wilding. They were a<br />
very successful combination. I learned, too, that your cadets and this<br />
is one reason why I would have been glad to see your guard of honour<br />
your cadets have so frequently won the sword of honour at Duntroon. And<br />
this year at the Officer Cadet School at Portsea where I have a seaside house,<br />
my wife tells me that two New Zealanders were the two senior boys in that<br />
particular year, one getting the sword of honour and the other the Queen's<br />
Medal. So that we respect you not only as worthy friends but as worthy / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
competitors il ields of sport~ aiid other areas where we come into contact<br />
one with the other.-I amDooking forward tremendously to this visit and learning<br />
more about your beautiful country, having talks which will be of value I am<br />
sure to us all, with your Prime Minister and Members of his Cabinet. And<br />
I am quite sure that this visit will be fruitful for all the purposes that I<br />
expect from it, and that with so much in common to serve, that our joint<br />
interests can be assisted by interchanges of this kind.<br />
My colleague, the Deputy Prime Minister, will be with you<br />
quite shortly for the periodical discussions on trade matters, and I would<br />
hope that my own visit is itself a symptom of a desire for much more<br />
frequent exchanges at all levels of Government between our two countries.<br />
MR. HOLYOAKE: I would just say briefly I am not going to make a speech<br />
unfortunately the weather has upset the earlier arrangements but again<br />
a very warm personal welcome, Harold, and I know you know we are so<br />
close. You know New Zealanders very well, but it is grand you should<br />
have this opportunity of meeting them and getting to know them on their own<br />
ground. With those few words, I warmly re-echo our welcome.<br />
