IPRESS STATEMENT NO. 314<br />

AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL GALLERY ACQUISITIONS COMMITTEE<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, today announced<br />
that the activities of the Australian National Gallery<br />
Acquisitions Committee would wind down shortly with the<br />
appointment of an Interim Council to take over all Gallery<br />
affairs. The Acquisitions Committee has comprised:<br />
Mr. James Gleeson ( Sydney), Chairman<br />
Mr. Leonard French ( Melbourne)<br />
Mr. Clifford Last ( Melbourne)<br />
Mr. James Mollison ( Canberra)<br />
Mr. Fred Williams ( Melbourne)<br />
Over the last 18 months the Committee has been<br />
responsible for all recommendations on acquisitions for the<br />
National Gallery, including Jackson Pollock's " Blue Poles"<br />
and many other important works of art.<br />
The Committee initiated a new era in the history<br />
of public collecting in Australia, particularly of world-wide<br />
modern and contemporary art.<br />
The Australian Government is appreciative of the<br />
individual and collective contributions. of members of the<br />
Committee which it believes constitute an important step<br />
towards the creation of what it is hoped may become one of<br />
the great collections of the twentieth century.<br />
