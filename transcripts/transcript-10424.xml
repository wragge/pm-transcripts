    <content><![CDATA[<p>I will be visiting the Hunter Region on Wednesday and Thursday of this week. The main purpose of my visit is to hold meetings with the local community on plans for dealing with the closure of the BHP steelworks in 1999.</p>
<p>The visit will include an inspection of the BHP plant and consultations with representatives from the union movement and the company.</p>
<p>I will also be convening the first meeting of a high level Taskforce of local community representatives which is advising me on social impacts of BHP's decision.</p>
<p>My visit follows earlier meetings involving Federal Government Ministers and signals the Coalition's determination to support local efforts to adjust and build a better future for the region.</p>
<p>While in the region I will also take the opportunity to visit the proposed site for the British Aerospace Lead-In Fighter project which will bring 150-200 new jobs to the region.</p>
<p>14 July 1997</p>
