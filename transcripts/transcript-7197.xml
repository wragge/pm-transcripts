PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 14 July 1987<br />
I have decid ed to recommend to the Governor-General that he<br />
approve major changes to the structure of Commonwealth<br />
administration. He has-agreed to my making an early<br />
announcement of my proposed recommendations. The changes<br />
are aimed at achieving substantial enhancement of the<br />
decision-making process and at removing overlap and<br />
duplication of functions.<br />
in summary, the changes will:-<br />
substantially reduce the number of Commonwealth<br />
departments to achieve administrative efficiencies and<br />
savings, better policy co-ordination and improved budget<br />
processesi enhance ministerial control of departments by moving to<br />
a 2 level ministerial structure, each Cabinet minister<br />
being responsible for one of 16 large portfolios<br />
supported In most cases by one or more non-Cabinet<br />
ministers responsible for specific parts of the Cabinet<br />
minister's portfolio, or assisting across the range. of<br />
functions.<br />
For example, within the portfolio of the Minister for<br />
Foreign Affairs and Trade there will be a Minister with<br />
specific responsibilities for Trade Ne oti at ions and within<br />
the Community Services and Health port olio there will be<br />
Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs and Veterans' Affairs. As<br />
I promised before and during the election campaign, there<br />
will continue to be a. separate department of Veterans'<br />
Affairs the only Department additional to the 16 portfolio<br />
structure. The total size of the ministry will be 30 of<br />
which 16 will be Cabinet ministers.<br />
These changes reflect the results of a comprehensive review<br />
of the structure of government and the government's<br />
perception that there is room for substantial streamlining<br />
of the administrative machinery. The new structure will, as<br />
I have said, reduce overlap and duplication. it will also<br />
ensure that all portfolio, interests are represented in a<br />
Cabinet that is of manageable size; will provide the<br />
opportunity for Improved budgetary and corporate management<br />
processes; will provide savings from economies of scale; and<br />
will introduce broader perspectives within portfolios<br />
without reducing the necessary impact of particular<br />
Interests. miost importantly, the new structure reflects and<br />
is attuned to the national policy imperatives which must<br />
command our attention at the present time and In the'longer<br />
term. 0) 28 </p>
<p>Division of responsibilities within portfolios Is something<br />
about which I will write to each minister when the ministry<br />
is decided and I allocate portfolios after the Caucus<br />
meeting. Subject to the special arrangements referred to<br />
above in the Veterans' Affairs area, what I intend is that<br />
the Cabinet ninister would have overall responsibility for<br />
the portfolio and would represent it in Cabinet, although<br />
non-Cabinet ministers will take to Cabinet submissions on<br />
matters in their specified areas of responsibility. The<br />
Cabinet minister will have the power to determine matters in<br />
dispute within the portfolio but will of course, involve the<br />
other ministarc in corporate management and policy<br />
development. Xn Parliament, the Cabinet minister will be<br />
ultimately accountable on major policy matters although the<br />
non-Cabinet ainistors will take day to day responsibility<br />
for their own treas including answering qestions and<br />
developing and steering through legislation.<br />
So far as departmental operations are concerned, in most<br />
cases there will be a portfolio secretary advising the<br />
Cabinet Minister on the range of matters within the<br />
portfolio. within most portfolios there will also be one or<br />
more associate secretaries to carry responsibility in<br />
particular areas.<br />
Some notable features of the new structure Include:<br />
consolidation of exporteprmotion of commodities and<br />
manufactures with the relevant domestic industry<br />
departmenti ( Industry, Technology and Commerce and<br />
Primary industries and Energy), with the Minister for<br />
Foreign Affairs having responsibility for bilateral and<br />
multilateral trade negotiations, thus emphasising the<br />
central importance of trade to our foreign relations.<br />
There will also be a minister for Trade Negotiations who<br />
will play a key role, assisting the Minister for Foreign<br />
Affairs and Trade and the industry ministers;<br />
amalgamation of the 2 major portfolios with<br />
responsibility for education and training and the labour<br />
market into a Department of Education, Employment and<br />
Training. This will ensure better co-ordination of<br />
education policies, in particular TAFE and school<br />
retention policies with labour market requirements,<br />
including training policy. There will be a separate<br />
industrial relations portfolio. The minister for<br />
industrial Relations will play a role of particular<br />
importance in the Industrial relations aspects of the<br />
restructuring of manufacturing Industry which is such an<br />
essential element of our medium term economic<br />
developmentl the Attorney-General will have overall responsibility<br />
for law enforcement functions hitherto handled by the<br />
Special Hin~ Ister of State; 0 0 to) 8 </p>
<p>there will be a broadly based community services and<br />
health portfolio with responsibility for health policy,<br />
community services and housing assistance with a<br />
separate department of veterans, Affairs and a statutory<br />
commission responsible for Aboriginal Affairs which wili<br />
be created as soon as new arrangements can be put in<br />
place. There will be separate Ministers for Veterans'<br />
Affairs and Aboriginal Affairs;<br />
the 3 departments with major infrastructure<br />
responsibilities Transport# Aviation and<br />
Communications will be brought together under one<br />
Cabinet minister, thus improving the coherence of policy<br />
making in this critical area;<br />
the related elements of the existing departments of<br />
Arts, Heritage and Environment, Sport, Recreation and<br />
Tourism and Territories will be amalgamated in one<br />
portfolio of Arts, Sport, Environment and Tourism.<br />
There will be a separate Capital Territory office within<br />
the portfolio;<br />
Most Government common services will be combined in. one<br />
department with a clear mandate to implement devolution<br />
of services to departments and economic char in<br />
policies and practices in line with, In particular, the<br />
recommendations of Mr David Block's Efficiency Scrutiny<br />
Unit.<br />
Althou h the primary impetus for these fundamental changes<br />
is efficiency and the better delivery of government<br />
services, there will be substantial savings arising from<br />
amalgamations, through economies of scale and the removal of<br />
duplication. These arrangements are estimated to result in<br />
staff savings in a full year of some 3,000 positions, which<br />
the Government has directed should be achieved through a<br />
process of attrition or'voluntary action on the part of<br />
employees. There will be no compulsory retrenchment. 0 This<br />
would result in savings of about $ 96 million In a full year.<br />
There should be si gnif i-, ant savings in the current year<br />
these will be sett led in the course of the budget process.<br />
The Government has accepted the recommendations of the<br />
report of the Efficiency Scrutiny Unit headed by David Block<br />
on proposed successor arrangements to the Public Service<br />
Board. The Efficiency Scrutiny Unit has recommended that<br />
the Public Service Board be abolished and that<br />
responsibility for its . existing functions be allocated as<br />
fol 1owst all operational aspects of personnel matters to be<br />
devolved to departments;<br />
public service arbitration, pay and conditions matters<br />
to be transferred to the Department of industrial<br />
Relations; classification issues to be transferred to the<br />
Department of Finance; and 00028 -1 </p>
<p>management improvement programs to be devolved to<br />
departmentG with the Department of Finance maintaining a<br />
small unit In the area of program budgeting.<br />
The Efficiency Scrutiny Unit has recommended that a Public<br />
Service Commission be established as the successor to the<br />
Board with independent statutory responsibility for the<br />
policy aspects of recruitment, promotion, mobility,<br />
discipline and retirement.. it would be headed by a single<br />
full-time Public Service Commissioner. The Merit Protection<br />
and Review Agency will be retained as a separate body.<br />
The Government has accepted these recommendations on the<br />
basis that they will eliminate duplications of functions<br />
while ensuring resource savings over time.<br />
implementation of the Efficiency Scrutiny Unit findings will<br />
ensure that public service reform initiatives and other<br />
essential functions of the Board are maintained at least at<br />
the same standaird.<br />
David Block will continue to work as a consultant to the<br />
Prime Minister and the Government on effective management in<br />
the public sector. The program of efficiency scrutinie<br />
will continue, but run by individual Departments. Mr Block<br />
will be turning his attention to broader issues of public<br />
service management including the following matters on which<br />
I have asked himi to report:<br />
the benefits of bringing together the Social Security<br />
and CES notw~ orks;<br />
the prospect of using the Department of Social Security<br />
more widely as a payments agency;<br />
the scope for devolving and making more businesslike the<br />
provision of common services ( where he will offer<br />
assistance to the Minister for Administrative Services<br />
in particular) I<br />
the case for a single foreign service; and<br />
the on-going role of the National Capital Development<br />
Commission, In the context of moves towards enhanced<br />
municipal government In the ACT.<br />
He will also be involved in the review -of local government<br />
financing and devolution of programs to local government<br />
( which I referred to in the election campaign), and in<br />
advising on the process of assets sales by the Government.<br />
I also foreshadow that I will be recommending to the<br />
Governor-General that Mr Block be appointed to the proposed<br />
part-time board of the Public Service Commission. 0 0-0 23 </p>
<p>The Minister for Industrial Relations will chair a Committee<br />
of Ministers with overall responsibility for co-ordinating<br />
the various measures to enhance the efficiency and<br />
effectiveness of the public service, including those<br />
announced today.<br />
Further details ( including the duties of the remaining<br />
non-Cabinet Ministers) will be announced following the<br />
swearing-in of the new Ministry next week, and a full<br />
