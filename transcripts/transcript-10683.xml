    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How far advanced is your tax package</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we've done a lot of work on it and it will be a fair go</p>
<p> for all Australians. It will remove the unfairness and the inequity</p>
<p> of the present system and there will be, of course, significant personal</p>
<p> tax cuts. And it will be a pro-business tax policy that will boost</p>
<p> the export performance of Australian business.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How far before the election will you release the details?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Adequately.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think an election campaign is the right time to be discussing</p>
<p> a serious and complicated subject like taxation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We will release it adequately before the next election.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>With exports and jobs threatened, is it time for the Government to</p>
<p> step in and settle this issue?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The threat to exports and jobs is coming from the behaviour of the</p>
<p> MUA now as it has come from the behaviour from the MUA in the past.</p>
<p> This issue is all about boosting jobs and exports by removing uncompetitive</p>
<p> practices from the waterfront. If the MUA had cooperated to do that,</p>
<p> this whole thing would not have arisen.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you have any plans for tackling the loss of jobs in the Upper Hunter</p>
<p> mining and power generating industries?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it would help if the New South Wales Government got off its tail</p>
<p> and helped in relation to Redbank, I've made Commonwealth money</p>
<p> available. One thousand jobs can be created and I call on Mr Carr</p>
<p> to do something in relation to the electricity authority to ensure</p>
<p> that Redbank can go ahead.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>With (inaudible) backing Malaysia's vote of Australia, is it</p>
<p> time to reassess our relationship with Indonesia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it's not a time to reassess the relationship but I make no</p>
<p> bones about the fact that it's a relationship that's (inaudible)</p>
<p> on mutual respect and if Indonesia does something that I don't</p>
<p> approve of, well, I make it known. I ought to make it clear though</p>
<p> that membership of ASEM is not the most important pebble on the foreign</p>
<p> policy beach. It'd be nice to be part of it but we are not going</p>
<p> to lose any sleep if we don't (inaudible), but we had a view</p>
<p> to put and now that that view has become public, I certainly don't</p>
<p> walk away from it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Jeff Kennett says hundreds and thousands of jobs might go if the waterfront</p>
<p> dispute continues? Do you think that's a possibility?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Who said that?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Jeff Kennett.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well certainly the MUA by continuing to deny the release of produce</p>
<p> that has been landed in Australia is overriding the situation. I mean</p>
<p> those people of Toyota, if they're stood down, that will be the</p>
<p> direct result of behaviour in the MUA.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On tax, Prime Minister, will you be accepting (inaudible) as a fait</p>
<p> accompli?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We will be releasing a tax policy in accordance with the principles</p>
<p> I laid down in August of last year.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Does it concern you that MUA protestors seem to be following you around?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What can you offer the people of the Hunter leading into the next</p>
<p> election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I can remind them, I can offer them a continuation of the low</p>
<p> interest rates that my Government has delivered. And we've delivered</p>
<p> the lowest interest rates in 30 years and I can tell them the truth</p>
<p> and that is that if Kim Beazley becomes Prime Minister, interest rates</p>
<p> will go up again because Kim Beazley is a big spender.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can you tell us what your plans are for a GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We'll be releasing our tax policy in accordance with the principles</p>
<p> I laid down in August of last year.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>With cargo stranded on the wharves, is it time to get the troops (inaudible)</p>
<p> in this dispute?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The only two governments in Australia's history that have used</p>
<p> troops in an industrial dispute have been Labor governments. It is</p>
<p> not a precedent I desire to follow.</p>
