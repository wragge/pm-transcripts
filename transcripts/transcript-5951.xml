AS DELIVERED<br />
AUSRL<br />
FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 27 OCTOBER 1982<br />
ADDRESS TO THE NATIONAL FARMERS FEDERATION, CANBERRA<br />
Thank you very much for the invitation to be with you this<br />
morning and to open this conference of the National Farmers<br />
Federation. I would like to congratulate you on having<br />
if not reached, nearly reached your target of the construction<br />
of your own national headquarters. It is an objective<br />
which farmers' organisations have looked forward to for a very<br />
long while and to know that it is now very close to reality<br />
must be encouraging indeed.<br />
The National Farmers Federation can take a good deal of pride<br />
in the way it has represented the interests of the farming<br />
and pastoral community in the relatively few years since the<br />
foundation of the Federation. An amalgamation of old and<br />
historically experienced organisations into one was not a<br />
particularly easy task, but it is one that has been encompassed<br />
well, effectively and generally with the interests of Australian<br />
farmers. I wish the organisation all good fortune in the<br />
future.<br />
The work that it will have to do, the policies that it will need<br />
to advocate-are going to be all the more important in the<br />
period ahead of us. Most people here are practical farmers,<br />
so there is no need to emphasise the difficulties of the<br />
present circumstances, but they are real and they are<br />
substantial. It is going.. to take wise and sensible leadership<br />
to make sure that the industries come through as-strongly<br />
based as possible and as well able as possible to take advantage<br />
of a break in the drought when it does come.<br />
The importance of agriculture to Australia does not need<br />
emphasising. It has formed the foundation and the base of the<br />
Australian economy for a very, very long while and there have<br />
been occasions when people have said farm exports are not going<br />
to be so important over the next decade because something<br />
has been happening in iron ore or coal or other minerals.<br />
After the first flush of that kind'of euphoria is passed by,<br />
people come back to recognising that the export income earned<br />
by Australia's farmers and pastoralists is really just as<br />
important to this country for the maintenance of living<br />
standards right around Australia as it ever was. Whether<br />
it is 40% or 50% of Australia's export earnings, the product<br />
of Australian farmers have been there to provide a base<br />
in which other. exports and other commrodities can build, but<br />
without the contribution of Australia's farms and properties,<br />
Australia would be in a very difficult situation indeed. </p>
<p>F--2<br />
We well know that there are many current difficulties not only<br />
caused by drought. The present world downturn which has gone<br />
on longer, is a deeper recession than any that we have known<br />
since the 1930s, certainly since the end of the war is<br />
having its impact on the prices for our commodities. There<br />
is stagnant trade. There is in many countries a rising<br />
tide of protectionism and it is a major objective of the<br />
Australian initiative. Doug Anthony will be at the = Ta ministerial<br />
meeting to stem that tide and if possibleturn it back. In<br />
addition there are rising costs, rising wages of a kind that<br />
make it very dif ficult indeed. All this is on top of the worst<br />
drought in the living memory of many Australians.<br />
The Government has obviously been concerned about these<br />
situations. I know when the Budget was first introduced, even<br />
though there were some useful things, wiping off a debt in the<br />
beef industry and of course continuing other policies which I<br />
believe are a significant advantage, income equalisation<br />
deposits to support the Primary Industry Bank and tax<br />
averaging of course, these things go on they tend to be<br />
taken for granted, but they are a very real benefit and<br />
assistance to Australia's rural industries. In spite of that<br />
I know when the Budget was introduced there was a feeling of<br />
has the Government paid adequate recognition to the problems<br />
that farmers are facing today and for the emerging drought,)<br />
I well recall a conversation I had with Peter Nixon when the<br />
budget was fraxned. He asked what we were going to do about<br />
the drought,. I said " How serious is it?" This was in July.<br />
" How serious can you persuade our colleagues that it is in<br />
July?" I think we agreed then that it is much better to wait<br />
a little later till the full seriousness of the drought for<br />
not just farmers or governments, but indeed for the whole<br />
country and that enabled the circumstances to unfold where<br />
we took the decisions which you know about and which I believe<br />
are the most imaginative or most generous in relation to any<br />
drought. Generous, but still necessary because this drought<br />
is more severe than any that I can remember since my childhood<br />
days in the Riverina in the 1930s. There was no drought<br />
assistance in those days, in those years, but I can remember<br />
knocking lambs on the head three years in a row in an effort<br />
to try and save the mother.<br />
That was the year when Carter Brothers, the biggest poultry<br />
farmers of Australia started to buy sheep to be boiled down<br />
for chook feed. I can remember my father hearing about this<br />
and they were being offered about 4 pence a head. Then he<br />
found that they had had so many offers they said if we paid<br />
the freight from Deniliquin to Werribee, they would accept<br />
delivery and take them off our hands. ' That I thought was a<br />
very generous offer.<br />
It is no consolation to know that in different parts of Australia<br />
sheep are being slaughtered, that there is very real hardship,<br />
very real difficulty of a kind that we had hoped we had put<br />
behind us for all time. The Government's policies I believe,<br />
will enable Australia's essential breeding herds to be preserved<br />
and therefore enable farmers to be in a position in which they<br />
can take advantage of relief when the season finally breaks.<br />
NFF / 3 </p>
<p>F--3<br />
There are other things of course which all Australians benefit<br />
from and so the farming and pastoral community also does.<br />
The changes in taxation arrangements, the reduction in taxation<br />
and a number of other measures in the Budget help the farming<br />
community just as much as anyone else. The Australian<br />
Bicentennial Road Development Program is one which is going to<br />
provide I would have thought very great assistance to the rural<br />
community. It is a program that is of benefit to the whole<br />
country. There will be cheaper transport costs,-and I would have<br />
hoped a lesser road toll. Local roads, arterial roads, as<br />
well as national highways are going to be enormously improved<br />
over the five or six years of this program. With an additional<br />
$ 2 billion being spent on road construction we can see a*<br />
revitalisation, an advancement in the quality of Australian<br />
roads which is going to assist farmers and pastoralists in a<br />
very real way right across Australia of a kind that I think<br />
people had only dreamt about before this program was announced.<br />
We believe very much that the Budget does form a basis for<br />
Australians working together and does form a basis for wage<br />
restraint. A single income family with dependent wife and say<br />
two children is about $ 17 to $ 19 better off as a result of<br />
our Budget. If they had to get that from employers, it would<br />
be $ 26 to $ 30 and in many cases that additional wage might<br />
be enough to send the employer bankrupt. Against that background<br />
it has been reasonble to argue for and expect a level of wage<br />
restraint that might otherwise have been difficult to achieve.<br />
There has been some progress in this area. Public sector pay<br />
increases have been from 5% to 7% compared to the 15% or<br />
of last year. The maximum level of restraint is going to be<br />
necessary if the competitive base of Australian industry is<br />
to be restored, not just over the last few months, and not<br />
just for the remainder of this year, but at least for a<br />
couple of years ahead of us and it is going to be difficult.<br />
We are going to need to argue as hard as we can and persuade<br />
as hard as we can. It has not been made much easier when we<br />
go around and say your family is significantly better off as<br />
a result of our Budget and'then Eric Risstrom has demonstrated that<br />
Mr Cain and his Budget ripped most of it back off again.<br />
A family that might have been $ 18 better off as a result of the<br />
Federal Budget is suddenly $ 12 worse off a week as a result of<br />
Mr Cain's Budget. They are Mr Risstrom's figures not mine and<br />
it shows how that Budget at least and the NSW Budget also,<br />
are pulling in opposite directions and making it therefore<br />
more difficult to achieve the level of wage restraint that is<br />
so vital.<br />
The consumer price increase of 3 in September quarter<br />
comes from a variety of factors, but whatever factors we<br />
ascribe it to, whether it is the drawing forward of some increases<br />
that would have otherwise have been in the December quarter,<br />
whether it is because of doing sums differently., whether it is<br />
because of much greater increases in state taxes and charges<br />
hospital charges have gone up in the states 60% over the last<br />
year and some by 40% since June or July and electricity charges<br />
NFF </p>
<p>N-F4Fhave<br />
been up by about 42% over recent periods. These increases<br />
have obviously had an impact on the Consumer Price Index of a<br />
kind that would not have been present in other years.<br />
Overwhelmingly, I believe the greatest part of the increase<br />
has come about as a result of the wages and hours decisions<br />
of last year which have done so much damage not only to<br />
farming and pastoral communities, but to manufacturing industry<br />
and indeed also damage to state and to Federal budgets because<br />
if it had not been for those wage increases, if it had not<br />
been for the shorter hours, state governments would not have<br />
needed to put up their charges anything like as much as they<br />
have. The services component of the CPI went up by a massive<br />
18% and that is nearly all wages. Then a large part of the state<br />
increases in their charges has to be attributed to the impact<br />
of the wages and hours decisions on their budgets. I suspect<br />
the impact of those decisions are not yet fully worked out through<br />
the economy and we are obviously hoping for a better December<br />
figure than we achieved last year, but how much better is going<br />
to depend on the elements in wage increases still to work through<br />
the Australian economy.<br />
These matters are obviously of great concern to us and they would<br />
be to you and they show that in no way can we relax in our<br />
fight against inflation. We have had a very severe setback<br />
in that fight as a result of what happened in the wages front through<br />
last year. We have got to make sure that that kind of thing<br />
does not happen again.<br />
I have already mentioned something about the drought, but I do<br />
not know that too many Australians apart from the farming<br />
community understand that this drought is effecting about<br />
110,000 farms, about 93 million sheep and 13 million beef<br />
cattle. The wheat crop is estimated to be less than 9 million<br />
tonnes compared to over 16 million tonnes in 1981-82. These<br />
figures demonstrate in the starkest possible terms the impact<br />
of the drought on some of Australia's major and most important<br />
industries. It is catastrophic not just for the families directly<br />
concerned, but the country towns, the rural cities and also<br />
for those industries which are dependent and which supply<br />
the rural community and this gets back into the major cities.<br />
So the breaking of the drought, is something that we are all<br />
going to be looking forward to. Unfortunately the weather<br />
maps and the weather patterns do not seem to be particularly<br />
favourable and have not been for many, many months.<br />
Renewed growth in world trade is going to be vital for your<br />
industries Mr President and also for economic recovery in the<br />
OECD area as a whole. There are some things that Australia<br />
can do on its own account and many of these were addressed<br />
in our last Budget. Renewed growth in world trade is of vital<br />
importance for the vigorous and growing Australia that we<br />
want to see. It is worth noting that the in the 150s and 160s<br />
world trade grew by volume by about 8% a year. It was an engine<br />
for growth and progress for rising living standards in' many<br />
countries of the world, developed and developing countries<br />
alike, btt in 1981 world trade contracted for the first time<br />
in over 20 years and it is no wonder that commodity prices<br />
are down and that the situation is dif f4cult.<br />
NFF </p>
<p>I know everyone has been looking for economic recovery in the<br />
United States and we do have to be encouraged by a fall in their<br />
inflation and a fall in their interest rates, but at the same<br />
time Americans you speak to seem to be in two categories. One<br />
is saying right, the recovery has started and seems to be<br />
trying to talk the economy up and others are saying the<br />
economy is bumping along on the bottom. Until the recovery<br />
is evident, until we can see in a hard-headed fashion that<br />
there is real movement in the United States economy, I think<br />
it is wiser not to bank too much on that. The professional<br />
predicters have been saying there will be recovery in-the United<br />
States in six months time, but they have been saying that<br />
now for about 2 years and at sometime if they go on saying it<br />
long enough, they are going to have to be right. I am<br />
not going to join the ranks of those predicters, but I think<br />
we need to watch with a little caution what is happening in<br />
the United States.<br />
I had a discussion with Mr Dalsager yesterday also, I think he<br />
is in no doubt at all about what the Government feels about<br />
the trading policies of the European community. We were talking<br />
about the importance of the GATT ministerial meeting and the<br />
importance of achieving agreement that agricultural trade<br />
should be subject to fair rules of trade in the same way that<br />
manufactured exports are. There was a great betrayal of<br />
agricultural industries outside of Europe when the world<br />
trading arrangements, when the GATT was first developed, because<br />
it was orginally intended that the rules for fair -trade could<br />
cover all trade. But a deal was done because of the demands<br />
of Europe that excluded agriculture and those deals have been<br />
done again and again and again.<br />
We know how much what has happened has affected us. We have<br />
had to find new additional, expanded markets for a whole range<br />
of our products because if you go back to the days when we still<br />
had access to Europe in a reasonable way, beef and veal in<br />
1965 we had 31% of our exports going to the community, now it<br />
is about We had about 58% of our dairy products, it is now<br />
about We had 47% of our sugar and now it is nothing.<br />
We had 12% of our wheat and now that is nothing. That shows<br />
the extent to which their own domestic policies and discriminatory<br />
trading policies have diminished opportunities for Australian<br />
farmers. If it had not been for the new markets in the Pacific<br />
area, in the western Pacific in the newly industrialising<br />
countries, and if it had not been for the capacity and energy<br />
of Australian industries in getting out and selling around the<br />
world, our industries would have been in much greater<br />
difficulty than has in fact been the case.<br />
Those figures demonstrate the need for Australian governments<br />
and Australian ministers for trade, to-continue to press for<br />
fair and reasonable rules of trade. You will know the trade<br />
initiative that we have put forward, it i's multilateral in<br />
its consequences, a holding of levels of protection and no<br />
increasing levels of protection and then a general winding back<br />
of other forms of protection or of export subsidies.. There has<br />
been a good deal of support for Australia from a large number<br />
of countries, from local communities, from ASEAN, from the<br />
Commonwealth Regional Meeting in Fiji and from the United States.<br />
NFF </p>
<p>-6<br />
There is one thing I would like to say in relation to the role of the<br />
USA at the GATT ministerial meeting. I know there are sometimes<br />
discussions between the United States and Europe, and there has<br />
been very vigorous discussion going on over whether or not a<br />
pipeline should be built. That in one sense might be an academic<br />
discussion because it seems to me the Europeans are going ahead<br />
and building it no matter what the United States does. I also<br />
believe that if the United States is absolutely committed and<br />
determined to make sure that agriculture shares in the benefits<br />
of any trade negotiations, to make sure that agriculture is not<br />
allowed to be pushed aside by the European Community as it has<br />
been for decades, then I believe that the United States has the<br />
strength, has the capacity to achieve that kind of result.<br />
They have been working very closely with us. They have been<br />
supporting us and we them in relation to these negotiations.<br />
I know quite well that in the earlier MTN round that there<br />
were agreements with the United States Special Trade Negotiator,<br />
but in the end, the United States believed that it was not<br />
worth pressing Europe as hard as the United States could have.<br />
I suppose I am saying that the United States should have enormous<br />
confidence in its own capacity to achieve an appropriate result.<br />
It should have enormous confidence in its own negotiating strength<br />
if it is supported by other countries such as Australia, and many<br />
others. It should have enormous confidence in its ability to<br />
achieve fair rules for trade and reasonable access in relation<br />
to agricultural products. But unless the United States has its<br />
own inbuilt conviction, unless it is totally determined to<br />
achieve this kind of result, then we will find agriculture<br />
pushed aside once again as it has been ever since the GATT<br />
was formed.<br />
The discussions that I and my colleagues had with Mr Dalsager<br />
last night did not indicate in any sense that it was going to<br />
be an easy discussion or that the Europeans would come around<br />
and say that after decades they were prepared to promote fair<br />
and reasonable rules for trade once again. I don't think it will<br />
be easy at all, but the United States should not underestimate<br />
her own enormous negotiating strength.<br />
There is no doubt that the world trade system does need overhaul.<br />
It is not only agricultural commodities that, are prejudiced.<br />
Opportunities are often prejudiced for developing countries<br />
and I think we in Australia know how well we can benefit from<br />
expanded market opportunities in some countries that have been,<br />
and still are, growing at a rate of about 10% a year, and they<br />
are doing that because of their energy, because they haven't<br />
had their economies put in straight jackets through the subsidisation<br />
of a whole host of industries as has so often been the case in<br />
Europe. There is a lesson in that, because if there can be<br />
more developing countries getting to the stage of economic<br />
takeoff, there are going to be greatly expanded markets for<br />
the products of factories of the Western industrial world.<br />
There will be greater opportunities also for Australia and<br />
Australian exports.<br />
I NFF ./ 7 </p>
<p>N-E7--<br />
The kind of trade initiatives that we have been talking about,<br />
coupled with greater access, a freer flow of world trade, might<br />
be one of the very few positive, forward looking things that can<br />
be done to get the growth of the world economies mroving . in a non-inf lationary<br />
way. I know, we all know, there can be some difficulty in the<br />
immediate process of change and restructuring that would be<br />
necessary in a number of countries, but the question is whether<br />
we are prepared to take the longer view and establish a sound,<br />
solid basis on which market opportunities can expand, and living<br />
standards not only in Australia, but around the world, start to<br />
rise again. There is not a future, as everyone here knows, in<br />
shutting the doors, pulling down the blinds. Some of the arguments<br />
that were put to us last night asked-why we let in Japanese and<br />
Korean steel when it could all be produced by BHP. One of a number<br />
of consequences of that would be that all the users down the<br />
line would be paying a higher price for the end product, and their<br />
costs would go up. They would come at us for more protection.<br />
They would lose markets because they wouldn't be able to<br />
compete as effectively as they now are.<br />
From the same district these miners came from, there are about<br />
eight million tons of coal that are exported to Japan and Korea<br />
each year, used by those countries in the production of steel.<br />
Now, if we are going to chop of their imports into this country,<br />
would they sit idlely by and continue to buy that coal from<br />
Australia, or would they buy that coal from some country that<br />
is prepared to promote and continue with reasonable and fair<br />
open market systems?<br />
If you won that retaliation by just chopping off imports<br />
as was advocated to us last night, you would then be in a<br />
situation where many hundreds of other Australians could<br />
directly be put at risk from the same part of Australia with<br />
other countries taking retaliatory action against us.<br />
Now, quite plainly, when the world is in difficulty, when<br />
Australia is in difficulty, there is no solution to our<br />
general problems by pulling down the blinds and pretending<br />
we can live as an island to ourselves. We have got to fight<br />
as hard as we possibly can with other middle ranking countries<br />
for fair and open rules of trade. Australia has more to benefit<br />
from that than almost any country because we have non-tariff<br />
barriers of one kind or another against about 50% of our<br />
total exports. I doubt if there is any other country that<br />
can make that kind of claim. Everyone would benefit from the<br />
kind of proposals that we have put to the GATT meeting.<br />
Mr President, your industries are confronted by very real<br />
problems of drought and because of the impact of a world<br />
recession that is deeper and longer lasting than any of us<br />
thought possible. Good, reasonable and sound policies are<br />
of vital importance to all of us. The Government is committed<br />
to doing what it can to assist in this process. It is also<br />
committed to doing what it can to assist the farming and<br />
pastoral community through the present difficult period,<br />
and especially through the present drought. / 8<br />
NFF </p>
<p>. I NF-8<br />
This is important for the building of the kind of Australia<br />
that we all want. We have enormous natural and human advantages<br />
in this country -the skills of Australians, their capacity to<br />
work, their initiative in doing things new in better and more<br />
economic ways. We have to look to those advantages in a tough,<br />
sometimes unpleasant, competitive world. Despite whatever the<br />
present difficulties are, I remain an optimist about the future<br />
of this country because I have enormous faith in you. and your<br />
industries. I have enormous faith in all Australia.<br />
I have great pleasure indeed in declaring your conference<br />
officially open. </p>
