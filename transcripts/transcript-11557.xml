    <content><![CDATA[<p>I understand that the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation has released a number of documents today.</p>
<p>One of those documents is entitled "Australian Declaration Towards Reconciliation".   This particular document has been the subject of much debate and discussion in the context of the reconciliation process.</p>
<p>Extensive discussions took place between me, the Minister Assisting me on Reconciliation, the Hon Philip Ruddock MP, and representatives of the Council regarding the contents of that document.</p>
<p>Although there was significant agreement between the government and the Council, in several areas it has not been possible for the government to give its full support to the document finally adopted by the Council.</p>
<p>For the information of the public, I attach a form of the declaration to which the government would have given its full support.</p>
<p>The areas of difference relate to customary law, the general application of the laws of Australia to all citizens, self determination and a national apology as distinct from an expression of sorrow and sincere regret.</p>
<p>Although there will be an inevitable focus on these areas of difference, it remains the fact that there is common ground between the government and the Council on most of the sentiments contained in the document.<br />
It is also the case that there is common commitment to the process of reconciliation.</p>
<p>Again in relation to the National Strategies To Advance Reconciliation, there are numerous points of agreement.  However, on some important aspects, the Minister Assisting me on Reconciliation has informed the Council of the government's reservations.</p>
<p>In its document entitled "Corroboree 2000 : Towards Reconciliation" the Council itself acknowledges ".there are many paths to reconciliation . some of these would be common ground for many Australians;  on others there are genuine differences of opinion".</p>
<p>The government approaches Corroboree 2000, to be held on 27 and 28 May, with goodwill and a positive desire for it to make a constructive contribution to the ongoing reconciliation process.</p>
<p>11 May 2000 </p>
