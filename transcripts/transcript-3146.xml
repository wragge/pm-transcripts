PRIME MINISTER IN LAOS<br />
Following is the text of an address by the Prime<br />
MVinister, Mr Whitlam, at a luncheon given in his honour<br />
by the Prime M~ inister of the Royal Government of Laos in<br />
Vientiane on Monday, 4 February:<br />
" I am obliged to Your Highness for giving me the<br />
opportunity during my present journey to pay this visit to<br />
Vientiane and to renew an acquaintance begun when you yourself<br />
were in Australia some years ago. I welcome too the occasion to<br />
inform myself of the achievements and problems associated with tbhe<br />
long awaited return of peace and order throughout your country.<br />
As you will know the Australian Government firmly supports the<br />
principles declared in the Geneva Agreements, as to the nzational<br />
integrity, independence and neutrality of Laos and looks to the<br />
international community to endorse and to respect them.<br />
Australia welcomed both the February Agreement and the<br />
subsequent Protocol in September of last year, seeing these as<br />
highly important in themselves but also as encouraging and<br />
heartening evidence of a spirit of goodwill, magnanimity and<br />
co-operation among all parties in Laos of willingness to pursue<br />
a mutually acceptable compromise on the presiding interest of a<br />
genuine national reconciliation. I know how much importance you<br />
personally have attached to this great objective of national<br />
reconciliation and how much is owed to your wise judgment and<br />
imaginative leadership in the progress towards it so far achieved.<br />
I speak for all my fellow Australians when I say that<br />
Australia understands how much now has to be done to bind up the<br />
wounds of war, to repair the loss and damage of so protracted a<br />
conflict. All of us in this room are conscious of what the tragic </p>
<p>events of the recent past have meant in terms of family<br />
bereavement and human suffering, the painful reality which<br />
underlies the macabre statistics of war. But we can<br />
nevertheless look forward with optimism to a brighter future<br />
for all the people of Laos. We cant confidently expect that the<br />
day is not far off when a Coalition√± Government can make a start<br />
on harnessing national energies for urgent tasks of rehabilitation<br />
and reconstruCtion0 In this work all friends of Laos will wish to make some<br />
contribution to promote the positive development of the talents<br />
and resources of all its peoples. My own Government stands ready<br />
to take part in this common endeavour. I believe that there are<br />
areas in which Australian experience has already proved to have<br />
particular relevance to the special needs of this country, as for<br />
instance, in afforestation a-r~ d i~ n pasture establishment under<br />
tropical conditions. In such fields we may be able to expand<br />
our present contribution, if you wish us to do so, helping to<br />
provide employment in the process to refugees and demobilised<br />
soldiers, and to lay foundations fo-r the controlled development<br />
of important nat-ional resources. We are happy too to continue<br />
our contribution to foreign exchange support for Laos. 1.11 . h1er<br />
directions we look forward to purposeful and practical. discussions<br />
with you of ways in which you think we might help, and where we<br />
would count it a privilege to serve. We are also interested in<br />
exploring with you the possibility of an agreement to encourage<br />
trade between our two countries.<br />
Australia and Laos will both prosper best through a<br />
combination of our own efforts and the promotion generally of a<br />
helpful climate of international. opinion and behaviour. We have<br />
to be both nationalist and internationalist. We see Laos, as it<br />
sees itself, as part of a region linked by geography, circumstances<br />
and history, to the other countries of Indo-China but as a<br />
neighbour also to Burma, Thailand and China. Laos draws a rich<br />
and fascinating inheritance from all these associations, woven<br />
into the fabric of popular life and furnishing the background<br />
of the national genius0 Australia is a more recent neighbour<br />
with a shorter, much shorter, awareness and experience of this -N </p>
<p>3,<br />
area, but we accept fully and completely the extent to which<br />
our destinies are bound up with yours. They both largely depend<br />
upon the degree of success that attends the labours of us all to<br />
Scontribute to a peaceful world order and the prospect of peaceful<br />
access to a fair share of its resources for all its peoples.<br />
There could be no better example to present and future<br />
generations of leaders in Laos in Indo-China, and indeed,<br />
throughout the whole region of South-East Asia, than the<br />
unremitting labour Your Highness has devoted to peace. It is in<br />
the hope of seeing extended the area of peace, of fraternal<br />
dialogue and discussion, that I will leave Vientiane, heartened<br />
and encouraged by the conviction that the path of negotiation on<br />
which you are now embarked is the right one for Laos, and for<br />
the region of which it is part. We shall follow with the keenest<br />
interest and sympathy the outcome of your endeavours and you may<br />
count upon us for support in your achievement.<br />
Finally on behalf of all in my party here today, may I<br />
express my deep appreciation of your generous hospitality to<br />
us all. I regret that circumstances have not permitted a longer<br />
stay and wider acquaintance with Laos. We go away sorry that our<br />
stay was not longer, but leaving our most earnest hopes and good<br />
wishes for the future peace and progress, so earnestly desired<br />
by every Lao, which will represent the culmination of your<br />
efforts as a statesman and peacemaker." </p>
