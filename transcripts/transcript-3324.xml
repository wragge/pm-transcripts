MEDIA RELEASE INDEPENDENCE AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA<br />
STATEMENT BY THE MINISTER ASSISTING THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN<br />
AFFAIRS IN MATTERS RELATING TO PAPUA NEW GUINEA, MR. BILL<br />
MORRISON. The Minister Assisting the Foreign Minister in Papua New<br />
Guinea matters, Mr. Bill Morrison, said today that the<br />
Australian Government would co-operate closely in achieving<br />
Papua New Guinea's goal of independence. He was commenting<br />
on the resolution passed yesterday by the House of Assembly<br />
in Port Moresby affirming that P. N. G. would move to<br />
independence as soon as practicable after a constitution<br />
had been enacted.<br />
He said pending the final decision of the House of Assembly<br />
to declare a date for independence for Papua New Guinea,<br />
the Australian Government will conduct its relations with<br />
the Government of Papua New Guinea as a Government of an<br />
independent nation to which Australia has certain special<br />
and inescapable obligations.<br />
Mr. Morrison added, " What exists today in P. N. G. is a<br />
state of defacto independence"<br />
Even in the areas where Australia reserves ultimate<br />
respon sibility until independence, mainly Defence and<br />
Foreign Relations, Papua New Guinea is already exercising<br />
day to day control and determining its own policies. The<br />
Minister said that even before self government, Papua New<br />
Guinea had appointed a Min1ister for Foreign Relations and<br />
Defence. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The Minister said that with Australia's encouragement,<br />
Papua New Guinea had taken its place in the international<br />
community and established contacts as if it were an<br />
independent entity.<br />
All this accords with the Australian Government's policy<br />
that the transition from self government to independence<br />
be smooth, in the same way that the granting of self<br />
government on December 1 of last year had largely been a<br />
formalisation of what already existed.<br />
Mr. Morrison said that the question of the date of independence<br />
should be kept in perspective. He recalled the statement<br />
made by Mr. Somare in the House of Assembly on Monday, 8<br />
July " We all know that independence will be coming<br />
fairly soon and really the question of the exact<br />
date is not all that important."<br />
Mr. Morrison said that despite the present preoccupation<br />
with the date of independence, the real challenges facing<br />
the Government and people of Papua New Guinea concern<br />
economic and social development.<br />
Among these challenges, which are being effectively handled<br />
by the P. N. G. Government, are rural development, which is<br />
at the heart of social justice in any nation at an early<br />
stage of development; the best use of available<br />
resources, both manpower and the natural resources with<br />
which Papua New Guinea is blessed. Employment opportunities<br />
must be found for the rapidly growing num ber of job-seekers<br />
in urban areas. The Papua New Guinea Government is also<br />
facing up to questions like the best utilisation of foreign<br />
aid, the formulation of a land policy and an investment<br />
policy. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Mr. Morrison said that it would be unfortunate if preoccupations<br />
over the exact independence date were to consume<br />
energy and attention which, in the interest of the future of<br />
Papua New Guinea, must necessarily be directed to resolving<br />
the real challenge-, which have been expressed by the<br />
leaders of Papua New Guinea.<br />
