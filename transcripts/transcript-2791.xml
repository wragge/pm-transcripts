NQ DATE<br />

CEASFIE IN VIET-NAM<br />
The Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Whitlam,<br />
made the following statement thi s afternoon welcoming President Nixon's<br />
announcement of a ceasefire agreement in Viet-Nam.<br />
" I am confident all Australians will rejoice at<br />
President Nixon's historic announcement. The Australian<br />
Government greets his statement with full approval andl<br />
the deepest satisfaction.<br />
I personally extend the warmest wishes to President<br />
Nixon on an achievement which establishes him firmly in the<br />
foremost ranks of modern statesmanship.<br />
The conclusion of a ceasefire agreement is a<br />
hopeful first step tovrards the goal of an eventual<br />
reconciliation. between the contending forces in Viet-Nam.<br />
Many months of patient and difficult negotiation will be<br />
required before progress towards this goal can be achieved.<br />
The divisions caused by years of hatred, bitterness and<br />
mutual suspicion will add to the difficulties of an<br />
already complex task.<br />
As the fighting recedes, opportunities will<br />
emerge for relief and reconstruction work in the devastated </p>
<p>areas of Viet-Nam North and South and in Indo-China as a<br />
whole. It is in this field that the Australian Government<br />
sees itself as making a particular contribution.<br />
It is still too soon for detailed aid programmes<br />
and machinery to have been worked out but as I agreed with<br />
Mr Kirk in Wellington at the weekend, Australia, along with<br />
New Zealand, is prepared to take part in an international<br />
rehabilitation programme throughout Indo-China. We stand<br />
ready to subscribe on a generous basis to international<br />
efforts to restore and develop all the ravaged countries<br />
of Indo-China. Indeed, it is to be hoped that, as the<br />
energies of the people, particularly in South and North<br />
Viet-Nam, become more and more engaged in the tasks of<br />
peaceful reconstruction, so there will be a movement<br />
from antagonism to reconciliation and cooperation throughout<br />
the whole area." j </p>
