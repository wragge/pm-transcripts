PRIME MINISTER<br />
PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE HON P J KEATING MP, TO ALP BUSINESS BREAKFAST,<br />
QUALITY LANGLEY HOTEL, PERTH, 30 JUNE 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
NOW, we've got our One Nation package out there working,<br />
really in earnest -froi-thi6-financial year beginning<br />
tomorrow. A lot of it we've got into place. We're now seeing the<br />
road programs, the arterial roads in the capital cities,<br />
the airline policy, the movement to a national<br />
electricity grid in the Eastern States, the vast changes<br />
to depreciation of the tax system.<br />
There are a few bits we've still got to move along. And<br />
we are now in the concluding phases of a greenfields<br />
agreement on the rail system for the National Rail<br />
Corporation. And when we get that into place, and we<br />
hope we can have that into place in the next month, we'll<br />
start to see the building of the standard . gause rapway<br />
between Melbourne and Adelaide,-and the upgrading of the<br />
-Adinaide,-and the upgrading of the railway line between<br />
Melbourne and Sydney, and Sydney and Brisbane.<br />
And that will mean that a whole new industry springs up<br />
in Western Australia, as people landbridge across the<br />
country into Melbourne, which they now can't do without<br />
changing bogies in South Australia. And it will lift the<br />
efficiency of the rail system and create the kind of rail<br />
network which Australia needs as a trading country.<br />
Now that's all on the cards. And I'm going to try to<br />
push that spending along in the next few weeks, as we get<br />
that agreement concluded.<br />
So, most of the One Nation spending will start to hit its<br />
straps in the coming months, the next month or two, and<br />
that will itself start to pull the economy up even<br />
faster. </p>
