TRANSCRIPT FROM " NATIONAL FARMING NEWS" THURSDAY 5 JUNE 1975<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, will the Government definitely<br />
stand behind the reserve price of 25O in the wool market?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Certainly it will do so and it will do so<br />
throughout the 1975/ 76 wool selling season. I am aware of<br />
statements which have been made particularly by the leader of<br />
the National Country Party which are obviously designed to<br />
undermine woolgrowers confidence in the market support<br />
scheme of the Australian Government. I repeat, the decision<br />
by the Government is a firm one, it will apply throughout<br />
the 1975/ 76 wool selling season. I can't imagine what<br />
motivates the Opposition in their efforts to create<br />
uncertainty, presumably an attempt to embarrass the Gove'rnment<br />
and win a few votes is more important to them than<br />
stabilizing Australia's greatest rural industry. They do<br />
neither a service to the wool industry nor a service to<br />
Australia. QUESTION: Sir, at present you are planning some moves<br />
within Cabinet. Could these moves lead to an additional<br />
move to relower the floor price to 2OO<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Not a chanc This decision was made by<br />
the members of the present Minister and whatever changes may<br />
be made in portfolios they will remain the Ministry and in<br />
any case I can beat the gun to this extent by saying that<br />
Senator Wriedt, the Leader of the Government in the Senate<br />
will certainly remain the minister for Agriculture. He has<br />
my confidence. I believe he is entitled to have the<br />
confidence of woolgrowers, woolbuyers and the whole country.,<br />
QUESTION: Cables into our office this morning from overseas<br />
indicated that if Mr Hayden was appointed Treasurer, that as<br />
he supported 2OO before he may make a new move in this<br />
direction. Could you kill that rumour?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There is no chance of Mr Hayden making this<br />
but you are asking me to comment on newspaper reports on<br />
speculation in part. NOW I have told you the position, there<br />
is no change in that position.<br />
QUESTION: 25O for the full season?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: For the third time, for the full season,<br />
throughout the 1975/ 76 wool selling season. Make no<br />
mistake about it. </p>
