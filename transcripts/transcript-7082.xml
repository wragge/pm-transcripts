PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF SPEECH AT OFFICIAL LUNCH, CYPRUS, 26 JANUARY 1987<br />
E-._. RROOF-ONLY<br />
PM: Mr President, Madam O. AMinisters, Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
I think you are aware, Mr President, that the brief duration of<br />
our stay in your country is no indication of any lack or small<br />
interest in this country. On the contrary, we are pleased to have<br />
the opportunity of being here for this period. I would mention<br />
to you, today is Australia's National Day. I do not do that to<br />
seek any congratulations from you, rather to make the point that<br />
we as a Nation have changed remarkably in the post-war period,<br />
and at the end of the last war, we-were only a Nation of<br />
seven million people. We are now a Nation of sixteen million<br />
people. Of course we have had that very significant increase in<br />
our population because we have had one of the most massive<br />
R </p>
<p>imm~ igration programs in history. People from many countries have<br />
added strength, diversity and richness to the nation of Australia<br />
and none would say the more significant part in that increasing<br />
strength, diversity and richness that have the some 50,000 or<br />
more people of Cypriot origin. The characteristic of that post-wardevlopentand<br />
8 row thbs66_ int thedemon s trated capacity ot<br />
people from different ethni. c-. and--cultural backgro~ undo... be able<br />
to live together in peace, and I am pleased to say that in our<br />
community that has been true of people of both Greek and Turkish<br />
Cypriot origin. And so it is because in this day we aE.<br />
Australians think with pride of the capacity of people with<br />
different backgrounds to live together in the new environment of<br />
Australia that we have perhaps, Mr President. a particular sense<br />
of tragedy with you, of what is happening at this time in Cyprus.<br />
You and your Ministers have been kind enough today to share at<br />
some length with us your views, both of the nature of the problem<br />
that c-onfronts you and of what you-Ve'd as the appropriate avenues<br />
for a just, peaceful and durable resolution of these problems.<br />
You have been kind enough to indicate that over the years,<br />
Australia has been identified both within the United Nations and<br />
within the Commonwealth with attemps defined a way to-resolve<br />
the tragedy that does exist here, and I have taken this<br />
opportunity today, and I take it again now of reaffirming our<br />
continuing support that Australia will give to the process of<br />
achieving a resolution of this pursuit. We understand your<br />
consideration. We believe that Resolution 541 and 550 United<br />
Nations provide the basis for such a resolution. We wish to<br />
see the Secretary-General of the United Nations continuingI<br />
his efforts, and I am pleased to have been told by you that his </p>
<p>representative will be here in the early days of February to<br />
review again those processes. I can assure you that you and<br />
the people of Cyprus will continue to have our understanding and<br />
we hope that through our understanding and we hope that through<br />
those processes under the aegis -of the Secretary-General that<br />
we can produce once again the situation once again in Cyprus<br />
that has characterised which--as you--have-gone-out-o-f your way toemphasise,<br />
as earlier days a vote of war and peace when people<br />
both of Greek and Turkish origin have been able to live<br />
harmoniously together. That is going to take dedication.<br />
commitment and hard work on the part of the people concerned,<br />
the parties concerned, and we for our part have seen today<br />
the depth of your commitment and integrity and we certainly wish<br />
you well in the difficult, arduous days ahead. Our discussions,<br />
Mr President, have not been confined, although the majority of<br />
our time has been associated with discussing the question you and<br />
I have-just referred, but I am plea'etf to say that we have just<br />
recognised referred, that I am pleased to say that we have both<br />
recognised that the bilateral relations between our two countries<br />
are in excellent shape and we have mutually reaffirmed our<br />
commitment to further strengthen those relations. I have also<br />
taken the opportunity Mr President of saying to you, and I say<br />
it again how much we appreciate the strength and commitment of<br />
the action that Cyprus has taken in the international drug<br />
traffic, taken the steps to do all that it can to cease that<br />
hideous traffic~ this is an issue to of concern to us in Australia<br />
we do appreciate the stregnth and commitment of your position<br />
there. After all the reasons that I have alluded to. Mr President<br />
I thank you again for the warmth of your welcome, I take this </p>
<p>4 D opportunity of reaffirming the strength of friendship between<br />
us, and I give you the commitment of Australia that we will do<br />
all that we can to assist the efforts under the aegis of the<br />
United Nations to see that the sad division that exists is<br />
brought to an end and that the people, all the people of<br />
Cyprus are once again able to live in peace and constructive<br />
harmony. Ladies and Gentlemen, I would ask you to rise and<br />
join me in the toast that I offer to the President and the<br />
people of Cyprus and to continuing bonds of the people of<br />
Cyprus and of Australia. </p>
