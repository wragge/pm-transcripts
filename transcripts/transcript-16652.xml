    <content><![CDATA[<p>A new optical fibre broadband link to Darwin will be one of the first priority steps in the roll out of the National Broadband Network.</p>
<p>The Australian Government today called a competitive tender to construct, operate and maintain the backbone link  -  with construction expected to begin by September, and better broadband services available in Darwin next year.</p>
<p>The $43 billion National Broadband Network is the single largest infrastructure project in Australia since the Snowy Hydro scheme, and is critical to building the recovery from the global economic recession.</p>
<p>Darwin is one of the first six priority locations for new broadband infrastructure under the $250 million Regional Broadband Blackspots Program.</p>
<p>A new optical fibre broadband link to Darwin will:</p>
<p>     * Increase access to broadband services  -  which Darwin needs more than other capital cities because of its distance from other commercial centres</p>
<p>     * Put downward pressure on prices by increasing competition  -  according to the Northern Territory Government, backbone prices are three to five times higher than the costs of similar routes elsewhere</p>
<p>     * Increase the reliability of services  -  three months ago, Territorians waited 11 hours for a communications system fault to be fixed because Darwin is the only capital city with no competitive backbone link.</p>
<p>Retail providers of broadband services must have access to competitive backbone infrastructure on an open access, equivalent basis  -  that is why the new optical fibre broadband link to Darwin is important.</p>
<p>This project will also kickstart the first of 25,000 local jobs that will be supported by the eight-year National Broadband Network.</p>
<p>Other priority locations for which a competitive tender has been called are:</p>
<p>     * Emerald and Longreach, Queensland</p>
<p>     * Geraldton, Western Australia</p>
<p>     * Broken Hill, New South Wales</p>
<p>     * Victor Harbor, South Australia</p>
<p>     * South West Gippsland, Victoria.</p>
<p>Submissions from a wide range of stakeholders have helped the Government identify the first six priority locations for these initial backbone infrastructure investments  -  and subject to the outcome of Round 1, more locations and routes will be identified later in the year.</p>
