October 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD, MP<br />
ADDRESS TO LIBERAL PARTY FEDERAL COUNCIL<br />
WREST POINT HOTEL CASINO, HOBART, TASMANIA<br />
E O E<br />
Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen for that very warm welcome. Before I<br />
commence my address to this Federal Council I am sure that there's somebody here who<br />
you would like to greet and that is the re-elected the Federal Member for Lindsay, Jackie<br />
Kelly. Tony Staley, Tony Rundle, the Premier of Tasmania, my other Federal and State<br />
Parliamentary colleagues, ladies and gentlemen. It is an enormous privilege for me to<br />
stand before you today as the first Liberal Prime , Minister in 14 years, addressing a<br />
Federal Council Meeting of the most successful political party since Federation. When<br />
yesterday we received Andrew Robb's report on the campaign it ended with an excerpt<br />
from the acceptance speech that I delivered at the wentworth IHlotel in Sydney on the<br />
second of March and in that speech I committed myself and my Government to the<br />
service of all of the people of Australia. And as I look back over the last seven-and-a-half<br />
months, I can say to you ladies and gentlemen thai we have stayed true to the values,<br />
principles and the policies that we took to the Australian people in the election. And over<br />
the past seven-and-a-half months there has not only been a change in policy, there has<br />
also been a change in the style of the Government of this country. No longer do we have<br />
a Government that responds to the loudest clamour f the noisiest minority, no longer do </p>
<p>Fax from we have a Government that is so arrogant it can never say sorry, or never say that it was<br />
wrong, no longer do we have a Governmnt that is remnote and out of touch with the<br />
aspirations and the hopes and indeed the dreams of the mainstream of the Australian<br />
community. Over the last seven-and-a-half months we have begun the task of addressing those aspects<br />
of the Australian economy that need change and reform. We delivered what I believe was<br />
the best Federal Budget in close to two decades. It was a Budget that was both strong and<br />
fair. It was a Budget that delivered the core commitments of the Coalition taken to the<br />
election. Tt was a Budget that goes greatly to the credit of the man who delivered it, the<br />
Deputy Leader of the Party, Peter Costello, and the Federal Treasurer.<br />
We also have in place a group of men and women who kfin to the Govcmnment of this<br />
country great skills and great ability. I am imensely proud of what my team has<br />
achieved-I am immensely proud of the skills that so many of them have brought to the<br />
job of governing Australia. I amn immensely proud of the fact that despite 13 years of<br />
Opposition, we have brought together a very professional and effective Go0vernmnent. A<br />
Government that retains the overwhelming respect of the Australian people. A<br />
Government that has delivered for all of us on what we took to the election. I remaind you<br />
that in the election campaign, we spoke extensively of our commitment to the Australian<br />
family. We spoke extensively of our commitment to industrial relations reform-We<br />
spoke of our commitment to the environment. We spoke of our commatnent to restoring<br />
the strengths and tho vigour and the competitiveness of the Australian economy. We<br />
spoke of our commnitnent to the small business sector of the Australian economy. And in<br />
all of those areas, every single one of those areas, which wcrc the heart and soul of the<br />
substance of the election campaign the battleground, the things that people had in the<br />
minds when they voted for us -all of those things have been addressed. And if they<br />
haven't been completely addressed and if they haven't been finally addressed it. is not<br />
through a lack of will on the part of the Coalition Governent, it is the circumstace that<br />
we do not control both Houses of Parliament. And that is a reality that we must grapple<br />
with and we are doing it realistically. Whatever the size of our majority in the House of<br />
Representatives, it remains a reality that we do not control the Senatc. Our supporters<br />
must understand that, you must understand that and you must understand the -steps we<br />
must take to deal with that reality. And we don't do it in a pig-headed arrogant fashion,<br />
we do it in a realistic fashion.<br />
over the past weeks Peter Reith has done a superb job as the Minister for Industrial<br />
Relations, a key portfolio in a key area. And over the past few weeks and months, Peter<br />
has as any quality Minister would do in that area, he's been patiently negotiating wit<br />
those who hold the balance of power in the Senate. And he and I and members of the<br />
Government remain hopeful that the legislation that for 10 years many of us have<br />
advocated above any other single economic reform, we remain hopeful that legislation<br />
can be passed into law. Because if this Government were through some circumstaces<br />
only to be able to choose one economic reform to introduce during its first term of<br />
Government unquestionably that economic reform would be to change Australia's old-<br />
Fa om28/ 18/ 96 13: 87 Pg: 2 </p>
<p>Fax from -sfashioned,<br />
outdated, uncompetitive, arthritic, industrial relations system. To sweep away<br />
such things as Laurie Brereton's job destroying unfair dismissal law a law which has<br />
done more to discourage men and women in small business around Australia from<br />
employing Australians than any other legislative measure introduced by a Federal<br />
Government over the last 20 years.<br />
So ladies and gentlemen we have kept true, we have remained true, we have stayed true<br />
to the issues that formed the focus of our election campaign. We took to the Australian<br />
people upfront a commitment to invest $ 1 billion into an historic natural heritage trust of<br />
Australia and out of that we would fund ongoing environmental works and environmental<br />
projects. And we would find the wherewithall for that out of a sale of one-third of Telstra.<br />
We made no bones about that. We didn't temporise, we didn't kid about that, we were<br />
upfront about it. We didn't write to the members of the Telstra Union as my predecessor<br />
had done in 1993 to the members of the Commonwealth Bank Employees Association<br />
and promise that he wouldn't privatise we made it clear that we would sell a third of<br />
Telstra. And we remain committed to that and it will be upon the heads of those who<br />
might defeat the Telstra legislation if this nation is denied the greatest ever capital<br />
investment in the environmental future of Australia, promised by any Government since<br />
the end of the Second World War.<br />
And the environmental measures that we have in mind are not the environmental<br />
measures of those who academically fancy improvements in the environment They are<br />
measures in practical, ongoing areas such as soil degradation, salinity, ocean outfall, river<br />
pollution, landcare the sort of things that are needed to restore the sustainable base of<br />
agriculture in this country. The sort of things that will enhance the clean, green image of<br />
Australia not only in our region but throughout the world.<br />
We have also of course delivered on our commitments to small business. There were few<br />
issues about which I spoke more frequently in the election campaign than the importance<br />
of small business in Australia. More and more Australians as the years go by will be<br />
employed by small firms. The hope of reducing significantly unemployment, particularly<br />
youth unemployment, lies in a revitalisation of the small business community of<br />
Australia. It is the large firms who are reducing staff. We hope that we can create a<br />
climate where a multiplicity of new small firms employing Australians come into<br />
existence in increasing numbers. And we have taken a number of major steps already. We<br />
changed the provisional tax uplift arrangements which have injected $ 160 million of<br />
cashflow into small business. We've promised capital gains tax rollover relief from the<br />
first of July next year. Within a few weeks, I'll have a report from the Small Business<br />
Deregulation Task Force about ways and means of reducing red tape by 50 per cent on<br />
small business during our first three years in Government. And of course no sector of the<br />
Australian economy will benefit more than the small business sector from the reforms<br />
that we have in mind in the area of industrial relations. 20/ 18/ 96 13: 87 Pg: 3 </p>
<p>Fax from So ladies and gendlemen, as I look back over the past seven months, as I take you back to<br />
that momentous and emnotional evening of the second of March 1996 an evening that<br />
ended for many of us what had seemed like a long political nightmare of 13 year of loss,<br />
13 years of frustration, 13 years of wondering whether again the Liberal Party of<br />
Australia would summon the unity, the courage, the campaign skills and the application<br />
and the commaitmient to become the Government of this country once again. And of<br />
course history records that we did. History records that those, and there are many in this<br />
room, who kept tbe faith through that ions political nightmare, who persevered with us,<br />
like one of those magnificent people, who we gave an Award to last night who I<br />
understand at one stage was the sole member of the Liberal Party in Toowoomba during<br />
one of the darkest times for the Liberal Party in Queensland. It was really to people like<br />
that that the victory on the second of March belonged because people like that had<br />
retaied their faith and their commitment in the Liberal Party and the things to which the<br />
Liberal Party has always stood. And what we are able to do with that victory was to<br />
demonstrate that when it comes to effective, professional campaigning, the Liberal Party<br />
is without peer. I don't say that Arrogantly or complacently but we need when we survey<br />
such an historic achievement, we need to reflect upon what are our strengths. And we<br />
need now that we are back in Government to begin treasuring toe heritage of our Party in<br />
a way that perhaps we failed to do in the past. We need to honour the past greats of the<br />
Liberal Party of Australia as well as to praise the present and to project forward to the<br />
fuiture because the past seven and a half months has been a period of great activity and a<br />
period of significant change and a period of consolidation. I've outlined the way in<br />
which we have stayed mre to ihe commitmients that we took to the last election. But<br />
those commitments were not restricted to the area of domestic policy, they also extended<br />
into Lhe international arena. How pathetic, how petty, how ridiculous, the claim made<br />
during the election campaign that our Asia Pacific neighbours and leaders would talk to<br />
but not deal with a Coalition Governent. How ridiculous, how against the national<br />
interest, the Australian national interest, such an absurd claimn sttinds. I have made it clear<br />
on the two visits I've paid overseas, most particularly the visit to Japan and Indonesia, the<br />
essential bipartisan continuity of many aspects of Australian foreign policy. When I was<br />
in both of those Fountries I praised the contribution made by two former Labor Prime<br />
Ministers to our relations with the nations in the region. I did that quite deliberately<br />
because I do think in areas where there is common ground between the major political<br />
forces of Australia we should identify that and then worry about our differences in areas<br />
where there is not common ground. It has long been a bipartisan, given of Australian<br />
foreign policy that our principle economic and strategic and political focus must be in the<br />
Asian Pacific, region. In. 1957: 40 years ago next year, John McEwen as the Depulty<br />
Prime Minister in a Coalition Government put down the findamernals of nur economic<br />
relationship with Japan in the Australia-Japan Commerce Agreement. He did it against<br />
the fierce opposition of the then Labor Party and the RSL. He did it at a CiLe when<br />
forging an economic link with Japan was a far harder proposition than it is now. He did it<br />
in 1957 and he showed courage and leadership and vision. And if you look at the<br />
contribution of other Coalition people at the time, of Richard Casey as the then Minister<br />
for External Affairs and die list could go on of' Percy Spender, his immediate<br />
predecessor. They all played major roles in forging those links. And successive Prime<br />
Faaœ n2 8/ 10/ 96 13: 87 Pg: 4 </p>
<p>Fax from 20/ 18/ 96 13: 87 Pg: S<br />
Minsters of Australia Whitlamn in relation to China, Fraser in relation to China, Fraser<br />
in relation to Indonesia, Hawkc i relation to APECJ Keating in relation to many of those<br />
countries as well, they've all played a role. And it's in that tradition of looking to the<br />
Australian national interest and not trying to find some cheap partisan political point<br />
scoring difference that I have tried to bring a focus to our foreign relations. There's been<br />
one difference that I have identified and that is that sometimes when I listen to the former<br />
Government it sounded as though their policy was a region only policy, that somehow or<br />
other you couldn't refurbish your relations wit nations such as the United Kingdom, the<br />
rmat of Europe and the United States without in some way drawing back from our new<br />
found relationships in the region. Now that of course is nonsense. It has never been<br />
necessary for this nation and it never will be necessary for our nation to choose betwecn<br />
her history and her geography when it comes to the making of Mrends abroad. We can<br />
have them both, we will have tern both, and under this Covernment I'm sure that we can<br />
build all of those relationships in a most productive and effective fashion. So it is not<br />
only in the areas of domestic policy, but it is also in the area of our relatons with other<br />
nations where there has been some changes and there has also been some essential<br />
continuity. But another change that T believe that has occurred is in the way in which some aspects of<br />
polities are conducted in this country. Some of it hasn't changed and some of it, given<br />
the robust combative style of Australians, oughtn't to change either. Politics is about<br />
difference as well as being about other things. And it's the job of political parties to<br />
identify differences, to acknowledge similarities, but to identify differences and to<br />
campaign on them.<br />
I spoke when I addressed the Queensland Division of the Liberal Party of the way in<br />
which in certain areas of debate the former Government had created a climate of<br />
intimidation, a climate in which people were fightened to express views on certain<br />
subjects. And I also reminded those in the audience on that occasion that robust debate in<br />
free speech carried with it the obligation to speak in a tolerant and senisitive fashion.<br />
One's obligations as a citizen are always a combination of freedoms and responsibilities.<br />
No freedom is absolutely untrammrrelled, there must always be a balance between the<br />
freedom to speak and say and act as one chooses, but also a respect for the rights, the<br />
property, and the sensibilities of others.<br />
And the last few weeks we've had a bit of a discussion about such things as immigration.<br />
I think that's a good thing, not a bad thing. I think we should talk about difficult issues,<br />
but we've got to talk about it in a sensitive and sensible fashion. Immigration has made<br />
an enormous contribution to Australia. It's made an enormous contribution to the Liberal<br />
Party. I might remlind you -we sometimes forget it thiat the first non-English speaking<br />
member of the national parliament was a Liberal, Senator Misho Lajovic, and quite a long<br />
time ago. It was the Liberal Party that put the first Asian born members of parliament<br />
into the parliaments of this country. And I want to say that over the last 40 years, people<br />
from all around the world have made a great contribution to this country. And the day<br />
that I came back to the leadership of the Liberal Ponty, the 3 1st of January 1995, 1 </p>
<p>Fax from identified a number of values that would guide and instruct the development of policy<br />
under my leadership. And one of those values was a vision of an Australian nation<br />
composed of people drawn from the four COrner of the world but united behind a<br />
common sct of Australian values. And that remains both the history of this nation and<br />
also the ideal of this nation. And it follows from that, that tolerance and respect for<br />
difference, a respect for the rights of people no matter where they may have come from<br />
once thuy are citizens of Australia is a core and important Liberal value.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, we had an exhilarating night last night, we really did. And I want<br />
to say something about the Lindsay by-election. I first of all want to extend to you,<br />
Jackie, our thanks and our gratitude for an absolutely mnagnificent campaign. I also want<br />
to wxend my congratulations to Tony Nutt, the Director of the New South Wales<br />
Division, and all of the others who worked so very hard in Lindsay. This was the first<br />
by-election since the election of the Government and it's vcry important that we neither<br />
get carried away in any surge of complacency and smugness arising out of the result, but<br />
also we don't allow the spin doctors on the other side to so devalue the result and to so<br />
create the impression that it was an entirely predictble, in-die-grove, unavoidable,<br />
inevitable, -natural, how-could-you-think-otherwise outcome. I mean, around in the ether<br />
is this suggestion that governm= ni~ when they're elected after long periods in opposition,<br />
always win the first by-election that's held shortly after they were elected. Well, I seem<br />
to rememnber a by-election in a place called Parraat which was held in September of<br />
973 that was less than a year after the Whitlarn Governiment had been elected. And<br />
Philip Ruddock knows the percentage swing even better than 1, but I think it was about<br />
seven and a half per cent against the Whitlarn Government that had been elected. Now I<br />
mention that, ladies and gentlemen, because 1 think it is important in the debate about the<br />
trnplica~ unis of yesterday, it is important to preserve a sense of perspective-By-elections<br />
do normally go against incumbent governents. The history of the seat of Lindsay is a<br />
Labor history and no amount of attempts to rewrite political history can alter that fact.<br />
We achieved an 11.5 per cent swing on the second of March and yesterday Jacie got<br />
another 4.76 per cent.<br />
Now theme are a few messages that come out of it. The first message of course is to us<br />
don't get carried away with it. One of the great capacities of the Australian people, and<br />
one that I will strive never to forget, is to level those in authority if they get too carried<br />
away with themselves. It's one of the great protective devices of our psyche and of our<br />
nation. It's one of the things that distinguishes us and it's one of thing$ we, I hope, never<br />
lose the capacity to bring people down to earth and to remind them that this is, at the<br />
end of the day, about the most egalitarian nation you cau find on earth and that is one of<br />
its enduring strengths and I hope it always will be.<br />
I think the second message that comes out of Lindsay is simply this: that the Australign<br />
people made a fundamental decision on the second of March, They wanted to change the<br />
Government. They wanted a new group of people to govern this country and they did it<br />
loudly and clearly and they did everywhere in Australia. It wasn't confined to Sydney or<br />
Tasmania or Western Australia, it was everywhere. It was about the m'ost comprehensive<br />
Fa om20/ 10/ 96 13: 07 Pg: 6 </p>
<p>Fax from swing that you could possibly find, both numnerically and geographically. I mean, who<br />
would have thought, if you listed all the great industrial and mining towns in centrecs of<br />
Australia since federation, who would have thought that alter the second of March only<br />
Newcastle and Wollongong continue to have Labor Party representatives. That towns<br />
such as Mount Isa and Ipswich and Kalgoorlie and Whyalla and Port Pirie and Broken<br />
Hill, all of tern are now represented by people other than the Australian Labor Party.<br />
And that was a measure of the socially and geographically comprehensive character of<br />
the victory that we won. So they said loudly and clearly, what a change!' And I think<br />
one of the messages coming out of yesterday, loudLy and clearly is, we didn't make a<br />
mistake, we wanted a change, and for those who would endeavour unreasonably to<br />
frustrate that change, get out of the way and let the new crowd have a fair go. And if<br />
alter a two or thre or whatever years we don't like what they're doing, then we'll do the<br />
same thing to thiem as we did to the other mob. I couldn't see it in clearer terms. I think<br />
it is fundamentally a question of that. And of course at a local level there was a great<br />
determination on the part of the people of Lindsay to give a magnificent, energetic,<br />
youthful candidate of the future and member of the future, a fair go.<br />
So ladies and gentlemen, it was a very, vcry eciting result, Arid there are just two other<br />
things that I want to say to you. The first of those is that amongst the many things that<br />
we were asked to do on the second of March was to continue to properly address the need<br />
for practical reform and change where change and reform is necessary. As you know,<br />
I've always adopted a rather Burkeian view to institutions and practices in Ausfralia. If<br />
something works well T'm reluctant to we it changed. If on the other band somethinrg is<br />
clearly failing the national interest, then it is our responsibility to vigorously pursue<br />
change. And in areas such as waterfront reformn, industrial reations; reform and all the<br />
other areas of change and reform that are needed to make Australia a more competitive<br />
nation, we: have a special responsibility to pursue them. And we have, if you like, a<br />
renewed reminder from the Australian people that the job of a sensible, progressive<br />
government is always a job of practical reform and practical change where that is<br />
necessary. And my Government will be a government of practical reform and change,<br />
particularly in areas that go to Australia's economic competitiveness. Our first Budget<br />
was splendidly received. It was seen as the right Budget at the right time, addressing the<br />
fundamental issues of debt and our current account deficit weakness. I mean, if we can<br />
have the opportunity through the Parliament and elsewhere to build on that, then we can<br />
discharge our mandate for practical reform-<br />
The very last thing I want to say is to renew my comitment to oir commnon cause. As I<br />
said to you last night, like so many in this room I joined the Liberal Party when I left<br />
school. The Liberal Party has been my life ever since. I love the Liberal Party and<br />
everything that I have achieved in public life has been due to the courtesy of the Liberal<br />
Party. I would ncvcr have been a member of Parliament, a Cabinet minister, let alone<br />
Parliamentary Leader, or the greatest honour of all, Time Minister, had it not been for the<br />
Liberal Party. I will never tae it for granted. I will always treasure what it has done for<br />
me, but more importantly, I will always honour what it. has done for AusLraiia. We<br />
belong to a great political movement. It is not just a collection of people, although they<br />
Fa om20/ 18/ 96 13: 87 Pg: 7 </p>
<p>Fax from<br />
t are fundamental to its success, it is a collection of values, it is a belief system about the<br />
kind of society we want for ourselves, the kind of society we can have for Australia and<br />
the kind of Australia in the world that we would like our nation to be in the next<br />
millennium-Ladies and gentlemen, I thank all of you from the bottom of my heart for the support that<br />
you gave me over the last year. I want to particularly thank my wife, Janette, and my<br />
three children who have been such an indispensible mainstay and continuum in all the<br />
time that I've been in politics. It has been a great Federal Council. It was crowned by a<br />
great victory last night, but in the nature of things we must address ourselves to the<br />
future, we must guard against complacency, and above all we must remember that we<br />
carry with us the trust of the Australian people and if we betray that trust, they will wreak<br />
the same vengeance as they wreaked upon our predecessors fo-r their betrayal and trust,<br />
and let us never forget that imperative of political life in Australia.<br />
Thank you. 28/ 18/ 96 13: 87 Pg: 8 </p>
