TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE MON P. J. MEATING MP<br />
PRESS * CONFERENCE, GRAND HYATT HOTEL, JAKARTA, TUESDAY,<br />
16 NOVEMBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF QOPY<br />
PM: Can I begin by saying that I think fth events In Bogor today, the<br />
decision of the Leaders to carry their support for the communication Is<br />
an absolute triumph for the Asia-Pacdfic. It Is a triumph for the world<br />
trading system and it is a triumph for Australia bemause It will be a very<br />
clear beneflclary from this and It has played a very Important and<br />
significant role in it. But, President Soeharto's statement may well be<br />
seen, I think, as the beginning of te Pacific century and Australia is<br />
set up for it. I want to commend President Soeharto on his leadership<br />
in putting the communique together and drivng It home.<br />
Free trade * int. h e Asia-Pacific by 2020. was the stuff we were only<br />
dreaming about two years ago. A decade ago It was beyond our<br />
dreaming. Today, 18 countries have signed up to It and the sense of<br />
restrained euphoria amongst the members knowing the weight and<br />
moment of what had been undertaken was something for one to<br />
experience. This area, 6f course, encompasses more than two billion people, by<br />
the turn of the century it will be 57 per cent of world trade and by 2020<br />
seven of the top 10 economies In the world will belong' to it In*<br />
Australian terms It means about $ 7 billion In extra Income each year,<br />
extra trade each year, about 70,000 nlew jobs, ft means exponential<br />
growth. 1in opportunities for young Australians. But, I think, much of the<br />
meani~ ng* of it can'tri be* meisured. For Australia's terms, how do you<br />
measure the value of a permanent seat at a table of this size? A seat,<br />
which I might say, we have In this Instance truly earned. A<br />
coonstrctive leading edge role In the region, the knowledge that we are<br />
not only masters of our own destiny, but truly ready tq seize it It<br />
means all the reform and realignmerft that we in Australia have </p>
<p>undertaken In the past decade will now have their rewards, It means<br />
economic growth will be secured by expanding trade, It means cooperation<br />
on other vital issues, It means a collective regional Interest In<br />
peace and security underpinned by a common economic Interest.<br />
I don't think the next generation would have blamed us for not having<br />
done this because this did not have to be done. But what is, I think,<br />
extraordinary about It Is that as the Cold War finished, as that bipolarity<br />
changed, as that bi-polar overlay was taken away, regions had<br />
a chance to do things together or to remain In the same sort of<br />
alignments. And, out of a process of sheer co-operation and<br />
Imagination we have seen developed here a commitment to free trade<br />
in the Pacific rim amongst these vast countries. Something that just<br />
simply didn't have to be done, something which, I think, most people<br />
thought would have been beyond our thought and our imagination.<br />
But, the fact Is It wasn't and it was done. It is a rare achievement, I<br />
think, 18 countries here have seen the future and they have seen the<br />
moment and they have seized it now not in another generations time,<br />
but now and, I think, this is a very extraordinary thing.<br />
So. we have all today lived through a bit of history. And, when we see<br />
the great post war changes such as the Bretton-Woods Agreement or<br />
the establishment of the IMF and the World Bank in the same terms<br />
what has happened today, larger In its Impact than the Uruguay Round<br />
by a factor of two or three, will change the worlds trading system and<br />
mean Instead of having three blocs one In Europe, one In the<br />
Americas and one In Asia we will have an Asia-Pacific dedicated to<br />
growth and co-operation and ultimately a better world where cooperation<br />
and achievement underpins what used to be there with the<br />
frightening polarity of the Cold War.<br />
So, this means much and it is a great achievement by everybody<br />
Involved.<br />
J: Mr Keating, what did you have to offer to Dr Mahathir to get him to sign<br />
up?<br />
PM: I think Dr Mahathir expressed some reservations and Intends to<br />
express them himself, but President Soeharto made this clear that this<br />
was a ' flexible -consensus' as he put it. That was that he wouldn't<br />
accept the view that one dissenter was able to change this and so, I<br />
think, Malaysia commits itself to this, but any reservations it has Is, I<br />
think, for it to explain and for its Prime Minister to explain.<br />
J: Mr Keeting. how Important has Australia's role been In the process? </p>
<p>PM: We started the idea off in 1992. That is, the idea of APEC meeting at<br />
leaders level because we took the view that Ministers, no matter how<br />
committed and no matter how conscientious couldn't draw down the<br />
authority to make these sorts of decisions. This could only be done<br />
to adopt a free trade agenda like this could only be done by leaders,<br />
by heads of government and by leaders and we needed therefore a<br />
leaders forum. It is that process that Australia put In train, but that was<br />
taken up ambitiously by President Clinton and I thank him sincerely for<br />
that for his meeting In Seattle last year and then by President<br />
Soeharto agreeing to host the second meeting end he said he would<br />
only do It on the basis if something positive came from It and then<br />
picking up the free trade agenda and running very hard with it So,<br />
Australia has been Involved I am very happy to say with this for its<br />
inception and we have worked closely now with President Clinton and<br />
President Soeharto and the other 18 leaders who have seen the<br />
opportunity of this and were prepared not to let the moment go.<br />
J: ( French Newspaper) If APEC is not going to be a free trading bloc as<br />
stated In the statement, does it mean that you extend benefits to<br />
Europe without having anything in return, without having to open its<br />
markets?<br />
PM: We think that this Is a proposal to help ourselves and in the doing of it<br />
helping others. Now, the open markets 2000 proposal which President<br />
Clinton proposed during the G7 was rejected by Europe. What has<br />
happened here Is a much more cooperation and conscientious<br />
undertaking and this will change the worlds trading system I'm happy<br />
to say, but the Initiative came from the Asia-Pacf and what is<br />
unusual here, the Initiative has come from the leader of a large<br />
developing country. This has not come from the G7 down or the<br />
OECD or anywhere else. This has come from a group of people<br />
meeting together and the leader of the developing country proposing<br />
to a dutch of developed countries US, Japan, Australia, Canada,<br />
New Zealand et cetera a free trade agenda. So, it is almost a role<br />
reversal for . President Soeharto to have done this, but he has and we<br />
have and the world will be a freer, more supple, more productive<br />
place. Now decisions have to be made in the future about whether<br />
this is MFN or preferential, but any of you who are familiar with the<br />
GATT will know that if this is a QATT consistent policy and it is we<br />
made that very clear, that an adoption of such a policy under the<br />
GATT leaves the option for each individual country of deciding whether<br />
it is MFN or preferential. But again, that Is a broader question that<br />
may be decided In the broad and we decided to have the next Leaders </p>
<p>4<br />
Meeting again, in Japan In Osaka In 1995 and that will be, of course,<br />
one of the Issues which we will be discussing.<br />
J: Mr Keating, did you say there was no unanimity or consensus on the<br />
free trade timetable?<br />
PM: No, let me just make these points to you from some of the paragraphs<br />
of the communique. At paragraph six it says ' we further agree to<br />
announce our commitment to complete the achievement of our goal of<br />
free , and open trade no later than 2020.' This is not an aim or a<br />
general direction,. this Is we agree to complete the goal by 2020. And<br />
then it goes on to say that is, that industrialised economies will be<br />
achieving the goal no later than 2010 and developing no later than<br />
2020.' So, in the parlance of intenationalcommuniques there are no<br />
weasel words here. These are firm executive decisions, this Is an<br />
executive decision taken by the Asia-Pacific Leaders. And, at<br />
paragraph seven ' we decide to expand and accelerate APECs trade<br />
and Investment facilitation programs'. Not we might decide or we are<br />
thinking about it, we decide. So, these are a very firm set of decisions<br />
and we will now need to give effect to those and think about the plan<br />
of how we will do that coming up to Osaka, during Osaka and beyond.<br />
J: There has been some sort of talk about this 10 years what happens<br />
in this ten years between 2010 and 2020, do the developing nations<br />
get free access to the developed markets...<br />
PM: We are already seeing a lot of unilateral changes in protection. For<br />
instance, Indonesian tarffs have fallen from 35 per cent In 1982 to<br />
per cent In 1992. In Korea they have fallen from 32 per cent to 10 per<br />
cent. Chile's average tariff Is now 11. Australia In trade weight at<br />
average terms will be at 2.9 per cent by year 2000. So, they are going<br />
down, just that some will have further to fall than others because they<br />
start from a higher level. But, again the modalities of this are to be<br />
decided up to Japan and during the Osaka meeting.<br />
J: ( International Herald Tribune) Mr Keating, when this agreement<br />
speaks of free trade, does that mean zero tartffs and how many of the<br />
countries or economies participating will take advantage of that opt<br />
out clause point nine?<br />
PM: Well, It is not an opt out clause and that was discussed by members<br />
today and there Is, I think, a very clear commitment to the paragraph<br />
six language here the first part of your question was? </p>
<p>J: Can 1 just follow up, If there was a very clear commitment, as you say,<br />
why is this point nine Included?<br />
PM: I think it was included originally for those who found trouble with some<br />
of the feature of itb, u t as It was agreed there would be no annexure to<br />
the statement. In other words, Leaders were not going to be deterred<br />
from publishing the statement as s, that paragraph nine largely<br />
becomes redundant in the decision in terms of any import that you<br />
might attach to it of the kind you are speaking of.<br />
J: Does free trade mean zero tariffs?<br />
PM: The coverage and the determination of free trade will be something<br />
which has to be decided in Osaka in 1995 and maybe beyond, but<br />
under the GATT, of course, the notion of GATT consistent free trade Is<br />
where markets are substantially liberated substantially is the word.<br />
And, that may be a formula that the APEC Leaders take up, it may be<br />
that they say zero to five per cent, t may be something else, it may be<br />
zero, but again these are all Issues which. I think, in the doing of this<br />
it's competent for the Leaders to discuss in Osaka In 1995.<br />
J: Mr Keating, does point nine where It refers to Implementing co.<br />
operative arrangement imply or require another formal agreement by<br />
the Leaders before this whole exercise of free trade might be<br />
embarked upon. And second question, can you tell us whether there<br />
was or was not consensus on the MFN question and is that why that<br />
also has been<br />
PM: The MFN question was not discussed. The only reference to it came<br />
from myself sayrng It is one of the issues which we will need to debate<br />
in Osaka in 1995, no one else discussed MFN. So, that wasn't an<br />
issue there. There was a notion, I think, at some point that In these<br />
negotiations there may be some not yet ready to participate or may<br />
join later. For Instance, countries that are not now In APEC, but who<br />
may join it are not necessarily signed up to these things and therefore<br />
can elect not to do. But. let me make this very clear; this was<br />
discussed, this paragraph nine was discussed at some length in the<br />
meeting today and it is not for the purposes of any of the members<br />
who expressed their support for it an option to move away from the<br />
very clear undertakings of paragraph six.<br />
J: Mr Keating, you say that Soeharto, if I got it right, you . said that<br />
Soeharto wouldn't accept the view that </p>
<p>6<br />
PM: That's right, he talked about the notion and I'll give you some of his<br />
words from my notes, he talked about the notion of a flexible<br />
consensus If the majority of the members are ready to c-operate they<br />
can carry it out and not wait for members who may not be ready.<br />
J: So, does this mean that he convinced Mahathir to go along or did<br />
Mahathir<br />
PM: Don't ask me about Prime Minister Mahathir's position, you had better<br />
ask him, I think.<br />
J: Was it in the meeting though, was it discussed?<br />
PM: You had better ask him about his position.<br />
J: What sort of adjustments win this mean for Australian Industry over the<br />
next ten years?<br />
PM: It depends what the climate is. We have always adjusted Australian<br />
Industry In the context of relatively high tariffs in the Asia-Pacific, but if<br />
you have got a commitment like this given the fact that we have<br />
already had the bulk of our adjustment behind us, and as I say we are<br />
going to a trade weighted level of tariffs of 2.9 per cent by the year<br />
2000, Australia's large adjustment task is basically behind it. So, this<br />
opens up an opportunity for Australia obviously, but I think, about any<br />
of these sorts of arrangements they are basically win-win<br />
arrangements. And, that is why I think the developing countries are<br />
bringing their tariffs down unilaterally, removing non-tariff barriers and<br />
being involved In trade liberalisation In general.<br />
J: There has been some expressions back in Australia, they fear that this<br />
may end up with a swamping of footwear, that sort of Industry in<br />
Australia. Are there any guarantees for those workers in those types<br />
of industry?<br />
PM: This is the sort of fears people have expressed down through time and<br />
certainly over the last decade. People said when we removed tariffs,<br />
manufacturing In Australia would close up. What has happened?<br />
Manufacturing production has doubled and manufacturing exports<br />
have tripled. -And, we are now seeing In a lot of competitive areas of<br />
the Asia-Pacific such as motor cars, even with existing levels of<br />
protection we are now producing vehicles for the world market,<br />
competitively of a very high quality, so I am very convinced of the<br />
capacity of Australians to compete in any of these markets and<br />
particularly in the environment of lower tariffs all around us. </p>
<p>J: ( The Daily Telegraph) If given that you are saying that paragraph nine<br />
is overridden by paragraph six in effect, what is the relevance of<br />
paragraph nine?<br />
PM: The thing is, as these meetings go on you could sit down and try to<br />
redraft some of the sections as you get a coalescence of view around<br />
particular points. But, you have got to understand how great this is,<br />
how big this Is. You have got the big Industrial economies of the<br />
United States and Japan, developed economies such as Australia,<br />
Canada, New Zealand, huge developing markets like China and<br />
Indonesia and the ASEAN economies, the industrialised economies<br />
like Singapore and Hong Kong, Korea, et cetera. I mean, this is an<br />
enormous panoply of countries and interests and to secure a thing like<br />
this is done, if someone wants to unpick the threads of a communique<br />
and you find yourself sitting there another day or two haggling over<br />
every point, I think, President Soeharto's instinct was to get the<br />
communique up and he did.<br />
J: Can you just describe from a personal point of view what it was like in<br />
that room with all those leaders, what were the atmospherics there?<br />
PM: The thing I keep trying to remind myself of is that two and a half years<br />
ago there was none of this, none of this existed, but, this has come<br />
together in this very rapid time. You could feel a sense of buoyancy<br />
from the Leaders Knowing tnat iney are in something as large as mis<br />
and it would mean so much for their communities and so much to their<br />
nations. The other thing was I can't think of a more tangible<br />
expression of the north south dialogue In any practical way than this<br />
because APEC is not like the European Community, Which is largely a<br />
community of developed countries. This has got the most developed<br />
and developing countries, it is a huge spread of countries from the<br />
United States to Papua New Guinea through to Indonesia, Korea, the<br />
differences here are so great that how long in all over our lives.<br />
Scertainly in all of my political life, we have heard about the north south<br />
dialogue. Well, this was the facilitation of that dialogue in the most<br />
tangible way that I could ever imagine. I think being part of that cooperation,<br />
I mean, seeing the President of China adopt these<br />
proposals along with the Prime Minister of Japan, the President of the<br />
Unites States along with the President of Indonesia, I mean this is cooperation<br />
and good sense triumphing over the tight polarity we used to<br />
Shave not just a few years ago. So, as I said to you in the opening<br />
remarks, I think, the Leaders have seen the opportunity here and<br />
seized It and this is leadership. This is what politicians can deliver. I<br />
, mean, politicians often are disparaged in this world, but In the end they </p>
<p>are the ones that make the decisions. This is a leaders meeting ati,<br />
this could only have been done by leaders and there was a lot of<br />
leadership on the line today.<br />
J: Did either Japan or China raise any reservations because they<br />
expressed plenty before?<br />
PM: No, there was basically nothing but support from China and Japan.<br />
But, before I leave you again on this paragraph nine, you asked me<br />
about It, If you read back through that you will find it is referring to the<br />
area above which Is largely about trade facilitation and standards<br />
agreements et cetera. That was largely the mood with which it was<br />
discussed in this group about trade facilitation, countries doing that<br />
which they sought to do while others were not yet ready to join. Let<br />
me assure you and you can go over this with a fine tooth comb and<br />
ask the other Leaders, those key words that I referred to you earlier<br />
about ' we agree to complete the achievement of our goal of free trade<br />
by 2020, industrialised economies achieving It by 2010. developing<br />
economies no later', you can't get it any harder than that. That is why<br />
it Is a great achievement.<br />
Could I just complete by thanking a number of people on the<br />
Australian side who have been associated with this for a very long<br />
period. of time, In the Australian bureaucracy, let me Just say about<br />
this, we have had a lot of debate about trade, there are trade<br />
theologians sprinkled all over my country and probably most countries,<br />
certainly in the Australian universities, but with the Uruguay Round and<br />
now with APEC, all the heavier hitters have got into the game. And,<br />
the game has gone way beyond polite papers being delivered at<br />
seminars to massive achievements of this variety by people who could<br />
imagine something bigger and better and had the horse power both<br />
political and bureaucratic to go In after it and get it.<br />
I'd just like to record a special thanks to my foreign policy adviser Allan<br />
Gyngell. To Michael Thawley In the Department of Prime Minister and<br />
Cabinet and his colleague David Ritchie who have worked on this with<br />
might, and tirelessly over a couple of years. Before that their<br />
predecessor Ashton Calvert, who is now our Ambassador to Japan,<br />
who worked on this for the first 18 months with Allan Gyngell. I'd like<br />
to particularly mention also my former private secretary and<br />
Ambassador to the United States Don Russell who has worked with<br />
the United States closely on this issue. My private secretary Geoff<br />
Walsh who has worked closely with Indonesia and I would like also to<br />
thank our Australian Ambassador to Indonesia for the relationship<br />
which he has created with the Indonesian government which has </p>
<p>V 9<br />
helped facilitate this. And. the many other members of the<br />
bureaucracy who have supported this, my colleagues In the ministry<br />
who have played their role right through these ministerial meetings<br />
Gareth Evans and Bob McMullan and officers of their department.<br />
There are many more I could mention and probabty many more I<br />
should and there may be some I have forgotten, but this Is the largest<br />
thing that I have ever been associated with or likely to be and I couldn't<br />
let a moment like this go by without acknowledging all of those who<br />
have put their shoulder to the wheel and kept it there with might and<br />
main. Thank you Indeed.<br />
