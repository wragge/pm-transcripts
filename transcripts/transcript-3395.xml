PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 332<br />
19 September 1974<br />
GOVERNMENT TO REASSESS ANL FREIGHT RATES TO AND FROM TASMANIA<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr E. G. Whitlam, announced tonight<br />
that the Australian Government will make an immediate<br />
reassessment of A. N. L. freight rates to and from Tasmania.<br />
This follows strong representations by Tasmania's<br />
federal Members and Senators who met this morning with the<br />
Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, and the Minister for Transport,<br />
Mr Jones. The Prime Minister has ordered that the reassessment<br />
should be made without delay to see if any interim assistance<br />
to Tasmania is appropriate. The Prime Minister emphasised<br />
that this move did not seek to anticipate the report of the<br />
Nimmo Royal Commission of Inquiry into Transport to and from<br />
Tasmania. This Inquiry is being held to ascertain how Tasmania<br />
is disadvantaged in terms of freight and associated costs<br />
through being the only State which has to depend on a single<br />
form of surface Transport for its links with other States.<br />
Mr Nimmo is at present examining the methods by<br />
which the Canadian Federal Government equalises the rates charged<br />
by Canadian National Railways for its rail services across the<br />
continent and its ferry services to Price Edward Island and<br />
Newfoundland. Mr Whitlam said that in the interim before Mr Nimmo<br />
reported, he considered it essential to ensure that ANL rates<br />
should not go up by a greater percentage than had the charges<br />
applying on similar goods moving by surface transport between<br />
mainland capitals during 1973 and 1974.<br />
Mr Whitlam said he hoped the undertaking he had given<br />
would reassure Tasmanians that their Labor Senators and Members<br />
of the House of Representatives were pursuing vigorously their<br />
representation of Tasmania's interests in Canberra.<br />
Mr Whitlam recalled that a $ 1 million subsidy was paid<br />
in 1973, towards the operations of the ' Empress of Australia'.<br />
The same amount is provided in the 1974/ 75 Budget announced on<br />
Tuesday night.<br />
