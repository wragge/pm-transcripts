    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today I am pleased to mark the 20th birthday celebration of Red Nose Day.  I urge all Australians to support the very important work of SIDS and Kids in reducing sudden and unexpected infant deaths across Australia.   </p>
<p>The Australian Government will contribute $80,000 to assist SIDS and Kids in raising awareness and helping prevent infant deaths.</p>
<p>  The funding includes an additional $40,000 for the production of 1,000 Safe Sleeping in Child Care Services kits.  This continues the Government's support for the SIDS and Kids Safe Sleeping Program, one of the SIDS and Kids programs which has contributed to an 85 per cent reduction in the rate of sudden infant death since its inception in 1990. </p>
<p>The Government will also provide $40,000 for SIDS and Kids to hold educational workshops for health care professionals, parents and carers in indigenous communities in the Northern Territory and Queensland.  These workshops will build on the Government's strong commitment to the care and protection of young indigenous children.  </p>
<p>  SIDS and Kids plays a crucial role in providing health and research programs, as well as offering support to families experiencing the tragic death of a child.</p>
<p>  I thank SIDS and Kids for their vital work and I encourage all Australians to participate in Red Nose Day.  </p>
