    <content><![CDATA[<p>Subjects: Childers fire tragedy.</p>
<p>E&amp;OE....</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what were your feelings like after going into the Hostel?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it was just a scene of great devastation. It has been a tragic event. I am moved beyond words by the wonderful spirit of the people, of the young people from different countries, the courage they've displayed, their comradeship to each other and the wonderful open-hearted character of the people of Childers. It is just fantastic.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I understand you met some of the survivors?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I did, I spent quite some time with them. They're great young people, they've been through an awful trauma, they've lost some of their close friends. But they're optimistic and they're very grateful for all the help they've received from the people. I want to thank, on behalf of all Australians the police, the emergency services, the fire services, the local clergy, the councillors. I mean they're the people that have got to bear the brunt of the trauma and sadness and anguish and everything. They're the people who have got to go in and bring out bodies and they've got to carry out identifications, it's a pretty stressful job and we take it all for granted as a community and when something like this happens I guess it hits us all in the face and we're reminded of what tremendous work they do.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Have there been many other messages of sympathy from other governments?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh yes, they've come from everywhere. But these things are incredibly sad, and young lives cut short is about as gripping as life can get.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Pardon?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did you visit the scene?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I did.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, as I said a moment ago, it is a scene of great devastation. Fire is a very cruel agent.</p>
<p>Good night.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
