CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
WILLIAM QUEALE MEMORIAL<br />
LECTURE<br />
Delivered b_ the Prime Minister, MrlJohn Gorton<br />
At the Bonython Hall, Univers ity of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA<br />
11 DECEMBER 1969<br />
" EDUCATION FOR MANAGEMENT"<br />
Mr President and Gentlemen<br />
Twice in the last few months, men from this plonet earth<br />
have walked the surface of the moon. We saw them on our television sets<br />
and we heard their voices in our homes. Now that is part of the history of<br />
our times. We are back in an everyday world of our own, coping with<br />
everyday problems. But we know that what was previously held impossible,<br />
has been shown to be possible. We have seen this gigantic achievement, and<br />
it should help us all to strive for similar break-throughs in the more mundane<br />
problems which face us.<br />
This, you may say, is a far cry from Education for<br />
Management which is the subject of my lecture tonight. This, you may<br />
say, has little to do with the late William Queale whose memory we honour<br />
tonight and whose memorial lecture it is my very great privilege to be<br />
delivering. Yet it is not, in fact, far removed, and let me tell you why.<br />
The targets for man's first landings on the moon were set<br />
a decade ago. Studies were made, equipment was designed and manufactured,<br />
personnel selected and trained, test flights in space were carried out and<br />
the moon flight itself planned on a world-wide basis. At every point<br />
management techniques were under ruthless test, and without those<br />
management techniques, the moon flight would have failed.<br />
Secondly, the moonshot was a pinnacle of achievement<br />
symbolising a new age, and that new age challenges management to seize<br />
new opportunities, to adopt new methods, to aspire to new horizons.<br />
William Queale, I am sure, would have agreed with that<br />
for he was a man with a vision. It was not my privilege to know him,<br />
though his record and his works are familiar things in the Australian<br />
story. We are in his debt for that which he did for Australia and we<br />
assemble here tonight to acknowledge that. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
I chose to speak to you tonight on education for<br />
management because of my personal interest in the subject and<br />
because I believe, as Disraeli said of England, that " Upon the education<br />
of the people of this country the fate of this country depends Education<br />
of all kinds, but not least education in management.<br />
Management is, I suppose, the science of<br />
using with the maximum economy, manpower, physical resources and<br />
intellectual skills in order to produce the maximum result. The goal<br />
of the skilful manager is to produce, or at least to work to, a blue-print<br />
or masterplan so that the goal, or goals, are set with absolute clarity,<br />
that they are understood at every level of the hierarchy, that each man<br />
knows the job he is to do, and does it without interfering with the work of<br />
others, as expeditiously as careful planning can provide. And he must<br />
be ready to abandon a blue-print, or a masterplan, when new and better<br />
methods are proved, or other changes are evident. These are the tasks<br />
of the manager and administrator.<br />
I would like, first, to sketch the background to education<br />
for management and tell you a little of it s history in Australia. Then,<br />
if I have your patience, I will talk of management' s role in national<br />
development. For the first half of this century our society continued<br />
to develop logically from the revolutions of long ago social,<br />
industrial, scientific and political revolutions which gave mankind<br />
courses to steer and which divided him with " isms" and into comnfunities<br />
distinguished by their wealth cr thdir pvierty, by their social standards or<br />
their technologies, by their political freedoms or their subjection to<br />
arbitrary rule. Two world wars drove mankind fast along these courses,<br />
for better and for worse. The forced draught of war frantically<br />
stimulated man's inventiveness in material matters. He flew, he<br />
learned to communicate across great distances, he discovered<br />
antibiotics, radar, the jet enc'fiTe computer, the guided missile,<br />
nuclear power and he burst IA~ te space age. These were all extensions<br />
of what had been happening.<br />
Then in the last decade or so, he began to separate from<br />
his past. It became clear that all around us things were beginning to<br />
happen that were not an orderly extension of the past, a refinement and<br />
a development of old systems, tested and brought to a level which<br />
satisfied the generation into which we were born. We were facing something<br />
new. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Peter F. Drucker, Professor of Management at New<br />
York University's Graduate School of Business has this to say<br />
" The last half century has been an age of continuity....<br />
the towering economic achievement of today, the affluent,<br />
mass consumption economies of the advanced countries, their<br />
productivity and their technical powers, are built foursquare<br />
on Victorian and Edwardian foundations and out of building<br />
blocks quarried then. They are, above all, a fulfilment of the<br />
economic and technological promotion of the Victorian and<br />
Edwardian eras and a testimony to their economic vision.<br />
" Now we face an age of discontinuity in world economy<br />
and technology..., it will be a period of change in technology<br />
and in economic policy, in industrial structures and in economic<br />
theory, in the knowledge needed to govern and to manage...<br />
While we have been finishing the great nineteenth century economic<br />
edifice, the foundations have shifted from under our feet.<br />
Drucker goes on to make the point of the need for<br />
" knowledge workers" as distinct from the emphasis on "~ manual workers<br />
So we come face to face with education and management.<br />
Look around us and what do we see? We see a world<br />
very different from the one our fathers knew, from the one we knew as<br />
children and that is not because it is jusi so much older. We are in a<br />
new age of burgeoning technological and scientific change. We are in a<br />
new age of discussion as to how best to use the new tools, the new<br />
knowledge, the new technologies, with which we are now provided.<br />
Tais is the task of the managers, and the hardest factor<br />
to cope with in an advanced community like ours is the " knowledge"<br />
explosion. The hour still only contains 60 minutes and the day only<br />
24 hours but the amount of paper work which has to be dealt with rises<br />
in an exponential curve. As measured by manpower, number of periodicals<br />
or scientific papers, science is growing exponentially with a doubling<br />
time of about fifteen years. Almost ninety per cent of all scientific<br />
endeavour in the history of mankind has been undertaken during the past<br />
fifty years. During the past fifteen years the same number of scientists<br />
were produced as existed during the entire previous period of science.<br />
Exactly the same is true in the social sciences and history. Where can<br />
one begin to burrow through the mountain of paper to make an informed<br />
judgment, except with benefit of computer? / 4 </p>
<p>It is important to understand these changes and<br />
opportunities, for as we understand them, so we shall shape our skills<br />
and condition our hearts and minds to extract the greatest benefits<br />
from them. Thereforel we must look to education even more than we<br />
have in the years gone by.<br />
As our pioneer forbears searched for water to open up<br />
an arid land and as our farmers planted the first grain so that they could<br />
live, so must we, in much the same way, turn increasingly to education<br />
to equip our nation for the long journey ahead. And education, by itself,<br />
is not enough. It is how we apply education to the brave new world of the<br />
seventies, the world which our children will inherit, that will determine<br />
our future and our fate, in a society where knowledge grows and skills<br />
abound. It is true, I think as Drucker postulates, that the most<br />
rapidly growing area in international trade is probably no longer trade<br />
in goods, but trade in technology, in patents and licences. This imt vitably<br />
is creating a new economic and industrial environment for which we<br />
must be educated and which we must know how to manage.<br />
In Australia, as elsewhere, knowledge is growing in<br />
importance in relation to experience. This is inevitable but the trend<br />
is not absolute. There will always be some things that only experience<br />
of life and the years can give. Computers cannot dispense wisdom. Y" Ot,<br />
by and large, we have to accept that experience without knowledge is no<br />
longer of the value that it was. By the same token, knowledge without<br />
experience has a diminished value.<br />
There are, I think, five elements we need to make up<br />
the ideal for our education system.<br />
The first, naturally, is an opportunity for everyone<br />
of school age in Australia to have equal access to<br />
opportunity for education, provided they are good<br />
enough academically. This, by and large, we have.<br />
The second is adequate resources in staff, buildings<br />
and equipment to do the job. The problem is<br />
identified; the final solution is not.<br />
The third is a tertiary education opportunity for all<br />
who have the ability to use it. This depends on<br />
resources. 4 </p>
<p>-The-fourth is a proper adjustment of education<br />
methods and systems to meet the demands of the<br />
new age. This need is recognised, but not yet<br />
satisfied.<br />
-The fifth is more intensive research into fundamentals,<br />
into priorities and methods. ' ibis, too, is recognised.<br />
Much remains to be done.<br />
Today forty per cent of the Australian population is<br />
under twenty-one and therefore of school and university age. And the<br />
young are staying at school longer. The percentage staying on beyond<br />
the age of compulsory attendance is nearly double that of ten years ago.<br />
University enrolments have risen in ten years from 47, 000 to 107, 000<br />
in 1969 and are expected to reach 127, 000 by 1972.<br />
1 quote these facts to show the growth in higher education<br />
and the pressure that is on the system.<br />
There has been, in recent years, an increasing direct<br />
interest by the central government in education. The responsibility for<br />
education outside the Commonwealth territories is primarily one for the<br />
States but for financial reasons there is an interlocking of activity between<br />
the Commonwealth and the State Governments. There is also constitutional<br />
provision for the granting of financial assistance by the central<br />
government to the States on terms and conditions approved by Parliament.<br />
Under these arrangements the Commonwealth is able to<br />
make significant cortributions to education in Australia.<br />
I do not want to bore you tonight with too many figures,<br />
but may I quote just a few to illustrate the point of increased Government<br />
interest in education. The Commonwealth Government is spending on education<br />
almost five times as much per head of population as it was ten years ago.<br />
The amount has gone up from $ 44 a head to $ 22 a head. The total has<br />
risen from around $ 40 million in a polqulation of nine million to $ 265<br />
million this year in a population of 12: i million.<br />
At the same time, the Australian States have more than<br />
doubled their net expenditure on education, per head of population, in<br />
the last ten years and they are now committing nearly one-third of their<br />
total revenue and loan moneys to this end. / 6 </p>
<p>6-<br />
All this has not been enough to solve the problem, but there<br />
are many other calls being made by society on the resources of the community,<br />
and we have, in education, at least been advancing.<br />
In tackling the range of problems we face, and being<br />
mindful of the five elements for an ideal system which I have mentioned,<br />
the Commonwealth and State programmes have touched the whole area<br />
from pre-school to postgraduate and adult education.<br />
It is appropriate for me, I think, to confine myself<br />
largely to the tertiary level for this is where the established education<br />
system and management training come closest together.<br />
A good geea education is, of course, basic to any<br />
professional competence, but it is at the point where specialisation has<br />
taken place that management training is most needed. We must ensure that<br />
the expert is not " grooved" or his vision narrowed by the blinkers of his<br />
specialisation. In talking of management training at the tertiary level,<br />
it may be appropriate for me to mention here that the first university<br />
to introduce a course in commercial studies was the University of<br />
Adelaide which had an Advanced Commercial Certificate in 1902.<br />
The University received a benefaction in that year of<br />
1l, 000 from Mr Joseph Fisher, which was to provide an income for " the<br />
promotion of the study of commerce in the University". The need was<br />
justified on rather negative grounds as was made clear by the inaugural<br />
Joseph Fisher lecturer who said<br />
" The slow starvation of hundreds of young, briefless<br />
barristers, and the forlorn outlook of scores of ' general<br />
practitioners' relegated to the back block townships, must<br />
eventually work a cure by giving pause to the enthusiasm which<br />
creates these in such profusion. Their places would be more<br />
than supplied if it were possible to offer a truly educational<br />
course having a direct bearing on business life equal to that<br />
lavished on the professions."<br />
Well, we've come a long way, I suppose, because<br />
frankly, I do not know of any starving barristers today and most of our<br />
GP's " go bush" only by choice. Adelaide's first commercial certificate<br />
was followed by diplomas and degrees and commercial studies available in<br />
a variety of courses eventually became part of our tertiary education<br />
system in all States. The concept of management training as part of / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
commercial studies was introduced in a limited way at a much later date.<br />
Now I come to the resources we have today for management<br />
training, either as part of, or in addition to, commercial training in<br />
the higher levels of our education systems.<br />
The most relevant management education courses are for<br />
Master's degrees in Busiess Administration at the Universities of<br />
Adelaide, Melbourne, New South Wales and Monash. This year the total<br />
enrolment at all of them was 406.<br />
Then there are courses, full -time and part-time, for<br />
diplomas in management, in business studies and business administration<br />
at some of our advanced colleges of education and our leading technical<br />
schools. Something like eighteen institutions are currently providing<br />
these courses over the whole of the Commonwealth.<br />
Supplementing these courses are others with which industry<br />
itself is closely associated. For instance the Australian Administrative<br />
Staff College at Mt Eliza in Victoria, the Summer School of Business<br />
Administration at the University of Melbourne and the Institute of Administration,<br />
run by the University of New South Wales at Little Bay.<br />
Other universities have plans i this field of business<br />
administration ranging from studies at Diploma level to a Master's<br />
degree. Now all this is good up to a point. You will see that<br />
the existing facilities are mostly for undergraduate studies. These are<br />
essential and there will have to be more of them. But when we come to<br />
a discussion of the nation's future needs at postgraduate level in management<br />
we find ourselves in the middle of a continuing deb ate. Should each<br />
Australian State and the Capital Territory bave its own university or its<br />
own College of Advanced Education staffed and equipped for this purpose?<br />
Or should resources be concentrated in one or two<br />
institutions of excellence2 Should we accept the problems posed by<br />
location and possible interstate jealousies for the sake of a concentration<br />
of effort and staff and equipment.<br />
I do not profess to know, but a decision has to be made and<br />
made without too much delay and for myself, I incline towards the<br />
avoidance of too much duplication. But this is a problem to the solution of<br />
which managers themselves should devote their thoughts and decide their<br />
attitudes. / 8 </p>
<p>-8<br />
In some respects, Australia has been slower than some other industrial<br />
countries in its development of management training. The first Master's<br />
Degree in business administration was not available until 1962 and our<br />
education resources are no,-t yet fully geared to the surge in national<br />
development which is upon us, particularly in the mineral industries.<br />
Until about eight years ago, an Australian business<br />
executive who wanted management education at the highest level had to<br />
go abroad and usually he went to America, to renowned institutions like<br />
Harvard and Stanford. Many still do.<br />
And yet, for years before that we had shown the world<br />
we could grow the best wool, wheat and meat in the world, we could<br />
build aeroplanes and ships and develop major industries. Some of our<br />
scientists and medical men had been pre-eminent in their fields and<br />
of world-wide reputation. Australians, in fact, were proving they<br />
could succeed in any company.<br />
But they had little opportunity for refining their admninistrative<br />
skills. The specialist was in his slot. There was little incentive<br />
for him to broaden the base of his management skill.<br />
Now we are seeking to overcome that. Industry at<br />
large is beginning to recognise it as the Institute of Management did<br />
long ago. The demand from traduates and undergraduates for management<br />
training is rising sharply. So too is the demand from industry.<br />
I envisage the solution emerging as the result of joint<br />
development by governments and industry. Most of you will be familiar<br />
with the decision the Government made in May of this year to Institute<br />
an inquiry into Australia's future needs in the field of post-graduate<br />
education in management and how best these needs could be met.<br />
This followed the study made by a panel from the<br />
Manufacturing Industries Advisory Council which set the future needs of<br />
industry as high as five hundred Masters of Business Administration a<br />
year. Since our decision in May, representatives of the<br />
Commonwealth have been abroad to visit a number of leading business<br />
schools and, as a result, the Commonwealth has invited a group of<br />
overseas experts to conduct the enquiry on the best method of management<br />
training for Australia. Some acceptances of these invitations have<br />
already been received and I would expect the Minister for Educat ion and<br />
Science to be in a position to announce further details about the enquiry<br />
very soon. / 9 </p>
<p>79<br />
I believe, here, we are starting at the right point.<br />
I turn now to management for national development. The<br />
size of the task in Australia hardly needs restating before a distinguished<br />
audience like this, for you are all, in your respective spheres, deeply<br />
involved. It is primarily an exercise in responsible government and<br />
" responsible government? as the late Sir Frederic Eggleston once<br />
said is " the attempt, never completely successful, of free democracies<br />
to secure in an integral process an effective forum, proper consideration<br />
and decision and effective execution".<br />
I see it as an exercise at three levels. First we have<br />
the application of political principles to the formation of policy by<br />
governments. Then there is the administrative arm of government,<br />
which is non-political and continuous, and which provides the tools<br />
governments need to do the j ob. It has vast skills and inherent<br />
qualities of management. I refer to the Public Service.<br />
And finally there is private enterprise which makes<br />
the heart of a nation whole. This we might define as a huge, sprawling,<br />
incredibly diverse association of individuals and comnirinities, bound<br />
only byecononic 17,7 v: d cubject to economic sanctions.<br />
Let us look for a moment at the political level in the<br />
exercise of responsible government. No political philosophy can succeed<br />
in a democracy ( though it may survive) unless it has a concept of<br />
management which is based on the human values of the individual, a<br />
respect for his liberties and an understanding of the forces which motivate<br />
him. There must be incentives to work and prcper rewards for labour.<br />
The opportunity to live without fear and in dignity must be his.<br />
In our early civilisation, man's needs were few. They<br />
were concerned with subsistence and survival. Management was a<br />
primitive exercise in looking after oneself. Today those needs still are<br />
there but they exist in a new environment which is made complicated and<br />
demanding by man himself because of the development of his knowledge,<br />
his skills, his inventions and his innovations.<br />
A political philosophy has to encoutipass in this modern<br />
age full regard t r the liberty of the individual and also recognise a<br />
framework of society in which that liberty can exist. It must be committed<br />
to the security of the social system in a world caught precariously between<br />
the eternal values and the forces of destruction. </p>
<p>10<br />
It has to be flexible and it cannot be so if it does not<br />
accept the virtues of compromise. Henry Clay, in writing of the Federal<br />
system in America, said compromise was the cement that held the Union<br />
together. " All legislation", he explains " is founded on the<br />
principle of mutual concession.... let him who elevates himself above<br />
humanity, above its weaknesses, its infirmities, its wants, its<br />
necessities say, if he pleases, ' I will never compromise'; but let<br />
no one who is not above the frailties of our common nature disdain<br />
compromise" That, I am afraid, is commonsense, though compromise<br />
must never involve abdication from principle. It seems to me that, in<br />
meeting the challenge of the change around us, we have to be concerned,<br />
at political level, not only with the art of compromise, but with a fuller<br />
understanding of how to manage the " knowledge worker" of whom I have<br />
already spoken. He needs and expects more than just " a living. He<br />
must be challenged to achieve greatness in his own field, not so much by<br />
people as by seeking to attain objectives objectives which others may<br />
regard as unattainable. Governments have the task, in a management sense, of<br />
defining the objectives of a society. In material terms those objectives<br />
in Australia can be summarised quite briefly.<br />
We want to see Australia free, independent, secure and<br />
prosperous.<br />
We want people and capital resources to develop this<br />
continent.<br />
We want to increase our self-sufficiency at home and<br />
enlarge our markets abroad.<br />
We want to play a responsible part in the community of<br />
nations with a proper recognition of our regional<br />
responsibilities.<br />
" We want to provide the greatest variety of opportunity for<br />
self-fulfilment and purposeful living to the individuals<br />
who make up our nation. / 11 </p>
<p>11<br />
Those objectives may be as old as our sovereignty, yet they<br />
are constantly taking new forms. New objectives are also emerging which<br />
are less tangible but of real importance, but I will come to them a little<br />
later. I have spoken a good deal on the political level of management<br />
in national development, but perhaps I may be forgiven because of my<br />
direct involvement in it.<br />
The second level I want to talk about now is the Public Service.<br />
This is the link which joins succeeding governments and it has management<br />
responsibili ties of a high order.<br />
While the politician has to make the ultimate decisions and is<br />
accountable to his peers and his constituents for what hie does or does not<br />
do, top management in the Public Service still has weighty responsibilities.<br />
This is where the translation of policy decisions into administrative action,<br />
advisory functions and a whole range of support activities exist. Facts,<br />
figures, analysis, assessment and advice must flow continuously to the<br />
Cabinet, the Ministry and the Parliament.<br />
I believe the Service performs these tasks well. Its probity<br />
is unquestioned and its record second to none. The officers of the Service<br />
are part of the new breed of " knowledge workers" as well as the architects<br />
of management techniques in government. The Service has come a long<br />
way in the second half of this century. University graduates are joining in<br />
greater numbers and occupy many posts in the higher echelons.<br />
It was not always so and in the first thirty years or so of<br />
Federation, entry was by examination at the age of fourteen or thereabouts.<br />
This led W. K. Hancock to write in 1930<br />
" Democratic sentiment, applauds the sound argument that<br />
every office boy should have a chance to become a manger<br />
and perverts it into a practical rule that no-one shall become<br />
a manager who has not been an office boy.<br />
I quo te this to show that in the administration of government,<br />
a vast transormation has already taken place and the process is still<br />
going on. The higher educational qualifications in the Public Service and<br />
the training in management practices which the Serivce provides internally<br />
and externally are powerful reinforcements for the system of responsible<br />
government. / 12 </p>
<p>-212-<br />
In recent years the cross-pollination of industry and the Public<br />
Service ar-officer-iel-baa. beon increasing. The fact that industry now<br />
turns frequently to the-Public Ser'-Ice in its search for top executives,<br />
top managers and specialists is a tribute to the system and the quality<br />
of the officer it attracts and trains. Similarly the opportunities the<br />
Public Service-itself provides do attract recruits from industry.<br />
In thi s sophisticated, twentieth century world, I do not believe<br />
the Public Service should be separated from industry by any significant<br />
barriers or artificial divisions of skill providing the traditional rights of<br />
the public servant are protected. After all, the differences between the<br />
responsibilities each accepts and the service each provides are not<br />
very great. The real barrier has been the non-transferability of<br />
superannuation. To remove this barrier the Commonwealth Government<br />
has accepted the concept of " portability of pensions" a clumsy phrase<br />
perhaps but one which means that, subject to certain conditions, a<br />
Commonwealth public servant does not lose his superannuation rights if he<br />
transfers to different spheres of Commonwealth employment, to the<br />
State public services, to the universities or to industry. It would seem<br />
eminently sensible for this to become a general principle in all sectors<br />
of employment. Though I know the industry has reservation as to this.<br />
May I now take the third level of activity in managing for<br />
national development. I refer to private enterprise. This is your<br />
territory, gentlemen.<br />
Now private enterprise has provided a great deal of the<br />
thrust tbat has taken Australia to the point of development we are at<br />
today, and it is indeed the base of our free enterprise society.<br />
It was private enterprise which opened up our rural lands;<br />
it was private enterprise which gave us our manufacturing industries.<br />
It was private enterprise which first drew from the earth the mineral<br />
wealth that today has given a new dimension to our growth, our export<br />
opportunity and our national economy as a whole.<br />
But it has not, and I probably need not remind you, done t,,.-se<br />
things exclusively on its own. Governments had to create a climate<br />
of opportunity and indeed to provide important incentives. This they<br />
have done, and through this we have seen the development of a partnership,<br />
ragged though it may appear at times, between the public and the<br />
private sectors in order the better to attain our national objectives. / 13 </p>
<p>13<br />
It was private enterprise, too, as I told you earlier in my<br />
historical reference to education for management, that inspired commercial<br />
education at the tertiary level. It was also informed private enterprise<br />
which began to advocate higher post-graduate education for management.<br />
But private enterprise in my opinion, is not pulling its weight in one<br />
important field; research for industry has been too much dependent on<br />
Government finances.<br />
I say this frankly because I think it merits your consideration<br />
and because it seems to me that research should have a very high priority<br />
when we are working out which way we will go in the next decade.<br />
This applies to management needs as well as management policies.<br />
An analysis by Dr Peter Stubbs of the Institute of Appled<br />
Economic Research at the University of Melbourne showed that while the<br />
Australian research effort overall was small the percentage contribution<br />
made by the Government sector to the total amount spent was far greater<br />
than the percentage contributed by the Governments of other countries<br />
in their own economies. The countries he selected for comparisons were<br />
the United States of America, Britain, Belgium, France West Germany<br />
and Holland. Of the estimated gross national expenditure on research and<br />
development, the Government sector in Australia contributed around 73 per<br />
cent and the next highest government contribution was in Britain where it<br />
was 64 per cent.<br />
Dr Stubbs makes it clear that in this field Australian industry,<br />
that is the private sector, has played a very small role both in its<br />
proportion to the Australian national effort and in absolute terms when<br />
compared with other industrial countries.<br />
I bring this to your notice because if we are to gvrasp the<br />
opportunities the future holds, we have to be inventors and innovate<br />
and it is top management which has to frame the policy towards innovation.<br />
By inn ovation I mean the act of bringing invention to fruition, the<br />
development part of " research and development" Invention we know as<br />
the act of creating a new product or process and Australians have a good<br />
record here, but development of an invention to tliFe point where it becomes<br />
commercial does not occur in Australia to the degree that it should.<br />
No-one can be an innovator without thorough research and a<br />
study of all the possibilities and no-one can be a successful innovator<br />
without management skills. / 14 </p>

We need the most advanced and specialised managerial skills<br />
we can attract. There have been regrettable cases in the past when<br />
citizens have had abundant gifts to offer but they have been unable to fit<br />
into already existing patterns of organisation. No matter how radical<br />
we may think ourselves, most of us are deeply ingrained with conservatism<br />
in organisational matters.<br />
An example is that of the Greek town planner and architect<br />
Constantinos Doxiadis. Dr Doxiadis was a leading architect in Greece<br />
before the Second World War, and in that war he led the Greek underground<br />
and was awarded the British OBE. After the war he was a Cabinet Minister<br />
and directed Marshall Plan operations in Greece. Following a change of<br />
government in 1951, he lost office and decided to migrate to Australia.<br />
Once in Australia he found that technical difficulties about<br />
qualifications prevented him from contributing as much as he would have<br />
liked and for two years he grew tomatoes in Western Australia. He wrote<br />
several books on town planning and in 1953 returned to Greece. He made<br />
one more attempt at Australia in 1956 but was unable to find an appropriate<br />
post for his talents.<br />
Since then he has founded his own university in Athens, and has<br />
begun massive town planning projects in Greece, in Philadelphia, Washington<br />
and Louisville in the US, in Baghdad and Khartoum, in En gland, South<br />
America and Asia. Only Australia has made no use of his genius. He<br />
won the coveted Aspen Award and is a member of the American Academy<br />
of Arts and Sciences.<br />
I would like to think that if Dr Doxiadis were to come as a migrant<br />
now, with -our growing sophistication and our recognition of the need for<br />
advanced managerial skills, he would not be rejected. But I cannot be sure.<br />
I put it to you, therefore, that when we look at our management<br />
standards and the contributions which come from the public and priva te<br />
sectors, we should also look at our research needs and explore ways in which<br />
government and industry can come closer together. Some progress has been<br />
made in recent years and the Australian Government has made finance<br />
available through special committees for both fundamental research and<br />
applied research in industry. But I believe there is room for more direct<br />
activity by industry and the field of development and application of new<br />
inventions in techniques and processes. / i </p>
<p>15<br />
Given wide-ranging and effective research, I believe we then<br />
have a solid ground floor from which the practitioners of the three levels<br />
of national management can operate. These levels, as I have explained,<br />
are represented by the politician both in government and opposition the<br />
Public Service and private enterprise. How well they fit together is the<br />
measure of our capacity tcget the job done. I believe they fit remarkably<br />
well and we see this across the whole panorama of national activity today.<br />
When I spoke earlier about our material objectives, I spoke of<br />
a different, non-material range of objectives before us. These may be<br />
stated simply as the objective of a more satisfying life for our citizens.<br />
In concerning ourselves as a people. * i th what makes for a<br />
more satisfying life, we have to admit that we are mostly only vaguely<br />
interested in what is happening to our environment, and what is more<br />
important what, indeed, we are doing to it. The sins of commission, I<br />
think are perhaps as great as the sins of omission.<br />
We all of us as citizens pollute the very air we breathe,<br />
we savage our unique wildlife with little s1u me, we slay our fellows on<br />
the roads with monstrous carelessness and we accept the congestion of<br />
our cities as though urban sprawl was the fault of somebody else.<br />
We blame everybody but ourselves for the grey areas in our daily lives.<br />
You may ask: What has all this to do with education for<br />
management? What has this to do with education for national development?<br />
I think it has much to do with those things. For the success of government<br />
efforts in this direction depends heavily on . an educated public opinion,<br />
on the bre aking down of the barriers of " it doesn't matter" and " I don't<br />
care". This is where private enterprise, which I have loosely descri ed<br />
as a " free-acting association of individuals and communities" has to make<br />
up the partnership and take up the challenge. It is a challenge to the<br />
" knowledge workers" and the managers to help create the climate in which<br />
an articulate public opinion can flourish and where people will come to say<br />
simply " I do care" and where as a result a more satisfying life will<br />
be the more easily attained.<br />
It is a brave man, indeed, who is dogmatic about the kind of<br />
people and the kind of nation we will be in the next century, but as we move<br />
towards its beginning, I believe the desire for a better life and a sense of<br />
involvement in the making of a nation are things close to the heart of most<br />
Australians. These things we cannot achieve by some kind of imperial<br />
rescript. They will come to us if we make a conscious effort to read some<br />
of the signs around us, as I'm sure William Queale did in his day, and if<br />
we keep the human values straight. An educated public opinion is our<br />
starting point. i16 </p>
<p>16<br />
So tonight, Mr President, we have looked historically at<br />
our record in education-for-management and the need to do better if we<br />
are to succeed in a world of change. We have looked at the base structure<br />
of education development in Australia and the elements of government and<br />
the people which form the management team for national development.<br />
We have looked ar our national objectives in material and human terms.<br />
And we have grounds for confidence, but none for complacency.<br />
believe that if governments and people continue to question and to strive,<br />
and are not bound by the concepts and practices of the past, we can stand<br />
up to the weathering of the centuries.<br />
You may ask " What of the future if we do all these things?"<br />
I am no prophet but let me tell you what I see, from the shape of things<br />
as they are 0 1 see Australia as a nation of perhaps twenty-five million<br />
people by the end of the century. That is double our<br />
population today.<br />
I see Australia as a society retaining political freedoms and<br />
using that freedom plus skilled management to provide<br />
economic freedom and more opportunity for creative<br />
self-expression.<br />
* I see Australia as a nation of explorers probing the seas,<br />
and the discoveries of the earth, and seeking new and better<br />
ways of providing more and better material things.<br />
0 1 see Australia developing in an environment we seek to<br />
protect and not destroy.<br />
a I see Australia as growing in tolerance, as increasing in the<br />
realisation that there is a common and a noble task for<br />
all sections of society to work for in harmony.<br />
I conclude, Mr President, by saying just this. We are all practical<br />
men. Of necessity we have to be. But we can have our dreams. And I<br />
say " let us have those dreams".<br />
Thomas Jefferson, a long time ago, said " We must dream of<br />
an aristocracy of achievement arising out of a democracy of opportunity'".<br />
You and your successors, I and . ni y successors, have the chance<br />
in this niation to translate those dreams into reality.<br />
I Mifn k you. </p>
