FOR PRESS 19 MARCH 1978<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The Government's desire to conserve Australia's environment continues<br />
as a high priority.<br />
Our decisions in relation to Kakadu National Park in the othr<br />
Terriroty and sand mining on the fragile Fraser Island are evidence<br />
of this concern to-protect Australia's unique environment.<br />
We have also shown an understanding of other sensitive conservation<br />
issues.<br />
Nan'-thousands of Australians and men, women and children<br />
throughout the world have long felt db-ep concern about thec<br />
activities of' whalers.<br />
There is a natural community disquiet about any activity that<br />
threatens the extinction of any animal. species.<br />
I abhor any such activity particularly when it is directed against<br />
a species as special and intelligent as the whale.<br />
There are however two distinct views in relation to the activities<br />
of whalers.<br />
One view put to me strongly is that all whale species under threat<br />
of extinction are protected by moratoriums imposed by the<br />
International Whaling Commission and that current policy is in line<br />
with the best principles of conservation.<br />
An alternative viewv which has also been Strongly argued to me is<br />
that the present practice of killing whales does endanger the whale<br />
species. Many other arguments have also been put on both sides.<br />
The Government believed the only fair way to resolve this issue<br />
was for an independent inquiry to look at every aspect of whaling,<br />
and I announced this course in November last year.<br />
I can now say that this Inquiry will be conducted by an eminent<br />
Australian, The Honourable Sir Sydney Frost.<br />
Sir Sydney, formerly a Queens Counsel at the Victorian Bar was<br />
Papua New Guinea's first Chief Justice until his recent retirement.<br />
We are keen to see this Inquiry start as soon as possible and I<br />
shall be meeting with Sir Sydney tomorrow. / 2 </p>
<p>cr this Inquiry he will have the support of scienti. i. c advisors<br />
and a secretariat, and I expect he will report back to the<br />
overnment in Seotember or shortly after.<br />
The Inquiry's brief is clear. It will recommend to the Government<br />
the best way Australia should carry out its policy of conserving<br />
all species of whales.<br />
Specifically, it will be asked to examine whether Australian whaling<br />
operations should continue or cease. It will examine the consequences<br />
for international whaling arising from our decision.<br />
In preparing terms of reference for this Inquiry the Government was<br />
keen to evaluate the views of all parties directly affected.<br />
We received submissions from the Cheynes Beach Whaling Company in<br />
Western Australia, the Western Australian Government, Project Jonah<br />
and Greenpeace Australia.<br />
It will be open to the Inquiry to hold public sessions and submissions<br />
will be sought from the general public, scientific experts,<br />
conservation groups and whaling interests as well as Government<br />
departments and agencies. The Inquiry will also be able to draw on<br />
international expertise.<br />
The Government's concern and involvement in the protection of<br />
Australia's wildlife much of it unique is also reflected by<br />
our strong support for the World Wildlife Fund.<br />
The World Wildlife Fund is an international organisation which<br />
raises money for projects around the world to help save endangered<br />
wildlife and habitat.<br />
It operates from a series of independent national organisations which<br />
currently exist in 26 countries.<br />
The Fund hopes Australia will be the 27th country, and the Australian<br />
Government is giving its full support and encouragement.<br />
I hope that with the establishment of the World Wildlife Fund in<br />
Australia there will be increased resources given to projects to<br />
preserve a large number of our wildlife species which are threatened<br />
with extinction.<br />
The Fund does not administer conservation projects itself, rather it<br />
applies the funds it raises to projects operated by other<br />
conservation groups.<br />
During my visit to London last June, I held discussions with<br />
Sir Peter Scott, noted ornothologist and Chairman of the World<br />
Wildlife Fund.<br />
Last Friday, I met with representatives of the Fund, including its<br />
Director-General, who reported on discussions they are presently<br />
having in Australia prior to formally establishing a branch in our<br />
country. We are hopeful that this can be achieved no later than the end of<br />
this year. / 3 </p>
<p>The Government ill, of course, continue to give every possible<br />
support and encouragement to the Fund throughout the year,<br />
including in the critical stages of its launching.<br />
As tangible evidence of our support the Government will legislate<br />
to make donations to the Fund tax deductible.<br />
M. uch of Australia's environment, our wildlife and habitat,<br />
are unique.<br />
We are determined to preserve our great heritage for present and<br />
future generations of Australians and visitors.<br />
