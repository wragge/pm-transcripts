PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE MRME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
HOWARD'S CONFIDENCE TRICK ONl SAVINGS<br />
John Howard's mail out of hNs plan to tinker with fte tax rate on savings Is more<br />
t~ i'n Just a serious campaign blunder. It Is also seriously dishonest<br />
Wr Hoard's letter apparently sent to mrilions of voters trumpets the<br />
aJncouragemrent of savings ' by cutting the tax on savir43s interest bry up to 2-5 per<br />
cant*" WhAen asked today to detail this hitheio secret policy. Mr Howard refused, saying<br />
the detail would be relesed asoon". Mir Howard may havw got away with this<br />
tactic eight monits trom the electon but eight days from t election it is a<br />
national disgraice, and an insult to the voters of Austalia.<br />
In his fumbling ellouls, to cover his error today, Mr Howard revealed the planned<br />
tax break on savings will be means-tee Yet his Wete to hundreds of<br />
thousands at voters made no mnention of this. Indeed, to compound the<br />
confidece trick. the letter described the pokiy as being part of a " plan for all of<br />
us. Moct of the people who received Mr Howard's shifty letter would reme" v no tax<br />
break whatever on their savings. Mr Howard has tried to play than off, and he<br />
has bean cauight out.<br />
Television news reports tonight have suggested the tax break will be a ftve per<br />
cent reduction In the tax rate on interest income for those on incomes below<br />
about $ 35,000. Why were these details omitted frn, Ilk Hmwdrs letter?<br />
At his amgingly em'banrassing media conference today, the following uncmplete<br />
question Was put lo AN Howard by a journalist " If you're telling voters you're<br />
going to give them savings up to 25 per cent but yours not tWing them ifs meanis<br />
tad isnm that..? r<br />
Let me complae the sentence: Isn't that dishonest?<br />
% Wa maks all of this worse is tOa Mr Howard knows he canrnot pay for such a<br />
Schieme at any price.<br />
