J., A USTRA LI<br />
PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 327<br />
12 September 1974<br />
DEATH OF FRANK GREEN<br />
Frank Green was one of the outstanding public<br />
servants of our generation. For 22 years he was an observer and<br />
recorder of some of the greatest events in the nation's history.<br />
His devotion to the cause of democracy and parliamentarygovernment,<br />
his lively involvement in the dramas and<br />
personalities of the political scene and his deep concern for<br />
the reputation of parliament and the rights of its members,<br />
endeared him to all who worked with him in the service of the<br />
Australian people. I feel a personal loss as I have been associated<br />
with the Green family since I came to Canberra with my own<br />
family in 1928. I have long valued his friendship and advice.<br />
I believe I speak for all my parliamentary<br />
colleagues in extending our deepest sympathy to his widow and<br />
family.<br />
CANBERRA. A. C. T. </p>
