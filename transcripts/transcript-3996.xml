LIBERAL PARTY RALLY. CROYDON PARK, MELBOURNE<br />
SPEECH NOTES FOR HON. MALCOLM FRASER M. P.<br />
RALLY SPEECH 0 OVEMBER 1975<br />
AUSTRALIA NEEDS AN IMMEDIATE CHANGE OF DIRECTION<br />
AN END TO THREE YEARS OF FOOLISH<br />
INCOMPETENT GOVERNMENT<br />
SO ON DECEMBER 13 YOU CAN SAY WHETHER YOU WANT YOUR<br />
WAY OF LIFE TO CONTINUE OR TO DISAPPEAR FOREVER<br />
ITS TIME TO RESTORE SOUND AND RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT<br />
TO AUSTRALIA<br />
ITS: TIME TO BEGIN ECONOMIC RECOVERY. TO ACHIEVE<br />
PROSPERITY FOR ALL AUSTRALIAHS.<br />
MR. WHITLAM IlN HIS LAST NON-POLICY SPEECH TREATED<br />
S AUSTRALIANS WITH CONTEMPT SUNDAY NOVEMBER 30. 19_ 75 r </p>
<p>2<br />
IGNORED THE PROBLEMS WORRYING ORDINARY<br />
AUSTRALIANS PRICES, HOUSING, STRIKES<br />
JOBS<br />
ALL MR, WHITLAN SAID WAS THAT HE'D BEEN WRONGED<br />
" VOTE FOR HIM BECAUSE YOU FEEL SORRY FOR HIM".<br />
HE IS THE FIRST PARTY LEADER IN AUSTRALIAN HISTORY<br />
TO MAKE. SELF PITY INTO A POLITICAL PROGRAMME.<br />
; HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT ORDINARY PEOPLE<br />
IF HE DID, HE WOULD HAVE TRIED TO RUN<br />
AUSTRALIA BETTER.<br />
WHEN OTHER AUSTRALIANS CAN'T GET A JOB HE FOUND<br />
A JOB FOR HIS SON QUICKLY ENOUGH<br />
AND BOB HAWKE IS HOLDING DOWN A SWAG OF<br />
JOBS J<br />
0 </p>
<p>3-<br />
WHO DO THESE PEOPLE REALLY CARE FOR?<br />
THE PEOPLE THEY HAVE BETRAYED<br />
OR THEMSELVES?<br />
HE AND HIS MINISTERS HAVE BEEN TOO BUSY GETTING<br />
THEMSELVES INTO'SCANDALS AND THEN TRYING TO<br />
COVER UP TO WORRY ABOUT THE STATE OF THE NATION<br />
0* WHEN WE ASKED MR. WHITLAM SOME TOUGH QUESTIONS<br />
ABOUT HIS ROLE. IN THE LOANS AFFAIR, HE SAID HE<br />
WOULDN'T ANSWER BECAUSE HE DIDN'T TRUST US.<br />
HE DOESN'T TRUST ANYONE ANYMORE'<br />
HE DOESN'T TRUST ALL THOSE MINISTERS HE SACKED<br />
HE TELLS US HE DOESN'T TRUST THE GOVERNOR GENERAL </p>
<p>NOW THAT THE QUEEN HAS WRITTEN THAT THE GOVERNOR<br />
GENERAL HAD EVERY RIGHT TO ACT AS HE DID<br />
HE PROBABLY DOESN'T EVEN TRUST THE QUEEN<br />
HE CERTAINLY DOESN'T TRUST THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE<br />
WHEN. PARLIAENT SAID HE HAD TO FACE THE PEOPLE<br />
HE TRIED TO RULE WITHOUT PARLIAMENT.<br />
HE TRIED TO TAKE AUSTRALIA THE FIRST<br />
STEP TOWARDS DICTATORSHIP.<br />
. HE IS'THE FIRST PRIME MINISTER WE HAVE EVER HAD WHO<br />
SAID THAT AN ELECTIONi WAS UNDEMOCRATIC,<br />
NOW HE IS POSING AS THE GREAT DEMOCRAT.<br />
WHO ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE APPEARING ON THE SAME<br />
PLATFORMS AS THE LABOR PARTY THESE DAYS? 0 0 0 </p>
<p>-REMEMBER THE DAYS WHEN THEY TRIED TO HIDE<br />
THE UNITY TICKETS?<br />
NOW LABOR PARTY LEADERS. ARE APPEALING<br />
WITH COMMUNIST UNION LEADERS ON PUBLIC.<br />
PLATFORMS PARADING AS DEFENDERS OF DEMOCRACY<br />
HE WANTS TO GET RID OF THE SENATE BECAUSE TlHE<br />
SENATE PROTECTS AUSTRALIA AGAINST SOME OF THE<br />
MOST DANGEROUS LEGISLATION EVER INTRODUC.<br />
THIS LEGISLATION WOULD HAVE ESTABLISHED:<br />
A GIANT GOVERNMENT PURCHASING MONOPOLY WHICH<br />
COULD FORCE LABOR'S POLICIES. ON ANY BUSINESS<br />
. WHICH DEALS WITH THE GOVERNMENT,<br />
A POWERFUL NATIONAL POLICE FORCE WHICH COULD<br />
POSE A SERIOUS THREAT TO CIVIL LIBERTIES,<br />
S </p>
<p>-6-<br />
THESE BILLS, AND OTHERS LIKE THEI, ARE A THREAT<br />
TO AUSTRALIAN DEiOCRACY.<br />
AND THE MAN WHO SUPPORTS THOSE BILLS SAYS HE IS<br />
DEFENiDING DEMOCRACY.<br />
HE SAYS HE WILL STAND ON HIS RECORD.<br />
SHEIS STANDING ON-HIS RECORD BECAUSE HE HOPES<br />
AUSTRALIANS WON'T SEE IT WITH HIM STANDING ON IT.<br />
WHICH RECORD IS HE STANDING ON:-<br />
SRECORD UNEMPLOYMENT HIGHEST . UEMPLOYHENT SINCE<br />
DEPRESSION.<br />
. RECORD INTEREST RATES.-HIGHEST SINCE FEDERATION.<br />
RECORD STRIKES WORST EVER $ 256 MILLION IN<br />
WAGES LOST THROUGH STRIKES,<br />
RECORD INFLATION WORST PRICE RISES IN OUR HISTORY. S<br />

NEW ZEALAND HAS JUST THROWN OUT ITS LABOR GOVERNMENT<br />
WITH A LANDSLIDE TO THE NATIONAL PARTY.<br />
THERE HAS BEEN A SWING OF MORE THAN EIGHT PER CENT<br />
AGAINST NEW ZEALAND LABOR. AT ONE STAGE LAST NIGHT<br />
THERE WAS EVEN-A POSSIBILITY THAT THE NEW. ZEALAND<br />
LABOR LEADER MR. ROLLINGS WOULD LOSE HIS OWN<br />
ELECTORATE OF WALLACE"<br />
-THE LATEST COUNTINGS THIS MORNING INDICATES THAT THE<br />
NATIONAL PARTY-WILL HAVE 53 OF THE 87. SEATS IN'THE<br />
; NEW ZEALAND PARLIAMENT. THAT IS A MASSIVE CHANGE<br />
FROM A LABOR GOVERNMENT WITH A MAJORITY OF 23 SEATS<br />
BEFORE YESTERDAY'S ELECTION.<br />
' BOTH LEADERS.. IN NEW ZEALAND HAVE AGREED THAT THE STATE<br />
OF THE ECONOMY-INCLUDING AN INFLATION RATE OF<br />
APPROXIMATELY 15 PER CENT WAS UPPERMOST IN THE VOTERS<br />
MINDS. r<br />
LJd ~ y </p>
<p>-6BI<br />
HAVE SENT A MESSAGE OF CONGRATULATION TO. THE<br />
NATIONAL PARTY LEADER MR, MULDOON TODAY,<br />
THE NEW ZEALAND RESULT REVEALS OVERWHELMING<br />
REJECTION OF A SOCIALIST PARTY WHICH SHOWED IT<br />
COULD NOT MANAGE A MODERN ECONOMY,<br />
HOWEVER IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT THE ECONOMIC*<br />
SITUATION RESULTING FROM THE MISMANAGEMENT OF A<br />
SOCIALIST GOVERNMENT WAS NOT AS.. BAD. IN. NEW<br />
ZEALAND AS IT IS IN AUSTRALIA UNDER A SOCIALIST<br />
PARTY, NOT ONLY HAVE THE SOCIALISTS MADE A BIGGER ECONOMIC<br />
MESS IN AUSTRALIA BUT NEW ZEALAND HAS NOT SUFFERED<br />
THE DISHONESTY DECEIT AND DECEPTION IN GOVERNMENT<br />
STHAT WE HAVEEXPERIENCED IN AUSTRALIA.<br />
THE LESSON IS THAT IN BOTH COUNTRIES LABOR PARTIES.<br />
HAVE PROVED TO BE. INCOMPETENT, I<br />
~~ ul </p>
<p>-6CNEW<br />
ZEALAND SWUNG TO LABOR IN 1972 AND MASSIVELY<br />
AGAINST LABOR IN 1975, I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THE<br />
SAME RESULT IN AUSTRALIA ON DECEMBER 13.<br />
