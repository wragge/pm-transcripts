COAG has today agreed to fast track the removal of red tape for environmental assessments and approvals, after listening to the requests of business.</p>
<p>At the inaugural meeting of the Business Advisory Forum yesterday, business leaders raised delays in environmental approvals and assessments as a major cost. These delays, due to duplicative processes across federal and state systems, can take businesses months or even years to resolve.</p>
<p>Today COAG acted on that concern and the Gillard Government and states and territories agreed to fast track arrangements to use state assessment and approval processes by March 2013.</p>
<p>The removal of these regulations will protect the environment whilst ending the costly delays that result from double-handling and duplication.</p>
<p>COAG today established across-jurisdictional Taskforce to develop the policy and timetable for this new deregulation agenda, to be chaired by the Secretary of the Commonwealth Department of Finance and Deregulation.</p>
<p>COAG also agreed to progress key issues raised at the Business Advisory Forum and asked the Taskforce to provide advice to the next COAG meeting on the specific reforms.</p>
<p>In particular, the Taskforce will provide urgent advice in advance of the next COAG meeting on how to fast track and rationalise carbon reduction and energy efficiency schemes.</p>
<p>COAG also directed the Taskforce to prepare a comprehensive report on the red-tape challenge to identify examples of burdensome or unnecessary regulations that frustrate businesses on a day to day basis.</p>
<p>To ensure that the benefits of these important regulatory reforms are sustained, a National Productivity Compact has also been agreed between the Commonwealth, states and territories and business.</p>
<p>This Compact will set out a high-level statement on principles for effective regulation and reform, with the plan to finalise this by the next Business Advisory Forum to be held in the second half of 2012. </p>
