    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE........... </p>
<p>Thank you very much for that very warm introduction. To the State Minister</p>
<p> for Research and Technology, and the State Minister for State Enterprises,</p>
<p> other very distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. I am particularly</p>
<p> delighted that it was possible to include in this my fifth visit to Indonesia</p>
<p> as Prime Minister and my eighth visit in different capacities, this luncheon</p>
<p> of the Australian Indonesian Business Council because it gives me an opportunity</p>
<p> to say a few things in two areas. It gives me an opportunity to say something</p>
<p> having just come from a meeting of the World Economic Forum in New York,</p>
<p> or colloquially called Davos in New York, an opportunity to reflect upon</p>
<p> attitudes towards economic growth and recovery in the United States; but</p>
<p> also and most importantly to stress the critical importance of growing</p>
<p> business relations and economic links between Australia and Indonesia</p>
<p> to the bilateral relationship between our two countries.</p>
<p>We are all aware that for a combination of circumstances the relationship</p>
<p> between our two countries has gone through at a political level some strains</p>
<p> and some difficulties in recent years. But we also know that sustained</p>
<p> by very strong person to person links in so many areas, and this large</p>
<p> gathering of people here today at this luncheon is a testament to the</p>
<p> strength of those personal links in the area of business activity and</p>
<p> business investment. We know that the basic infrastructure of the relationship</p>
<p> has remained very strong because it is the person to person links in the</p>
<p> end that drive a relationship more than anything else and it';s a</p>
<p> happy fact that as I speak to you today there are some 18,000 Indonesian</p>
<p> students studying in Australia, more than from any other country in the</p>
<p> world and it';s that kind of linkage which over the years has been</p>
<p> the constant in the relationship between our two countries.</p>
<p>May I say that on this visit of mine I have been very graciously received</p>
<p> by the President and all of the senior ministers of her Government. We';ve</p>
<p> had an opportunity of talking about the areas of similarity, the areas</p>
<p> of debate, and the areas of difference that those discussions have been</p>
<p> conducted in a spirit of wanting to achieve better outcomes and of recognising</p>
<p> that geography and circumstance and the fact that we are regional neighbours</p>
<p> means that our two societies are with each other forever and there is</p>
<p> a responsibility in charge on all of us to do what we can to contribute</p>
<p> to the maintenance and the development of very strong relations between</p>
<p> our two countries.</p>
<p>Indonesia suffered grievously and in my view unfairly in many respects</p>
<p> from the impact of the Asian economic downturn in 1997. And I was very</p>
<p> pleased as Prime Minister of Australia that we were able to provide material</p>
<p> and valuable assistance in relation to the IMF package in 1997, and we</p>
<p> were also able to advocate to the international monetary fund at that</p>
<p> time a more realistic approach to the reform process that was to be undertaken</p>
<p> in Indonesia. And once again economic circumstances have combined to put</p>
<p> pressure on Indonesia';s economy at a time when it is going through</p>
<p> a process, along with the political structure of this country, a process</p>
<p> of great change and great reform.</p>
<p>All economies of the world now are inevitably influenced by what occurs</p>
<p> in the United State more than at any time that I can recall in the almost</p>
<p> thirty years that I';ve been in public life. The influence of the</p>
<p> United States politically and economically is strong and dominant. I believe</p>
<p> that the American economy is already in the early stages of recovery.</p>
<p> It may not be as strong a recovery as many would want but a recovery nonetheless.</p>
<p> And I certainly found in New York both in the discussions I had with the</p>
<p> Secretary of the United States Treasury â Mr Paul O';Neill,</p>
<p> and other senior people in the business and financial community, not universal</p>
<p> but nonetheless majority, optimism about the future of the American economy</p>
<p> and a belief that the strength of consumer spending underpinned by the</p>
<p> very low interest rates, historically almost low interest rates, than</p>
<p> America has enjoyed in recent times, and the capacity because of the increase</p>
<p> in wealth of so many middle class Americans to leverage off that increase</p>
<p> to support their consumer spending there is a belief that an economic</p>
<p> recovery is on the way.</p>
<p>Naturally of course the American economy and the world economy took an</p>
<p> enormous confidence hit on the 11th of September and I have no doubt that</p>
<p> the objectives of those who perpetrated that foul deed included a desire</p>
<p> to harm and damage the exuberant economic confidence of the United States</p>
<p> and of the American people. The good thing that I can report to those</p>
<p> who care about investment not only here in Indonesia but all around the</p>
<p> world, the good thing that I can report from the time that I spent in</p>
<p> the United States in New York is that the exuberance and the confidence</p>
<p> of the American people, although very seriously assaulted on the 11th</p>
<p> of September, is nonetheless still there and their determination in their</p>
<p> commitment to economic growth and enterprise, their determination to continue</p>
<p> and to resume the patterns of growth that existed until last year should</p>
<p> not be doubted. So I came away from that meeting with a great sense of</p>
<p> hope and optimism about the United States economy.</p>
<p>And I can also say to you today as Prime Minister of Australia that I</p>
<p> believe the economy of Australia in this calendar year will grow very</p>
<p> strongly. Some such as the Economist magazine predict that our growth</p>
<p> could be greater than that of any other industrialised country. Whether</p>
<p> it reaches that level or falls a little short of it it will nonetheless</p>
<p> be the case that we will experience very significant economic growth.</p>
<p> I';m very happy to report that the last year has seen a steady growth</p>
<p> in the trade flows between Australia and Indonesia. There';s been</p>
<p> a very healthy growth in both exports and imports. I recognise that as</p>
<p> I am reminded by my Indonesian ministerial friends that there is an imbalance</p>
<p> in the pattern of trade and one of the things that we committed ourselves</p>
<p> to in our discussions yesterday was to ensure that there were no unnecessary</p>
<p> impediments between trade and investment flows between our two nations.</p>
<p>The Australian economy has benefited greatly over the last few years</p>
<p> from a series of economic reforms some of which were undertaken by the</p>
<p> government of Australia before I became Prime Minister and many of which</p>
<p> have been undertaken by my Government over the last almost six years.</p>
<p> In particular in the area of labour market reform we have made changes</p>
<p> which have boosted the productivity of the Australian economy, made it</p>
<p> more competitive, and that productivity boost has enabled us to maintain</p>
<p> a faster rate of economic growth than has been possible over earlier years.</p>
<p> For many years the great challenge of the Australian economy was to try</p>
<p> and find a way of taking the speed limits off economic growth. We experienced</p>
<p> the unhappy phenomenon of having a period of economic growth which led</p>
<p> to a period of inflation or a blow out in our current account deficit</p>
<p> which necessitated the imposition of a more restrictive monetary or fiscal</p>
<p> policy which in turn suppressed economic growth. But by undertaking structural</p>
<p> reform, by first of all floating our exchange rate which proved to be</p>
<p> quite important in relation to Australia';s adjustment to the Asian</p>
<p> economic downturn in 1997 and more recently under my Government bringing</p>
<p> about a fiscal surplus position with our budget in recent years, major</p>
<p> labour market reforms, significant reforms to Australia';s taxation</p>
<p> system which represent one of the biggest systemic changes to our economy</p>
<p> in recent years. These things have all combined to create a situation</p>
<p> where some of the speed limits that used to be there on Australia';s</p>
<p> economic growth are no longer there.</p>
<p>I also believe that we have benefited very greatly from a very stable</p>
<p> legal and political climate in Australia. Certainly our political environment</p>
<p> is robust and combative as the Australians and many others in the audience</p>
<p> will know, but it is nonetheless a stable political climate. The certainty</p>
<p> of corporate governance and the clarity of our legal system, all of those</p>
<p> things are very important.</p>
<p>And I agree that increasingly in this borderless world, the use the frequent</p>
<p> clich, and a world of globalisation, countries with predictable and stable</p>
<p> codes of corporate governance, prudential supervision and legal systems</p>
<p> will be the beneficiaries of increasing levels of foreign investment.</p>
<p>When I was in New York there was much debate of course about the impact</p>
<p> of globalisation, there was much debate about the impact of the tragic</p>
<p> events of last September on how nations relate to each other, and how</p>
<p> the process of globalisation might be affected. I think a very strong</p>
<p> view emerged from those to whom I spoke that we must do more if we believe</p>
<p> in globalisation to explain the benefits, to offer the critics of a more</p>
<p> open economic system around the world, are allowed to propagate falsehoods</p>
<p> all to infrequently those who understand its benefits are silent or inarticulate</p>
<p> in expressing the benefits and explaining the advantages. The reality</p>
<p> is that developing countries do, despite some of the anti-globalisation</p>
<p> rhetoric, the reality is that developing countries do have much to gain,</p>
<p> if globalisation involves as I believe it should, the opening up of markets</p>
<p> for greater access to the products and the services of developing countries.</p>
<p>It';s frequently been said that if the protective trade barriers</p>
<p> of the industrialised world were to be removed, then the value of that</p>
<p> one single act to the wealth and the export income from developing countries</p>
<p> would multiply by many times the existing level of foreign aid from those</p>
<p> industrialised countries to the developing world. And if in fact you look</p>
<p> at the experience and the history of nations over the last forty to fifty</p>
<p> years, comparing the experience of those that have started off being under-developed</p>
<p> with others of a similar situation, the first group adopting more open</p>
<p> economic policies and the second group adopting more closed economic policies,</p>
<p> the first group has turned out to be infinitely more successful.</p>
<p>I recognise that the process of economic change and economic adjustment</p>
<p> is very difficult in a nation such as Indonesia. I know the importance</p>
<p> to the many citizens of this country of a lot of the arrangements that</p>
<p> have been in place for many years. But as a politician of now some twenty-seven</p>
<p> years in the Australian Parliament, and almost six years as Prime Minister,</p>
<p> I know in my own country how resistant many people are to change, and</p>
<p> how difficult it is to explain the longer term virtues of change and reform,</p>
<p> particularly if that involves some short term cost. And I do empathise</p>
<p> very strongly with the Indonesian people, the Indonesian Government, and</p>
<p> those in the business community who are seeking to lead this country';s</p>
<p> transformation in so many areas.</p>
<p>And I want to leave you with my most important remark today, and that</p>
<p> is, that in that process of change and reform which is so very important</p>
<p> to the people of Indonesia, and to the people of this region, the people</p>
<p> of Indonesia do have a firm and constant and understanding friend in Australia.</p>
<p> We are a country that values the relationship we have with Indonesia.</p>
<p> We have had our differences, and will have our differences in the future.</p>
<p> But I believe that those who carry influence in both societies understand</p>
<p> that being neighbours and because of shared history and shared experiences,</p>
<p> we do have a future together, and a future that I know people in both</p>
<p> countries want to build on and make more fruitful, and I hope that in</p>
<p> a small way my visit on this occasion has contributed to building ever</p>
<p> closer links between our two communities.</p>
<p>But it is very important that what this room represents, and that is</p>
<p> the economic dynamism of the relationship, that has a very prominent part</p>
<p> because without investment, without economic growth, without the beneficial</p>
<p> effects of entrepreneurial risk taking, without achieving a proper balance</p>
<p> between the role of the state and the role of the private sector, growing</p>
<p> living standards and reaping the benefits globalisation will not be available</p>
<p> to Indonesia. I know there are many in the Australian business community</p>
<p> who are keen to support Indonesia';s future economic growth. Like</p>
<p> all people in business, they like a good return, and that is understandable.</p>
<p> They like certainty and predictability. They respect the efforts being</p>
<p> made to bring about change and reform, and at a political level, I look</p>
<p> forward to better and growing relationships between our two nations. And</p>
<p> I say that sure in the knowledge that our association which has now been</p>
<p> very long standing, Australia having been one of the very first supporters</p>
<p> of the independence movement in Indonesia in the 1940';s, that it</p>
<p> is an association that is built on very sound foundations. And I am delighted</p>
<p> to be back here in Jakarta, and I wish all the members of the Council</p>
<p> the very best of good fortune.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
