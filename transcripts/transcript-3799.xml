SUGGESTED LINE FOR LAUNCESTON flATRICULATION COLLEGE<br />
THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION INTRODUCED A VERY ORIGINAL<br />
NOTE INTO THE CAMPAIGN WHEN HE SPOKE TO THE TASMANIAN<br />
PRESS CLUB HERE IN LAUNCESTON ON TUESDAY. HE RAISED<br />
THE ISSUE OF CIVIL LIBERTIES AND INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS.<br />
NOW THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. IT IS AN ISSUE<br />
THAT WILL BE CENTRAL TO THE POLITICAL DEBATE IN<br />
AUSTRALIA AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD FOR THE REST<br />
OF YOUR LIVES, THE NOVEL THING ON TUESDAY WAS THAT<br />
IT SHOULD BE RAISED BY MR FRASER IN THE WAY HE DID<br />
IN THE FORM OF AN ATTACK UPON THE LABOR GOVERNMENT.<br />
YOU ARE EO:_' G TO HEAR A GREAT DEAL ALONG THIS LINE<br />
BEFORE Th-E I-EXT GENERAL ELECTION WHEN MOST OF YOU<br />
WILL BE A-B31-TO EXERCISE THE MOST BASIC OF ALL<br />
DEMOCRATIC R: GHTS THE RIGHT TO VOTE.<br />
THAT RIGHT TO VOTE AT 18 W'J WAS GIVEN BY THE VERY<br />
FIRST PIECE. OF LEGISLATION INTRODUCED IN THE FIRST<br />
SESSION OF PARLIAMENT AFTER WE FIRST BECAME THE GOVERNMENT.<br />
ANY OF YOU WHO ARE VOTING ON SATURDAY HAVE THAT RIGHT<br />
BECAUSE A LABOR GOVERNMENT GAVE IT TO YOU AFTER 23 YEARS<br />
OF REFUSAL TO ALLOW IT BY THE LIBERALS., NDIVIDUAL<br />
RIGHTS AND HUMAN FREEDOMS ARE THE MOST PRECIOUS THINGS<br />
WE HAVE. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
BUT WOULDN'T YOU SAY. THAT PERHAPS THE MOST SACRED<br />
OF THEM ALL, WOULDN T YOU PUT AT THE TOP OF THE LIST<br />
YOUR RIGHT NOT TO BE DRAFTED INTO MILITARY SERVICE<br />
THAT IS, YOUR RIGHT OVER THE USE OF YOUR OWN BODY?<br />
MR FRASER WAS MINISTER FOR THE ARMY AND THEN MINISTER<br />
FOR DEFENCE UNTIL HE FELL OUT WITH JOHN GORTON AND<br />
DESTROYED HIM IN A GOVERNMENT WHICH INTRODUCED THE<br />
FIRST PEACE TIME CONSCRIPTION IN AUSTRALIA'S<br />
HISTORY, IF l'\ R FRASER WAS SrILL IN GOVERNMENT,<br />
EVERY BOY IN THIS ROOM WOULD BE LIABLE FOR TWO YEARS<br />
COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE. IT IS ALL TOO EASILY<br />
FORGOTTEN, IT IS ALL TOO EASILY FORGOTTEN THAT<br />
MORE THAN HALF OF THOSE WHO WERE KILLED IN VIETNAM<br />
THE FORGOTTEN FIVE HUNDRED WERE CONSCRIPTS AND<br />
THAT TWO-THIRDS OF THOSE WHO SERVED IN VIETNAM<br />
THE FORGOTTEN , qAR WERE CONSCRIPTS. z<br />
FOR ALL BUT 18 MONTHS OF OUR WRETCHED INVOLVEMENT IN<br />
THAT WRETCHED WAR, MR FRASER PRESIDED AS ARMY MINISTER<br />
AND DEFENCE MINISTER OVER THE CONSCRIPT SYSTEM,<br />
THE FIRST ACTION LANCE BARNARD TOOK AS A MINISTER ON<br />
THE DAY HE AND I FORMED THE GOVERNMENT WAS TO END<br />
CONSCRIPTION, WE DIDN'T WAIT FOR THE PARLIAMENT TO<br />
MEET, IT WAS DONE BY THE STROKE OF A PEN. </p>
<p>7<br />
ON THE SAME DAY WE ENDED THE LAST VESTIGES OF<br />
AUSTRALIA' S MILITARY COM" MITMENT IN INDO-CHINA AND<br />
WE FREED FROM PRISON ANY HEN WHO WERE SERVING TERMS<br />
FOR REFUSING MILITARY SERVICEoWE WIPED FROM THE<br />
RECORDS THEIR CONVICTIONS SO THAT THEY WOULD NOT<br />
SPEND A LIFETIME OF CIVIL HANDICAP BECAUSE OF THEIR<br />
CONVICTION THEIR CONVICTION IN BOTH SENSES OF THE WORDCONVICTION<br />
AS CRIMINALS FOR STANDING UP FOR THEIR<br />
CONVICTIONS. DON'T FORGET VIETNAM -IT WAS A WAR THE LIBERALS<br />
FOISTED UPON AUSTRALIA AND AS THE RECORD OF HOW WE<br />
GOT INVOLVED, WHICH I AS AN INDEPENDENT HISTORIAN<br />
COMPILED AND PUBLISHED A FORTNIGHT AGO SHOWSA<br />
WAR WE GOT INTO THROUGH LIBERAL LIES AND LIBERAL<br />
DECEIT AND LIBERAL STUPIDITY. DON'T FORGET<br />
CONSCRIPTION OR WHAT IT MEANS TO YOUR CIVIL<br />
LIBERTIES, ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE OF ITS GREATEST<br />
ADVOCATES, rFIR FRASER, TALKS ABOUT FREEDOM.<br />
LET ME MENTION SOME OTHER BASIC RIGHTS. IS THERE<br />
ANYTHING MORE FUNDAMENTAL THAN EQUALITY BEFORE THE<br />
LAW? THERE CAN.'. BE NO EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW<br />
UNLESS THERE IS EQUALITY OF ACCESS TO THE COURTS.<br />
WITHOUT THAT EQUALITY THERE WILL ALWAYS BE ONE LAW<br />
FOR THE RICH AND ANOTHER FOR THE POOR. WE HAVE<br />
SET UP THE LEGAL AID SERVICE TO PROVIDE THAT EQUALITY. </p>
<p>THERE IS THE BASIC QUESTION OF RIGHTS FPR ABORIGINES.<br />
T. SMART ALECKa-4v. HAD c. E;<br />
, Oi4t R JOKE AT TASMANIAN EXPENSE BY CHI-ACKING<br />
THE VISIT HERE DURING THE CAMPAIGN BY MY MINISTER<br />
FOR ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS, LES JOHNSON, T THOUGHT<br />
THAT THERE WERE NO ABORIGINES IN TASMANIA BECAUSE<br />
OF THE DREADFUL THINGS WE DID OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.<br />
IN FACT THERE ARE IMPORTANT PROGRAMS OPERATING IN<br />
THIS AREA FOR ABORIGINES. BUT THE POINT I WANT<br />
TO MAKE IS, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR HISTORY,<br />
AUSTRALIA HAS A GOVERNMENT WHICH IS TRYING TO RESTORE<br />
BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS TO ABORIGINES AND TO REPAIR<br />
AUSTRALIA'S REPUTATION,<br />
ANOTHER -AS: C HUMAN RIGHT IS POLITICAL AND NATIONAL<br />
INDEPENDEiCE,. ON 16 SEPTEMBER WE SHALL BE GIVING<br />
INDEPENDENCE TO MORE THAN TWO MILLION HUMAN BEINGS,<br />
THE TWO A: D A HALF MILLION PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE<br />
WORLD'S LARGEST REMAINING COLONY, PAPUA NEW GUINEA.<br />
FOR MOST OF THE YEARS THE LIBERALS WERE IN POWER,<br />
UNTIL 1971 AT THE EARLIEST, THE MINISTER FOR WHAT<br />
WAS THEN CALLED EXTERNAL TERRITORIES USED TO TALK ABOUT<br />
INDEPENDENCE FOR PAPUA NEW GUINEA IN TERMS OF THE<br />
TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY IF THEN, TALK ABOUT ALL<br />
POWER BEING VESTED IN CANBERRA' </p>
<p>IT WILL BE ONE OF THE PROUDEST THINGS OF MY LIFE<br />
TO HAVE ACHIEVED WHAT A MERE 5 YEARS AGO WAS DENOUNCED<br />
AS WILDLY IRRESPONSIBLE TO DIVEST CANBERRA OF<br />
AUTHORITY OVER THE LIVES OF TWO AND A HALF<br />
MILLION PEOPLE.<br />
IN THE MATTER OF MOST IMMEDIATE CONCERN TO YOU<br />
AT THE MOMENT YOUR OWN EDUCATION, IS THERE ANY<br />
RIGHT MORE IMPORTANT THAN EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY<br />
FOR A DECENT EDUCATION? WHEN HE WASN'T MINISTER<br />
FOR ARMY PRESIDING OVER CONSCRIPTION OR MINISTER<br />
FOR DEFENCE PRESIDING OVER THE WAR IN VIETNAM,<br />
MR FRASER WAS MINISTER FOR EDUCATION,<br />
HE WAS V~_ FIN HIS OPPOSITION TO THE NEEDS CONCEPT<br />
IN EDUCAT:,.., HICH HAS BEEN PUT INTO EFFECT BY THE<br />
SCHOOLS CM SOI HE WAS OPPOSED TO THE SCHOOLS<br />
COMMISSION LTSELF, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF WHICH HAS<br />
TRANSFORMED -=--UCATION IN OUR NATION, HE WAS OPPOSED<br />
TO FREE EDUCATION AT UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES OF<br />
ADVANCED EDUCATION. THESE ARE THINGS WE HAVE<br />
ESTABLISHED, THINGS WHICH HAVE GUARANTEED TO EVERY<br />
AUSTRALIAN 30Y AND GIRL, A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF<br />
EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
THIS IS INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S YEAR. ONI E OF THE<br />
GREAT RIGHTS THAT WOMEN AROUND THE WORLD HAVE<br />
BEEN FIGHTING FOR FOR GENERATIONS IS EQUAL PAY<br />
FOR EQUAL WORK. ALMOST ALONE OF THE ADVANCED<br />
WEALTHY COUNTRIES. AUSTRALIA UNDER THs LIBERALS/<br />
REFUSED THIS RIGHT TO WOMEN. WE ESTABLISHED THAT<br />
RIGHT.<br />
YOU HAV! E TO JUDGE WHETHER THAT IS A RIGHT WORTH<br />
HAVING, BECAUSE IT DOES BRING WITH IT SOME DIFFICULTIES,<br />
YOU HAVE BEEN HEARING A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THE DAMAGE<br />
OUR TARIFF CUT OF 25% DID TO THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY<br />
HERE IN LAUNCESTON, THE FACT IS THAT THE REAL REASON<br />
WHY THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY DEVELOPED IN PLACES LIKE<br />
LAUNCESTON WAS THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO CALL UPON GROUPS<br />
OF UNSKILLED'WOMEN WORKERS WHO. WOULD ACCEPT LOW WAGES<br />
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO OTHER FORM OF EMPLOYMENT AVAILABLE.<br />
ONCE THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL PAY WAS ESTABLISHED BY<br />
my GOVERNMENT THIS NO LONGER APPLIED. THE TARIFF<br />
CUTS HAVE BEEN A MARGINAL FACTOR IN FORCING THE<br />
vyfp<br />
RESTRUCTING OF THE AUSTRALIAN TEXTILE INDUSTRY.<br />
THE TRUTH IS THAT IF ONE TRIED TO RESTORE THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
TEXTILE INDUSTRY TO ITS EARLIER SITUATION, ONE WOULD HAVE<br />
TO TAKE AWAY EQUAL PAY NOT JUST IN TEXTILE BUT IN<br />
ALL INDUSTRY, FOR ALL WOMEN. </p>
