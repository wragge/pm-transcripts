FOR MEDIA EMBARGOED 10.00 AM, 17 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
The Chairman of the Australian selectors, Lawrie Sawle, and<br />
I have chosen the following players for the Prime Minister's<br />
XI team to play England at Manuka Oval on 4 December:<br />
Allan Border ( Captain)<br />
Trevor Bayliss<br />
Michael Bevan<br />
Darren Lehmann<br />
Craig McDermott<br />
Mark McPhee<br />
Paul Reiffel<br />
Gavin Robertson<br />
Joe Scuderi<br />
Rod Tucker<br />
Mike Veletta<br />
Shane McNamee ( 12th man) Queensland New South Wales<br />
New South Wales<br />
Victoria Queensland Western Australia<br />
Victoria Tasmania South Australia<br />
Tasmania Western Australia<br />
ACT<br />
I feel this side has a very good balance of experience and<br />
youth, and is proof of the depth of talent in Australian<br />
first-class cricket.-<br />
The experience of players like Allan Border, Craig McDermott<br />
and Mike Veletta will be invaluable to the side, with<br />
Veletta's dual role as a keeper/ batsman providing extra<br />
strength to the upper-order batting.<br />
The team also contains a wealth of potential, with proven<br />
young players; Trevor Bayliss, Darren Lehmannn, Gavin<br />
Robertson, Rod Tucker, Mark McPhee and Paul Reiffel giving<br />
it formidable strength.<br />
The influence of the AIS Commonwealth Bank Cricket Academy<br />
continues to show through, with two graduates Joe Scuderi<br />
and Michael B~ evan in the side again.<br />
I am confident this team will provide stiff opposition to an<br />
English side anxious to prove it is world-class, and the<br />
players we have chosen for the Prime Minister's XI are sure<br />
to provide skilful and entertaining cricket. </p>
