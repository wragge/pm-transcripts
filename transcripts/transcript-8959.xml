    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that <strong>Australia Today Indonesia ' 94</strong>, the largest trade and cultural promotion ever undertaken by Australia in Indonesia, will be held in Jakarta next year. The promotion is sponsored by the Australia Abroad Council and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>
<p>Australia attaches a high priority to its relationship with Indonesia, a close neighbour and friend. Australia has already put considerable work into developing the relationship, including through my visit to Indonesia last year, the establishment of the Australia- Indonesia Ministerial Forum ( which met for the first time in late 1992) and the work of the Australia Indonesia Institute in increasing people-to-people ties and mutual understanding.</p>
<p>Indonesia was Australia's tenth largest trading partner in 1992 with Australia exporting $ 137 billion worth of goods and services to Indonesia and importing $ 1.2 billion from Indonesia. Since 1990 the valuc of imports from Indonesia has increased by 138 percent and the value of exports by 27 percent.</p>
<p>Australia Today Indonesia ' 94 will provide an opportunity to showcase Australian achievements in trade and industry, science and technology, education, the arts, sports, media and film, tourism and other areas of distinctive Australian capability. Austrlia Today Indonesia ' 94 will also establish new links between our two countries and promote the continuing strong ties between us in a broad range of areas.</p>
<p>Australia has much to offer Indonesia. Our advanced industrial, scientifc and technological capabilities position us well to develop partnerships with business, government and educational organisations in Indonesia. The promotion will also develop the understanding between our peoples through a cultural program that includes per-forming and visual arts, film and television, sports and popular entertainment.</p>
<p>Australia Today Indonesia ' 94 will be held mainly in Jakarta over June-July 1994 with some events in Surabaya, Yogyakarta and other Indonesian cities. A major Trade and Industry exhibition at the Hilton Convention Centre in Jakarta will provide the centrepiece of the promotion.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government has provided $ 2 million to the promotion and State and Territory Governments arc also closely involved. Many companies are exhibiting and supporting the events.</p>
