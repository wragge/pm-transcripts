PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS AT THE OPENING OF DOWELL'S FACTORY, HAMILTON<br />
It is a great pleasure to be here today to open Dowell's new factory<br />
and warehouse on the Hamilton Industrial Estate. I understand that<br />
Dowell is a company of great initiative. Indeed, such is their<br />
initiative that although I am opening this factory today it has in<br />
fact been in operation since April. So I suppose these few words<br />
should be called my re-opening remarks.<br />
This is a very impressive factory costing around $ 200,000.<br />
It will be involved mainly in the assembly and sales of aluminium.<br />
building products for Western Victoria and South East South<br />
Australia. The factory is a positive expression of confidence<br />
in the future of the Australian economy and in the future of the<br />
city of Hamilton.<br />
The Government has actively contributed to the creation of an<br />
attractive climate for investment through our economic policies<br />
and our encouragement of soundly based developments in the manufacturing<br />
industry.<br />
Two years ago, the economy was at a standstill. Today, considerable<br />
progress has been made in establishing the conditions necessary for<br />
sustained economic growth. Notable achievements have been made in<br />
the fight against prosperity' s main enemy inflation.<br />
The CPI increase for June was the lowest June CPI increase<br />
for five years. Overall, this brings the inflation rate to 10.2%<br />
excluding Medibank compared with 15.4% over the previous year.<br />
Our growth rate has picked up again; investment has increased;<br />
and company profitability has improved.<br />
A profitable private sector is in the interest of all sections of<br />
the community. It benefits everyone. It is the key to Australia's<br />
economic prosperity and to improved job opportunities. The<br />
Government has taken direct action to assist and promote the<br />
private sector's recovery. We have introduced a generous<br />
investment allowance and other tax reforms for industry. Controls<br />
on capital inflows have been relaxed and this should assist many<br />
companies to raise overseas capital. We have acted to ensure that<br />
Australian industries are not subject to unreasonable disruptive<br />
change. and that high levels of imports do not exacerbate<br />
unemployment in industries sensitive to import competition.<br />

A number of innovative schemes have been introduced to alleviate<br />
unemployment and the results have been encouraging. The<br />
Community Youth Support Scheme now involves some 15,000 young<br />
people. The NEAT scheme has been expanded to cover 18,000<br />
people, three quarters of whom have found a job at the end of<br />
their term under the scheme. NEAT's special youth employment<br />
training programme is particularly successful. It subsidises<br />
employers to hire young people who have been unemployed for a<br />
lengthy period of time. Over 70% of them retain their job when<br />
the subsidy expires.<br />
The CRAFT scheme for promoting apprenticeships has also been a<br />
significant success. The figures for the financial year just ended<br />
are now available. They show that this scheme now covers over<br />
41,500 apprentices, and apprenticeships throughout Australia are<br />
up 9% on last year. This scheme is still in its early developmental<br />
stage, and even further increases can be expected this year.<br />
There is also the Relocation Assistance Scheme to help those who<br />
have to move to another area to find employment. These schemes are<br />
having an impact on this plant. I understand that four of the first<br />
six employees to be taken on by Dowell in Hamilton get assistance<br />
from them. Two junior employees get assistance under the Special<br />
Youth Training Programme, and two adult employees are receiving<br />
assistance under the NEAT scheme.<br />
All Governments Commonwealth, State and Local have an important<br />
part to play in encouraging the productive private sector. In<br />
building this factory Dowell has received assistance from the<br />
Victorian Department of Decentralisation.<br />
The City of Hamilton is also to be commended for assisting financially,<br />
helping with the design and supervising construction, and I<br />
understand tha-t one of the important factors leading to Dowell's<br />
decision to locate a new plant in Hamilton was the positive<br />
attitude of local government.<br />
But while two governments can do a great deal to provide the<br />
environment in which the private sector can prosper, business<br />
must be willing to grasp the opportunities. Dowell is one of the<br />
increasing number of companies that is doing so. It has promoted<br />
a very successful decentralisation strategy, locating its new<br />
branches principally in country areas in Victoria and New South<br />
Wales. The success of this policy is due to the energy and<br />
capacity of people in country areas, and to the efforts of the<br />
company and its employees to become aware of the community in<br />
which they establish themselves.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, this new factory is the latestinstance of a<br />
successful pattern of expansion by Dowell in recent years. I am<br />
confident that the company will make a significant contribution to<br />
the future of the City of Hamilton and that Hamilton will make a<br />
significant contribution to the company.<br />
It gives me great pleasure to declare the factory open. </p>
