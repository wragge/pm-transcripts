AU TALIA<br />
PRIME ' MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 18 FEBRUARY, 1981<br />
SPEECH AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF WORK ON THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE ACADEMY<br />
The proposal for tri-service tertiary education originated<br />
in the 1960s, and in the years that it has taken for the<br />
idea to come to fruition, the world has undergone considerable<br />
changes. It is not just that our strategic perceptions have altered,<br />
but that the strategic environment in which we live has also<br />
changed dramatically. The security, thought to be conferred<br />
by detente, was shattered by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.<br />
While it would be an exaggeration to suggest that this invasion<br />
was the single cause for the strategic instability in which we<br />
live, that invasion is the clearest recent example of the<br />
Soviet Union's basic rejection of the accepted concept and<br />
necessity of international stability. That rejection is<br />
fraught with consequences for the security of all nations; and<br />
it certainly has clear implications for our attitude to national<br />
and regional defence.<br />
These fundamental changes in Australia's national circumstances<br />
require a number of re-assessments and responses. In the past,<br />
single-service contingents have operated, more or less, as<br />
self-contained tactical forces. But advances in technology,<br />
and radical changes in operational situations and methods have<br />
led to a blurring of the lines which formally separated the<br />
individual services.<br />
As we develop our defence capability in the light of strategic<br />
changes and advances in technology, we must recognise, more and<br />
more, the need for our armed services to operate jointly, as<br />
the Australian Defence Force. The old and costly single-service<br />
arrangements are no longer appropriate to modern circumstances<br />
and to the course of defence development in this country.<br />
Tomorrow, it will be a year since I announced the Government's<br />
decision to allocate a greater proportion of our resources<br />
to defence. The decision to invest in modern weapons systems<br />
and to increase research and development funds was the beginning<br />
of a long, sustained haul to enhance our defence preparedness. / 2<br />

Our efforts to ' secure the nation's defence, through a<br />
well-developed defence infrastructure, necessarily place a<br />
premium on techiiological capacity, well-trained manpower, and'<br />
an officer corps which is sensitive to the kinds of co-ordinated<br />
tactical responses which a modern defence capacity requires.<br />
We cannot enhance our security, however, without due regard<br />
to the security of our friends and allies. Defence is not simply<br />
a national endeavour. It is a co-operative effort, in a regional<br />
sense as well. Among other things, this has important<br />
implications for the training of our service officers.<br />
our armed forces the Navy, the Army and the Air. Force mnus~ t<br />
be able to operate together as a united Australian Defence Force.<br />
They must also be able to co-ordinate their efforts with those<br />
of our allies. Our service officers' vision must extend beyond<br />
the traditions and daily pre-occupations of the single services.<br />
This is one important reason why we are gathered here today to<br />
mark the commencement of the building of the Australian Defence<br />
Force Academy. The Academy will instil into its members. ful1.<br />
dedication to their parent services. It will foster in our<br />
military cadets loyalty to the national force. But more<br />
fundamentally, it will encourage a basic sense of national<br />
mission and of interdependence between our three services.<br />
There are Very few circumstances in which Australian servicemten<br />
will be committed in the future which will involve only one<br />
. service; which-will not require the active and co-operative<br />
support of elements of the other ' services. The need to establish<br />
an integrated training system for-the three services stems from<br />
a recognition of the need to establish one integrated,<br />
concerted, committed, hard hitting and effective defence force.<br />
The responsibility for national defence and for an independent<br />
national contribution to the security of our allies and friends,<br />
places new and taxing demands on the personnel of our defence<br />
force, and particularly on its leaders. officers of the defEnce<br />
force must be able not only to meet the complex requirements<br />
of their daily. duties, which call increasingly for a high dec ree<br />
of proficiency in a rangje of professional specialisation. But<br />
also, they must be able to take their place in the councils cf<br />
State, and make their contribution to the discussion of<br />
problems and policies along with representatives of other arc-as<br />
of the State service, both Parliamentary and administrative.<br />
There must be an understanding in the defence force of our<br />
history and institutions, our social values, our national<br />
situation and our international circumstances and prospects.<br />
Such requirements demand an education of a high order.<br />
With the co-operation and partnership that we seek from the<br />
University of New South Wales, we can look forward to support.<br />
at the highest levels and in the highest traditions of<br />
university teaching. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
I take this opportunity to offer my thanks to the universities,<br />
and other organisations, and to all the people who have<br />
contributed to the development of ADFA to the point we have<br />
reached today. I would particularly like to pay tribute to<br />
the work of Sir Henry Basten, as Chairman, and of the other<br />
members of the ADFA Development Council, many of whom are<br />
with us today. In particular, I want to acknowledge the<br />
contribution of Professor Rupert Myers, without whose continuing<br />
advocacy, there would have been no project.<br />
The planning teams from the Department of Housing and Construction<br />
and the Department of Defence also deserve praise for their<br />
efforts particularly for keeping within the limits of the<br />
cost targets set in 1976.<br />
We now take a major step towards the establishment of a new<br />
institution of real significance to Australia. On occasions<br />
such as this, one naturally looks to the future. I do so today<br />
with great satisfaction that this project is launched at last;:<br />
and with great confidence that we are making the best possible<br />
provision for the leaders of Australia's defence force for<br />
many, many years ahead.<br />
With much pleasure, I now unveil this plaque to mark the<br />
start of work on the Defence Force Academy.<br />
