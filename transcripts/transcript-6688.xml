PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT MELBOURNE, 10 AUGUST 1985<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you confident that the<br />
Labor Party will stop this factional problem that has<br />
been going on in Canberra?<br />
PM: Yes. I believe that they realise that the Opposition<br />
hasn't put a glove on us this year. And we have been very<br />
much tied up with our own problems of tax and so on, and a<br />
bit too much factionalism. There is a very good feeling<br />
now in the Party. And the problems in the Liberal Party<br />
are e, -rmous. We will now get the benefit of the economic<br />
runs wnich are increasingly showing on the board. 410,00n'<br />
new jobs, record housing starts, about 40 percent higher<br />
housing starts than the in last year of the Liberal government,<br />
inflation down, and retail sales up. We have got our third<br />
year of 5 percent growth. it is the best economic performance<br />
in the world. There is no other country to match it in<br />
economic growth or jobs.<br />
JOURNALIST: why isn't that message getting through?<br />
PM: Well it was partly our own fault. But partly because<br />
we have been tied down in Canberra since the election. Two<br />
things, the tax issue and the May economic statement where<br />
we had to effect a lot of savings and that meant that I and<br />
my senior ministers were tied down there. But we have broken<br />
out of that. And all the good runs are on the board. We<br />
are going to have a marvellous package for young people<br />
which is going to offer hope to the young people of<br />
Australia. I will be announcing that in the very, very<br />
near future. And we have turned Australia around. And I<br />
think all Australians are going to start to be proud of<br />
the fact that the world is recognising that we have got<br />
the fastest growing economy. We have got jobs growing<br />
at a faster rate than any other country in the world.<br />
And we are doing that at low levels of inflation. Now,<br />
the troubles are behind us. The good things have been<br />
there, they are going to be more obvious. And particularly<br />
for our young people. I want to emphasise that what we will<br />
be offering in the package in the very near future is going<br />
to give hope to all the young people of Australia. </p>

JOURNALIST: If that factionalism broke out again Prime<br />
Minister would you be rrepared to suffer<br />
PM: Well I have written to Ministers and said that they<br />
have got to operate within their portfolios. If they<br />
operated outside that either in a factional or a nonfactional<br />
way, yes they would go.<br />
JOURNALIST: Has that factionalism caused your Party<br />
much damage?<br />
PM: I think it has. There has been a feeling that we<br />
have been, particularly around the tax issue. That was<br />
the thing where people felt strongly about that. And they<br />
were making their points publicly, and that didn't help.<br />
But that is behind us. And they understand it is behind us.<br />
It won't be tolerated, any public disputation. It is<br />
legitimate in a party like ours, if you are trying to<br />
improve and change for the better Australia. It is natural<br />
that different groups are going to have feelings about the<br />
way they want to go, the emphasis they want to give to<br />
different points. But they have got to do that within<br />
the Party.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, could you find a portfolio<br />
for Mr Valder?<br />
PM: Could I ' Lind a portfolio for M~ r Valder? Minister for<br />
Communications. ends </p>
