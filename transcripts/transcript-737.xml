FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 4+ O/ 196-1<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir<br />
Robert Menzies,<br />
I have decided that I should, in the<br />
coming Parliamentary recess, pay a brief visit to<br />
Britain and the United States in response to invitations<br />
which I have received from the Governments of those<br />
countries, I will have the opportunity of personal<br />
discussions in London with Mr. Macmillan and in Washington<br />
with President Kennedy. I am in touch also with<br />
Mr. Pearson, the Prime Minister of Canada, in the hope<br />
that we may be able to arrange a discussion between us<br />
in Ottawa. I propose to leave Sydney for London<br />
on 13th June and to return to Australia, by way of<br />
North America, arriving in Sydney on 12th July.<br />
CANBERRA, 13th May, 1963. </p>
