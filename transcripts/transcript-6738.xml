EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH FOR THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
T. J. RYAN MEMORIAL LECTURE<br />
" THE DIRECTION FOR AUSTRALIA"<br />
24 September 1985<br />
Distinguished Guests, Members of the Queensland University ALP,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
I am deeply honoured that you have invited me to deliver the sixth<br />
in a series of the T J Ryan Memorial Lectures.<br />
The late Denis Murphy, at the conclusion of his masterful<br />
biography on Thomas John Ryan, observed that Ryan remained<br />
something of a forgotten figure in Australian history.<br />
Thankfully, these memorial lectures, which Denis Murphy did so<br />
much to establish, are redressing this lamentable situation.<br />
The annual lecture has, in fact, done much to promote the<br />
intellectual richness of the great Australian Labor Party.<br />
Occasions such as t-onight, and events such as the Chifley<br />
centenary address which I had the honour of delivering just last<br />
Saturday in Bathurst, contribute considerably to the development<br />
of labour thought, and that is something which is important to the<br />
health of the political process and to our Party's vigour.<br />
Ryan was primarily a highly successful Queen ; land Premier. His was<br />
one of the'most innovatory of social democratic governments. it<br />
was ' a Government based on economic development and stability. It<br />
was progressive, particularly in social welfare and industrial<br />
relations.<br />
Ryan was invited to enter Federal Parliament in October 1919. The<br />
Party's Federal Conference exten~ ded the invitation after<br />
representations from the State Executives of Queensland, NSW, and<br />
Tasmania the only time this has ever been done. He was elected<br />
MHR for West Sydney and later, in September 1920, he became the<br />
Assistant Leader of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party. </p>
<p>2<br />
If Ryan had not died tragically of pneunomia whilst campaigning in<br />
the Maranoa by-election on the first of August, 1921, he<br />
unquestionably would have replaced Tudor as Leader in 1922.<br />
Australia was the worse for his death.<br />
Ryan was a leader in the great tradition of moderate Labor. He<br />
had a clear vision of the direction his government should take,<br />
and he took it. Ryan's was a first class example, in fact, of the<br />
need for direction in government, of the need for reform but<br />
reform with realism rand moderation and the need to face up to<br />
the challenges of a changing world.<br />
There are many parallels to be drawn between the experiences of<br />
Ryan and other grea. E Labor traditionalist leaders such as Chifley<br />
and Curtin, and our-own experience today.<br />
So I want to talk tonight about the direction of * the present<br />
government in the context of both the challenges we face as a<br />
nation, and the achievement of the vision we share for a better<br />
Australia. There is no question that Australia is at a watershed in its<br />
political, economic and social development.<br />
The challenges of the future, the legacy of the past and<br />
imperatives of the present have demanded new approaches, new<br />
methods of dealing with problems and the need for hard decisions<br />
to firmly re-establish our long term prosperity and our objectives<br />
as a nation.<br />
Just on two and a half years ago, the Federal Labor Government<br />
came to office with the promise of a New Direction for Australia<br />
and for the Atistralian people.<br />
It was a troubled period in our history.<br />
At the time, in March of 19.83, we were a nation immersed in<br />
economic chaos, dispirited and paralysed by recession. There was<br />
little hope of quick recovery.<br />
Worst of all, we had a government bereft of inspiration, devoid of<br />
direction and ideas about how the situation c'buld be retrieved;<br />
The turnaround since 1983 has been dramatic. our policies are<br />
succeeding. ours is now a nation of optimism, of growth and<br />
increasing vitality. We have recovered our morale and dignity as<br />
a nation.<br />
Under this Government, Australia HAS been given a New Direction.<br />
But this does not signal the end of our effort our national<br />
efforts to get our economy back on the track to sustainable<br />
economic growth and prosperity, where our people have jobs and<br />
live in an atmosphere of equality and freedom. </p>
<p>3<br />
We have achieved a remarkable reconciliation and recovery, but our<br />
task of reconstruction is only just beginning.<br />
But we must also be realistic. We all have our hopes and our<br />
dreams of a better Australia. But we have to accept that we live<br />
in a world of finite resources. We simply do not have the means<br />
to realise every dream, no matter how laudable.<br />
The task of government is to match our hopes with the available<br />
resources, to , ensure that those resources are directed to where<br />
they can be used most efficiently, to bring us closer to realising<br />
those dreams.<br />
This Governme-Kt has been about creating the conditions of<br />
sustainable es~ onomic growth growth which will generate the<br />
wealth we need to implement the changes which will make<br />
Australia a fairer society.<br />
Sustained growth is the prerequisite for everything we want to do.<br />
It is impossible to have fundamental and lasting change in a<br />
static economy.<br />
The evidence-of our economic and social recovery is ever-ywhere.<br />
Remember that in the year before we came to Government 160,000<br />
jobs disappeared and unemployment increased by over a quarter of a<br />
million. Under Labor, in just 28 months, 430,000 jobs have been<br />
created. I do not believe that there has been a comparably important socioeconomic<br />
achievement in Australia for over three decades. Our<br />
success so f~ r places us well on the track to meeting the target<br />
of 500,000 new jobs in our first three years of office.<br />
We have turned the elconomy from a situation in which it was<br />
actually shrinking, to one in which we have now had two successive<br />
years of five per cent growth. We have one of the fastest<br />
growing economies in the world and we are recognised increasingly<br />
around the world for our success.<br />
We have freed our financial sectcr from those regulatory devices<br />
which have proved unnecessary and stifling of our development.<br />
This is a central element in making us competitive with the rest<br />
of the world. We floated the dollar, freed up most interest<br />
rates, and admitted foreign bank' 3.<br />
Industrial disputes are at a record low. We have removed wages<br />
from the arena of direct disputes and employers now have a far<br />
stronger assurance of stability.<br />
Profits have been restored to the levels of the late<br />
the sort of levels which make it worthwhile for employers to<br />
reinvest and to create more jobs. We have maintained the real<br />
value of wages at the same time as inflation has been virtually<br />
halved. </p>
<p>We have simultaneously brought unemployment down from record<br />
levels. And we will bring it down still further.<br />
Underpinning everything we are doing is our commitment to the<br />
Prices and Incomes Accord and to the trilogy. The trilogy<br />
involves our undertakings to restrain our spending, the deficit<br />
and taxation as proportions of GDP. This has given us a definite<br />
yardstick by which to measure our restraint.<br />
No government has ever imposed such a discipline upon itself. We<br />
met these commitments in our last budget the first time in 17<br />
years that any government has done so. The Opposition said we<br />
couldn't do it.<br />
Right from the outset, we were convinced that an effective prices<br />
and incomes policy was an essential vehicle for achieving<br />
sustained, non-inflationary recovery. The opposition said it<br />
would fall apart.<br />
Indeed, the Accord remains at the head of the issues which really<br />
matter to Australians the security of incomes and employment,<br />
freedom from unnecessary industrial disruption, low inflation and<br />
fairness in the treatment of the needy.<br />
it is also the reason why this recovery has taken place without<br />
the sort of wages explosion which has, very often in the past,<br />
snuffed out recoveries before they have taken hold.<br />
The Accord goes far beyond being simply a unique and a uniquely<br />
Australian method of controlling inflation and reducing<br />
unemployment. It is a complex of agreements and understandings<br />
about economic and social goals for the nation as a whole the<br />
goals which are fundamental to Labor's vision for Australia.<br />
And it is this interpretation of the Accord which makes our common<br />
commitment as a Government and as a movement so fundamental to<br />
Labor's cause and to Australia's course. We reject a narrow<br />
commitment to growth for growth's sake.* We embrace growth as the<br />
means to build a better and a fairer Australia.<br />
The value and the significance of the Accord was demonstrated~<br />
again by the recent agreement between the Government and the ACTU<br />
to renew the Accord for another two years.<br />
Under this agreement, the union movement has accepted specific and<br />
further restraint in wages and conditions claims. And the<br />
Government has agreed to a fundamental reform of superannuation<br />
arrangements. As a result of the agreement, up to 100,000 new<br />
jobs will be created because the beneficial effects of the<br />
devaluation will not be lost in a new bout of inflation.<br />
The Accord has also provided the basis for sectoral policies which<br />
have rejuvenated some major Australian industries, particularly<br />
steel, motor vehicles and housing. </p>
<p>I have spoken many times of the need to restructure our industry<br />
and to enmesh our economy with those rapidly developing and<br />
dynamic economies of Asia and the Pacific. Our long term survival<br />
as a prosperous and relevant nation depends upon this.<br />
Australia has been lucky in the past, riding home on the sheep's<br />
back, the wheat grower ' s harvester and on the miner's conveyor<br />
belt. But instead of relying only on commodities, our<br />
manufacturing and services sectors must become more exportoriented.<br />
This involves fundamental changes in the image our<br />
industries have of themselves. We have to look overseas to<br />
expand. The Government is encouraging the appropriate conditions for this<br />
to occur.<br />
Deregulation has made our economy more responsive to market<br />
conditions and reduced distortions relative to our overseas<br />
competitors. We have also placed emphasis on research and development and on<br />
removing unnecessary regulations which hinder the effective<br />
operations of all kinds of industry, and thus inhibit their<br />
competitiveness.<br />
We are encouraging a liberalisation of world trade through our<br />
regional initiative on a new round of multi-lateral trade<br />
negotiations. our emphasis on internationalism in our industry policy is nowhere<br />
more forward looking than in our relations with China. China's<br />
iodernisation. offers the potential of a huge new market.-for our<br />
producers. The possible linkage of our two iron and steel<br />
industries is one example.<br />
Contact between the Australian and Chinese governments and between<br />
Australian and Chinese industcy will become increasingly<br />
important. The China-Australia relationship has enormous<br />
potential to influence Australia's prosperity and our economic<br />
relevance in the world for decades into the future.<br />
Despite our remarkable success so far, we still have a long way to<br />
go on the road to long term economic stability. We cannot slacken<br />
off now.<br />
our policies have been credible because they are relevant both to<br />
the immediate and the long terms.<br />
Many of them have appeared tough, because they have been taken<br />
with an eye to the future as well as to the present.<br />
It is always much harder to apply solutions which will carry us<br />
into the future solutions which will create our future for us.<br />
I have provided a broad overview ' of our record tonight because I<br />
think it is important that our achievements so far should be<br />
placed in their proper context. </p>
<p>We should never forget what the alternative is to our policies and<br />
to our own approach to government.<br />
It is a choice between a government which has brought about strong<br />
growth with significantly reduced inflation and a coalition which<br />
promises only a return to the economic and social chaos of the<br />
early 1980s laced with obsessions and id~ ological hang-ups.<br />
We have produced hope, optimism and growth. They offer a<br />
reversion to the spectres of the past confrontation, economic<br />
stagnation and despair. They espouse the politics of privilege.<br />
They strike emptyapostures which are irrelevant to Australia's<br />
future. It would be pointless to deny that the rnew leadership of the<br />
Liberal Party has put a sharper focus on the Opposition than<br />
previously. But that does not mean that their policies will be<br />
any better or any newer, or are likely to be any more effective<br />
than the policies which were tried by our predecessors in office,<br />
and which failed dismally.<br />
it is the recipe as it was concocted for the seven years before<br />
March 1983. * At the heart of it lay the confrontation with the<br />
trade union movement, the attack on the arbitration system and on<br />
the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, and the undermining<br />
and subsequent abandonment of centralised wage f ixation.<br />
The result of these policies was a wages explosion, followed by a<br />
new bout of inflation, and the worst recession for fifty years<br />
culminating in zero growth, record inflation, record unemployment<br />
and record industrial disputation.<br />
What we have from the O&amp; pposition that is new is simply more<br />
strident rhetoric to convince us of the merits of ideas which have<br />
been tried and found wanting. They are more fervid in their<br />
polemics, more rabid in their obsessions..<br />
In policy, our opponents this week stand for<br />
deregulation of the labour market<br />
savage and peremptory cuts in spending; and<br />
privatisation of our great national institutions.<br />
Let's have a closer look at these elemtents.<br />
Labour market deregulation would break down the centralised,<br />
national approach to wage fixing which has brought us<br />
simultaneously low inflation and lower unemployment and a<br />
restoration of the sort of profit levels which make it worthwhile<br />
again for businesses to reinvest and create the jobs and growth<br />
which will re-establish our national prosperity. </p>
<p>Far from applying if I could put it this bluntly a laxative to<br />
the labour market, deregulation would create the law of the jungle<br />
in our economy. Neither rational economic considerations nor<br />
Australian social imperatives would be served by a return to that<br />
sort of chaos, which plunged this country into the deepest<br />
recession in 50 years.<br />
our opponentshave also declared that they would cut three billion<br />
dollars off the deficit in each of their first two budgets.<br />
This is a hollow commitment if ever there was one. Never forget<br />
they were the architects of our high deficits. They created them<br />
in a frenzy o-f spending in an unsuccessful effort to avoid losing<br />
office in 1983. our management, in just three budgets, has gone a<br />
long way to correcting this mess. we have halved the deficit as a<br />
proportion of GDP. That is as severe as we could bear without<br />
destabilising and dislocative economic and social effects.<br />
The opposition does not have the courage to nominate the precise<br />
cuts they would make. But the Australian people know that they<br />
would cut in the disadvantaged areas where people really need the<br />
help and support of the nation.<br />
The third element of their policies is their commitment to<br />
privatise some of our greatest and most valuable national<br />
institutions. They have nominated a list of them, including the<br />
Commonwealth Bank, QANTAS and Telecom. They have said they don't<br />
mind if these institutions end up in foreign hands.<br />
our opponents would sell off institutions which have been built up<br />
over generations. They should be left to serve our children as<br />
well as they have served our parents.<br />
What would happen if they were sold off? Ask yourselves the<br />
question. Our opponents have already acknowledged the need for<br />
government subsidies to allow the continued cross-subsidisation of<br />
the services these institutions provide. They say the subsidies<br />
would be financed by the taxation of their profi-ts.<br />
So on the one hand, we would have the privatisation of thie<br />
profits. And on the other hand, the government's revenue -which<br />
should be applied to social needs would be' used to subsidise the<br />
private activities that our opponents would tell you are far more<br />
effectively conducted by private enterprise.<br />
There are some national activities which can only be undertaken by<br />
government. We are concerned with securing the most efficient use<br />
of the resources which must be applied to them in the national<br />
interest.<br />
The key elements of our opponents' propaganda are unworkable and<br />
empty. They are unnecessary and unwanted. If they were ever put<br />
into practice they would cause damage to the entire community and<br />
leave ordinary Australians far worse off. What the coalition<br />
advocates is socially offensive. </p>
<p>We are a Government and a Party with stron~ g traditions as adopted<br />
by great figures such as T J Ryan, John Curtin and Ben Chifley.<br />
We are concerned with social justice. We take the view that we<br />
have a national and a natural obligation to help the disadvantaged<br />
in our community to realise the aspirations for their own personal<br />
development which the more privileged take as a matter of course.<br />
Unlike the Opposition, this Labor Government does not treat people<br />
as stereotypical economic units. We have defined a program of<br />
social security and social justice which is compatible with the<br />
broader objective of economic growth. The two goals are<br />
inseparable. You,, cannot achieve only one unless it is at the<br />
expense of the other.<br />
Government has always been about blending economic rationality<br />
with humanity. Most governments err to one side or the other. We<br />
are achieving the fairest and most realistic balance seen in this<br />
country for decades.<br />
in our first three budgets, the government has directed to the<br />
disadvantaged in our community almost $ 1.5 billion in new and<br />
increased social security benefits over and above those resulting<br />
from establis~ hed indexation arrangements. Wle have in most areas<br />
recovered and even substantially improved upon the ground lost<br />
during the seven years of conservative rule.<br />
These are extraordinary advances in an economy still suffering<br />
very much from those dark years. But we have managed it without<br />
dislocation because we have implemented our policies gradually and<br />
directed benefits to those most in need.<br />
The best way * 1 can illustrate our achievements how we combine<br />
our obligations to the economy and to ordinary people is to<br />
refer to two areas of current activity and they are taxation<br />
reform and our new initiatives to help our young people.<br />
It is true that the taxation reforms which have now been announced<br />
are not as extensive as we had originally intended. We tried.<br />
But we could not attract the widespread community support which is<br />
required for any political reform to succeed.<br />
That was the decision of the Australian people.<br />
But that still leaves us with a series of significant reforms to<br />
our taxation system. We have dramatically reformed personal<br />
income tax scales, broadened the income tax net to catch those<br />
people who have been avoiding tax for years and forcing heavier<br />
burdens on to lower income earners. We will make sure that<br />
everyone meets their proper taxation responsibilities.<br />
We will implement changes which are long overdue changes which<br />
were not made in the past because previous conservative<br />
governments lacked the courage to tackle them. </p>
<p>our taxation reforms will institute a realism and a fairness in<br />
the taxation system with substantial social benefits. They will<br />
stabilise the revenue base from which governments work to provide<br />
the services that all Australians need.<br />
Our initiatives in youth policy are also directed at the future<br />
at our. future as a society arnd at our future as a nation equipped<br />
to meet the ecconomic challenges of an increasingly competitive<br />
world. Australia's future is in the hands of our young people. They are<br />
our greatest-~ asset. But they were left by the wayside over the<br />
years of recession. If our young people have no future, then<br />
Australia has no future.<br />
The coalition presided over a situation where teenage employment<br />
fell by 19 per cent in their last five years. Their response to<br />
the tragedy that they created is a simplistic call for cuts in<br />
youth wages.<br />
We have been painstaking in our development * of a solution to this<br />
problem. It is a multi-faceted approach to improve our young<br />
people's job prospects by making sure they have better<br />
opportunities to be trained in relevant skills.<br />
This involves a traineeship scheme which will complement the<br />
apprenticeship system. It will allow young people to receive<br />
training at the same time as job experience. It involves support<br />
for employers to encourage them to help us achieve these<br />
objectives. Our proposals, involve income support for young people to encourage<br />
them to remain in f-ormal education if they wish, so they are not<br />
forced to drop out of schoo). through economic or social necessity.<br />
And we will increase the positions available for young people at<br />
TAFE colleges.<br />
Our proposals represent a comprehensive and integrated approach to<br />
solving the problems of the people who will inherit our &amp; ountry.<br />
The effect is not simply to improve their chances of getting a<br />
job. The result will be a better trained, and a far more capable<br />
and productive workforce for all of Australia. It will mean a<br />
more secure place for Australia in the world. We will not be<br />
confined to the economic backwaters because we will have a<br />
population and a workforce capable of meeting these challenges.<br />
it is the difference between nurturing the talent, the energy, the<br />
creativity of young Australia or letting that talent and<br />
creativity wither on the vine. And Australia's future would<br />
wither on the vine alongside them. </p>
<p>our programs are aimed at our long term future. They are aimed at<br />
creating an economically secure Australia, as well as a secure and<br />
peaceful world. Testimony to this is our support for the<br />
international non-proliferation regime, for disarmament measures<br />
and our successful advocacy of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone<br />
Treaty now made even stronger by Papua-New Guinea signing the<br />
Treaty during my visit to Port Moresby a week ago.<br />
Unless people, and we as a nation, are able to live in an<br />
atmosphere of peace and security, we will not be able to devote<br />
our energies and our resources to our economic and social<br />
security. our gradual change will leave Australia as a stronger, a more<br />
stable society. Our people will not be divided by such<br />
destructive and negative motivations as unequal opportunity, by<br />
elitism or by envy. They will aspire to self-improvement, not at<br />
the expense of their neighbours but in co-operation with them.<br />
Their opportunities * to realise their aspirations will be fairer<br />
unlike the past, when privilege and opportunity were unequal, and<br />
unlike the attitude taken by our opponents, which would entrench<br />
privilege and power in their existing balances.<br />
This is really the essence of the campaign being waged by the new,<br />
so-called drier leadership of our opponents. They are obsessed<br />
with what they call " corporatism". Their campaign is to destroy<br />
what they describe as the " corporate alliance" between " big<br />
government, big unions and big business".<br />
This is a sinister and a cheap means of deriding the co-operative<br />
relationship, the partnership which has produced the most<br />
remarkable economic turnaround in the world today. Of course the<br />
conservatives object to it. It has kept the Labor Government in<br />
office, and it has kept the conservatives out of office.<br />
The difference between the two sides is really over whether we<br />
together take a national approach to issues and problems which are<br />
essentially national issues and problems, requiring national<br />
solutions. The essence of the conservatives' approach is that they would<br />
break down our national approach into a hotch-potch series of<br />
cheap little deals, with every self interested group of workers or<br />
bosses in every enterprise or industry, and every social group in<br />
Australia fighting each other to get the most that they can.<br />
It would be dog eat dog in its crudest form.<br />
Far from giving little people more power and more choice, this<br />
sort of approach would serve only to break down the national cooperation<br />
which has worked so well for all Australians. It would<br />
do nothing to advance the cause of our national economic and<br />
social well-being. It would leave the strong stronger and the weak<br />
weaker. </p>
<p>If there is one thing that the success of our co-operative<br />
approach has demonstrated so far, it is that none of us can be<br />
winners unless we are all winners. And so far, we ARE all<br />
winners. It is the difference between national compassion and action on the<br />
one hand, and the abrogation of ndtional government responsibility<br />
on the other.<br />
It is easy to see why our opponents advocate their particular<br />
approach. After all, they are the representatives of entrenched<br />
inequality. They represent a party that was set up primarily to<br />
oppose Labor, tc? protect their own1 already comfortable, privileged<br />
positions. And'we should never forget that.<br />
The Labor Party has always been the party of ideas in Australia.<br />
It has always been been the the party of compassion and humanity.<br />
Labor has tried to blend the twin objectives of economic and<br />
social well-being, of fairness and justice.<br />
Labor has fought the fight for moderate reform with concern for<br />
all the people of Australia. We are not a sectional party. We are<br />
a party for all Australians, delivering the growth and the<br />
policies which benefit all Australians.<br />
It is every person's legitimate expectation that they should be<br />
able to live their lives the way they want to live them, free from<br />
government interference, and subject only to the constraint that<br />
they should not, in the process of living their lives, infringe<br />
the rights and freedoms of others.<br />
We have no interest in cutting down the achievers in our society.<br />
Far from it. * No society can thrive without the positive<br />
contributions of those'who stand out. We are intent upon<br />
encouraging achievement.<br />
But we are also concerned to create the conditions to ensure that<br />
everyone has the opportunity to develop their own skills and<br />
potential, to take a full, creative and productive role in society<br />
to become an achiever should they possess the talent and the<br />
inclination to do so.<br />
They should not be barred by accidents of birth, by accidents of<br />
race, of social status or of location.<br />
Our task is to create a society in which opportunities are open to<br />
all, in which mothers and fathers will not worry for their<br />
children's future, because their future will be secure from the<br />
threat of unemployment, destitution and discrimination and as<br />
far as possible free from the threats of war and violence.<br />
This is our way. It is the way of the vast majority of the<br />
Australian people. It is the true Labor way, in the great Labor<br />
tradition. It is up to us as a government to create the conditions to make<br />
sure that these goals can be met. </p>
<p>We do not believe in Big Government. We do believe in efficient,<br />
compassionate and responsive government. We believe in government<br />
which is equipped to provide the services and support that we all<br />
need to realise the hopes and dreams that we all have.<br />
We have much in common with such great Labor figures as T J Ryan,<br />
who had an abiding confidence in the tolerance, judgement and<br />
intelligence-of the Australian people. Ryan held a view of<br />
humanity which I share. He believed in the essential goodness of<br />
people and he understood their aspirations.<br />
Ryan's hallmarks were his intelligence,. his capacity for hard<br />
work, and his abifity to understand people and their problems. He<br />
understood the particular nuances of the ALP. He was prepared to<br />
stand his ground and not to be intimidated by his opponents.<br />
These characteristics, I believe, are also those of the current<br />
Australian Labor Government.<br />
Under this Government, we have emerged once again as a nation to<br />
be respected in the world. We have rejected conflict and<br />
confrontation and replaced it with co-operation and compassion.<br />
We have ended the drift, the division, the lack of direction, the<br />
loss of confidence, the absence of leadership and the blindness<br />
about where Australia was headed and what we could achieve<br />
together.<br />
We are creating a better, more caring, more tolerant, more<br />
diverse, and more realistic Australia. It is a more cohesive,<br />
richer and enriched Australia an Australia of which T. J. Ryan<br />
would justly be proud. </p>
