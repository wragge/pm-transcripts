July 1975<br />
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE STATES<br />
SPECIAL GRANTS<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that the Australian<br />
Government had approved the recommendations of the Grants<br />
Commission on applications made by the Queensland and South<br />
Australian Governments for special financial assistance for<br />
the year 1975/ 76.<br />
The amounts approved for payment in 1975/ 76 total<br />
$ 36,300,000 for Queensland and $ 2,500,000 for South Australia.<br />
The Prime Minister said that special grants are<br />
paid to Queensland and South Australia to compensate them<br />
for such factors as lower capacity to raise revenue from<br />
their own resources and the higher costs of providing<br />
government services of a standard similar to those in the<br />
financially stronger States.<br />
The grants are in addition to those decided upon<br />
at the Premiers' Conference in June 1975, when the Australian<br />
Government agreed that Queensland and South Australia should be<br />
provided with financial assistance grants totalling<br />
$ 564.4 million and $ 379.2 million respectively.<br />
Mr Whitlam noted that South Australia withdrew from<br />
the Grants Commission at the end of 1974/ 75 and that the<br />
Australian Government had agreed to increase the State's<br />
financial assistance grant as from 1975/ 76 to compensate for<br />
loss of special grants. The grant of $ 2,500,000 in 1975/ 76<br />
is a final completion payment in respect of 1973/ 74.<br />
The Prime Minister concluded by pointing out that<br />
the aggregate of over $ 38 million in special grants represents<br />
a significant effort by the Australian Government to assist<br />
these two States.<br />
