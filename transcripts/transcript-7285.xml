PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 8 FEBRUARY 1988<br />
The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic<br />
Affairs, Mick Young, has informed me of his decision to<br />
resign from political life as from today.<br />
It is a decision which I deeply regret and one which I urged<br />
him to reconsider, but Mick feels that such have been the<br />
events of the last week he no longer has the desire to<br />
continue in political life. I would emphasise that there<br />
are absolutely no circumstances other than those he mentions<br />
in his press release that have pressured him to resign.<br />
one of the tragedies of public life is that exonerations<br />
never receive the headlines of allegations.<br />
Mick Young has been an inestimable asset to the Labor Party<br />
both prior to his election to the House of Representatives<br />
in 1974, and in holding Parliamentary and Party positions in<br />
Opposition and in my Government. In opposition, he was<br />
instrumental in devising many of the policies on which we<br />
were voted into office in 1983.<br />
Mick Young has been a greatly respected and liked minister<br />
as Special Minister of state, and since the last election,<br />
as the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic<br />
Affairs. He also held the office of Vice-President of the<br />
Executive Council. He has been an outstanding Leader of the<br />
House whose wit and quick mind have earned him the<br />
admiration of all its Members. His voice has been one of<br />
great common sense and wisdom in the councils of both<br />
Cabinet and Caucus.<br />
The loss of Mick Young's unique talents and experience to my<br />
Government and to the Parliament is immeasurable. Today is<br />
a day of great personal and professional regret to me. We<br />
lose an outstanding Minister, an energetic representative<br />
and a convivial colleague.<br />
Margaret Reynolds will undertake the duties of minister for<br />
Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs until my<br />
further announcement. 004317 </p>
