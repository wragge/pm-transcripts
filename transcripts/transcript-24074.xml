    <content><![CDATA[<p>Early this morning, the Martin Place siege ended with the death of the lone gunman and tragically, the loss of two hostages – innocent Australians caught up in the horror of yesterday’s events in Sydney.</p>
<p>I have instructed that the Australian National Flag be flown at half-mast today at all Commonwealth Government buildings as a mark of respect and mourning for the innocent victims involved in the Martin Place siege.</p>
<p>Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the two deceased hostages, the wounded, and the other hostages.</p>
