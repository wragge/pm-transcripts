Affairs. The Council will be chaired by the Honourable Sir James<br />
Gobbo of tha Victorian Supreme Court. Sir James has been a<br />

men and women from a diversity of backgrounds, who between<br />
them poscess both extensive experience and youthful<br />
enthusiasm( and represent a wide variety of expertise and<br />
gunerational viewpoints.<br />
The Advioory Council will be charged with providing advice<br />
to me and to Mr Young on ways in which the Government might<br />
advance its objective of encouraging the further development<br />
of our multicultural society. In recognition of the<br />
cultural diversity of contemporary Australian society, the<br />
Government seeks to promote an environment in which all<br />
Australipans, irrespective of cultural origins, can exercise<br />
their rights and obligations as full and equal members of<br />
the cofminity.<br />
As part of this, the Advisory Council will also be expected<br />
to help the Government to ensure that its policies and<br />
programs are equitable, and its programs accessible to all<br />
members of our community. </p>
<p>2.<br />
The Council's : 7le will be a broad one. it is expected that<br />
priority will be given to developing advice for the<br />
Government based on consultation and research. The Council<br />
will provide an appropriate channel for communications<br />
between the com~ munity at large and the Government on<br />
multicultural siatters. It will also be responsible for<br />
assisting the Government in promoting multiculturalirsm<br />
across all sectors of the Australian community.<br />
The Council will be supported in these roles by an office of<br />
Multicultural Affairs which is being established in my<br />
Department. Viree senior appointments have now been made to<br />
the office. Tae Head of the office will be Dr Peter<br />
Shergold, forr.. 3rly an Associate Professor in the Department<br />
of Economic History at the University of New South Wales, I<br />
who has had wide research experience in the multicultural<br />
field and has worked closely with community bodies and<br />
government agencies in conducting that research. He will be<br />
supported by I-s Vasiliki Nihas and Mir Peter Vaughan. Mis<br />
Nihas, who has also had extensive research and working<br />
experience in multicultural affairs and especially in the<br />
education field, will be responsible for consultation and<br />
liaison with communities. Mr Vaughan, who has had long<br />
experience in administering government programs in a<br />
regional sott4, ng and for developing policy advice for<br />
governmonts, will be responsible for the advisory and<br />
research roles in the office.<br />
The role of thp Office will be to support the Advisory<br />
Council and the Government in developing policies which are<br />
equitable and which contribute to the maintenance of social<br />
harmony. It will work closely with the Advisory Council.<br />
The office wil'. consult widely with communities and other<br />
Government agencies in developing and carrying out its role.<br />
