February 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH MIKE GIBSON RADIO 2GB<br />
E O E<br />
GIBSON: Prime Minister, good morning to you.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
How are you Mike?<br />
GIBSON: Pretty good, thank you. As I said I've been off for a day or two with a crook throat. Of all<br />
the politicians you've come up against, who do you wish had lost their voice?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think on occasions at the moment you think people should have lost their voices, but<br />
sometimes some of my colleagues who are talking themselves into trouble, but as you will<br />
understand because I'm talking about some of my colleagues that they better remain nameless.<br />
GIBSON: All right, before we get onto politics, let's talk front page news. What would you think if the<br />
President of the United States what would he do if a team of long haired protesters crashed<br />
into his office, ordered pizza, refused to get out for six hours, used his telephones, drank his<br />
alcohol and generally... stuck a picture of him on a picture of Elizabeth Taylor ( sic). What do<br />
you think he would do?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I'm glad you asked me about that. It obviously refers to the incident at my electorate </p>
<p>office earlier this week. The decision that my staff took to handle the matter in the way that it<br />
did, which has attracted criticism from the Sydney Daily Telegraph and from others, was based<br />
upon the certain knowledge was that what those people wanted more than anything else, in<br />
other words, what the long haired demonstrators wanted more than anything else was their<br />
pictures on the main stories of the television news that night, being dragged shouting and<br />
screaming from my office. That was their objective. In fact during the day some of my staff<br />
heard one of the ringleaders of the demonstration bitterly complaining that there weren't<br />
enough police there, there weren't enough cameras there and the impact of that was that the<br />
desired adverse news footage was not going to materialise. Now, that was their objective in<br />
handling it the way they did. I've discussed the matter at great length with them since. If that<br />
kind of incident occurs again, it will be handled quite differently and I have to say in defence of<br />
my staff..<br />
GIBSON: Did you give that instruction to you staff?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No the decision in relation to that was taken by my staff, because I was at a Cabinet meeting<br />
but I defend the motives of my staff, I'm not going to turn around and dump on my staff.<br />
GIBSON: But don't you think it's backfired on them, because those protesters have got more publicity<br />
than they ever dreamt of?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, look I understand... well, yes, but not very favourably. Look, I understand the<br />
puzzlement of people and the criticism I accept that and I am concerned about it, but I want<br />
to assure the Australian...<br />
GIBSON: But we voted for you because we respect you and we respect your office. The people who<br />
voted for you hate those sort of protesters.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I know that Mike.<br />
GIBSON: I mean, they are the people who wanted you to kick them out. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Mike I understand that, and I want to say to those people that I am concerned about the<br />
perception that was inadvertently created that in some way I was relaxed about the occupation<br />
of my electorate office. I wasn't. I was concerned about the safety of my staff, I refused to<br />
sort of publicly disintegrate on radio about it because I don't think that's the intelligent thing<br />
to do. I have discussed it at great length with my staff. I want to repeat that their motive was<br />
to deny those long-haireds the public relations coup that they sought and that was to have<br />
angry footage on every commercial television bulletin in Sydney that night of them being<br />
dragged shouting and screaming obscenities about the alleged environmental rape of Port<br />
Hinchinbrook. Now that's what they wanted and they didn't get that, and the reason that my<br />
staff handled it they way they did was to deny them that opportunity, not to help them.<br />
GIBSON:<br />
But having said that you will now change you tack next time should they be there again<br />
today. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I can assure you that if this sort of thing happens again itwill be handled very differently. But<br />
I do defend my staff, because their motive was not to be in any way relaxed about law and<br />
order, not to be in any way relaxed about the behaviour of these people but to deny them what<br />
they wanted and that was this angry footage on television bulletins that night. Now, often<br />
when demonstrations like this occur in politicians' offices some thought is given to denying the<br />
demonstrators the public relations goal they seek at the outset of the demonstration and that<br />
was the objective my staff had in mind. Now, the fact that in a publicity sense it hasn't turned<br />
out a 100%, 1 understand that, and I take the opportunity through your programme of saying<br />
to those people who were concerned that what happened indicated some ultra-relaxed attitude<br />
on my part towards demonstrations and law and order, can I tell them they couldn't be further<br />
from the reality on that. I'm not relaxed, I'm not happy about what occurred but I refused<br />
yesterday when the matter was raised with me until I was in possession of all of the facts and<br />
the circumstances to in any way dump on my staff. I don't do that. Their motives were in my<br />
view correct. They wanted to achieve a certain goal. The fact that as a consequence it was<br />
seen in an adverse light, well, those things happen, I regret that, I'm sorry about that, but let<br />
me assure the public that the purpose of handling it that way was not to indicate that in some<br />
indirect fashion I turn a blind eye to that sort of behaviour, I don't. No person in public life<br />
should ever do that but there was a reason for the decision taken by my staff and I defend their<br />
motives in taking that decision.<br />
GIBSON: You are coming up to your first anniversary in office. Your critics say you've done very little,<br />
that under John Howard Australia is stagnating. What do you say to them?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, that's not right. I've done a lot. I've done all the main things I promised to do. I've<br />
changed the industrial relations law, I've got the sale of Telstra through the Senate. We are </p>
<p>going to have the biggest capital investment in the environmental future ever. I've made a lot<br />
of changes to help the small business sector. We have reduced the size of the budget deficit.<br />
We have, in prospect and this is the advice of the Reserve Bank, which is an independent<br />
economic analyst we have very strong business investment in prospect, the strongest we've<br />
had in 20 to 25 years. All of the official advice coming to the Government is that the economy<br />
will grow at a rate of about 3.5% over the coming year.<br />
GIBSON: But why aren't we spending more? Why are Australians so cautious? I mean, you're a<br />
Sydney bloke, Mr Howard. When a Sydney institution like David Jones is talking about<br />
closing down stores consumer confidence is lacking.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
You know what's happened I think two things, and I think we have to understand this. The<br />
first is that Australians came out of the last recession with permanently changed attitudes<br />
towards spending. The last recession made Australian consumers hard-nosed and bargain<br />
hunting in a way that no previous recession had left the Australian community. And as a result<br />
the attitude towards consumption and the attitude towards spending the retail dollar has<br />
changed a lot. The other change is that peoples' taste, particularly amongst the young, are<br />
now very different. The young don't spend as much money on clothing. They spend more<br />
money on things like video games, CDs, everything to do with communications technology,<br />
they spend proportionately more money on overseas and domestic travel. And what I believe<br />
we have to adjust to in this community is a change in the buying preferences of the Australian<br />
public and also a change in the attitude of consumers towards achieving bargains. The other<br />
possible change and it's too early to say it any more strongly the other possible change is<br />
that people may be switching some of their buying intensity away from the pre-Christmas<br />
period towards other periods of the year. There is some indication from the comments of<br />
some of the major retailers that people are now spending proportionately more immediately<br />
after Christmas than they used to spend in the past.<br />
GIBSON: Now, you're seen as a decent, hard working bloke. What are you going to do for self-funded<br />
retirees. I mean, the bloke who's worked hard all his life. He's payed hundreds of thousands<br />
in taxes, he's put away enough so that he and his wife thought they'd never have to rely on the<br />
pension. Now interest rates are so low he can't afford to retire. What can you do for him?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I'm doing two things for him or her. The first thing I'm doing is I'm honouring a<br />
commitment I made in the last election and that is to give him the same tax break as<br />
pensioners on an equivalent income get. That was a commitment we made. The pensioners<br />
who get a bit of extra income have a special additional tax free area. And I am in two steps<br />
extending that to self-funded retirees and that was a promise we made in the last election.<br />
Another thing I'm doing for the self-funded retirees of course is, along with everybody else,<br />
giving them a tax break of their private health insurance, if they have it, as from the I1st of July<br />
this year. The other thing I'm doing in common with of course the rest of the community is </p>
<p>doing everything I can to keep this very low inflation environment which means that price rises<br />
are kept to a minimum and people have a level of price stability we've not had for 20 years.<br />
Now, I do understand the impact of falling interest rates on retired people. I am very sensitive<br />
to that. I know that when interest rates comes down, if you're a home buyer or a small<br />
business man you cheer your head off. But if you're a self-funded retiree you think oh, that<br />
could be another cut in my income. And I have a lot of people who raise this with me quite<br />
frequently and the Treasurer has a lot people close to him who tells me he raised this with him<br />
quite frequently. So I want to say to any self-funded retirees who may be listening to this<br />
interview that I am particularly conscious, and just as we didn't forget them in the lead up to<br />
the election, we're not going to forget them now that we' re in office because I know that<br />
falling interest rates is a double-edged sword.<br />
GIBSON: Now, you just mentioned the Treasurer. I know it's early days yet, but do you see this as a<br />
tough budget this year?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It will be a budget that will make further savings...<br />
GIBSON: At whose expense?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I can't say at this stage. But we're not going to hit the vulnerable and the poor and the<br />
elderly. We're not going to do that. We didn't last time. I mean, we...<br />
GIBSON: When you say you're not going to hit the vulnerable, the poor and the elderly, that leaves the<br />
middle-class and the slightly better paid.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, it also may leave some people who are getting things now that perhaps they shouldn't be<br />
getting. GIBSON: Like superannuation payments that you whacked last year, are you likely to whack them again<br />
this year?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, I can't rule a whole lot of things in and out but the savings we've got to achieve this<br />
year are much less than the savings that we achieved in the last budget. And there is a </p>
<p>dividend for everybody in having a good budget. IF you have another budget that reduces the<br />
deficit then the prospect for the economy are made better. And there's no doubt that one of<br />
the reasons why we have had lower interest rates in the last year and I recognise as I did a<br />
moment ago that that is a bit of a double-edged sword, but on balance it's a plus for the<br />
economy, a big plus one of the reasons for that is that the Reserve Bank new it had a<br />
government that was willing to cut the budget deficit and felt it could safely and comfortably<br />
go ahead and cut interest rates. So don't anybody imagine that when a government brings<br />
down a budget that cuts spending in certain areas that that's all bad news because if the overall<br />
impact of the budget is good, and for the economy, and it helps it grow and it gives overseas<br />
investors confidence, there are a lot of flow through benefits for ordinary Australians in that.<br />
GIBSON: I always think with special guests like yourself Prime Minister that your choice of music quite<br />
often reveals quite a bit about yourself. Now, I understand that you are a Bob Dylan fan.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, yes, I was. Oh well, I sort of still am, but I mean I particularly was some years ago, yes.<br />
GIBSON: I would have thought a lot of your visitors to your office on Tuesday were probably Bob<br />
Dylan fans.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
You're dead right. People have often regarded that as rather contrary and ironic that<br />
somebody, such a conservative bloke as myself conservative on a lot of issues should have<br />
found the music of people like Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and others of that era and of that stripe,<br />
as far as the style of music is concerned, found that attractive that I did.<br />
GIBSON: Was it the music or the message?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The music. The music mate, the music.<br />
GIBSON: All right, well I'll just give my voice a rest and we might listen to one of your favourites. The<br />
Prime Minister's asked for this one from Bob Dylan.<br />
( TAPE BREAK)<br />
GIBSON: </p>
<p>And there he is, Bob Dylan and ' The Times, They Are A Changing.' And as the Prime<br />
Minister himself said, some people would be surprised at that being one of his favourite songs.<br />
Our guest is the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr John Howard. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Could I just say Mike, while that was being played I've just been handed a copy of the Skilled<br />
Vacancy Survey released by the Department of Employment for the month of February and it<br />
shows that the Skilled Vacancy Index was increased by 0.7% in February. It's the fourth<br />
consecutive monthly increase. Now, I don't say we should jump over the moon about that.<br />
But what is encouraging is that this is yet another indication that the employment market may<br />
be getting stronger. We had better employment figures last week than many expected. We<br />
had that Morgan Banks survey suggesting that people were more optimistic about putting<br />
on staff. We had the ANZ Bank employment index which also went up and now for the fourth<br />
month in a row the Skilled Vacancy Survey of the Department of Employment shows an<br />
increase. Now it's only a sign it could go into reverse next month, I hope it doesn't, but it is<br />
encouraging that you are now starting to see a number of indicators all pointing in the right<br />
direction. Now I don't want to put it any more strongly than that. But it's encouraging and I<br />
think one should always mention the good news because you always hear about the bad news.<br />
GIBSON:<br />
When you were in the gun the other week about your loss of memory, or alleged loss of<br />
memory, many listeners rang this programme to comment on the fact that last year you and<br />
your wife, Janette, were fighting your own personal battle and you were under a lot of stress<br />
and you gained a lot of admirers and she, particularly, gained a lot of admirers. How tough<br />
was it running the country, you'd just become Prime Minister and your wife at that stage was<br />
seriously ill?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well like anybody else it was something that knocked me around but I don't seek in any way<br />
to excuse any mistake I may have made in my job on a personal diversion I don't seek to do<br />
that. GIBSON:<br />
No, I know. But she is a much admired lady your wife.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well she deserves it, I'm glad to hear that because the wives and husbands of people in public<br />
life have a lot of strain and pressure. Look, that was a very unhappy moment, unhappy time,<br />
as it is for hundreds of thousands of my fellow Australians who are placed in the same<br />
situation. And, of course, like anybody else with that kind of challenge I could think of<br />
nothing else for a few days which is only understandable.<br />
GIBSON: As I said Prime Minister she's a much admired lady. What is the thing about her that you love<br />
most? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well she's a tremendous companion and a very able person and I'm very fortunate to have<br />
somebody who's been willing to put up with the pressures and the vagaries of the kind of<br />
existence I live. But she's very dedicated, she's very committed and loyal to her family and<br />
she's also got a wonderful personality and is a highly intelligent woman and she's a great<br />
companion of mine as well as being my wife.<br />
GIBSON:<br />
When will we have a GST?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we certainly won't have a GST in this term as I said we wouldn't.<br />
GIBSON: Are you in favour of a GST?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I supported it when it was part of Fight back and I supported it many years ago when I<br />
was a member of the former Coalition Government. We went to the election in ' 93 under<br />
John Hewson with Fight back and that contained a GST. The public said no. Now whether I<br />
thought then or John Hewson thought then that was right or wrong that's what the public<br />
said. And in a democracy we said okay we accept the verdict of the public, we ruled it out for<br />
the last election and that is really all, I think you'll understand, I can say.<br />
GIBSON: Well you seem to be saying we won't have one this term but, you know, I'm not ruling out<br />
one for the next term which suggests we may have one next term.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Ask me about next term when we approach it. We haven't got to one third of the way<br />
through my first term yet. Look, I understand the Australian taxation system is not perfect. I<br />
also think there is a danger in some people imagining that because we haven't introduced a<br />
GST and it's not on our agenda for this term there's a view developing in the community of<br />
if it were introduced that would solve every problem we've got. You shouldn't imagine that<br />
any one change, if it were to come about, would solve all of the deficiencies or all of the short<br />
comings and weaknesses in the Australian economy. But I'm conscious of what I said in the<br />
lead up to the last election. Clearly as we get closer to the next election and I mean closer, as<br />
in the 12 months in the run down to the next election, people are entitled to know what our<br />
plans will be for the next term and they will ask me about that not only in the taxation area<br />
but in a whole lot of other areas. But it's altogether premature to even think about what we<br />
might be saying that the time of the next election. </p>
<p>GIBSON: The death of Deng Xiaoping this morning you certainly won't get pushed off the plane to<br />
that one because foreign dignitaries haven't been invited. You're going up to China, I gather<br />
in Easter. Do you feel that his death is likely to herald any great change?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No. The most interesting thing will be to watch any real line that are power influences by the<br />
people who are now completely in charge. He had no formal position but because of his<br />
immense power in the past and influence and because he's one of the great revolutionary<br />
figures of Communist China he continued to have great influence. He is the person who, more<br />
than anybody else, modernised China's economy so his economic legacy is a very powerful<br />
one. I don't expect it will make any fundamental change to either relations between Australia<br />
and China or relations between China and the rest of the world. China wants to have good<br />
relations despite the vast differences between her political system and that of the rest of the<br />
western world. That will go on. I'll be going there to convey on behalf of Australia a desire<br />
to continue a practical association between Australia and China. We are different societies<br />
ours is a open democratic one, theirs is quite different. But we do have a lot in common<br />
economically China invests more in Australia than any country outside the PRC at present<br />
other than Hong Kong which is quite a significant thing that a lot of Australians don't<br />
appreciate. And there are literally hundreds if not thousands of businessmen from Australia<br />
who have invested in China and, indeed, quite a lot of business men and women which to<br />
come on a delegation when I go to China at Easter as part of furthering their business links<br />
with that very big country which, of course, is growing at a rate which no other country is<br />
achieving at the present time. It's growing at a rate of around eight to ten per cent at least a<br />
year which is quite extraordinary. Now it's off a very low base and their living standard is still<br />
very, very low by Australian standards but it's a big player China and everybody has to factor<br />
China in. I believe you can have an association with a country like China which recognises<br />
that we must agree to be different. I mean, we are a free open society and I don't retreat for a<br />
moment from that in discussions with the Chinese that's why I saw the Dalai Lama. On the<br />
other hand there's an economic interest in Australia having good relations with China and I<br />
think we have to be pragmatic about that as well.<br />
GIBSON: All right well you talked about the big players and just before you go, Prime Minister, talking<br />
of players those you'll be watching, I know, are the Australians who are outsiders to beat<br />
South Africa in the upcoming test series. Last two questions firstly can we beat the South<br />
Africans and secondly, can you possibly legislate to stop Mark Taylor from chewing gum?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
( Laughter) I'd get dragged before the international court of justice if I tried to legislate...<br />
GIBSON: By Wrigley's. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yeah, by Wrigley's indeed. Look, can we beat yes we can. I was very pleased that Mark<br />
got some runs against Western Province a few days ago. I understand why the S'outh Africans<br />
start favourites and it will be a tough call. But we still have some, we have a half a dozen star<br />
players in that team who on their day are still amongst the best in the world and if Taylor<br />
strikes form, the two Waughs and Bevan and Hayden is playing extremely well at the present<br />
time and, of course, that's not to leave out our great leg break bowler, Shane Warne. You<br />
know, it's still a classy team and if it does hit its straps it can surprise the South Africans.<br />
They're a class act too. They've done wonderfully well in cricket since their isolation ended,<br />
they really have and it's been very admirable, they're very focussed to use the modern jargon<br />
and very committed. But our blokes are quite capable of really turning on a great<br />
performance and I'm optimistic and I wish them luck and I'm particularly delighted to see<br />
Mark Taylor, notwithstanding the chewing gum, back in form and amongst the runs.<br />
GIBSON: All right you talk about returning from isolation I guess that's what you and the Libs have<br />
done and many Australians will say you haven't done to badly either at this stage with your<br />
first anniversary coming up. Thanks for your time this morning.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
And I hope the throat gets better.<br />
GIBSON: Thank you very much.<br />
