EMBAROED AGAINST DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
" THE WINNERS' FIELD DAY" BOONOKE 8 MARCH 1984<br />
Ken, Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
Thank you very much for your very warm welcome.<br />
I was struck in reading the report of last year's field day<br />
by two things.<br />
One was that your chief guest last year was the mighty Ron<br />
Barassi standing in for Malcolm Fraser who had to excuse<br />
himself at short notice due to the " singular nature of the<br />
handover following the election five days earlier". There<br />
has been no such reshuffle needed this year!<br />
Second, Alec Morrison, on this day last year, told you<br />
" Tomorrow or the day after it will rain.<br />
Tomorrow or the day after devaluation will boost the<br />
wool cheques.<br />
Tomorrow or the day after the recession will give way<br />
to recovery".<br />
Well Alec must have been a clairvoyant, or was it just<br />
recognition of what we as a Labor Government were capable of<br />
achieving? While I cannot claim full responsibility for it, the drought<br />
has broken; we did devalue and, with the later float of the<br />
dollar, contributed a further important boost to your<br />
industry; we have also seen the economy firmly repositioned<br />
on the path to recovery and all Australians stand to benefit<br />
from this.<br />
In short, the last year has seen a real turnaround in<br />
Australia's fortunes. My Government aims to maintain the<br />
strong growth trend now establistred and expects the rural<br />
sector, and particularly the wool industry, to be among the<br />
principal beneficiaries as well as major contributors to<br />
this. </p>
<p>The Australian Labor Government believes that the best way<br />
to help ensure Australia's primary industries have a more<br />
stable and prosperous future is to focus on sound economic<br />
management. As a Government we have accordingly sought to<br />
be responsible, flexible, realistic, respecting of market<br />
realities and concerned to address basic issues such as<br />
employment, costs, inflation and taxes. In all of this we<br />
have sought to build a national consensus a consensus<br />
involving farmers as much as any other group in the<br />
community. Indeed it is with some pride I recall the initiative I<br />
mounted some years ago as President of the A. C. T. U. bringing<br />
Australian unions and wool industry representatives into<br />
consultation. Those contacts then were highly productive<br />
and demonstrated the benefit to all concerned of<br />
co-operative approaches to industry problems.<br />
The Government introduced into Parliament last week a Bill<br />
to give the Australian Wool Corporation powers comparable<br />
with those of other major statutory authorities and place it<br />
in a position where it can commercially evaluate alternative<br />
sources of finance for its operation.<br />
The Corporation operates in an increasingly difficult and<br />
competitive environment and needs to be able to take<br />
advantage of the best borrowing rates available.<br />
The amendments to the Wool Industry Act 1972 proposed in the<br />
Bill will allow for better management of woolgrower funds<br />
for market support operations and for wool research.<br />
The Bill now before the Parliament quite deliberately<br />
recognises the value or the wool industry to the Australian<br />
economy. It is a far cry from the lone bale of wool exported by John<br />
Macarthur in 1807 to the export in 1982-83 of nearly 612<br />
million kilos of wool valued at $ 1.9 billion, second only to<br />
coal in total value of exports.<br />
The Australian wool industry has time and again demonstrated<br />
its remarkable resilience and adaptability in the face of<br />
drought, fire and flood as well as unpredictable overseas<br />
markets and competition from man-made fibres.<br />
But despite the adverse conditions it has at times had to<br />
endure or overcome, Australian wool has remained a winner.<br />
Australia now has 133 million sh6le-producing over one<br />
quarter of total world wool output and supplying about half<br />
of all wool entering world trade. </p>
<p>Changes in the destinations of Australia's wool exports<br />
reflect the changing relationships between Australia and her<br />
trading partners. Although the infant wool industry<br />
flourished in response to demand from British textile mills,<br />
our major markets now include Japan, USSR, China and the<br />
EEC.<br />
Similarly the wool industry has shown its capacity to adjust<br />
to its changing role within the Australian economy. Since<br />
the wool prices boom of the 1950' s, following the outbreak<br />
of the Korean war, wool's share of Australia's export<br />
earnings has declined dramatically as the mineral, tertiary<br />
and manufacturing sectors have expanded. It nevertheless in<br />
1982/ 83 remains significant at 10 per cent of the total.<br />
Australia may no longer be riding on the sheep's back but<br />
the wool industry has proven to be low cost and efficient<br />
and remains an important contributor to the national<br />
economy. It is at once a valuable source of national income<br />
and export earnings, and provides significant employment<br />
opportunities. You will all recall that before the last election I promised<br />
that a Labor Government would provide $ 28 million per annum<br />
for wool promotion funding during the triennium 1983-84. We<br />
were not able to honour this pledge fully in the last budget<br />
principally, as you would all know and appreciate, because<br />
of our inheritance from the previous Government of a much<br />
higher deficit than we could have reasonably anticipated. I<br />
am, however, very conscious of the importance of this matter<br />
to the industry and have therefore recently directed that it<br />
should be brought forward again for national consideration<br />
prior to the normal 1984/ 85 Budget discussions.<br />
An announcement of the Government's decision should be<br />
possible before the Wool Council meeting in May.<br />
Finally let me say that in John Kerin you have a Federal<br />
Minister for Primary Industry who brings a real commitment<br />
and feeling of responsibility for the people of rural<br />
Australia. He has a very strong personal commitment to see<br />
that the immense contribution that # Irural and provincial<br />
Australia makes to this country is~ fully recognised within<br />
Government and that sensitive policy making and fairness<br />
pr eva ils.<br />
In moving around the country over the last twelve months,<br />
talking to individuals and producer representatives, John<br />
has impressed everyone with his tremendous drive, ability<br />
and sincerity. He has managed hrW portfolio with great<br />
expertise and has become an outstanding Minister in my<br />
Government, deserving the full support of the wide interests<br />
he represents.<br />
I know you all appreciate this and will lend him you full<br />
support in his not always easy task. </p>
