MACQUARIE NETWORK WEEKLY BROADCAST<br />
BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT HON.<br />
WILLIAM _ McMAHON, CH, MP. 9 AUGUST 1972<br />
WEEK<br />
Interviewer: Paul Lynch<br />
Q. Prime Minister, you, your Cab-' ret colleagues, and various<br />
other Government spokesmen, including the Q. C. s whom you've<br />
retained to appear before the Commonwealth Arbitration Commission,<br />
have made it clear that you stand one hundred per cent<br />
against a general increase in the number of people getting<br />
the 35-hour week. Why is that<br />
PR. The question that must be answered by anyone who thinks<br />
about the 35-hour week, is this. What wv~ ill the effect be upon<br />
the mother, and the children in the home? W'hat will be the<br />
effect on people on fixed i.-Ct-, Tj-v2S, as for example on people<br />
receiving superannuity payments? What will be the effect on<br />
our export in competition with the exporters of other countries?<br />
These are the problems we face. And I think it can be<br />
crystallised in this way that if the 35-hour wieek were introduced,<br />
and we tried to replace those hours, by overtime working<br />
at penalty rates, or by fresh labour, then, we believe, the<br />
cost to the community would be 3m:-r; of the order of<br />
$ 2,500 million to $ 2,600 million per annum. And secondly, and<br />
this is of crucial importance too. We believe that on the<br />
evidence available to us at the moment, unit cost would go up<br />
by as much as 18%, depending upon the effective reduction in<br />
working hours. I want to emphasise those words ' unit cost<br />
could go up by as much as 18% V under the conditions that I have<br />
mentioned. That is the reason I believe wo have to oppose the<br />
week whenever we have the opportunity to do so before<br />
the Arbitration and Conciliation Commission.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, you qualified your phrase ' unit cost'.<br />
Now that is a technical term of course. What does it mean to<br />
the average person listening at this m;. oment? Does this mean<br />
that everything is going to go up 18% in price? ./ 2 </p>
<p>PM: It means that on the average, you would expect that those<br />
costs would go up by the amount that I have mentioned, depending,<br />
of course, as I said, on the effective reduction of the<br />
working week itself. What it does mean is that unit costs go<br />
up, then, of necessity, the price of goods in the retail stores<br />
must go up as well, and these prices have to be paid by the<br />
mother, and they have to be paid by her on behalf of the<br />
children, and in time it must lead to a 1-Iqsning of purchasing<br />
power by the other eonlo that I've mentioned, particularly<br />
the oxnorter and the--ern-n -n fixed income.<br />
Q. One argument put forward in favour of a shorter working week<br />
is that if you have people working for fewer hours, more jobs<br />
will be created. In a time of unemployment, do you see that as<br />
a good argument<br />
PM: There are many better ways of getting increased employment<br />
and reduced unemployment than by reducing hours of work, particularly<br />
under present circumstances. As an example, for the<br />
last year or more, we have been creating opportunities for<br />
greater employment. Wo gave additional funds to the States<br />
in order that they could build up work opportunities. We<br />
reduced income tax so that there would be greater purchases in<br />
the stores, and this would reflect back into employment-giving<br />
opportunities in the factories. This is the way of getting<br />
greater production, greater employment, and giving greater<br />
prospects for improving living standards, and this is what we<br />
want to do.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, twice in the past two months your Government,<br />
through a has intervened before the Commonwealth Arbitration<br />
Commission to try to prevent the granting of a 35-hour week in<br />
two separate industry areas. Now in both cases your submissions<br />
were rejected by the Commission. Does this make you feel that<br />
perhaps this isn't the best time in the world to be opposing the<br />
week?<br />
PM: No, we wanted to make a point before the Arbitration<br />
Commission. We wanted it to be known what we thought the impact<br />
would be on the community. And above all we wanted to prevent<br />
a flow-on to other industries. And in the most recent case,<br />
that is in the container denots, the Commission itself stated<br />
that this was not to be taken as a rule" to anply to all other<br />
industries; it was not to be taken as a precedent. We hone the<br />
Commission will be able to live up to that rule, and certainly,<br />
whenever we get the opoortunity to intervene, we will do so to<br />
prevent it becoming a crecedent.<br />
Q. Is the 35-hour week going to be, do you believe, one of the<br />
big electoral issues of this year:<br />
PM: Not necessarily, but I think ople must continuously bear<br />
it in mind, and the more they know about the facts, the more,<br />
' I believe, public ooinion will be mobilised against the<br />
week. But we don't want to make this a political issue. We<br />
certainly don't want to make it an electoral issues. But if<br />
there are strenuous efforts ma. de by the trade union movement,<br />
and little or no control from the Australian Council of Trade<br />
Unions, then inevitably it will become a political issue, and<br />
consequently an electoral one. / 3 </p>
<p>Q. The retiring A. C. T. U. Counsel,( Mr Willis, from memory),<br />
said some few weeks ago when he left his position to run for<br />
office, that already ae Australian worker in five works for<br />
hours a week. Do you know whether that is a correct figure?<br />
PM: I don't doubt that it is because usually he is pretty<br />
accurate, but I couldn't give you a precise answer because I<br />
haven't checked on the facts myself. But I don't think that<br />
gets away from the crucial issue that faces us. If we get a<br />
week under the conditions that I've mentioned, then,<br />
of necessity, people must pay more and get less. And that<br />
must affect those who, we feel, it is our responsibility to<br />
protect, the poorer sections of the community, and above all,<br />
the family group. They'll pay more, they'll get less, and<br />
their prospects for the future will be dampened.<br />
Q. A final point, Prime Minister, on a lighter note, of course,<br />
clerical grade officers of the Commonwealth Public Service<br />
don't work a 40-hour week. In fact, they work pretty close to<br />
a 35-hour week already. Does this mean that the Commonwealth<br />
Public Service is not productive<br />
PM: I can't make a comment about this because they got their<br />
awards through the arbitration system, or through the Public<br />
Service Arbitrator. As that award has been granted we have to<br />
livewith it, and do the best we can. I want to prevent a<br />
flow-on to other industries if I can do so.<br />
Thank you very much, Prime Minister. </p>
