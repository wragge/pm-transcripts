States' bombing and all other acts of war against North Viet Nam.<br />
The President of the United States has said that he will<br />
establish contact with this representative.<br />

seeds of hope that meaningful talks leading to a just and enduring<br />
peace are possible and the Australian Government shares the hope<br />
of the world that this may eventuate.<br />
