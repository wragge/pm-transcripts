PRIME MINISTER FRIDAY, 10 APRIL, 1981<br />
LAUNCHING OF A NEW RECORDING BY THE AUSTRALIAN CHAMBER ORCHESTA<br />
Mr. Chairman, members of the Orchestra, and ladies and<br />
gentlemen, I am delighted to have been asked to come here<br />
tonight to launch the new recording of the Australian<br />
Chamber Orchestra. The main reason I am pleased to be here<br />
is that it gives me an opportunity to say how delighted I am<br />
at the success of the Orchestra and with the way in which its<br />
quality has become so widely recognised in Australia and<br />
wherever it has visited overseas.<br />
I do remember a concert in the Music Centre in Canberra in<br />
1976 when the Orchestra was conducted by Neville Mariner<br />
and that thne Orchestra would go from strength to strength was<br />
clear on th'at night.<br />
Since then h Orchestl--ra has toured in Japan and South East Asia,<br />
as the Ch7--4an has told us, and next year . I understand, it<br />
will be gr; to Europe. It is an orchestra of world standard<br />
of which al! Australians can be very proud indeed.<br />
There is of course another reason why I am pleased to have been<br />
asked to be here tonight. I welcome the role that private<br />
enterprise has played in supporting both the Orchestra and<br />
the record being launched this evening. I am always pleased to<br />
see private enterprise becoming involved in support for the arts in<br />
Australia. That is a habit that is catching. More and more<br />
corporations, I believe, are starting to be involved.<br />
I congratulate 7 Records for releasing the record, and IBM for<br />
its sponsorship of the Orchestra. Thank you for giving me a copy<br />
of the record which both Tamie and I have listened to before<br />
this-evening. It is beautiful music, beautifully played and<br />
very professionally recorded.<br />
The Commonwealth Government has also assisted the Orchestra<br />
through some subsidies from the Music Board through the<br />
Australia Council. The N. S. W. Government has also provided<br />
some support.<br />
Over the last five years, the Commonwealth Government has had<br />
to concentrate heavily on economic management. I think some people<br />
suspect that that is all we are interested in, but that is not true.<br />
But it would be entirely wrong to infer from that as some people,,<br />
as I have just suggested, might have done that the Government is<br />
therefore not interested in the well-being of the arts and of t" he<br />
other broader and vastly important areas of life in Australia. </p>
<p>-2<br />
In fact, the Government's commitment to an Australia in<br />
which the arts will flourish is fundamental. We know full<br />
well what a barren country Australia would be without the<br />
Australian opera, without ballet, without art, without music,<br />
without the Chamber Orchestra. The way of life which the<br />
Government is promoting, and which I think most of us want in,<br />
this country, is a way of life in which cultural opportunities..<br />
in the widest sense are open to as many Australians as possible.<br />
The Government's concentration on economic recovery over a<br />
number of years needs to be viewed in the context of th * at much9<br />
broader commitment. If they are making profits, corporat * ionswill<br />
be* mord' inclined to support the arts and to support . the<br />
Orchestra. If they are making losses, I suspect they would<br />
find it harder to justify it to their shareholders. If the<br />
company is doing well, Governments themselves have greater<br />
revenue with which to support the arts and other areas of life<br />
in Australia. So in this sense, a sound and a growing economy<br />
is important to many of our aspirations and to many of our hopes.<br />
We take the view that a weak economy shackles both Governments<br />
and private enterprise. Just as business will not contribute<br />
to the arts unless it is thriving, so Governments cannot<br />
contribute nearly so effectively unless the economy is sound<br />
and growing.<br />
None of t-his means, however, that the Government has been<br />
inactj-7-in areas such as the arts during the last five years.<br />
One of : robjectives as a Governm~ ent has been to encourage<br />
the par-lcinatLion of private enterprise in the arts in Australia.<br />
This hesboth to civilise private enterprise and to strengthen<br />
artist4: " life in Australia. It encourages a diversity of<br />
endeavo-.-r which Government alone might be unable to achieve.<br />
I also believe that it provides a much greater sense of independence<br />
to areas of artistic endeavour if they know that resources are<br />
available from different corporations and private enterprise<br />
as well as from Governments. If Governments do not then do<br />
what they ought, there are other opportunities available. I<br />
think that is good.<br />
It has never been our view that the arts in Australia should come<br />
to be dependent upon Government support and Government support<br />
alone. Wide support throughout the community is the best<br />
possible guarantee of continued freedom and development of art<br />
in Australia.<br />
The Australian Chamber Orchestra is an excellent example of<br />
what can and has been achieved. Private support will be<br />
forthcoming for outstanding artistic quality. There are occasions<br />
when most can be achieved by Governments and private enterprise<br />
working closely together. I want to take the opportunity to<br />
mention briefly the International Cultural Corporation of<br />
Australia. Thah Corporation has been established recently<br />
to enable Government and private enterprise-to be<br />
closely involved in the planning and presentation of international<br />
cultural projects in Australia. The Corporation brings together<br />
art administrators and business experts to manage large exhibitions<br />
and to attract large scale commercial sponsorships. / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
The Commonwealth Government role is to underwrite the ventures<br />
through the indemnification process. Though only recenlty<br />
established the Corporation has already made a significant<br />
contribution in this area. It has been able to secure<br />
sponsorship for the Chinese Classical Paintings Exhibition<br />
which is at present visiting Australia, and which has only<br />
recently opened in this great city. It has a number of future<br />
projects planned.<br />
We welcome very much the ready and the generous response of<br />
companies and of business, foundations and individuals . in<br />
providing sponsorship funds for the arts a development which<br />
I think all Australians see as important for the future fund: Lng<br />
of arts, for the well-being and the strength of the arts in<br />
Australia. But this evening is a celebration of the work of the Australian<br />
Chamber Orchestra, and an occasion for congratulating 7 Records<br />
and IBM on their good sense in supporting the Orchestra.<br />
Australia is very proud of the Orchestra. I would like to<br />
wish all its members now and in the future the best of good<br />
fortune, and I am sure that the Orchestra will go from strength<br />
to strength in reputation here and overseas.<br />
The reccrding of works by Mozart and Bach will further advance<br />
its rep::_ ation, and bring enjoyment of its work to a much<br />
wider a: oience.<br />
Very macy zongratulations to the Orchestra and all of those<br />
who have contributed to its success, and may the record sell<br />
by the hundreds of thousands however many it is meant to sell<br />
and then double the number. I have great pleasure in launching<br />
the record. 000---</p>
