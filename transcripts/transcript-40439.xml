    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>Thank you very much Prime Minister Li. Personally, I congratulate you and your Government on holding such a successful G20 in beautiful Hangzhou. It was a magnificent event.</p>
<p><strong>PREMIER LI KEQIANG: </strong>Had you been to Hangzhou before?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:  </strong>Yes, yes I have. I’ve been to Hangzhou several times before.</p>
<p><strong>PREMIER LI KEQIANG: </strong>Several?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>Yes and as I said to President Xi, many years ago I had the great pleasure of going out on the lake, very early in the morning just as dawn was rising - it’s a very, very beautiful lake.  Of course the city has much transformed from what it was in the early 1990’s but congratulations. We have many things to discuss as we did in April. Again, thank you very much for your hospitality. This relationship is a very strong one. It is getting stronger all the time at every level - at the economic level, at the cultural level, education level, investment. So there’s a lot to discuss as we continue to grow closer together and surely we do so in the years ahead.</p>
