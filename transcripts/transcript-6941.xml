PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH<br />
NATIONAL ITALIAN DAY CELEBRATIONS<br />
THE DOMAIN SYDNEY 1 JUNE 1986<br />
CAVALIERE CAPELLETTO, PREMIER WRAN, YOUR EXCELLENCY,<br />
DR ERIC DA RIN, CONSUL GENERAL ALVISE MEMMO, MAYOR<br />
SUTHERLAND, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN<br />
TODAY WE ARE CELEBRATING AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR ITALY THE<br />
ANNIVERSARY OF THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC, A DAY ON WHICH<br />
ITALIANS TAKE PRIDE IN THEIR GOVERNMENT AND CONSTITUTION.<br />
HERE IN AUSTRALIA THIS OCCASION GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO<br />
REFLECT ON OUR SHARED COMMITMENT TO FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY,<br />
AND ON THE MANY OTHER CLOSE TIES BINDING OUR TWO COUNTRIES.<br />
THE GREAT STRENGTH OF OUR TIES DERIVES FROM THE MANY<br />
AUSTRALIAN ITALIANS LIVING HERE, A COMMUNITY WHOSE ORIGINS<br />
IN AUSTRALIA GO BACK WELL OVER A HUNDRED YEARS, AND WHOSE<br />
GREAT CONTRIBUTION TO OUR COUNTRY AND OUR CULTURE ARE VALUED<br />
BY ALL AUSTRALIANS.<br />
MY VISIT TO ROME LAST MONTH GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK<br />
TO PRIME MINISTER CRAXI ABOUT THE AUSTRALIAN ITALIAN<br />
COMMUNITY AND THE IMPORTANCE THE GOVERNMENT ATTACHES TO IT.<br />
THIS IMPORTANCE WAS REFLECTED BY THE SIGNING OF THE SOCIAL<br />
SECURITY AGREEMENT BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES, AN AGREEMENT<br />
REACHED AFTER MANY YEARS AND AFTER CLOSE CONSULTATIONS WITH<br />
THE COMMUNITY IN AUSTRALIA. </p>
<p>I AN DELIGHTED THAT UNDER THEl AGREEMENT THOUSAND) S OF<br />
IN AUSTRALIA AND IN ITALY WILL NOW BE AflLZ TO BENEFIT PR~ O*<br />
ITALIAN OR AUSTRALI: AN PENSIONS.<br />
BOTH PRIME M~ INISTER CRAXI AND I WERE PLEASED TO BE ABLE T1O<br />
DISCUSS WAYS IN WHICH OUR TWO COUNTRIES, SO CLOSELY LINKED<br />
THROUGH THE AUSTRALIAN ITALIAN COMMUNITY, COULD WORK<br />
TOGETHER TO OUR MUTUAL BENEFIT. WE SAW ADVANTAGES IN<br />
INCREASING TRADE AND JOINT VENTURES, PARTICULARLY IN THE<br />
HIGH TECHNOLOGY FIELD. MR CRAXI SAID, TOO, THAT HE WOULD<br />
ESTABLISH A BICENTENNIAL COMMITTEE TO CO-ORDINATE ITALIAN<br />
INVOLVEMENT IN OUR BICENTENARY, REFLECTING THE LONG<br />
INFLUENCE OF ITALIAN MIGRANTS ON AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY. WE<br />
BOTH LOOKED FORWARD, TOO, TO ITALIAN PARTICIPATION IN THE<br />
AMERICA'S CUP, WHEN AUSTRALIA HOPES TO WELCOME MANY VISITORS<br />
FROM ITALY.<br />
I WAS VERY PLEASED THAT HAZEL HAD THE OPPORTUNITY, ON BEHALF<br />
OF THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE, TO OPEN THE CHILD DEVELOPMENT<br />
CENTRE IN AVELLINO, THE LATEST IN A REMARKABLE SERIES OF<br />
PROJECTS FOR VICTIMS OF THE SOUTHERN ITALIAN EARTHQUAKE<br />
DISASTER IN 1980 FUNDED THROUGH THE EFFORTS OF THE ITALIAN<br />
COMMUNITY IN AUSTRALIA. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS<br />
OPPORTUNITY TO THANK ONCE AGAIN THE AUSTRALIAN COMMITTEES,<br />
HEADED BY GENNARO ABIGNANO AND CARLO VALMORBIDA, FOR THEIR<br />
LONG AND SUCCESSFUL INVOLVEMENT WITH THE EARTHQUAKE RELIEF<br />
APPEAL. </p>
<p>I THINK I CMI SAY THAT NY VISIT SERVED TO ILLUSTRATE THE<br />
FACT THAT AUSTRALIA AND ITALY TODAY SHAAE A MATURE AND<br />
SYMPATHETIC UNDERSTANDING OF EACH OTHER'S ASPIRATIONS: WE<br />
SHARE THE WILL TO FURTHER DEVELOP OUR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC<br />
LINKS. WE ARE INCREASINGLY COMING TOGETHER IN THE CULTURAL<br />
AND SPORTING FIELDS AS EVIDENCED BY THE CURRENT TOUR OF<br />
AUSTRALIA BY THE ITALIAN RUGBY UNION TEAM. AND ALTHOUGH WE<br />
ARE SORRY THAT THE SOCCEROOS DID NOT GET TO THE WORLD CUP IN<br />
MEXICO, DESPITE THEIR VALIANT EFFORTS, WE WISH ITALY ALL THE<br />
BEST. TODAY I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THE FORMATION OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIA-ITALY PROMOTION COMMITTEE, A NEW BODY WHOSE<br />
MEMBERSHIP HAS BEEN DRAWN FROM A CROSS-SECTION OF THE<br />
COMMUNITY. THE AUSTRALIA-ITALY PROMOTION COMMITTEE WILL<br />
CO-ORDINATE AND ADVISE ON THE PROMOTION OF CONTACTS AND<br />
EXCHANGES IN THE FIELDS OF SPORT, TOURISM, INFORMATION<br />
DISSEMINATION AND SOME CULTURAL ACTIVITIES.<br />
I UNDERSTAND MY COLLEAGUE, THE MINISTER FOR SPORT,<br />
RECREATION AND TOURISM, MR BROWN, WILL BE ANNOUNCING FULL<br />
DETAILS LATER TODAY, BUT I WOULD LIRE TO MARE PARTICULAR<br />
MENTION HERE OF HOW GRATEFUL I AM TO MR FRANCO<br />
BELGIORNO-NETTIS, WHO HAS GENEROUSLY AGREED TO CHAIR THE<br />
COMMITTEE. MR BELGIORNO-NETTIS ALREADY CONTRIBUTES GREATLY<br />
TO AUSTRALIA'S CULTURAL LIFE THROUGH HIS ROLES AS CHAIRMAN<br />
OF THE BIENNALE OF SYDNEY AND AS DIRECTOR OF THE<br />
INTERNATIONAL CULTURAL CORPORATION OF AUSTRALIA. </p>
<p>4.<br />
TODA, K&amp; TXOI(&amp; L i TAL iAm DAY,_ LET US CtLE3AT3t NOT OILY FORTY<br />
YEARS OF THE ITALIAN REPUBhLIC BUT ALSO TUE GREAT<br />
CONTRIBUTION OF AUSTRALIAN ITALIANS TO THE Q) UALITY AND THE<br />
ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS LAND OF OURS. </p>
