FOR PRESS P. m. No. _ 34/ 1965<br />
BISHOPS'I LETTER ON VIETNAM<br />
Statement by the Prime Ministers the Rt. Hon. $ ir Roateze<br />
On March 12, a letter signed by a number of bishops<br />
of the Anglican Church was received by the Prime Minister.<br />
It dealt with events in Vietnam.<br />
Yesterday, the Prime Minister replied to the letter<br />
in the following terms<br />
" I have given careful thought to your letter<br />
of March 12th, relating to events in Vietnam. As your<br />
letter was published in the press, 1 shall give publicity<br />
to my reply, when you have received it.<br />
You urge that my Government should be seen<br />
to be taking ' positive steps towardis an honourable and<br />
peaceful settlement of the fighting in Vietnam.'<br />
Now~ t hat all of us in our country want<br />
peace is axiomatic, The whole strength of Australia's<br />
diplomatic forces in countries to which they are<br />
accredited is directed almuost daily to the removal of<br />
difficulties and the promotion of peace. But before any<br />
nation such as the U. S. A. " negotiates" for peace,<br />
realism requires<br />
that thie other party or parties to the conflict<br />
should be willing to negotiate; and<br />
that there should be a genuine cease-fire,<br />
strictly and honourably observed; and<br />
that there should be some reasonable assurance<br />
that aggression and subversion will come to an<br />
end, It is at this point that your letter surprises<br />
and distresses me. Although you are urging some form of<br />
political action upon me and my colleagues in relation to<br />
the fighting in Vietnam, you go on to say that you are<br />
' not concerned here to canvass the merits of the respective<br />
attitudes of the North and South Vietnamese Government, or<br />
the Governments of the United States and China,,'<br />
Well, all I can say is that the Government is<br />
and must be concerned. Indeed, it seems elementary to me<br />
that unless we have some ideas on the merits of these<br />
matters our actions will be those of expediency a nd not<br />
those o01 principle. I therefore address myself to the merits,<br />
to which, I fear, you attach little significance,<br />
You refer to the Geneva agreements of 1951+.<br />
These provided a military demarcation line at the 17th<br />
parallel, separating North and South Vietnam with a<br />
demilitarised zone of five kilometres on each side. Each<br />
side was to ' order and enforce the complete cessation of<br />
all hostilities in Vietnam by all armed forces under<br />
their control'. / 2 </p>
<p>North Vietnam is under Communist rule, The<br />
political views of Hanoi are not to be distinguished from<br />
those of Peking, There can, in our opinion be no doubt that<br />
the Geneva Accords have been consistently violated by the<br />
Communists, partly by direct attacks across the line partly<br />
by infiltr~ ation and supply, and partly by the establishment<br />
and maintenance of the Communist insurgents know , n as the Viet<br />
Cong, whose activities are directed to the overthrow of<br />
government in South Vietnam and to the ultimate establishment<br />
there of a Communist regime. These facts are not seriously<br />
denied, In 1960 they were expressly conceded by the Government<br />
and Communist Party in North Vietnam. At the request of the<br />
Government of South Vietnam the United States has deployed<br />
forces in that country, to aid in its defence and we, under<br />
similar circumstances, have given military ana material aid.<br />
These steps are denounced by the Communists as ' Luperialismt,<br />
though it is quite clear that they have been taken in the<br />
defence of local freedom and self-government against an<br />
imperialist aggression which if not restricted by deeds, will<br />
lead to the over-running of Louth-East Asia by aggressive<br />
Communism and a complete loss of the existing freedom of non-<br />
Communist countries. Are there no merits here to be considered by<br />
Church leaders? There can be no true composition between<br />
atheistic and materialistic Communism and countries with deep<br />
religious beliefs, True, there can be, given good faith on<br />
both sides, peaceful co-existence and mutual tolerance. But<br />
these cannot continue if aggression continues and grows and<br />
is unchecked except by fine words.<br />
We have considered the merits, as any Government<br />
must. We believe as do all those who have been prepared to<br />
consider the merits, that the United States policies and<br />
actions in relation to South Vietnam are right, and should be<br />
supported; that they derive from a courageous and generous<br />
acceptance of responsibilities for the protection of human<br />
freedom. You urge that we join with some other authorities<br />
' in bringing to a close a war that is costing so many lives<br />
and reducing the economy of Vietnam to chaos. t<br />
I agree that the war is costing many lives and<br />
is damaging Vietnam. But how is it to be brought to a close?<br />
The Viet Cong and the forces of Hanoi are backed by Communist<br />
China, a country which rejects peaceful co-existence and<br />
practises, as it has already shown in India and Tibet an<br />
aggressive imperialism. Is the United States to withdraw,<br />
and abandon South Vietnam? This would no doubt lead: to a<br />
conquest which would end the armed conflict by conceding<br />
victory to the Communists.<br />
Or is the United States without withdrawal or<br />
abandonment, to negotiate for peace With whom? About what?<br />
These are two vital questions.<br />
How would they negotiate with the Viet Cong, well<br />
organised but hidden, practising the night attack upon<br />
villages, determined upon revolution by violence? How would<br />
they negotiate with North Vietnam, a country which has shown<br />
that it will be bound by no agreement? a / 3 </p>
<p>How could they negotiate with Communist China,<br />
the home of aggression, except upon a basis of assured<br />
independence and freedom for South Vietnam and those other<br />
countries of South-East Asia which are now threatened by<br />
Communist expansionism? Sir, the change of heart that is needed to lay<br />
a good foundation for a fruitful negotiation and a lasting<br />
peace must occur in the Communist bodies. It will occur all<br />
the sooner if aggression is met by resistance, if we remain<br />
clear about what it is that we are defending and if we, and<br />
all our allies, can make it well understood that we are not<br />
concerned to conquer others, but that we will do our part to<br />
preserve freedom where it now exists4 Freedom is, in this<br />
world, not expendable. And free people are not aggressors."<br />
CANBERRA March, 1965 </p>
