PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
ANNIVERSARY OF THE RACIAL DISCRIMINATION ACT<br />
MELBOURNE, 9 JUNE 1995<br />
Thank you very much for inviting me to this celebration of the<br />
Anniversary of the Racial Discrimination Act.<br />
This was a very brave piece of legislation. It came at a time of great change in<br />
Australia at a time when a lot of the old attitudes were beginning to show<br />
signs of crumbling away, and some inevitably were resisting fiercely.<br />
New ways of thinking about Australia and about social and economic issues,<br />
and what sort of country we could establish here were beginning to get a<br />
foothold. Quite a few of those ideas have stood the test of time. In their legislated form<br />
they are now enshrined in our democracy and they go some way to defining<br />
our civilisation here.<br />
They stand as a bulwark against the old prejudices.<br />
It is worth recaling the context in which this Act came into being.<br />
It was less than a decade since the referendum which put Aboriginal<br />
Australians on the census. It was only a few years since the practice of taking<br />
Aboriginal children from their families had ended. The attitudes from which<br />
those things flowed were still very common.<br />
Australia was a multicultural society in 1975, but we had not yet begun to lay<br />
the framework of programs which have made cultural diversity. a considerable<br />
and distinct national strength.<br />
Much of the progress we have made since then has been underpinned by the<br />
Racial Discrimination Act.<br />
That is not to say that anyone was ever under the illusion that we could<br />
legislate to abolish prejudice. And opponents of the Racial Hatred Bill really<br />
should not pretend that we are under such an illusion. 2) </p>
<p>Legislation like this does not spring from any utopian vision of society or<br />
human nature. It springs from recognition of the less than perfect reality.<br />
And it doesn't spring from a wish to punish the perpetrators of racism, but from<br />
a desire to protect its victims.<br />
I think that this is the essential point: we come to understand the necessity for<br />
this kind of legislation when we put ourselves in the position of the victims of<br />
racial discrimination or vilification or worse.<br />
Perhaps we understand even better when we ask ourselves how we would feel<br />
if our children were made victims.<br />
A Racial Hatred Bill is directed at more than the purveyors of racial hatred. It<br />
aims to limit the hatred generally. If by warning people, or by sending them a<br />
signal that it is not acceptable in Australian society, we reduce the incidence of<br />
racism, we make for a society less divided and more at peace.<br />
Legislation like this serves to remind the victims of racial prejudice that their<br />
country will protect them.<br />
It is a reminder to minorities that a democratically elected parliament has<br />
decided that discrimination or vilification is unacceptable; that it is hostile to<br />
the values of the majority of Australians, outside the boundaries of what<br />
Australia is and what Australia stands for, that they are inside and the racists<br />
are outside, that they are of the great majority and the racists are of an extreme<br />
minority. I think opponents of this kind of legislation miss the mark.<br />
When they say as they did in 1975 and as the same voices are saying about<br />
the Racial Hatred Bill today that such legislation is " draconian" they are<br />
thinking, it seems to me, in a context which is much too narrow and legalistic.<br />
The Racial Discrimination Act followed the wording of the International<br />
Convention for the Elimination of All Racial Discrimination and made it<br />
unlawfuil for anyone to make distinctions or to afford preferences, on the<br />
grounds of race, colour, descent or national ethnic origin.<br />
Inevitably, Voltaire was trotted out. And, on the face of it, it does seem to<br />
contradict the great liberal precept: " I disagree with what you say, but I will<br />
defend to the death your right to say it".<br />
I wouldn't presume to know what Voltaire would have made of this legislation;<br />
but I do know that the notorious history of the 20th century makes very clear<br />
that tolerating racial prejudice is extremely dangerous to all liberal societies. </p>
<p>And I also know that as a Government we have a responsibility to protect our<br />
citizens against words which are for them blows which inflict pain of a kind<br />
that, if it were physical, would bring charges of assault.<br />
In 1975 we might have been inclined to think, living such a long way from the<br />
rest of the world, that somehow our responsibility in this was diminished.<br />
But of course it was not.<br />
We had among us then, as we have now, many Australians who are here<br />
because of racial persecution in other countries.<br />
And we have Australians among us who have been here for much longer<br />
50,000 years or so longer and whose culture and lives have been all but<br />
destroyed by racial prejudice.<br />
We also have and we had in 1975 a society comprised of people from all the<br />
countries of the world. And we had to make that society a peaceful and<br />
harmonious one.<br />
Remember, in 1975 we were only a few years clear of that policy which<br />
embodied Australian racial prejudice the White Australia Policy.<br />
Twenty years later, we can honestly say that our cultural pluralism is one of our<br />
great national successes. That is not an exaggeration.<br />
Those of us old enough to remember Australia in the fifties and sixties<br />
remember some very pleasant things: it was, at least until the Vietnam War, in<br />
some many respects a quiet, simple, seemingly innocent place.<br />
But it also had the malaise of xenophobia. This was apparent not just in the<br />
White Australia Policy but in much else in our thinking about the world. It was<br />
also apparent in the attitudes which were most offensively manifested in<br />
Aboriginal policy.<br />
For those of us old enough to remember, the distance we have travelled as a<br />
society since then is simply extraordinary.<br />
I don't suggest for a moment either that we have made this progress because of<br />
the Racial Discrimination Act, or that we can now sit back and congratulate<br />
ourselves on creating one of the world's most tolerant multicultural societies.<br />
This society is not free of prejudice, and we cannot not even say that the trend<br />
is ineluctably towards tolerance.<br />
None of us can ever justify complacency on this. All of us have to engage<br />
ourselves in the difficult questions of how we make sure that Australia<br />
continues to be a tolerant society and becomes one which is more tolerant. </p>
<p>The role of the Racial Discrimination Act and for that matter the Sex<br />
Discrimination Act and the Racial Hatred Bill is not to punish every act of<br />
prejudice, but to make clear that tolerance and justice are things we live by and<br />
goals to which we aspire.<br />
These Acts and Acts and institutions like the Human Rights and Equal<br />
Opportunity Commission, the Native Title Act and, say, Medicare in some<br />
ways constitute our Bill of Rights.<br />
It is a more pragmatic, less rhetorical, legislative approach but after 20 years, I<br />
am a bit inclined to think that it works at least as well.<br />
As I said, legislation alone is not enough. Education will take us a lot further.<br />
Probably the best thing we can do to eliminate prejudice is to eliminate the<br />
poverty traps; create opportunity; keep in place a safety net while<br />
encouraging people to maintain their cultural difference, and give them every<br />
reason to have faith in this country.<br />
And seeing the advantages which flow from living without prejudice or envy or<br />
hatred will take us further still. These things are building blocks their success<br />
encourages more success.<br />
That is why we encourage the notion of an inclusive society. It is why we talk<br />
about bringing people in from the margins and not leaving anyone on the edges<br />
or anyone behind.<br />
It is also why, might I say, I think it is so important that before the end of the<br />
century we decide to elect one of our own as Head of State why we should<br />
become a republican Commonwealth of Australia.<br />
It is because by doing this we have a unique chance to symbolically define<br />
contemporary Australia and in doing so enshrine those attitudes and ambitions<br />
and those social realities which now distinguish us.<br />
By making an Australian our Head of State at the turn of the century, we can<br />
say to the world and to our children this is a country which believes in its<br />
contemporary self.<br />
And the reality of that contemporary self is, among many other things, a belief<br />
in the value of tolerance and the evil of prejudice.<br />
Not a belief in our capacity to abolish prejudice or make tolerance the universal<br />
condition of humanity in Australia, but a belief that these are things which must<br />
be fought for.<br />
And which Australia should number among its ambitions. </p>
<p>Which say that racism is wrong, that racial vilification and incitement to racial<br />
violence is wrong.<br />
And because it harms our fellow citizens and the peace, cohesion and harmony<br />
of our society, it is also illegal.<br />
This is why the Racial Discrimination Act is a landmark Act and one we<br />
should celebrate.<br />
There are many people who deserve to be acknowledged today.<br />
I can name only a handful.<br />
I could begin with Eddie Mabo, or with a large number of Aboriginal leaders I<br />
have come to know and immensely respect in the last few years.<br />
I think it is appropriate, as we are acknowledging an Act which is now 20 years<br />
old, to pay tribute to those who have made contributions along the way.<br />
There are too many to mention, including a great many leaders from the ethnic<br />
communities. I don't think any of us should forget that Malcolm Fraser was a founder of<br />
multicultural Australia and a consistent supporter of the principals which<br />
underlied it.<br />
But the ultimate thanks must go to the people who engineered the Racial<br />
Discrimination Act I mean the late Lionel Murphy and Kep Enderby,<br />
Al Grassby and of course the leader of the epoch, Gough Whitlam.<br />
The Racial Discrimination Act got through agaist great opposition. Almost by<br />
definition, ground-breaking legislation nearly always faces bitter opponents.<br />
But it was good legislation and it has done Australia good.<br />
And I don't think anyone here doubts that it will be here in another 20 years<br />
time and I sincerely hope in another hundred.<br />
Ends </p>
