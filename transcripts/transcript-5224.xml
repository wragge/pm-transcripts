FOR MEDIA JANUARY 1,'' 1980<br />
NEW YEAR'S DAY MESSAGE<br />
Much has been said in recent times about the ' 70s. A lot of<br />
it has been dominated by an unfounded sense of negativism and<br />
gloom which we must not allow to settle upon Australia<br />
especially as we begin a new decade.<br />
I want to speak to you about some of the positive forces at<br />
work, because I believe Australians are rightly interested in<br />
the prospects that the ' 80s hold.<br />
As we know, the world experienced great problems in the<br />
Our biggest scourge was inflation, fuelling further rises in<br />
costs and prices; further wage demands; and inevitably, further<br />
unemployment. In the last four years, Australians have come to see that when<br />
we contain inflation, business activity increases and employment<br />
prospects are improved. To achieve this, difficult decisions<br />
have been required of the Government. Indeed, all Australians<br />
have been confronted by difficult choices.<br />
But often the most difficult decisions contain the most responsible<br />
solutions; often the most difficult choices have the most rewarding<br />
outcomes. Now I believe, we are in a position where our economic<br />
stability and strength allow us to be justifiably optimistic<br />
for the ' 80s; and together we have earned this feeling of optimism.<br />
Here we are at the gateway of a new decade with our inflation<br />
rate below that of many of our major trading partners. We are<br />
internationally competitive; our costs are down; exports are up;<br />
factory output has increased; business investment is strengthening;<br />
farmers and pastoralists are enjoying better returns for their<br />
production; and while unemployment is still too high, new jobs are<br />
being created. Civilian employment, over the last year, has<br />
started to grow again.<br />
To add to all of this, we have abundant raw materials and energy<br />
resources in a world greatly in need of both. So surely we are<br />
justified in feeling a sense of pride, now that a great programme<br />
of national development is at hand. This will be the basis of<br />
our economic growth in the<br />
But it does not mean that we can be complacent about the future.<br />
We can never escape challenge. It is how we respond to challenge<br />
that decides Australia's future. We must never allow ourselves to<br />
be driven into pessimism and panic; defeatism and gloom. 511Z crecorlw&amp;-y </p>

These are corroding factors. If allowed to enter our daily lives,<br />
they can beat the spirit out of the best of us. Let us beat them<br />
by acknowledging that the ' 80s will be rich in opportunity. Success<br />
in taking advantage of these opportunities will depend on us.<br />
In the past, the partnership between all Australians has produced<br />
great progress; significant achievements achievements of Australian<br />
men and women in all walks of life achievements of Australia as a<br />
community and as a nation.<br />
Now, we are all heirs apparent to the 180s. But, we cannot afford<br />
to just stand waiting in the wings. We must strive to get our<br />
act on stage; to go out and further our successes; to do so with<br />
purpose, confidence and conviction.<br />
It is often said that the future of a country depends on the quality<br />
of its youth. This is true. Because it is is true, those of us who<br />
are parents, must accept our responsibilities. As we learnt from<br />
our parents, so the young learn their standards and values from us.<br />
These will remain with them throughout life. No schoolteacher,<br />
however concerned, can replace a parent. No school, however fine,<br />
can replace the home.<br />
It . is at this time of the year that our awareness of the value of<br />
home and family life is increased. It is through the strengthening<br />
of family life, that life itself gains its quality. It provides a<br />
reservoir of compassion and concern enabling us to contribute to<br />
those who need our help.<br />
Such quality, harnessed in every individual, gives this nation its<br />
character. Because of this, we must accept more seriously our<br />
responsibility to encourage young people through the times that lie<br />
ahead. This encouragement will be strengthened by the confidence we<br />
demonstrate in ourselves; and by the confidence we reveal in the<br />
future we shape for ourselves. As we look to this future our<br />
optimism is well justified. Our economic policies hdve won<br />
international acclaim. our natural resources, now being properly<br />
harnessed, have given us a powerful export base.. We have large<br />
reserves of energy. And above all, we are a nation of people<br />
renowned for their enterprise and creativity. This catalogue of<br />
advantages is unique to Australia.<br />
We have a lot to look forward to. So let us be enthusiastic about<br />
building a greater nation. Let us communicate this enthusiasm to<br />
one another. New stories are about to be written into Australia's<br />
history. Let us confirm together our determination to make a<br />
significant contribution to the emerging story of the<br />
Wherever you are today, Tamie and I wish you and your family good<br />
health and a happy New Year at the beginning of this decade of<br />
opportunity. 000---</p>
