 I am pleased to announce that The Most Reverend Archbishop</p>
<p> Peter Hollingworth AO OBE is to assume the chairmanship of the National</p>
<p> Council for the Centenary of Federation.<br />
   The Archbishop has served on the National Council since</p>
<p> its inception. I am delighted that such a distinguished Australian has</p>
<p> agreed to lead the Council.<br />
   Archbishop Hollingworth succeeds Mr Dick Smith, who has</p>
<p> been chairman since the Council began its work in December 1996.<br />
   Mr Smith has retired from the position because of overseas</p>
<p> commitments and plans that would not enable him to participate fully in</p>
<p> the increasing workload of the Council. He has made a valued contribution</p>
<p> during the past three years, and has led the Council during an intense</p>
<p> period of planning for 2001. He is a proud and dedicated Australian, and</p>
<p> I am grateful for his commitment to the centenary year.<br />
   Archbishop Hollingworth, the Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane</p>
<p> since 1990, has been an active member of the Council over the past four</p>
<p> years. He has contributed to the work of a number of Council's advisory</p>
<p> committees.<br />
   Along with his well-known work with the Brotherhood of</p>
<p> St. Laurence for over 25 years, he is a former Australian of the Year</p>
<p> and Victorian Father of the Year, and has been conferred with Honorary</p>
<p> Doctorates from five Australian universities.<br />
   The National Council for the Centenary of Federation,</p>
<p> comprising representatives of the Commonwealth, States and Territories,</p>
<p> was established in December 1996 as an initiative of the Council of Australian</p>
<p> Governments. Its task is to oversee and coordinate the Australian-wide</p>
<p> arrangements for the Centenary, and to implement projects at a national</p>
<p> level.<br />
   18 February 2000</p>
