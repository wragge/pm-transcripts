<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, you spoke to Xanana Gusmao after the lunch or during the lunch. What did you say to him?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we talked to each other briefly about the tragic events over night in West Timor. I naturally expressed my concern at what had happened. And I indicated to him of course Australiaâs continued commitment to East Timorâs future. Everybody is very disturbed about what happened. An unjustified, unprovoked attack on humanitarian workers is always repellent and something that people naturally condemn very strongly.</p>
<p>And it does mean of course that the efforts of Indonesia to restrain the militia must be redoubled. I understand Indonesiaâs difficulties and Iâve certainly had very strong assurances from President Wahid to whom I spoke again this morning of the determination of his government to do what it can to control the situation more and to track down those responsible for what has happened.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>If East Timor asked for it would you offer any immediate assistance?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No Xanana didnât raise any, make any further requests of me, no.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister whatâs your view on relaxing rules of engagement to allow UN forces near the border to take action more quickly?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I havenât had any proposals put before me in relation to that and Iâm not going to make therefore a hypothetical comment.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
