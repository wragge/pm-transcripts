PUBLIC MEETING,_ KOOYONG BY-ELECTION<br />
KEW TOWN HALL, MELBOURNE 28TH MARCH 1966<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
I have heard a lot of people here tonight calling<br />
out " Let's have a referendum" but you know they are the same<br />
people who won't even let us have a meeting. There is not<br />
much point in having a referendum if we can't have a meeting.<br />
My purpose here tonight and I won't, of course, be<br />
deterred from it by the noise of those who come here to break<br />
up a meeting is to speak in support of our Liberal<br />
candidate, Andrew Peacock, who has been selected by the<br />
Liberal Party to succeed a very great Australian who represented<br />
this electorate with great distinction for more than thirty<br />
years. Kooyong has a reputation for returning to the Federal<br />
Parliament very great men. You gave us Sir John Latham, who<br />
proved to be one of the outstanding figures in the history of<br />
our Federation. And then followed Sir Robert Menzies who<br />
established an all-time record term of office as Prime Minister<br />
of this coantry. And so when it came to find a worthy<br />
successor to Sir Robert Menzies, the people of Kooyong, in a<br />
democratic ballot, selected from those who were offering a<br />
young man who had already established his political wisdom and<br />
capacity to a point where at a comparatively early age he had<br />
been selected as the State President of the Liberal Party in<br />
Victoria. Now a young man who enjoys the confidence of his<br />
fellow citizens and members of the same party sufficiently to<br />
be selected as their State leader in what has been a stronghold<br />
of Liberalism in Australia is a young man quite clearly who<br />
possesses exceptional political qualities, and that is the<br />
candidate that we are offering from the Liberal Party to the<br />
electors of Kooyong on this occasion.<br />
Now tonight, ladies and gentlemen and I am speaking<br />
now not only to those of you in this hall but the many thousands<br />
of you who are listening to the broadcast of tonight's<br />
proce. edings the issue in this campaign is not whether you<br />
have a change of government; this is a by-election but this<br />
by-election provides not merely the opportunity to return a<br />
very able man to the national Parliament but it does provide<br />
an opportunity for an Australian electorate to offer a view on<br />
what is clearly the most outstanding public issue of this time.<br />
And the public issue can be divided into two parts for tonight's<br />
purposes. One is whether Australia should or should not be in<br />
South Viet Nam with troops, and a considerable section of<br />
this audience, not all of whom I suspect come from Kooyong,<br />
has indicated very clearly that they think Australia should<br />
not be in South Viet Nam, and in adopting that view they are,<br />
of course, echoing the view of the Australian Labor Party and<br />
its Parliamentary representatives in Canberra. Well at least<br />
then, we have that much established. Those who are making<br />
the noise are supporters of the Australian Labor Party and they<br />
oppose our being in Viet Nam. </p>
<p>on the other hand, the other three parties<br />
represented in the National Parliament the Liberal Party,<br />
the Country Party and the Democratic Labor Party, all<br />
believe that Australia should be represented in South<br />
Viet Nam and should be engaged in assisting the communist<br />
aggression which threatens the people of that country.<br />
So here tonight we have a number of people, supporters of the<br />
Labor Party, the one party represented in the National<br />
Parliament which is opposed to Australia's participation in<br />
South Viet Nam. Of course there is one party outside the<br />
National Parliament, and I suspect that that party is well<br />
represented here tonight also; that, of course, is the<br />
Communist Party. It too believes that we should not be in<br />
South Viet Nam.<br />
And so, ladies and gentlemen, here is a national<br />
line-up. Three political parties saying Australia should<br />
be fighting communist aggression in South Viet Nam, and two<br />
parties the Australian Labor Party and the Communist Party<br />
saying that Australia should keep out of South Viet Nam.<br />
All right, if that is one of the great national issues on<br />
which the Labor Party wants to fight an election, then this<br />
government accepts that challenge quite gladly.<br />
Somebody says " What about a referendum?". Of<br />
course this wasn't Mr. Calwell's story when we passed the<br />
legislation. At the time when we passed the legislation on<br />
National Service, the Labor Party then said that the forthcoming<br />
Senate election was going to be the testing election of the<br />
Government's policy on National Service, and that election<br />
was held in 1964, and in only one State did the Labor Party<br />
secure a majority of the votes on that occasion. And so,<br />
having fought the Senate election of 1964 on this particular<br />
issue, the Labor Party refuses to accept the verdict given<br />
at that time. Well, then, let that be the case. For our<br />
part, we welcome the fact that this campaign provides yet<br />
another opportunity to examine I would have hoped to<br />
examine calmly and carefully the issues which are involved<br />
in this campaign, but unfortunately there are some who have<br />
come here tonight determined to prevent a clear and coherent<br />
account being given of what is involved. However, thanks<br />
to these mechanical aids to good sense and to good government,<br />
I shall be able to speak to many people outside this hall who<br />
will only be affected to a minor degree by the species of<br />
entertainment which have been provided around various sections<br />
of this audience. Now Sir, Mr. Chairman, the reason why Australia is<br />
represented in South Viet Nam is first because we and our<br />
allies have resisted communist aggression wherever we have<br />
found it. We resisted it in Berlin. we resisted it in the<br />
threat from Cuba. We resisted it in Korea. We saved Taiwan<br />
from being overrun by Chinese communists. And we have<br />
resisted it now in South Viet Nam. We know fully well that<br />
if Chinese communism succeeds in South Viet Nam, then Chinese<br />
communism will spread unchecked through the mainland of<br />
South East Asia and we can surrender the whole of this vital<br />
area of the world to communist overlordship. </p>
<p>3.<br />
Now, ladies and gentlemen, this issue has been<br />
clear enough to the Australian people f or a very long time<br />
and they have given the Government staunch support in the<br />
action which it has taken. The Government does not take<br />
its action as if somehow the members of the Cabinet lived<br />
in a vacuum. We act, not only on the soundest military<br />
advice we can secure, we act on the advice and the<br />
information reaching us from a wide variety of sources, from<br />
our own diplomatic sources, from the governments of other<br />
countries, from thB Defence Committee which includes in its<br />
membership not merely the Chiefs of Staff but which includes<br />
in its membership I am afraid this lady is behaving in a<br />
very unladylike fashion. It is not often that a lady<br />
intrudes where she hasn't been invited. I hope that nobody<br />
tries to treat her with other than sympathy for obviously<br />
there is a quite imperfect knowledge of the issues involv-2d<br />
for this country and the action which should be taken<br />
regarding them.<br />
Now, I am not surprised that here ton ht in what<br />
we are assured by the Labor Party is a democracy and of<br />
course they may well believe that to be so, because when<br />
Mr. Calwell spoke in this campaign, he wgas given a very<br />
attentive hearing. May I repeat that When Mr. Calwell<br />
spoke in this campaign, he was given a very attentive hearing.<br />
I wonder why his supporters deny to the candidate here<br />
tonight, Andrew Peacock, and to myself a reasonable opportunity<br />
to put the Government's case. I mean, what are they afraid<br />
of? Can't they stand up to the facts? Aren't they<br />
prepared to hear the case which the Government is quite able<br />
to give, convincingly enough, I think, even to shake those<br />
who have come here with the most rigid Labor support in their<br />
minds. And I want them to give me just this opportunity.<br />
I heard one or two calling out " All the way with LBJ". Yes,<br />
there he is. " All the way with LBJ".<br />
Now, ladies and gentlemen, I would think it was<br />
well known to the meanest intelligence that Australia, a<br />
country of less than 12 million people, inhabiting a continent<br />
the size of the United States, could not hope to defend<br />
itself against aggression entirely from its own resources.<br />
That should be quite obvious I should think to the meanest<br />
intelligence. And the action which contributed most to the,<br />
security of the Australian people was the action of the Menzies<br />
Government in negotiating the ANZUS Treaty and the South East<br />
Asian Treaty. These two treaties contribute more to<br />
Australia' s security than anything else that could be named.<br />
These treaties assure us that should we be attacked by an<br />
aggressor we can look to powerful allies to bring us the<br />
strength of their support in resisting that aggression.<br />
Now, once this fact has been grasped, and I hope that you are<br />
able to grasp it quite firmly, then the Labor platform<br />
becomes all the more significant and I am going to read to<br />
you for a moment the Labor Party platform on defence. I<br />
wonder whether our noisy friends will at least allow me to<br />
tell this audience the Labor Party platform on defence. Well<br />
let me read it to you. Now allow me please. </p>
<p>4.<br />
This is taken from the official printed platform<br />
of the Australian Labor Party under the heading of Defence<br />
" Australia's national policy must be to ensure her<br />
territorial security, the security of her overseas<br />
trade and her development as an independent but<br />
co-operative nation. The nation's defence must<br />
be so arranged that the intention of Australia to<br />
defend itself to the limits of its ability is clear<br />
beyond all doubt to our own people, to our allies<br />
and to any potential aggressor. The development<br />
by negotiation of a regional defence system of<br />
United Nations Member States within the South East<br />
Asian and Indian sub-continental areas for mutual<br />
defence consistent with the requirements of the<br />
United Nations Charter and not inconsistent with<br />
the general provisions of Australia' s existing<br />
defence treaty commitments. Labor's defence and<br />
foreign policies are based on the conviction that<br />
war can and must be prevented and Australia has a<br />
part to play in its prevention. Australia demands<br />
the right to consultation in the great decisions<br />
of peace and war."<br />
Now this is the final sentence and I want you to listen to<br />
this final sentence<br />
" Labor will honour and support Australia's treaties<br />
and defence alliances."<br />
Now that is a very now wait a minute. That is a<br />
very important sentence, but the significant thing is that<br />
that sentence appears in the platform of the Labor Party<br />
for 1963 and 1964, but it has been dropped from the platform<br />
of the Labor Party in 1965, and I say, Sir, that this<br />
Australian Labor Party under its present leadership has no<br />
intention of honouring Australia's treaties and alliances<br />
with those with whom it has engaged This provision<br />
that I have referred to was deliberately dropped from the<br />
platform of the Australian Labor Party and I suggest to<br />
Mr. Calwell and to Mr. Whitlan, his doubtful deputy, I suggest<br />
to Mr. Calwell and to Mr. Whitlam that they occupy the<br />
remainder of this by-election campaign explaining to the<br />
Australian people why the Labor Party has dropped from its<br />
platform the sentence which says " Labor will honour and<br />
support Australia's treaties and defence alliances"<br />
Now, ladies and gentlemen, if this by-election has<br />
done nothing else it has at least brought out into the open<br />
that the Australian Labor Party, without any flourish of<br />
trumpets and without the Australian public being fully aware<br />
of this matter until it has appeared in this rather obscure<br />
way, the Australian Labor Party has dropped from its platform<br />
its undertaking to honour and support Australia's treaties and<br />
defence alliances. All right, we now know where the Labor<br />
Party stands on South Viet Nam. They don't stand with the<br />
United States and the Allies and the South Vietnamese and they<br />
don't stand by the treaties and alliances which we, for<br />
Australia's protection, have freely entered into. </p>
<p>4. ( a)<br />
Now let me move to the next point. The next point<br />
that I want to deal with is why did we find it necessary to<br />
introduce a National Service scheme. As is well known,<br />
the Australian Government decided some years ago that<br />
Australia should establish and maintain a well-equipped,<br />
highly mobile Regular Army, Navy and Air Force. And over<br />
recent years we have increased the strength of the Navy,<br />
the Air Force and the Army. In 1964, after a period in<br />
which Indonesia had embarked on a policy of confrontation<br />
against Malaysia, a country to which Australia had given<br />
an undertaking to assist in its defence, and at a time when<br />
Communist pressures were increasing in South Viet Nam, in<br />
Laos, in Cambodia, in Thailand, in other parts of South<br />
East Asia, the Government decided that Australia should<br />
increase our Regular Army components. Now at that time the<br />
target was 22,500 men, and a decision was taken to build<br />
this total up to 37,500. S. </p>
<p>Now, Sir, at that time we were engaging on an active<br />
campaign of advertising for volunteers. We were offering<br />
improved conditions and terms of service, and no one can<br />
seriously argue that the conditions and terms of service are<br />
unfavourable or unattractive because the fact of the matter<br />
is that Army men who come to the end of their period of<br />
service are re-engaging at what is a very high percentage rate.<br />
The figure at the moment is higher, the percentage of reengagement<br />
is actually higher in the Army than it is in the<br />
Air Force or the Navy. It is a percentage of 70, and 700%<br />
of re-engagement is one of the highest figures in the history<br />
of the Australian Army. And so this defeats any argument<br />
that there are not sufficiently attractive pay and conditions<br />
offering for the Regular Army.<br />
So you look for the reason elsewhere and the reason<br />
why we are not getting all the volunteers that we require is<br />
to be found in two directions. The first is that in a fully<br />
employed society, with plenty of opportunities offering for<br />
our young men, in a country that doesn't have a military<br />
tradition, you don't have a great number of young men offering<br />
for an Army career, and the number offering over the last<br />
three years has been in the neighbourhood of 8,500 young men.<br />
But the Army if it is maintaining a small Regular Army has to<br />
have a highly efficient Army, a very fit Army, a well-trained<br />
Army, and people who can measure up to the demands of the<br />
various and varied diverse circumstances that a mobile Army<br />
group will have to meet in various parts of South East Asia.<br />
And so we found in practice that out of some 8,500 volunteers<br />
less than 2,500 were regarded as measuring up to the standard<br />
which the Army required. Now this operated right through<br />
the three years leading up to the changeover to National<br />
Service and when the decision was and it was<br />
a decision taken against a background of the highest advice<br />
we could secure, the strategic advice of our own Defence<br />
Committee, the Defence Committee consisting of the Chiefs of<br />
Staff of the three Services, the Chairman of the Chiefs of<br />
Staff Committee, the Permanent Head of the Prime Minister's<br />
Department, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Permanent<br />
Head of the Department of External Affairs. Now these people<br />
are the top advisers that the Government can secure and based<br />
on their strategic view of the worsening circumstances and<br />
situation in South East Asia they recommended a substantial<br />
increase in the Armed Services and the equipment available<br />
to the Armed Services.<br />
The Chief of Staff of the Army pointed ( obt to us<br />
that if we wished to increase our troops from 22,500 to 37,500<br />
then the voluntary system would give us merely an additional<br />
750 people a year, and quite obviously we wouldn't build up<br />
to the desired target on the basis of 750 people a year.<br />
And it was at this point, Mr. Chairman, that a Government<br />
which has the responsibility for the national security of the<br />
Australian people decided that a system of National Service<br />
was essential in the interests of our people. </p>
<p>Sir, could any party, has any political party in<br />
the history of Australia been humiliated and treated with<br />
such contempt as the Australian Labor Party's Federal<br />
Parliamentary Party was by the Federal Executive of that<br />
Party. Never in the history of the Australian people has<br />
a political party been treated with such contempt and been<br />
publicly humiliated in the way that the Federal Parliamentary party<br />
of the A. L. P. has over these recent months and this, Sir, is<br />
the Party that says to the people of Kooyong in this campaign<br />
elect us, put the Government out and put us in, put in a<br />
Party that has no defence policy, that has no foreign policy,<br />
that goes along with the noisier members of this audience in<br />
attacking Australia's alliance with the United States. These,<br />
Sir, are the people that ask the Australian Government and<br />
people to allow them to govern the Australia of today. Sir,<br />
there cannot be any doubt as to where Australians come out on<br />
this particular issue.<br />
Now you have a chance to show your support for a<br />
splendid candidate who will represent Kooyong ably and for long<br />
in the years ahead. I would have liked tonight, ladies and<br />
gentlemen, to have given you the positive side of the<br />
Government's programme in the domestic field. I would very<br />
much have liked to have had the opportunity to tell you of the<br />
positive side to the campaign in South Viet Nam because, as<br />
President Johnson pointed out in Honolulu when he met the<br />
courageous leader of the South Vietnamese people, we are<br />
determined that out of the struggle in South Viet Nam will<br />
come a reconstruction, a rehabilitation, a new economic and<br />
social order which will be a model and example to other<br />
countries in South East Asia. Now, Sir, this becomes possible<br />
if Communism can be resisted. This is what has occurred in<br />
Korea, this is what has been done in Taiwan, two countries<br />
rescued from Communist aggression and this is what can be done<br />
in South Viet Nam if we are able to hold in check the cancerous<br />
scourge of Communism.<br />
Now Communism is a cancerous scourge you either<br />
check the cancerous scourge of Communism, you check it, you<br />
eradicate it, or your victim goes under as it spreads its<br />
deadly poisonous effect through the victim concerned, and this<br />
is what has happened in so many of the enslaved countries of'<br />
Central Europe and this, but for the strength and resolution<br />
of the American people is what would be happening in South East<br />
Asia today. Ladies and gentlemen, it is a significant thing that<br />
in addition to all the countries which are giving their military<br />
and material aid in South East Asia, three distinguished<br />
Presidents of the United States, President Eisenhower,<br />
President Kennedy and President Johnson all have taken the<br />
same view of the necessity of resisting aggression in that<br />
country and we in Australia can feel deeply grateful for the<br />
resolution, the strength of purpose, the firmness of mind of<br />
the President of the United States, President Johnson, for<br />
his determination to see these issues through in South Viet Nam. </p>
<p>Now,. Sir, there are some 80,000 odd young men in<br />
the 20-year age group. And the total of National Servicemen<br />
required was some 8,400, approximately one tenth of the total<br />
number of people who reach that particular age arnd<br />
incidentally, it is of interest to know that in the task<br />
force that will be going to South Viet Nam there will be<br />
approximately 30% of the membership of that task force drawn<br />
from the National Service component.<br />
Now, right from the outset, it was intended that<br />
the National Service trainee should go into a Regular Army<br />
unit and in that army unit serve on the same pay, the same<br />
terms and the same conditions as the Regular Army Servicemen.<br />
But, having then gone into that Regular unit, they should go<br />
wherever that particular Army unit was placed some will be<br />
placed on various duties inside Australia, some will go to<br />
Malaysia, some will go to Viet Nami. If any trouble develops<br />
in our own Territory of Papua and New Guinea then others<br />
would be required in Papua and New Guinea. But where assisting<br />
the Regular Army troops, the people who represent Australia's<br />
contribution to our own security in this part of the world,<br />
they, Sir, will be supported by this comparatively small<br />
component of National Servicemen.<br />
Now, Sir, those National Servicemen are required to<br />
serve in regular service for a period of two years, and, as<br />
to overseas service in South Viet Nam, quite obviously just<br />
as only a fraction of the 20-year-olds will ever be called up<br />
for National S,:. rvice so also only a fraction of those actually<br />
called up will be required to serve outside Australia, whether<br />
in Viet Nam or elsewhere. The tour of duty in South Viet Nam<br />
is one year, after which they would retuirn to Australia.<br />
That in essence is the scheme and the reason why it was found<br />
necessary to introduce that scheme.<br />
Now the Labor Party has offered no alternative.<br />
What is the alternative policy of the Labor Party? First of<br />
all it says pull our troops out of South Viet Nam. it<br />
dropped from its platform the clause which says it will honour<br />
its treaties and its alliances, so it leaves Australia without<br />
treaty assistance and it leaves Australia without the<br />
friendship of those who would feel some obligation to us<br />
because in their time of peril we have given them assistance<br />
to resist the communist aggression directed against them.<br />
Now there in essence, ladies and gentlemen, is the issue on<br />
which the Labor Party chooses to fight this campaign. They<br />
cloud these issues over of course with an emotional smokescreen.<br />
They try to tell the mothers of this country that<br />
their boys are going to be taken away for indefinite periods<br />
of. time, that this is something which is going to apply to<br />
the young manhood of this country. They paint the most<br />
harrowing picture and, Sir, if I thought that the Australian<br />
Labor Party represented the feeling of the Australian people<br />
then I would despair for this country, but I am quite certain<br />
that this Australian Labor Party will go down in history as<br />
the weakest, the most irresponsible, the most unrealistic of<br />
all the political parties which have ever carried an honourable<br />
name in Australia. </p>
<p>Mr. Caiwell tells us that this is an unwinnable<br />
war what sort of national leader when we know we have<br />
on our side in this issue the United States of America, the<br />
people of this country, the people of other countries who<br />
are giving military support and the South Vietnamese<br />
themselves who have more than 200,000 regular troops in the<br />
armed forces of that country what manner of national<br />
leader is it who tells the Australian people that this is an<br />
unwinnable war. This is the man who wouldn't even support<br />
his own Labor Leader, John Curtin, when John Curtin thought<br />
it was necessary in the interests of Australia to call up<br />
national Servicemen. This is the man who now comes before<br />
you and says that he would be the leader of the Australian<br />
people at a time when the pernicious, corroding, erosive,<br />
influence of Communism is spreading through Europe and is<br />
spreading through Africa and is spreading through the<br />
countries of South East. Asia. Yes, but unfortunately<br />
Arthur Calwell is not. This is my deep complaint.<br />
Our friend here thinks that times are changing.<br />
Of course they are. They have changed since the days of<br />
the conscription of 1916/ 17. Arthur Calwell has never got<br />
outside the atmosphere of that campaign. They have changed<br />
since the days of the depression period of the 1930' s, when<br />
a Labor Government couldn't cope with the economic situation<br />
of that time. Here most of you in this room, most of those<br />
of you screaming here tonight, have never known anything but<br />
full employment thanks to this Government. No government<br />
in the history of Australia has ever kept its people employed,<br />
fully employed, in the way this Government has done. No<br />
country in the history of Australia has given the standard<br />
of living that this country has done. In Labor's last year<br />
of office they provided œ 9014-$ 18014-for social welfare.<br />
That was Labor. We, Sir, in our last Budget, provided<br />
$ 940M4 against $ 180M4 for Labor we provided $ 940M, so this<br />
Government has built the economy of Australia so that we<br />
can support a considerable defence effort, we can support<br />
the most rapid rate of development in the history of this<br />
nation and we can support the highest level of social welfare<br />
that this country has ever known.<br />
Why is it that around the world Oh, I<br />
know, they don't want to hear this, they don't want to hear<br />
it, of course they don't want to hear it but they cannot deny<br />
that these are the facts and these are the facts that Mr.<br />
Calwell and his parliamentary colleagues are not prepared to<br />
stand up to. This is why, although there are many issues<br />
on which this campaign in Kooyong should be fought, they want<br />
the smoke-screen of the one issue. They won't fight the<br />
election in Kooyong over the broad fields of government.<br />
policies they want to concentrate on the one item of policy<br />
and they organise this kind of undemocratic demonstration,<br />
this kind of demonstration worthy of the totalitarian countries<br />
for which their sympathies have been so plainly evidenced.<br />
Sir, does Mr. Calwell who was given an uninterrupted<br />
and attentive hearing in the meeting he opened in this<br />
camnpaign, does Mr. Calwell and that notable democrat, Mr.<br />
Whitlam, the dagger man, does he believe that this is the<br />
way in which Labor supporters should show how a political<br />
meeting should be conducted. I am quite certain that those </p>
<p>who came here to disrupt this meeting have gained many<br />
supporters for the Liberal cause. If there were any doubters<br />
in this audience tonight as to how their vote should be cast,<br />
then after tonight's performance there will be no doubt that<br />
they will be voting for a government that can maintain order<br />
at home and order abroad. They are not going to hand this<br />
country over to the rabble supporters of a rabble government.<br />
The Labor Party in Canberra today is a rabble party can<br />
anyone who has witnessed the events in the last few months<br />
describe it as other than a rabble party desperately trying<br />
to find a leader that they can support with any species of<br />
loyalty. They cannot support Caiwell they don't believe<br />
he is the man for leader, they cannot support Whitlam because<br />
they don't think he is a man that they can trust, and they<br />
cannot find a candidate inside the Labor Parliamentary Party<br />
that they are prepared to back for their leadership. And<br />
so a rabble party which offers Australia a rabble government<br />
turns to its rabble supporters and says go out and wreck the<br />
meeting of the one government that can conduct Australia to<br />
security and prosperity in these difficult times.<br />
So ladies and gentlemen, I think most of us tonight<br />
have got the essence of the message that we have been trying<br />
to get over to you. You don't have to hear from Andrew<br />
Peacock because you know that this young man has shown the<br />
qualities of character, of intelligence and of leadership<br />
which at this age have brought him to the election in the<br />
position of President of the State Division of the Liberal<br />
Party of Australia, and this young man in a first class field<br />
of candidates which offered themselves for the s~ ection for<br />
this notable seat he had the handsome votes which brought him<br />
here as your candidate tonight.<br />
Now Kooyong has been notable for its illustrious<br />
representation and I am quite certain that following Sir John<br />
Latham, Sir Robert Menzies and the men who preceded them will<br />
be a splendid candidate who enjoys the support of a most<br />
charming, gracious and attractive young wife. These young<br />
people will not only be an ornament for the electors of Kooyong<br />
but they will be assets of great value to the National<br />
Parliament in Canberra. I wish, Andrew, continuing success<br />
to you in the years ahead. I know that you will be a welcome<br />
addition to our ranks in Canberra. You are typical of the<br />
young vigorous, able and intelligent young men and women who<br />
are rallying in their thousands today to the Australian people.<br />
And not only are the young people rallying to us, but tbe,<br />
trade anionists of this country are rallying to us in increasing<br />
numbers. The Labor Party used to claim to represent the trade<br />
unionists of this country but, Sir, we would not be in office<br />
here today unless hundreds of thousands of men and women in<br />
the trade unions of this country voted for us regularly,<br />
election after election.<br />
And this party, this Liberal Party, this great<br />
national party, can claim to be truly representative of all<br />
sections of the Australian people. We are not a class conscious<br />
party envisaged by the memories of long ago struggles which<br />
seem to have poisoned the minds of Mr. Calwell and so many </p>
<p>of his supporters. This is a young party with a young<br />
outlook for the great future of a great country and it is<br />
with the help of able young men of courage and character<br />
like Andrew Peacock that we shall build a great Australia to<br />
which the Liberal Party will have made a notable contribution<br />
of leadership and wise political guidance and policy<br />
development. Ladies and gentlemen, give this young man, this<br />
very able and very courageous young man, a flying start on<br />
a long and notable political career by a bumper vote not<br />
merely victory, we know he is going to win but give him a<br />
vote of which he and we and all of us can be proud when he<br />
comes to the poll in the next week. </p>
