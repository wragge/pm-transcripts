<p>The Prime Minister has sent the following message to the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher:</p>
<p>When I met your new High Commissioner, Sir John Leahy, in Canberra on Sunday I expressed to him our shock at the outrage in Brighton last week and our sympathy for the victims.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Australian Goverment I also wish to extend deep sympathy to you personally, to those who are injured and to the relatives and friends of those murdered in that brutal blast. I fully support your courageous response to this appalling act of terrorism.</p>
