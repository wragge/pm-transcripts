    <content><![CDATA[<p>Iâm pleased to announce that Governor-General Designate, General Peter Cosgrove AC MC, will be sworn in as Australiaâs 26th Governor-General on 28 March 2014.</p>
<p>Chief Justice Robert French will swear-in General Cosgrove in the Senate with the reading of the Oath of Allegiance and the Oath of Office.</p>
<p>General Cosgrove and his wife Lynne will then reside at Government House in Canberra.</p>
<p>General Cosgrove has given service of the very highest order to our country.</p>
<p>I am confident that in this new role he will discharge his responsibilities with selfless dedication to duty.</p>
<p>Once again, Iâd like to thank Her Excellency the Honourable Quentin Bryce for the contribution she has made as Governor-General since her appointment in 2008.</p>
<p>Ms Bryce has discharged her duties as Governor-General with grace and distinction.</p>
<p>There will be a number of events to formally mark the end of Ms Bryceâs term as Governor-General in the week of General Cosgroveâs swearing-in.</p>
<p>24 February 2014</p>
