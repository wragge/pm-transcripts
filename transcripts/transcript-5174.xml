PRIME MINISTER 17 OCTOBER 1979<br />
from the Press Office Summary of* 1" P. M." 1<br />
The President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission,<br />
Sir John Moore, is seeking a meeting with Mr Street to discuss<br />
the Government's changes to the Conciliation and Arbitration<br />
Act. It appears that the main concern, which camne out of a<br />
meeting today between Sir John, senior presidential members<br />
of the Commission, and the Commissioners Association Executive,<br />
centres on the consultative provisions of the new legislation.<br />
It now seems that the Commissioners objections are based on<br />
a belief that thi. 1 provision will slow down proceedings,<br />
discourage trade unions from bringing industrial disputes<br />
before the Commission, and create new and unnecessary legal<br />
technicalities. They believe that such consultative provisions<br />
conflict with the objects of the Conciliation and Arbitration<br />
Act. Mr Street was accused today by Lionel Bowen-of misleading<br />
the Parliament on the circumstances leading up to the release<br />
by his Department of Mr Justice Staples letter, which sparked<br />
off today's meeting of the Arbitration Commissioners. Mr Street<br />
was closely questioned during Question Time on statements he<br />
made on last night. Report on this afternoon's events<br />
in Parliament.<br />
The Australian Government and the Japanese Government today<br />
signed the first bilateral fishing agreement between'the<br />
two countries, despite widespread opposition from game<br />
fishermen in North Queensland and who say that the<br />
Japanese long-line operators will wipe out the black Marlin<br />
in waters off the Queensland coast. The Minister for<br />
Transport and Primary Industry, Mr. Nixon, met with representatives<br />
of the Game Fishing Association last night. But as he told<br />
Parliament today, he was not able to delay the signing of the<br />
agreement. Mr. Nixon has assured the fishermen that proper<br />
monitoring controls will be enforced-and that he will ask<br />
permission from Cabinet to go to Japan to ask the Japanese to<br />
use voluntary restraint. Mr. Nixon interviewed.<br />
The Marlin controversy in Queensland has led to an unexpected<br />
move by the Queensland Premier, Mr. Bjelke Petsersen, to bring<br />
to the attention of the Commissioner for Community Relations,<br />
Al Grassby, comments made by the ALP member for Cairns, Mr. Ray Jones,<br />
which Mr. Bjelke Petersen says are racist. Mr. Jones is against<br />
the agreement to allow the Japanese to fish in North Queensland<br />
waters and says the only reason the Federal Government is allowing<br />
the Japanese is to protect their major trading agreements.<br />
Mr. Bjelke Peters~ en in Parliament said today that Mr. Jones'<br />
statement could damage the livelihood of North Queensland because<br />
the economy of the region depended heavily on exports of beef<br />
and sugar to Japan. Mr. Ray Jones interviewed. / 2 </p>

Three Adelaide academics have accused the Federal Government<br />
of silent collaboration with the Indonesian Government over<br />
the delay in distributing Australian aid to East Timor.<br />
About $ 200,000 worth of aid in the form of vegetable oil<br />
and high protein biscuits was authorised by the Government<br />
six weeks ago, but it is yet to reach the East Timorese.<br />
The Government has admitted the delay which a spokesman for<br />
the group, Lecturer in Politics at Adelaide University,<br />
Mr. Pat Flanagan, says is: the lastest scandal in the<br />
East Timor affair: interviewed.<br />
Returning to comments made by Mr. Ray Jones, ALP Member for<br />
Cairns, in the Queensland Parliament about the Australia-Japan<br />
fishing agreement and allegations that the Federal Government<br />
may have bowed to pressure to preserve our beef and sugar sales<br />
to Japan.--Queensland Premier, Mr. Bjelke Petersen interviewed.<br />
Some children in Sydney are spending up to $ 6.00 a day on<br />
pinball machines, according to the N. S. W. Minister for<br />
Consumer Affairs, Mr. Einfield. The Minister told State Parliament<br />
he was disturbed about where the children were getting the<br />
money and about the possiblity that undesirable people were<br />
running pinball parlours: interviewed. 000----f t; 8~ </p>
