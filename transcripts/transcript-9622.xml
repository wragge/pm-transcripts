TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH FRAN KELLY, ABC RADIO 8 JUNE 1995<br />
Unedited version*<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
FK: Prime Minister, a minimalist position is the position you have put<br />
tonight, is that a concession then that what we now have actually<br />
works and doesn't really need to be changed much. Why bother if all<br />
we are doing is a minimalist change?<br />
PM: Why bother is, it is entirely inappropriate that the Australian head of<br />
state should not be an Australian person. As I said last night, that<br />
person should be one of us and only an Australian can represent the<br />
aspirations of our people, of our nation and that it is, in the long run,<br />
intolerable for us to be represented and to have as our head of state<br />
the monarch of another country.<br />
FK: You say that, but what is the pressing need for change? Most people<br />
in their daily lives wouldn't think, gosh we must have an Australian<br />
head of state.<br />
PM: It makes us stronger. It makes us stronger as a country to know that<br />
we are independent in all respects including this one. That we are<br />
more complete. That we are more unified and that as a people we<br />
engage the rest of the world knowing exactly who we are and what we<br />
are. These things are tangible and real and it just has to change and<br />
what we propose the minimalist proposition proposal is not a<br />
concession, it is practical. What it is saying is our system of<br />
Government has worked, we don't want to change the system of<br />
government, but we do want to change the head of state and this is<br />
how we might do that, but still maintain the benefits that we have<br />
enjoyed from the system that we have developed.<br />
EK: As you spoke last night, some members from the Opposition kept<br />
calling out ' yes, isn't Bill Hayden doing a good job. Yes Bill Hayden is </p>
<p>doing a great job'. What is the problem with the job currently being<br />
done with the Governor-General, isn't that in essence, doing the same<br />
job that you are proposing this person to do?<br />
PM: But, the Governor-General in representing the Queen of Australia in,<br />
and in all practical respects, the Queen of Great Britain can never no<br />
matter who is Governor-General, represent Australia adequately. It is<br />
one of the reasons why, frankly, the Governor-General rarely travels<br />
because you might remember just a year or so ago, the Governor-<br />
General was going to some particular country, and the Government of<br />
that country rang the British Foreign Office to see whether they should<br />
receive him. I mean, what a disgrace.<br />
FK: If we could just look at some of the essential parts of the plan you<br />
outlined last night. One of the key pieces of it that will attract a lot of<br />
attention is the proposal that says no popularly elected president.<br />
Why not?<br />
PM: The answer is, that in our system of Government, the most democratic<br />
institution is the diffuse power of the House of Representatives. The<br />
diffuse democracy, representative democracy, that we see at the<br />
House of Representatives where every member of Parliament is<br />
elected from a constituency where they go home at weekends and<br />
relate to it, where they have an electorate office and where you see<br />
the great public issues come and go, where the parliamentary system<br />
responds to it, whether it be the preservation of our forests or<br />
Aboriginal health or whatever the issues you have seen in this last<br />
year, the Government respond to, change its position because we are<br />
all out there in a representative system feeling our way with our<br />
democratic process. But, if only one person in the system is elected<br />
and aggregates substantial power to that position the whole system<br />
changes. The House of Representatives is diminished.<br />
FK: So, what you are saying is they have more votes than say the Prime<br />
Minister?<br />
PM: No, no, not more votes just that diffuse power is better and more<br />
trustworthy for the country. More effective, more practical, more<br />
reliable, more sound than one person. That is one person being the<br />
embodiment of the nation invested with great powers. So, if we are<br />
going to vest considerable powers in such person, the source of the<br />
power should be constrained. That is why the Government accepted<br />
the Republican Advisory Committee Report's recommendation that the<br />
House of Representatives and the Senate sitting in joint session,<br />
should by two thirds majority elect such person. </p>
<p>FK: Is there a danger in that position though for you electorally because it<br />
immediately alienates the 75 per cent or more people who currently<br />
say in the polls that they want to elect the president?<br />
PM: No, I don't think so because they say that when asked: " do you want<br />
to elect a president?" ' oh, yes'. But if you say to them ' well look, you<br />
realise if you elect such person that the whole system of government<br />
changes'. You see, I am the Prime Minister, but I was not elected<br />
Prime Minister by the public at large. I was elected Member for<br />
Blaxland. I was chosen by my party as the leader and appointed by<br />
the Governor-General to be Prime Minister. I was not elected Prime<br />
Minister and I could be unelected tomorrow morning. In the same way,<br />
for instance, as my predecessor Bob Hawke was or his predecessor.<br />
The same with Ministers. In other words, there is no one above the<br />
system, larger than the system, so larger or so far above it as to<br />
actually change it. As to make this representative democracy<br />
impractical or do substantially shift the power from the executive and<br />
the Parliament to one person.<br />
FK: You mention in your plan it would need a two thirds Parliamentary<br />
majority to elect the President. Some of your opponents have already<br />
pointed out the fact that Malcolm Fraser was only one vote off that in<br />
1975 and it could be the case that we have a two third government<br />
majority.<br />
PM: Well, if he had a majority of two-thirds in 1975, he was entitled to say<br />
who the person was. I mean, if the Liberal and National Parties...<br />
FK: So it could be, in fact, if we had a Government majority of two-thirds<br />
that could just then go ahead and appoint the President of their wish?<br />
PM: Just like Prime Minister's in the past have exclusively appointed<br />
Governors-General by proposing to the Queen a certain person. Well,<br />
technically, the Queen appoints the Governor-General, but on the<br />
nomination of the Prime Minister. But frankly, if a party had two-thirds<br />
but you understand, there has never been a case in the post-War<br />
years when any party has had a two-thirds majority.<br />
FK: One vote off though that's pretty close.<br />
PM: Well, if Malcolm Fraser was one vote in both Chambers from a twothirds<br />
majority, and he had let's say, 2 more votes, in my view he is<br />
entitled to make the nomination. I mean, what's so terrible about that?<br />
FK: You have also dismissed the idea of a people's convention it's a<br />
notion that will sell well in the community it sounds good.<br />
PM; Yes, but it's a fraud you understand, it's fraudulent? Because the<br />
convention can't initiate the proposal. Under the Constitution, there is </p>
<p>only one place of initiation, and that's the Parliament. There is no<br />
power under the Constitution for a convention. You see, this is not the<br />
1890s when we had a convention in the 1890s, in the 1890s the<br />
convention's were the initiating body. There was no Constitution, there<br />
was no Commonwealth of Australia, and there was no Parliament. But<br />
now there is a Constitution, there is a Commonwealth of Australia, and<br />
there is a Parliament. Under that Constitution, only the Parliament can<br />
initiate referenda. So, that's why all of the Constitutional conventions<br />
have failed they can only be, at best, advisory, and you heard what<br />
Mr Howard said, cynically, and his predecessor " oh yes, we would<br />
have a convention", " but Mr Howard, would you adopt that which the<br />
convention says?", " oh no, no not necessarily".<br />
FK: But it also allows Mr Howard to say that they would give...<br />
PM: What do they think they are coming at?<br />
FK: They say it gives them the opportunity for the people to have the<br />
Constitution they want, rather than the republic Keating wants? That's<br />
a very powerful line out in the electorate, isn't it?<br />
PM: No it's not a powerful line at all it's completely fraudulent. The<br />
people the greatest expression of the democracy of the people is by<br />
referendum. I mean, the people are quite conscientious about this<br />
thing they know that their power is in the ballot box. They know that it<br />
is entirely their choice you can't have a republic, or any other<br />
constitutional change, without securing the support of a majority of<br />
voters, in a majority of states, and a majority overall. So, it is the most<br />
democratic operation. But, a so-called people's convention what, a<br />
state Government sending 10 MP's? Or a collection of their<br />
community interest groups? I mean, they are of their essence elitist.<br />
They are not people's conventions, and they never were.<br />
FK; Well, you emphasised in your speech that their would be widespread<br />
public consultation...<br />
PM: Indeed.<br />
FK: Is that an attempt to offset this criticism, or this line...<br />
PM: No -just to listen.<br />
FK: that a people's convention is a more democratic way of going?<br />
PM: I have demonstrated, I think to you, categorically, that it is not<br />
democratic. Because, for a start, under the Constitution, its decisions<br />
can't be implemented. What's democratic about that? What can be<br />
more democratic than a referendum and a vote by the Australian<br />
people... </p>
<p>EK: Well, after widespread<br />
PM: . just a sec, if the Government is then prepared as it has been to<br />
propose a model, and has listened now after having the Turnbull<br />
Committee produce a report and adopted its principle recommendation<br />
if after having done that and remember that Committee did consult<br />
very widely, and was made up of a representative group of people, a<br />
couple of people who are members of the Coalition, Constitutional<br />
experts etc in the course of the period between now and when a<br />
referendum is put, the Government will listen to community opinion. I<br />
mean, there is no doubt in my mind that the presentation of these<br />
proposals yesterday fall on much more receptive ears than say 18<br />
months ago. There is no doubt that the vat is maturing.<br />
FK: So you think the debate is happening out there in the community?<br />
PM: We have got wine in there we mightn't have Grange Hermitage, but<br />
we have got wine in there. And what we had was grape juice, 18<br />
months or two years ago. I mean, the community opinion is forming,<br />
and maturing, and therefore I think they will receive these proposals<br />
well, and the Government will pay due regard to the shifts in opinion<br />
about this, just as it did, say, recently, on things like the timber<br />
industry, or the environment, or aboriginal health. In other words, we<br />
will be listening, and talking but remembering that the Parliament is<br />
the initiating body of a referendum.<br />
FK: Well, how much change would you wear to this plan, then?<br />
PM: It's not immutable, and we will listen to what people have to say. But if,<br />
for instance, what the Coalition says that we want to bog it down in an<br />
elitist Constitutional convention which has no powers, and for which<br />
they say will not accept the decisions of such a convention because<br />
John Howard is utterly indecisive and into obfuscation. I mean, it's a<br />
very simple question, just by the way. The question is should an<br />
Australian be the Australian head of state? It's not a complex<br />
question.<br />
FK: Isn't the next question it is complex?<br />
PM: Just a sec why can't he say yes or no? I mean, I think what John<br />
Howard has to tell us tonight is where he stands on the simple<br />
question does he believe an Australian one of us should be our<br />
head of state, or not? If he says, " I believe in a convention which<br />
discusses, I believe in the current Constitution, and I believe in a<br />
convention which will discuss the powers of the Senate, the external<br />
affairs power', you know that he has basically passed the parcel he<br />
has copped out. But he is, completely and totally, indecisive. Now, </p>
<p>that's why, in this country, nothing happens unless the Labor Party<br />
gets it cracking, and we have done this again with the republic.<br />
J: But are you being slightly less honest here by saying the only question<br />
is should we have an Australian head of state? Isn't the next question<br />
one that is going to cause quite a lot of confusion potentially, what will<br />
the powers of that person be? Don't we need to codify them, shouldn't<br />
we write them down?<br />
PM: No, what we will say in the Constitution is that most of the things the<br />
Governor-General does now each day, the President of the<br />
Commonwealth of Australia will do on ministerial advice. There will be<br />
only those very few matters on those very rare occasions where these<br />
so called reserve powers have to be used. And let's take the history,<br />
we are five years off from the century and only once in the century has<br />
there been any controversy over these powers and that was in 1975.<br />
J: In 1975 it was quite a vicious and divisive controversy<br />
PM: And it was resolved.<br />
J: Why are you allowing that situation to emerge again?<br />
PM: Well because you can't get agreement about writing these powers<br />
down. I mean, you are saying why would I allow that? If I said to<br />
John Howard tomorrow morning that the President of the<br />
Commonwealth of Australia was not entitled to dismiss a Government,<br />
who could not guarantee supply through the Senate, he wouldn't<br />
agree. And, therefore, there will be substantial disagreements about<br />
these things. Better to leave the power on a contingent basis and it is<br />
I think no bad thing that in this country for the next 100 or 200 years,<br />
and that is what we are thinking of, that there is a power there because<br />
to try and write them down, how can you foresee what the powers<br />
might need to be? But let's make sure that the source of the power,<br />
that is the election of the head of state, is from the representative<br />
chambers the House of Representatives and the proportional power<br />
of the Senate and that way, nobody is walking around the system<br />
saying " I am the deputy of an English monarch, I am hearing voices<br />
from God, I have a higher duty". They are really getting the power<br />
from those chambers and that power can be taken back by the same<br />
two-thirds majority.<br />
J: Talking about hearing voices of God, there are those who are opposed<br />
to your plan, who think that that is how you want to set yourself up and<br />
you want to do more than just a republic. You want to change the<br />
powers of the Senate, reduce the powers of the Senate, change the<br />
powers of the State. </p>
<p>PM: Well I made it very clear last night that none of that is in the<br />
Government's proposal. I mean it just a matter of record. The<br />
Government's proposal doesn't go to any of those matters and you<br />
might know that in the speech I referred to the report of the<br />
West Australian Parliament, under the current Coalition Government of<br />
Western Australia, which looked at the minimalist option and said that<br />
it in no way changed the nature of the relationship between the<br />
Commonwealth and the States. So, in the end, red-herrings sure,<br />
opponents of this will drag the red-herrings out, but they won't last a<br />
day those red-herrings.<br />
J: Mr Keating what do you say to those Australians who passionately<br />
don't want a republic, passionately are devoted to the English<br />
monarchy? What do you say to those people if they do get left<br />
behind?<br />
PM: The first thing I would say is, I understand very well the basis of those<br />
sentiments, but it can never be right that the Australian head of state is<br />
the monarch of another country. It must be an Australian person, it<br />
must be one of us.<br />
J: Does it mean, though, that we now hate Britain, that we now don't love<br />
the Queen?<br />
PM: But you are not entitled to ask that question when you saw the<br />
sentiments I expressed last night about our British heritage, the<br />
strength of the Parliamentary system that we have had from it, our<br />
affection for the Queen and our links with Britain, both in peace and<br />
war, Prime Minister Major's recent view of a year or so ago, that we<br />
should have a modern relationship. These are all things that I heartily<br />
endorse. I mean for my part, I have a very good relationship with Her<br />
Majesty and I wrote a letter to her yesterday, covering the speech,<br />
indicating to her that some of the proposals there were things that I<br />
discussed with her at Balmoral.<br />
J: Mr Keating, just finally, where does this process go from here? How,<br />
in your words, do you get this, turn this, into Grange Hermitage?<br />
PM: Well, I think, now there is a set of proposals. You see if you just go<br />
back a little bit, after the Republican Advisory Committee Report came<br />
down and I said a few things about it and a couple of other Ministers<br />
did, people said " oh look the politicians should stay out of this, leave<br />
this to the public, leave it to a public debate". We said okay, right.<br />
A year or so down the track, we have had Mr Turnbull and others<br />
coming out saying " what is the Government doing about our Report?<br />
It is time they responded." In other words, they needed a Government<br />
proposal. Well last night they got one and that Government proposal<br />
will now see the third stage of the debate. The first stage was the<br />
presentation by me, in the policy speech in 1993, saying that the </p>
<p>Labor Party believes we should have a republic before the turn of the<br />
century. The second stage was the commission of the Republic<br />
Advisory Committee Report. The second stage debate, finished last<br />
night. That was the beginning of the third stage. A set of proposals<br />
from the Government. Now there will be a process of consultation and<br />
listening by the Government to see in which way those proposals<br />
might be varied and how and when the Government proposes a<br />
referendum.<br />
J: And have you heard back from the Queen?<br />
PM: Oh no I haven't and I wouldn't expect to. But not only courtesy, but<br />
appreciation demands that she be treated entirely properly and taken<br />
into our confidence.<br />
J: Mr Keating thank you.<br />
PM: Thank you indeed.<br />
