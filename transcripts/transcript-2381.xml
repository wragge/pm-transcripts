NEW PRIME MINIST'ER<br />
PRESS, RADIO AND TV CONFERENCE GIVEN BY THE<br />
LEADER CF THE LIBERAL PAKW-T-7( 4R. WILLIAMFIMcMAHON<br />
CANBERRA 10OMARCH 1971<br />
MR. McMAHON: There is not much I want to say to you other than that today<br />
the Party has had a vote, voting for the Prime Ministership, an~ d they decided<br />
they wanted a new election for the Leader of the Liberal Party. The vote was<br />
taken and I have been declared the Leader of the Party and I consulted with<br />
Mr. Gorton about taking over from himr. The vote was also taken for the Deputy<br />
Leadership and Mr. Gorton has been declared by me to be the Deputy Leader.<br />
I don't know the numbers of votes. I think only the scrutineers would know<br />
them, so I hope there won't be a great degree of speculation about how many<br />
votes I won by or how narrowly I squeaked into the position of the leadership<br />
of the Liberal Party. This afternoon, I will be going out to Government House with<br />
Mr. Gorton in order to advise the Governor-General and to see what action he will<br />
take about the courses of action that are open to him. At 2. 31.0 the House will<br />
meet and Mr. Gorton will ther announce to the House the changes that have taken<br />
place in the Liberal Party and will then ask for the adjournment so that the normal<br />
Constitutional practices can be observed.<br />
I don't want to say a great deal to you today othier than this. I am<br />
a Party man. I believe in the Liberal Party and I believe the L-iberal Party is the<br />
organ by which the national will and the national consciousness can be put into effect.<br />
I am a very great believer in the system of Cabinet Governmsnt, in full discussion<br />
in Cabinet with every Member having the opportunity to express his views, and only<br />
when political mratters of the highest moment are involved, should the Prime<br />
Minister feel that he should intervene and ensure that the fullest discussions take<br />
place or fuller discussions take place between the Cabinet mT_-n. isters and Members<br />
of the Parliamentary Party. I want the Party itself in the Party Room to be able<br />
to play an increasingly important part in knowing what is going on in the Government,<br />
knowing the facts on which Cabinet decisions are based, knowing the reasons<br />
why we have decided to introduce new types of legislation, arid I hope by this mneans<br />
to ensure that not only are we cohesive but when we go to the election, whenever<br />
it might happen to be somewhere towards the end of 1972, vie will have that<br />
degree of cohesion, we will have the public confidence that will make certain that<br />
we come back with a bigger majority than we have at the present moment.<br />
That is all I want to say to you. I can assure every member of<br />
the Press, and most of you know me well by now, that whenever you feel you<br />
want to have a press conference with me, provided you give me some notice oFF<br />
the kind of questions and the problems that you want me to handle, believe me<br />
I will do my best to fit in with your wishes because I want the Australian public<br />
to be informed of what the Government is doing and, just as importantly, the<br />
reasons why the Government is taking the kind of action we recommend. o. / 2 </p>
<p>Q. Mr. McMahon, do you intend to prorogue Parliament? Will<br />
Parliament be prorogued, Sir?<br />
A. I am not sure of the procedure, but it will meet at 2. 30. The<br />
Prime Minister will announce that a new Leader of the Liberal Party has beep.<br />
elected, and that we are to go out for an interview with the Governor-General,<br />
and then the House will be adjourned until the ringing of the bells...<br />
Q4 Mr. McMahon, I understand the Governor-General may not be in<br />
Canberra today. Do you know whether this is so?<br />
A. Well the information that is now available to me is that he is<br />
there at Government House.<br />
Q. After the ev ents of today and yesterday how do you now feel about<br />
working with Mr. Gorton as Deputy?<br />
A. Mr. Gorton has been elected as the Deputy Leader of the Liberal<br />
Party by the Liberal Party itself. I am sure we will both work together in the<br />
interests of the Party and above all in the interests of the cou-aitry.<br />
Q. What do you know about the future of Mr. Fraser?<br />
A. Don't ask me that yet because I have only been elected the Leader<br />
of the Liberal Party in the course of the last hour.<br />
Q. When do you expect to name your new Ministry?<br />
A. Probably the existing Ministry will have to be sworn in. I am<br />
not sure of this for the time being. But I will announce the Ministry when 1.<br />
get a commission I will announce the Ministry as soon as I can. But that of<br />
course will take some time and I must have the fullest discussions with<br />
Mr. Anthony, with the Country Party.<br />
Q. After Mr Gorton virtually voted himself out o! the vote of<br />
confidence, were you surprised that he stood as Deputy Leader?<br />
A. No, he had the right to stand as the Deputy Leader and the Party<br />
had within its power the right to elect him if it wanted to. it elected him and that<br />
decision binds me in the same way as it binds every other Member.<br />
Q. ( Inaudible)<br />
A. I have just given an answer to that question a few moments ago.<br />
I 7,. aventt yet had time to thinlk about it.<br />
Q. Could you say whether you will be making a decision on the<br />
Ministry this week? I will try, but I can't be precise. </p>
<p>Q. Mr. McMahon, the antipathy between you and Mr Gorton, I think<br />
you would agree is a public fact. Do you think that despite this antipathy you can<br />
still work together in the next 22 months to the election?<br />
A. Yes.<br />
Q. Sir, have you spoken to Mr. Anthony since the election?<br />
A. I have spoken. to him to inform him that I have been elected the<br />
Leader of the Liberal Party and I asked him if he would make the timre available<br />
to speak to me as soon as he could.<br />
Q. Has he indicated he will work with you, Mr. McMahon?<br />
A. I haven't spoken to him on that matter yet.<br />
Q. Could we ask a question of Mrs. McMahon? How she feels about<br />
this<br />
A NO.' Can you tell us who the other candidates were for both positions?<br />
A. Mr. Snedden was a candidate for the leadership and Mr. David<br />
Fairbairn and Mr. Malcolm Fraser were also candidates for thle Deputy<br />
Leadership.<br />
Q. ( Inaudible) concerned with Mr. Fairbairn wthdrawing his<br />
statement that he was no longer available to serve as Minister in a Liberal<br />
Ministry?<br />
A. Mr. Fairbair-n is both a friend of mine and I admire him. But as<br />
yet, I have not had any discussions with him about Cabinet or Ministerial portfolios.<br />
But naturally I will have discu"-sions with him soon.<br />
Q. Do you see a place for him in the Ministry?<br />
A. I will think of every member of the Party and one of them will be<br />
Mr. Fairbairn.<br />
Q. Mr. McMahon, are you likely to be Prime Mirnister and Treasurer?<br />
A. I haven't thought of that, but naturally it will be one of the problems<br />
I will be giving consideration to. I don't think it is practicable for a person to<br />
act in two portfolios for very long. Other Ministers have tried it, other Prime<br />
Ministers have tried it, and it is a pretty diff icult if not impossible task.<br />
Q. I was thinking of Mr. Ben Chifley. </p>
<p>04<br />
A. That was quite right. But he was the only one in the Labor Party<br />
who had the capacity to do it.<br />
Q. Mr. McMahon speaking of your Ministry, have you considered<br />
the possibility of adopting the elected Ministry system?<br />
A. No.<br />
Q. Are you thinking in terms of a trip to Washington and other places<br />
very shortly?<br />
A. No.<br />
Q. What do you see as the main problems confronting the Government<br />
today?<br />
A. Don't ask me that at this moment. As soon as I have had time<br />
to settle into the leadership a2 the Liberal Party, then of course I will have another<br />
conference and you can ask me all the questions you want then. I think at the<br />
moment the real problem is how to organise the Government, the Ministerial<br />
portfolios in the Government and that I believe is the main problem that must<br />
face me for the time being.<br />
Q. Do you think a new Mlinistry should have another look at how the<br />
Government should deal with problems in the economy?<br />
A. Yes.<br />
Q. How long do you thinlk the House will be adjourned?<br />
A. I can't tell you because there is a lot to do. Iwas quite surprised<br />
when papers wiere brought to me, or to myself and Mr. Gorton, to see how much has<br />
to be done, particularly as there is a new Government the whole of the Ministry<br />
has to be sworn in before it can meet the House, so 1 couldn't give you any real<br />
guidance other than I would lilke the House to meet today.<br />
Q. You have said you will be having a look at the economy. Are there<br />
any other recent Government decisions that you would like your Government to<br />
review?<br />
A. Yes, Commonwealth/ State relationships.<br />
Q. Inaudible, concerning what sort of a line will be taken on this. </p>
<p>I couldn't tell you because I have -said that I am a Party man from<br />
the top of my head to the bottomn of my feet and I will want the fullest consultation<br />
with the Ministry and with the Party before I make any decision or fill in any precise<br />
details. Mr. McMahon, do you have in mind an early meeting with State<br />
Premiers? April 5, will that still be on? That was arranged by Mr Gorton<br />
with the Premiers. I see no reason-to change it but if I felt that it was impracticable<br />
to hold it, I would let them know immediately. But I would have no difficulty at all,<br />
no problem whatsoever in talking to them. I wouldn't doubt thazt in a few days I<br />
would be talking to Mr. A skin and later on to Sir Henry. But later on, I want to talk<br />
to them just as soon as I can.<br />
Sir Henry is mrost anxious to talk to you.<br />
As Deputy Leader, did Mr Gorton make any declarations of loyalty<br />
within the party to you and your potential administration?<br />
There was a universal declaration of loyalty. And in particular<br />
there were declarations of loyalty by Mr Snedden and then after the election of<br />
the Deputy Leader by Mr Gcrton.<br />
Do you anticipate any challenges to your leadership as Mr. Gorton<br />
has had. Inaudible comment about backbenchers.<br />
I hope not, but I hope that I will be able to so change the Party<br />
system to bring them well into the m echanism of governmenrt, I don't know how<br />
I will go about it, but it will be one of the major problems Of Government I Will<br />
face, and I hope it will bring great satisfaction to the Party.<br />
Sir the Prime Ministership has been your goal for a long time.<br />
Did you go in there this morning thinking that you might come out as Liberal<br />
Leader? Were you surprised and how do you feel personally now that you have<br />
attained it? It is a strange thing, but everyone seems to think I am a person<br />
of tremendous ambition. I don't think I am. I'm a tremendous worker and if I'm<br />
given a job to do I work at it and if it takes me to some other goal, and if the goal<br />
is the kind-that most people in the world would like that most people in Australia<br />
wi) uld like of course I'm glad I've got there. I think my wife would answer this<br />
question better than anyone else. But I don't feel the slightest bit excited or<br />
emotional, and you'd be as good a judge of this as she is. I have taken it in a<br />
composed way because I have been * here for a long time. I've seen Prime Mi. nisters<br />
come and go. I've seen the Miistry change. So I hope that what I will be able<br />
to do with the co-operation of my colleagues in the Country Party and my own Party<br />
I hope we can make this a very successful Government, and I'll do as much as I<br />
can all I can to ensure its success. </p>
<p>6.<br />
Q. Mr. McMahon do you have in mind calling this the First McMahon<br />
Ministry or the First McMahon-Anthony Ministry?<br />
A. I hadn't thought of it. I don't believe in giving titles anyhow.<br />
Q. Well it has to be one or the other.<br />
A. Oh, I don't know. For a long time we called it the Liberal-Country<br />
Party Government. And that title suits me for the moment.<br />
Q. Sir, did you thiink back in 1969 that you'd had your last chance<br />
at this job?<br />
A. I didn't bother to think about it. I knew that events change so<br />
quickly and as events change opportunities change with them, , so I didn't bother<br />
about the past. I always look forward to the future. And now I can only express<br />
my joy that I'm where I am.<br />
Q. Mr. McMahon have you sent a telegram to Sir John McEwen?<br />
A. I will.<br />
Q. ( Inaudible)<br />
A. I haven't thought out the contents yet.<br />
Q. How do you regard Mr. Whitlam as an opponent to fight an election<br />
against?<br />
A. I don't want to get heavily into politics at the moment, but you have<br />
heard me express my views in the past, and I see no reason after yesterday to<br />
think I should change my mind.<br />
Q. Sir would your Government be a more conservative one than<br />
Mr. Gorton's? 7<br />
A I don't know what that means.... what'tonservative" means.<br />
I will try with my Party and with my Ministry to make those changes that we think<br />
are desirable. I don't think " conservative" is a good word to use. We are a<br />
practical people, anxious I believe, demonstrably anxious, to do our best in the<br />
interests of the country. And whether that means being conservative, or being<br />
radical or being liberal, I don't know. We'll do our best, it doesn't matter<br />
what title people want to give us. All I can say to you is that I'll be very anticommunist,<br />
and I'll be very anti-socialist.<br />
Q. Mr. McMahon will Sir Cyrus Lenox still remain as Prime<br />
Minister's Department Head during your -reign? e / 7 </p>
<p>* 0 7.<br />
A. I haven't given a great deal of thought to that, but I will announce<br />
that in due time.., or I might not even announce it, it might just happen.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, will you consider an early increase for pensioners?<br />
A. Look, I am not there yet. I haven't yet discussed it with<br />
Cabinet. I want to ensure that Cabinet is fully consulted on everything before<br />
decisions are made. I personally will not make any statement about this until<br />
I have discussed it with the relevant Minister.<br />
Q. Mr. McMahon how do you feel about being the first Prime<br />
Minister from New South Wales for 22 years?<br />
A. I thought of Billy Hughes immediately,, but I can't tell you what<br />
my thoughts am. ounted to.<br />
Q. Do you feel yourself bound by the decisions of Mr. Gorton's<br />
Government in respect of tariffs, and trade practices and other economic<br />
measures he has taken in the name of the Cabinet?<br />
A. I am not going to discuss any policy decisions at the moment<br />
but everything is open to review tariff policies, economic policies.<br />
( To Max Walsh) I am sorry your guess this morning wasn't too good:<br />
Q. Mr McMahoni you have made a point that you would be anticommunist.<br />
Now there are a lot of families around Australia at the moment<br />
watching you on television and wondering just what you are going to do about<br />
Vietnam.<br />
A. The policy on Vietnam, the Government policy, has been more<br />
strongly pressed by me than by any other person there. Those policies will<br />
continue. But as I said, all policies are open to review. I stated when I was<br />
Foreign Minister there wasn't any single area of foreign policy activity where<br />
we weren't looking at our policies, our policy objectives and trying to find out<br />
whether changes should be made. Exactly the san-e will apply in the case of<br />
Vietnam as applies to the other policies. I cannot give you aniy decisions because<br />
I have not discussed the problem with my Cabinet colleagues.<br />
Q. There has been speculation that if you won today you would consider<br />
an early election to go to the people before the alleged honeymoon is over. Is<br />
there any truth in that?<br />
A. I think it is about 100-1 odds or even worse.<br />
Q. Do you feel any gratitude to Mr. Fraser whose resignation<br />
seems to have sparked all this off? </p>
<p>" Gratitude" is a word that Is not frequently used in political<br />
language. I respect Mr. Fraser. I think he is an able, perhaps a very able man.<br />
I make no other comment about Mr. Fraser other than that, and I like him.<br />
Q. Inaudible ( about the role of the mass media)<br />
A. I think the greatest problem any government faces is one of<br />
communication, and consequently the more intimate association you can have<br />
with the mass media the better it will be for the Government, the better it<br />
will be for Australia. The real problem is how do you do it. How do you<br />
explain your policies? How do you explain your policy objectives? I do hope<br />
I will be able to win the support of the mass media, particularly as I will be<br />
communicating with them to let themn know what we will be doing and why we<br />
are doing it.<br />
Q. Sir, will it be possible to arrange a regular press conference,<br />
say once a week?<br />
A. I don't know about once a week, but, regularly yes.<br />
Mr. Barnes Thank you very much on behalf of the Gallery Members. -Thank<br />
you for your assurance that in our future relations we will be having frequent<br />
contact. </p>
