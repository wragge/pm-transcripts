    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce the appointment of Mr Mike Mrdak as Secretary of the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government.</p>
<p>The position became vacant following the recent announcement by Mr Mike Taylor AO of his retirement. I express my sincere thanks to Mr Taylor for his dedicated service and wish him well.</p>
<p>Mr Mrdak, who will carry with him to his new position responsibility for the role of Commonwealth Co-ordinator General, will take up his appointment as Secretary on 29 June.</p>
<p>Until his appointment earlier this year as Co-ordinator General responsible for the implementation of the Government's Nation Building Economic Stimulus Package, Mr Mrdak was Deputy Secretary, Governance in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, with responsibility for corporate management, governance including Freedom of Information and electoral reform and Cabinet Secretariat.</p>
<p>Mr Mrdak previously served much of his public service career in the Infrastructure Department and its predecessors, rising to the position of Deputy Secretary.</p>
<p>He has extensive experience across the entire DITRDALG portfolio, including in policy development in the areas of aviation, road and rail transport, infrastructure investment and delivery and local government.</p>
<p>I am confident that Mr Mrdak's skills and experience equip him admirably for the many challenges of his new role.</p>
