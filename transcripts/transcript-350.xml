DR. P. L. BAZELEY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
On 18th May, 1961 the Director-General of Health, Dr.<br />
W. D. Refshauge, acting under Section 56 of the Public Service<br />
Act, charged Dr. P. L. Bazeley, Director of the Commonwealth<br />
Serum Laboratories as following<br />
" That the said Percival Landon Bazeley between the<br />
tenth and seventeenth days of May, 1961 was guilty of<br />
improper conduct in his official capacity in that he,<br />
being an officer of the Public Service, made statements<br />
to the public press in criticism of, and attempted to<br />
promote opposition to, the Commonwealth Serum<br />
Laboratories Bill introduced in the Parliament by the<br />
Government".<br />
The Director-General of Health suspended Dr. Bazeley as from<br />
the close of business on 19th May, 1961.<br />
The charge against Dr. Bazeley and his suspension were<br />
notified to the Public Service Board on 18th May, 1961 and as no<br />
recommendation was made by the Director-General of Health that<br />
salary should not be paid to Dr. Bazeley during his suspension,<br />
the Board did not make an order under sub-section of section<br />
of the Public Service Act 1922-1960, depriving Dr. Bazeley of<br />
his salary during suspension.<br />
On 26th May, 1961, Dr. Bazeley, in writing, denied the<br />
truth of the charge.<br />
The Public Service Board therefore, on 7th June, 1961,<br />
appointed a Board of Inquiry consisting of<br />
The Honourable Mr. Justice Richard Moulton Eggleston,<br />
Judge of the Commonwealth Industrial Court, Melbourne,<br />
Chairman of the Board of Inquiry,<br />
Sir Patrick Silvesta McGovern, and<br />
Francis Patrick O'Grady, Esq., Deputy Director-General<br />
of Posts and Telegraphs, Postmaster-General's<br />
Department, Melbourne,<br />
to inquire into the truth of the charge and to report to the<br />
Public Service Board its opinion thereon.<br />
After two full days of evidence had been -iven before<br />
the Board of Inquiry, Dr. Bazeley admitted the truth of the<br />
charge and the Board of Inquiry, on 21st June, 1961, reported<br />
that, having regard to this admission and to the other evidence<br />
tendered, it found the charge to be proved.<br />
The Board of Inquiry annexed to its report, at the<br />
request of Dr. Bazeley's Counsel, certain statements for the<br />
consideration of the Public Service Board. The Board of Inquiry<br />
said that it had not considered these statements in any way and<br />
was merely passing them on to the Public Service Board.<br />
At the request of Dr. Bazeley the Public Service<br />
Bord on 3rd July, 1961 received from Dr. Bazeley and his<br />
solicitor, oral and written representations which the Public<br />
Service Board might take into consideration when preparing the<br />
A-9 </p>
<p>A 2.<br />
recommendation it was required to make under the Public Service<br />
Act, to the Governor-General. Similarly on 6th July the<br />
Director-General of Health was given an opportunity to put his<br />
views to the Public Service Board on matters relevant to the<br />
Board's recommendation to the Governor-General.<br />
The Public Service Board has now reported to the<br />
Administrator of the Commonwealth, Sir Dallas Brooks, that it is<br />
of the opinion that the improper conduct proved in the case of<br />
Dr. Bazeley was a serious breach of a duty required of officers<br />
in a non-political career Public Service in the British and.<br />
Australian tradition.<br />
The Board recommended to the Administrator that Dr.<br />
Bazeley be removed from the Office of Director, Commonwealth<br />
Serum Laboratories and be reduced to an office in the Commonwealth<br />
Serum Laboratories having the designation of Senior Medical<br />
Officer, Grade 3, with effect on and from the date of the Order<br />
made by the Administrator in Executive Council.<br />
The Administrator in Executive Council on 24th July<br />
made an order giving effect to the Public Service Board's<br />
recommendation. The contents of the Order have been conveyed to<br />
1the Director-General of the Department of Health and through him<br />
to Dr. Bazeley. In its consideration of the matter the Public Service<br />
Board has noted that at no time was there any suggestion that Dr.<br />
Bazeley had been guilty of misconduct in his professional<br />
capacity as a qualified medical or veterinary practitioner.<br />
