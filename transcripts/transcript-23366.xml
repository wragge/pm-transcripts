    <content><![CDATA[<p>On my recommendation, Her Majesty the Queen has amended the Letters Patent constituting the Order of Australia.</p>
<p>Knights and Dames in the Order of Australia will be approved by Her Majesty on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>There may be up to four Knights or Dames created in any year.</p>
<p>This special recognition may be extended to Australians of “extraordinary and pre-eminent achievement and merit” in their service to Australia or to humanity at large.</p>
<p>Henceforth, the serving Governor-General will be the principal Knight or Dame in the Order of Australia.</p>
<p>The first new Dame will be the outgoing Governor-General.</p>
<p>The first new Knight will be the incoming Governor-General.</p>
<p>It is fitting that the Queen’s representative be so honoured.</p>
<p>Invariably, Governors-General have been extraordinary and pre-eminent servants of the Australian people.</p>
<p>My intention is that this new award will go to those who have accepted public office rather than sought it; and who can never, by virtue of the office they have held, entirely return to private life.</p>
<p>The Chairman of the Order of Australia Council will be consulted on any such recommendation.</p>
<p>This change will not affect existing Companions, Officers or Members of the Order of Australia.</p>
<p>I congratulate Her Excellency the Honourable Dame Quentin Bryce AD CVO and the Governor-General Designate, General Peter Cosgrove AC MC, on this acknowledgement of their service to our country.</p>
<p>25 March 2014</p>
