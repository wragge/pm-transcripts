PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL 9.30 P. M. CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER NATIONAL CONFERENCE<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF POLITICAL SCIENCE<br />
MELBOURNE 26 MAY 1984<br />
I am pleased once again to participate in a National<br />
Conference of the Australian Institute of Political Science.<br />
Indeed, I particularly am delighted to have the opportunity<br />
now to launch the book " Industrial Confrontation", which, as<br />
you would all know, contains the proceedings of last year's<br />
Summer School.<br />
At that Summer School I outlined a new approach to<br />
Australian industrial relations and economicdecision-<br />
making. That approach very soon after was being<br />
implemented by a Labor Government.<br />
The pace of events following the 1983 Summer School was<br />
quite extraordinary. I recall John Wilkes at the tea break<br />
after my presentation last year congratulating me on my<br />
Paper, suggesting it be made the main policy plank for the<br />
next election and predicting that, if this were done, I<br />
would become Australia' s next Prime Minister!<br />
Whatever success I have enjoyed since in fact assuming that<br />
office has been in large measure due to the quality of the<br />
staff and advisers around me. Percipience is always at a<br />
premium John feel free to come aboard!<br />
The strategy I outlined to you last January became the main<br />
thrust of the Labor campaign for the March 1983 election and<br />
has guided the industrial relations and economic policies of<br />
my Government'since then.<br />
Central to that strategy is the overt recognition that there<br />
is a large degree of mutual interest between the major<br />
participants in our national economic system. There is no<br />
necessary reason, in this view, why industrial issues-need<br />
be addressed in a confrontationist fashion.<br />
I a P </p>
<p>2.<br />
This might sound rather unremarkable in May 1984. But need<br />
I remind you of the pessimism implicit in your own January<br />
1983 conference theme, ' Industrial Confrontation Can We<br />
Survive It?'<br />
This was a direct reflection of the fact: that Australia then<br />
was a deeply divided society, with a disastrous recent<br />
history of turbulent industrial relations and an economy in<br />
the process of shedding a quarter of a million jobs in a<br />
single year.<br />
In those circumstances, what was needed was a deliberate<br />
redirection of Australian attention to the compelling shared<br />
interests of all parties to the industrial relationship.<br />
The common ground or point of convergence lay in the<br />
legitimate goal shared by all Australians of maintaining<br />
and, over time, improving their real incomes. All<br />
Australians share a fundamental interest in working<br />
constructively towards the achievement of real growth.<br />
At the Summer School I spelled out the conditions necessary<br />
for the achievement of co-operative, more productive<br />
endeavour by all Australians. Government, as I saw it, had<br />
a particular responsibility to provide the framework within<br />
which realization of those conditions might be possible.<br />
The essential elements of that framework boil down to three<br />
reasonably straight-forward propositions:<br />
First, that all parties need to understand the context in<br />
which their relationship is conducted; that is, a<br />
requirement for adequate information about the issues and<br />
choices available.<br />
Second, that all sides need to feel they are involved in<br />
decisions affecting that context; and<br />
Third, that the rules which govern the relationship between<br />
the parties be seen by all sides as compatible and<br />
consistent. I would add that there is another requirement namely, that<br />
the likely outcomes should be broadly accepted as being<br />
fair. In our complex, modern democracy, many groups have<br />
the power effectively to veto the changes necessary for<br />
growth. It is unrealistic to expect Australians to co-operate in<br />
joint endeavours to lift our national performance unless<br />
they are confident the benefits of growth will be shared<br />
equitably. In other words, a successful economic relationship requires<br />
information, consultation and fair treatment under the<br />
rules. T </p>
<p>3.<br />
Quite obviously, none of those circumstances prevailed in<br />
January 1983. Labor's strategy sought to address these<br />
needs as a means of bringing together all the participants<br />
in the industrial relationship, in Australian economic life.<br />
We aimed to return to Australia a sense of purpose and unity<br />
based on a genuinely co-operative approach between<br />
Governments, business and unions.<br />
The strategy of co-operation and consultation was begun over<br />
three years before we won government. The ALP and the ACTU,<br />
realising that competition over income claims would not<br />
contribute to a better quality of life, and would restrict<br />
and quite possibly destroy the efforts of government to<br />
reduce unemployment, negotiated a Prices and Incomes Accord.<br />
This was an achievement of historic significance.<br />
The Accord is not just a wages policy. It encompasses a<br />
spectrum of economic, industrial and social policies and<br />
provides a framework for continuous consultation and<br />
co-operation between the government and the trade union<br />
movement. Those doomsdayers who have predicted the demise of the<br />
Accord, have been shown to be wrong. They have not<br />
recognised that the Accord represents a long-term commitment<br />
to employment, stability and equity on the part of the<br />
Government and the union movement. This commitment is<br />
unshakeable, even if the detail of its implementation must<br />
be the subject of complex negotiation.<br />
The outcome of our strategy is now a matter of record. And<br />
what gives me so much satisfaction tonight in reviewing the<br />
past sixteen months is the great sense of achievement the<br />
Government can derive from the speed with which our strategy<br />
has been put into effect.<br />
The National Economic Summit held in Canberra in April 1983<br />
was our first step as a Government in the process of<br />
bringing together the main actors in Australia's economic<br />
and social life.<br />
It was the first time in our national history that such a<br />
diverse but representative group actually joined together to<br />
identify goals, to come to some understandings about the<br />
options before them, and to establish agreemeht about the<br />
appropriate means of pursuing joint goals.<br />
The Prices and Incomes Accord was endorsed at the Summit and<br />
was accepted as the foundation of the Government's policies<br />
for setting the economy on an upward path once more.<br />

<p>4<br />
Importantly, the Accord has provided an essential measure of<br />
stability and predictability to decision-makers in the<br />
economic process: The trade unions have committed themselves to wage<br />
restraint in the knowledge that the Government's<br />
policies will work to their advantage in job<br />
creation and improved standards of living over time<br />
An environment of stable real costs, in which<br />
profitability is being restored, has also been<br />
created. As a result there is a basis for renewed<br />
confidence in the business sector.<br />
Apart from ratification of the Prices and Incomes Accord,<br />
the broader achievements of the Summit were also<br />
tremendously important in creating an appropriate climate<br />
for the pursuit of economic growth. It provided the<br />
opportunity for the sharing of views, the exchange of<br />
information and perspectives across what could have been<br />
thought of in the past as the Australian ' Industrial Divide' what,<br />
truly, had been " The Great Divide<br />
The work of the Summit in sponsoring a pooling of knowledge<br />
and viewpoints has been carried forward since April 1983 in<br />
the work of the Economic Planning Advisory Council<br />
EPAC and in a wide range of other formal and informal<br />
bodies. In this manner, the habit of consultation and<br />
consensus has been established in our economic system and I<br />
have no doubt that it will be continued. The most<br />
persuasive argument in its favour is quite clearly its<br />
success. The main economic indicators confirm the view that recovery<br />
is well and truly underway.<br />
Economic growth has gathered pace somewhat more quickly<br />
than had been expected. The growth performance for the<br />
six months to December was the strongest since records<br />
have been kept in Australia.<br />
While this record in part reflects a low base and is not<br />
therefore likely to be sustained, the fact remains that<br />
growth into the forseeable future is likely to be very<br />
strong by historical standards. A review of recent economic<br />
indicators justifies this confidence.<br />
S Exports have reached a new record level<br />
The housing sector is bouyant<br />
Industrial production has picked up<br />
r </p>
<p>At the same time inflation has fallen dramatically with<br />
a rise in the CPI of only 5.9 per cent in the last<br />
twelve months. Even with the medicare factor excluded<br />
the CPI rose by only 7.6 per cent the lowest inflation<br />
rate for a long time.<br />
There has been strong growth in employment with 225,000<br />
new jobs being created since AprSl last year. And the<br />
unemployment rate has fallen by 4 of a percentage point<br />
to 9.5 per cent in the same period<br />
Non-seasonal interest rates have dropped to levels<br />
significantly lower than a year ago. We expect that a<br />
reduction in the deficit for 1984/ 85 will further reduce<br />
public sector pressures on financial markets.<br />
Business investment is also beginning to pick up. The<br />
figures for the March quarter of this year show a<br />
seasonally adjusted estimate of new fixed capital<br />
expenditure seven per cent higher than the December<br />
quarter result.<br />
There has, finally, been a very sharp drop in the level<br />
of industrial disputation:<br />
The number of working days lost per thousand<br />
workers as a result of industrial conflict is at<br />
its lowest point in seventeen years.<br />
We have achieved in little more than a year a basis for a<br />
return to confidence in our capacity, as a nation, to get<br />
our resources working for us again. The economy is now<br />
moving in the right direction. We aim to see the recovery<br />
sustained. Indeed, the challenge before us now is to consolidate our<br />
achievements and to ensure that our basic economic structure<br />
is appropriate for charting a sustained growth path into the<br />
medium and longer term.<br />
In this regard I think it quite right that this conference<br />
should be asking: ' Australia Poor Nation of the<br />
Pacific'? Provocative as this question might be, it draws attention to<br />
the real issues which must be confronted by-those concerned<br />
with Australia's long-term economic outlook.<br />
Our postwar record in harnessing the economic potential of<br />
Australia's significant resources human, technological and<br />
natural has not been good. Australia's per capita gross<br />
domestic product ( GDP) growth performance between 1960 and<br />
1980 was in the bottom 25 per cent of OECD nations.<br />
Compared with some of our East and South East Asian<br />
neighbours, our per capita GDP growth performance has been<br />
even less impressive. S<br />

V: r. X l~ l: i It ti,: </p>
<p>While care needs to be taken with direct extrapolation of<br />
such trends, we would be foolish to seek to deflect<br />
attention from some of the uncomfortable truths which are at<br />
the foundation of these comparisons. An inward-looking and<br />
reactive Australia, not geared to the prospects available<br />
through innovation and market expansion, will inevitably<br />
suffer a comparative decline in its standards of living.<br />
The risk is real. This reflects an Australian inheritance<br />
of past policies which have insulated our industry from the<br />
dynamic realities of world markets. The price of the<br />
misallocations and distortions caused by these policies, in<br />
additional costs for consumers and industry alike, has<br />
become unacceptably high.<br />
In an era of lower global growth and proportionately weaker<br />
world demand for many of our major primary exports, we can<br />
ill-afford such polic: ies.<br />
And even more se iou ; ly, to continue with an inward-looking<br />
industry strateg wi Ll mean forgoing the opportunity which<br />
now exists to sh: ire in the rapid economic growth of our own<br />
region. Premier Zhio was right when, earlier this year,<br />
during a visit to t ie United States, he spoke of the 21st<br />
century being the c ntury of the Pacific. President Reagan<br />
has also drawn atte. tion to this prospect.<br />
It is within our choice to make Australia a participant in<br />
the dynamism of the region or to slump passively into<br />
relative inefficiency and, by comparison with others,<br />
declining living standards.<br />
What we need to do nationally is to make sure that we make<br />
the best use of the resources available to us in both our<br />
private and public sectors to meet the requirements or<br />
preferences of society. Creating the conditions for growth<br />
will at the same time contribute to the achievement of a<br />
more equitable society.<br />
In present circumstances, the Government's emphasis has been<br />
particularly on the employment generating effects of growth.<br />
Given the disastrous effects of the recent recession this<br />
has been an inevitable priority. It will, however, be<br />
apparent that strong growth will also provide scope for<br />
improved and more equitable provision of services to the<br />
community in fields such as social welfare and education.<br />
: J With strong growth we can provide:<br />
Maximum opportunities for employment;<br />
High quality education which equips us for the demands<br />
of the workforce;<br />
T * 2 i I<br />
f. </p>
<p>7.<br />
A decent standard of living for all, including the aged<br />
and the disadvantaged;<br />
S Universal health care services;<br />
S Adequate housing;<br />
Essential community facilities such as services for<br />
children, immigrants and other special groups;<br />
Encouragement for the expression of national art and<br />
culture;<br />
SCommunity sport and recreation facilities;<br />
Preservation of unique aspects of the environment;<br />
And so the list could be continued.<br />
Ultimately, the scope which we have as a community to work<br />
towards these and other goals depends critically on the use<br />
which we make of our national resources of land, minerals,<br />
skilled labour and capital.<br />
In this sense, it will be far easier to devote resources to<br />
improving living standards if the economic cake as we<br />
measure it is growing bigger. This has be achieved both<br />
through raising the quantum of the resource base, or by<br />
achieving a more effective application of Australian skills.<br />
In essence this means there can be no shrinking from the<br />
need to improve our economic efficiency. In order to<br />
achieve this, we need to make more effective use of our<br />
existing natural and human resource endowment.<br />
I have already outlined to you the successes the Government<br />
has recorded in its macro-economic policy setting to date.(<br />
1 We have also adopted a number of measures aimed at<br />
encouraging industry to become more efficient, more flexible<br />
and more responsive to changes in economic circumstances.<br />
In respect of financial markets, our decision to deregulate<br />
the exchange rate was a major step.<br />
We have also acted on the Martin Committee recommendations<br />
on deposit regulations and on foreign exchange licences.<br />
Major aspects of that Report still remain for decision and<br />
are currently the subject of wide-ranging consultation by<br />
the Government.<br />
We have also been active in exploring with our regional<br />
neighbours the scope for improved trading opportunities both<br />
bilaterally and as they might emerge from any future global<br />
trade negotiations. N. C 4 1 r'I </p>
<p>8.<br />
These are all important policy areas which will have a<br />
profound influence in the medium to longer term on<br />
Australian prosperity.<br />
A particularly pressing requirement, is the need to secure a<br />
properly co-ordinated approach to industry policy.<br />
In this regard useful progress has already been made. The<br />
concentrated attention being given by the Government to the<br />
issues involved has already seen the sterile discussion of<br />
past years on appropriate levels of industry protection<br />
replaced by a more realistic and constructive concern with<br />
the parameters, processes and timing of industry<br />
restructuring. This has involved not only thorough reviews of Australian<br />
opportunities in such major markets as Japan and China, but<br />
has also seen a vigorous, co-operative effort with countries<br />
of the region to secure international attention to the<br />
region's most important interests in the international trade<br />
system. The recent meeting of the region's senior trade officials at<br />
Denpasar in Indonesia was particularly successful in this<br />
latter regard, and has seen a good number of the countries<br />
of the region, including Australia and all the ASEAN<br />
countries, register their particular and shared concerns<br />
with the participants at the forthcoming Western Economic<br />
Summit in London.<br />
Quite early in my Government's period in office we<br />
confronted the need to make some urgent decisions about the<br />
future of the steel industry in this country. In<br />
co-operation with the trade unions and industry we worked<br />
out a plan for rationalisation and recovery in that sector.<br />
That plan has been enormously successful.<br />
Another area requiring attention has been the motor vehicle<br />
industry. Details of the Government's new motor vehicle<br />
industry policy will be announced by Senator Button next<br />
week. It has also been developed through an intense, and I<br />
believe highly productive, process of consultation with all<br />
interested parties.<br />
It is a policy which will clearly demonstrate the<br />
Government's commitment to the gradual achievement over the<br />
long-term of rational, competitive industry structures.<br />
The question of industry structure generally is too<br />
important, and the consequences too far-reaching, for the<br />
policy issues which effect it to be treated in isolation<br />
from one another. Accordingly the Government is giving<br />
particular priority to co-ordinating more effectively all<br />
those aspects of our policy making which impinge on our<br />
long-term industry structure. Above all, we need a sense of<br />
direction and purpose in our efforts.<br />
04 </p>
<p>To this end a special Committee of Ministers, chaired by the<br />
Minister for Industry and Commerce, Senator Button, has been<br />
established to co-ordinate Government work in areas relevant<br />
to structural change in the economy. The issues are also<br />
being examined within EPAC and the Australian Manufacturing<br />
Council. Clearly a wide range of Government policies have an<br />
important influence on the performance prospects of various<br />
sectors of the economy and should be encompassed by any<br />
strategy aimed at improving the efficiency of Australian<br />
industry. The macroeconomic framework is obviously of paramount<br />
importance. But decisions made today, for example, in the<br />
areas of education and training, and science and technology.<br />
policy will also have a critical impact on the options for<br />
Australia's productive capacity and possible industry<br />
structure further down the track. Consideration, as well,<br />
needs to be given to improving the mechanisms by which<br />
Australian industry can benefit from the applicaton of<br />
research results.<br />
The industry policies adopted by the Government should also<br />
be informed by a balanced appreciation of the relevance for<br />
those policies of other Government decisions in the fields<br />
of trade, transport, taxation, labour market and foreign<br />
investment. Effective co-ordination of approach is a<br />
necessity. In the final analysis, however, what is particularly<br />
important is that comparative advantage whether natural or<br />
created be recognised and accepted as the key factor in<br />
determining restructuring policies.<br />
Particularly crucial to the development of a coherent and<br />
considered approach to industry policy is the need for a<br />
national economic information base which is as full and as<br />
accessible as possible. Already we have moved some way in<br />
this direction through EPAC which will each year prepare a<br />
detailed medium-term assessment of the economy.<br />
We should expect that, through the collection and<br />
dissemination of such information to the business sector,<br />
unions and other community groups, the process of rational<br />
decision-making at the levels of the firm, the industry and<br />
the whole economy will be made easier.<br />
The process of adjustment from our present industry<br />
structure to one which maximises the opportunities provided<br />
by our resource base and our location in the Asian region<br />
will inevitably mean costs for some in the community. I<br />
have said before that such costs should not be borne<br />
disproportionately by those industries and employees<br />
directly affected by such change. '-. C7 </p>
<p>Rather, because the change involved will ultimately benefit<br />
the whole community, compensating policies designed to<br />
spread the burden are absolutely necessary. Community<br />
endorsement for policies of the kind needed will hinge on<br />
there being broad agreement that all parties are receiving<br />
fair treatment.<br />
It will only be by openly and deliberately addressing issues<br />
such as these that Australia will secure its path to a<br />
prosperous future.<br />
If we are to establish for ourselves an appropriate place in<br />
the ' Century of the Pacific' we must apply to the challenges<br />
involved those characteristics which in the past twelve<br />
months have enabled Australians to pull this country out of<br />
its worst recession since the 1930' s. In many respects<br />
those challenges are more difficult.<br />
During my visits in the Asian region in the last year there<br />
was a widespread welcoming of our moves to establish the<br />
conditions necesary to ensure a dynamic economic<br />
relationship between Australia and the region. There was a<br />
clear appreciation that the Australian Labor Government is<br />
committed to seeing Australian industry more competitive and<br />
more capable of responding to opportunities within the<br />
region. The corollary of a more open Australian economic<br />
system is judged important by our regional neighbours.<br />
There is, at the same time, acknowledgement within the<br />
region that the necessary changes in Australian economic<br />
structures can only be phased in gradually. It is<br />
particularly appreciated that too rapid a movement would<br />
A result in negative domestic reactions leading to the sort of<br />
stop-start gyrations that are inimical to consolidated and<br />
successful change.<br />
QIt is only by effectively managing the process of change<br />
that we will be able to stand our ground in competition and<br />
co-operation within our region and consolidate our national<br />
economic future.<br />
The challenge is considerable. But with an appropriate<br />
national economic framework, and with effective mechanisms<br />
for -consultation on our goals and how to approach them, I<br />
believe we can confront this challenge successfully.<br />
Certainly all Australians stand to gain considerably from<br />
the extent to which we do so.<br />
Finally, let me say this. To this point I have been talking<br />
in essentially economic terms. I have been trying to<br />
convey what I believe is one of the most important truths to<br />
be understood by my fellow Australians concerned about the<br />
future of our great country the truth that the standard<br />
and quality of life of our children and succeeding<br />
generations will be determined by the standard and quality<br />
of our relations with the countries of our region. </p>
<p>4 11.<br />
We can, with good sense and constructive imagination, make<br />
the right decisions that will enable our economy to benefit<br />
from, and contribute to, the dynamic growth we can expect to<br />
see characterise that region. But we delude-ourselves if we<br />
imagine we can so conduct our affairs as to create the fact,<br />
or even the impression, of second-class citizenship for<br />
those of our people who have settled amongst us from the<br />
countries of that region.<br />
Put simply, this is not only morally repugnant, it is<br />
economically self-defeating. Those who, either explicitly<br />
or implicitly, give sustenance to such a position in terms<br />
of professed concern about lost job opportunities should get<br />
their perspectives right, ignoring as they do, in any case,<br />
the fact that our immigration levels are framed in the<br />
context of employment and capacity considerations. All the<br />
correct economic decisions we may make will be diminished,<br />
even negated, in terms of creating a productive and<br />
employment generating partnership with this dynamically<br />
growing region if we are perceived to go down that dangerous<br />
path sign-posted in the language of racial intolerance.<br />
I had cause to say in my maiden speech in the Parliament<br />
that if considerations of morality will not produce correct<br />
decisions perhaps the more persuasive element of<br />
self-interest will lead to that end.<br />
The events of recent weeks and I am not concerned here<br />
with attributing blame have been sad and they have<br />
certainly been against the long-term interests of our<br />
country. Let us, as Australians, understand that fact. And let us,<br />
as Australians, understand that we shall not be " the poor<br />
relation" but together as partners, based on a shared human<br />
dignity, we can provide the basis for a glowing and proud<br />
future for all the future citizens of our country<br />
