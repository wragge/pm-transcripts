    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Can I express on behalf of the Australian Government and the Australian people my incredible distress and sadness at what happened overnight in Baghdad. The brutal murder by terrorists of United Nations people and others adds yet another grim chapter to the behaviour of terrorists around the world. The death of Sergio de Mello, who I knew well from his time in East Timor, is a particularly grievous loss to the United Nations and the international community. He was a fine diplomat, a tireless crusader for peace, a thoroughly decent man and somebody who had devoted his life to bringing about harmony and understanding between peoples with strongly held opinions. He was the last person in the world in that sense who deserved to be the target of people who in some perverted way felt they had a just cause. And his death, and that of so many other United Nations people, simply underlines that nobody is safe from terrorists. There is no hierarchy of targets when it comes to the mindless acts of terrorism.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, are you concerned that the target has changed to the UN, which really didn';t play a partâ¦</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I condemn the murder of American soldiers. This suggestion that in some way it';s alright to murder American soldiers, I reject totally. But of course I condemn the murder of the United Nations people, and it really underlines the point that terrorists strike at everybody â they killed their Muslim brothers in Indonesia two weeks ago and they';ve now killed peacemakers from the United Nations â and that';s the point I';m making. Of course I';m concerned that United Nations people have been targeted, but if the implication in that question was that there ought to be no concern about the targeting of American soldiers, then as you can see I completely reject that implication.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>No, I wasn';tâ¦</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I';m not suggesting you are, but there is an underlying tone in some of the commentary on this matter â oh well, of course it';s par for the course to kill American soldiers, but once it wanders elsewhereâ¦. Well, I mean it';s all appalling and the point I';m making to you this morning is that mindlessâ¦ terrorism is inexcusable wherever it occurs, whatever form it takes. And while I';m at it, let me express my horror at the suicide bombing in Israel. Children murdered, people maimed â all the while that an attempt is being made by the international community to bring about a peace settlement. Terrorists don';t want a rebuilt Iraq. Terrorists don';t want a peace settlement in the Middle East. They might say the opposite, but in reality peace and stability is the enemy of terrorism. That is why they kill people who try to bring it about.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, what is the future for the United Nations in Iraq?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the United Nations has already made it very clear that it intends to stay in Iraq. It has a constructive role to play. Sergio de Mello was the Secretary General';s representative, his special representative, and I';ve said all along that the United Nations has a particular role to play in cooperation with the coalition.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do these further attacks that keep happening, do they make you rethink our role in Iraq?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I don';t. Certainly not. If anything, it strengthens my view that the right decision was taken. Look these people, at the very least, are connected with and are probably the remnants of the regime that was removed. Is somebody suggesting that people who behave in this manner should have remained in occupation? Are we suggesting that it would have been acceptable for them to go on murdering thousands of Iraqis? The people who were killed in Baghdad yesterdayâ¦ Sergio de Mello was there on a peace mission, he was there in the name of Iraq';s future, he was there in the name of the unification of the Iraqi people, of hope for the Iraqi people, and he was murdered by terrorists. That is just despicable and should be condemned by all men and women around the world.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you aware of any Australians that were injured in the attack?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I understand that one or two Australian civilians suffered minor injuries and they are being looked after and they are in no particular pain or discomfort, apart from the obvious trauma of being involved in such an horrific deed.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, can I ask you about Mr Tuckey? Does he have a case to answer?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I';ve discussed the matter with Mr Tuckey and I';m still studying the matter and at this stage I don';t have anything further to say.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So you would consider sacking him?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I didn';t say that. You said that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible] that he apologised to the Parliament this morning?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think there was a suggestion that he had sort of misled the House and he wanted to correct that, and he has made it very clear. Look, obviously he should not have written those representations on his ministerial letterhead. He knows that and I';ve made that very clear to him, very clear to him. I think it was very foolish of him to have done that. He now understands that, I';m sure. And I just take the opportunity of reminding all Ministers that when it comes to things like that, a representation made on your personal stationery or in your private capacity can be perfectly legitimate, but once it becomes something on your letterhead, that people can read different things into it. But that doesn';t automatically mean that it';s wrong to make representations on behalf of a member of your family. It depends on the circumstances and the magnitude of what is involved and who you make the representations to. I mean, he was hardly trying to do it secretly. He made them to a State Labor Minister.</p>
