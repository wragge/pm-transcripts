    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much Dr Aurora. To my colleagues, Philip Ruddock,</p>
<p>   the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, to Senator</p>
<p>   Rod Kemp, to Mrs Leonie Bourke, to Mr John Thwaites, other distinguished</p>
<p>   guests, ladies and gentleman. </p>
<p>It is a real delight for me to share this very special occasion</p>
<p>   with representatives and members of the Indian community of Australia.</p>
<p>   It commemorates, of course, that great day in the sub-continent's</p>
<p>   history when two nations were made out of one and since then the</p>
<p>   association between Australia and India in particular, but also</p>
<p>   of course between Australia and Pakistan and Bangladesh, has taken</p>
<p>   many forms. You were right to remind us, Dr Aurora, of the very</p>
<p>   close links that Australia has with India. We have great links of</p>
<p>   history and it is often not appreciated by many Australians just</p>
<p>   how many Australians and Indians have fought together in theatres</p>
<p>   of battle over the years stretching back to our common participation</p>
<p>   in World War I. And I was reminded of this a few months ago when</p>
<p>   I led the pilgrimage to Hellfire Pass in Thailand and opened the</p>
<p>   museum there which commemorates the contribution of those Australians</p>
<p>   who died in captivity in World War II. And, of course, as this audience</p>
<p>   will know, there were many many thousands of Indians who also died</p>
<p>   in captivity fighting along side the Australians during that particular</p>
<p>   conflict. </p>
<p>India, of course, is the world's largest democracy. It is</p>
<p>   built upon one of the world's most important and richest cultural</p>
<p>   heritage. Australia and India share the common membership of the</p>
<p>   Commonwealth. We share the common historical association which went</p>
<p>   before the Commonwealth. We share many other things that Australians</p>
<p>   of different backgrounds love, not least of those of course is our</p>
<p>   common affection for that wonderful game of cricket. And of course</p>
<p>   there are few sports that uniquely bind a limited number of countries</p>
<p>   together quite like the game of cricket, and it continues to have</p>
<p>   a romance and a fascination for the people of the sub-continent</p>
<p>   in a very very particular way. And, of course, it was on the visit</p>
<p>   of the famous Indian team, led by Lala Amarnath in 1947-48 that</p>
<p>   the famous Sir Donald Bradman scored his hundredth hundred in first-class</p>
<p>   cricket. And I said this afternoon in an interview that I recorded,</p>
<p>   that is frequently said that the two bets known Australian names</p>
<p>   on the Indian sub-continent are those of Bradman and Border. </p>
<p>But of course the bonds between our two countries go beyond those</p>
<p>   of sport, important though those links may be. We've had official</p>
<p>   representation as a nation in India since 1944, three years before</p>
<p>   your independence. And there have been increased opportunities for</p>
<p>   commercial links between our two countries over the years. The past</p>
<p>   decade has seen businesses, ministerial, Parliamentary, and official</p>
<p>   level contact grow and the inauguration of the Australia South Asia</p>
<p>   Research Centre at the ANU in Canberra. </p>
<p>When the Government I lead came to office we had a commitment to</p>
<p>   improve and strengthen the relations between our two countries.</p>
<p>   We launched a major promotion of Australia in India in 1996 called</p>
<p>   "Australia-India : New Horizons", and it was the</p>
<p>   largest trade cultural promotion ever mounted by Australia overseas</p>
<p>   involving a range of business science, technology, education, cultural</p>
<p>   and sporting events in six major Indian cities. And we followed</p>
<p>   up by nominating 1997 as the year of south Asia. Our total trade</p>
<p>   is now $2.3 billion and we expect that to double over the next five</p>
<p>   years. There are 100 joint ventures between Indian and Australian</p>
<p>   companies in areas as diverse as banking and telecommunications,</p>
<p>   minerals and food processing. There are over 5,500 Indian students</p>
<p>   studying in Australia at the present time and Australia is the most</p>
<p>   favoured destination for Indian students after the United States.</p>
<p>   And that, of course, bodes very well for future contact between</p>
<p>   our two countries because the links between people are the most</p>
<p>   important expression of the links between nations. </p>
<p>You mentioned the nuclear tests and, of course, as a nation we</p>
<p>   oppose those tests and we expressed our disappointment at the time</p>
<p>   and the basis of that disappointment is well understood. Of course</p>
<p>   we were speaking then as the Australian Government on behalf of</p>
<p>   all Australians irrespective of their background. And, of course,</p>
<p>   our concern about those tests in no way affected the attitude of</p>
<p>   Australia or the Australian Government and the Australian people</p>
<p>   towards the Indian community within our midst. And it does not,</p>
<p>   in any way, diminish our commitment to build a strong relationship</p>
<p>   between our two countries. </p>
<p>There are now some 160,000 people of Indian origin including those</p>
<p>   born in Australia with either one parent of both born in India.</p>
<p>   And it is a very long established community within the Australian</p>
<p>   nation. And I want, on behalf of the Government, to express my admiration</p>
<p>   for the contribution that Australians of Indian descent have made</p>
<p>   to the development of our country over a long period of time. I</p>
<p>   want to express, on behalf of my Government, the great respect for</p>
<p>   the very strong commitment to the common concerns and the common</p>
<p>   values of the Australian community that people of Indian descent</p>
<p>   have always demonstrated. </p>
<p>You do have a very high level of naturalisation. You are first</p>
<p>   and foremost good Australians. Australians who love our country</p>
<p>   and love our values. But fully consistent with that you have retained</p>
<p>   a natural affection for your Indian origins. And a natural affection</p>
<p>   for the customs and the culture of India. And that is something</p>
<p>   the rest of us understand and respect and support. One of the great</p>
<p>   virtues of this country is its enduring tolerance. Australia is</p>
<p>   the best example of how different races can live in harmony that</p>
<p>   one can find anywhere in the world. </p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr Ruddock, on behalf of the Government launched our</p>
<p>   campaign, Living in Harmony. It can be described as an anti-racism</p>
<p>   campaign. I think more positively speaking it can be described as</p>
<p>   a campaign to promote and reinforce tolerance and harmony within</p>
<p>   our community. Discrimination against any person on the basis of</p>
<p>   race, religion, national origin, or ethnicity, is absolutely abhorrent</p>
<p>   to my Government. It is absolutely unacceptable in a society that</p>
<p>   values the human decencies and places a store on the importance</p>
<p>   of individual liberty and individual freedom. </p>
<p>And it is very important that we never lose sight of just how successful</p>
<p>   Australia has been in absorbing people from so many parts of the</p>
<p>   world. Something in the order of 150 different countries have in</p>
<p>   their various ways been tributaries to what is now the modern Australian</p>
<p>   stream. And those countries have all made a contribution, and the</p>
<p>   people from them have all made a contribution to building the modern</p>
<p>   Australia. And we should never be reluctant as a community to say</p>
<p>   to the world that not only have we been a tolerant country that</p>
<p>   we have been more successful than most in playing out and demonstrating</p>
<p>   that tolerance within our midst. And it is incumbent upon all of</p>
<p>   us, incumbent upon me as Prime Minister, incumbent upon the members</p>
<p>   of my Government, incumbent upon all sections of the Australian</p>
<p>   community to condemn and denounce intolerance whenever it occurs.</p>
<p>   But the best way that we can repudiate discrimination, the best</p>
<p>   way that we can abhor intolerance, is to demonstrate in a positive</p>
<p>   way our capacity to live in harmony one with the other. To salute</p>
<p>   the special days, the special traditions and the special values</p>
<p>   of different groups within our community, but equally at all times</p>
<p>   to demonstrate those common things that bind us together as Australians.</p>
<p>I have frequently said that one of the most important things we</p>
<p>   should remember as Australians is that the things that unite us</p>
<p>   are infinitely greater and more enduring than the things that divide</p>
<p>   us. And this country has been a remarkable demonstration to the</p>
<p>   world of a capacity to absorb people of so many different backgrounds</p>
<p>   in a harmonious and a peaceful way. </p>
<p>You mentioned in your speech Dr Aurora the views of the leader</p>
<p>   of the One Nation Party. Can I say in relation to what you said</p>
<p>   that I think that those who violently demonstrate against that particular</p>
<p>   party and that particular person may in fact be behaving in a counter-productive</p>
<p>   fashion. I think violent demonstrations of any kind are unacceptable</p>
<p>   and offensive to the Australian community, and I think it is very</p>
<p>   important that all of us remember that the most effective repudiation</p>
<p>   of an attitude that you find unacceptable is a repudiation based</p>
<p>   on offering something better to the Australian community and repudiation</p>
<p>   based on demonstrating your superior values of tolerance and understanding</p>
<p>   and harmony. </p>
<p>Tonight, I want on behalf of the Government to salute the contribution</p>
<p>   of the people of Indian descent, to our nation. I want to assure</p>
<p>   all of you that one of the great common threads of the Australian</p>
<p>   identity is respect for people individual values. This country of</p>
<p>   course has been built on migration. Those who were born overseas</p>
<p>   and have chosen Australia as their land are as much part of the</p>
<p>   Australian community as those of use who were born here. And that</p>
<p>   is irrespective of your country of origin or your racial background.</p>
<p>   This country is as much yours as it is mine. Its values are as much</p>
<p>   yours as they are mine and its future is something that all of us</p>
<p>   share together. And that can be a very bright and very positive</p>
<p>   future. It can be a future built on the common strands of Australian</p>
<p>   life of democracy, of respect for the rule of law, of respect for</p>
<p>   the rights of individuals, of the equality of men and women, a rejection</p>
<p>   of class distinction, a reaffirmation of the need to care for the</p>
<p>   more vulnerable within our community, an abhorrence of all forms</p>
<p>   of division or discrimination based on race and ethnicity. And a</p>
<p>   common commitment, irrespective or our differences on other issues,</p>
<p>   to the progress and the advancement of the Australian nation. </p>
<p>We have much to celebrate as Australians. We have much to be proud</p>
<p>   of as Australians. We should say to the rest of the world as a united</p>
<p>   community that we are defiantly proud of what Australia has achieved</p>
<p>   and what Australia represents in terms of tolerance and understanding</p>
<p>   of difference within a united community and united nation. </p>
<p>I thank you very warmly Dr Aurora for your welcome. I thank members</p>
<p>   of the association for asking me here tonight. Your president has</p>
<p>   explained that in the nature of things, I am moving onto another</p>
<p>   function shortly, but I am very very pleased that I have been able</p>
<p>   to come to both functions and on behalf of the Australian Government</p>
<p>   to honour again the commitment of people of Indian descent to our</p>
<p>   nation. To mark the independence on the 15th of August</p>
<p>   in 1947, in very dramatic and in many cases tragic circumstances,</p>
<p>   of two great nations out of the form of the Indian sub-continent</p>
<p>   which ultimately, in 1971, became three. Thank you again for being</p>
<p>   such wonderful Australians. Let us all live together in harmony</p>
<p>   and tolerance and understanding. Thank you.</p>
