<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, welcome.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good evening Barry.</p>
<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>Is this new package fairer than the original?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I thought the original one was fair. We've added a lot of compensation,</p>
<p> and food's been taken out. I've always preferred to have</p>
<p> food in. I've never really accepted the argument that you make</p>
<p> it fairer by taking something out. However, that's academic because</p>
<p> two weeks ago I learnt that I couldn't get that through and I</p>
<p> decided to get the best I could by negotiation with the Australian</p>
<p> Democrats. And we've ended up with 85% of what we originally</p>
<p> wanted.</p>
<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>And something that is considerably fairer surely, because food is</p>
<p> out, the tax cuts remain in toto, the compensation has been boosted.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Barry, I'm not unhappy with the outcome. I mean I'm very</p>
<p> happy with it. But I don't accept that the original package was</p>
<p> unfair. I mean whether, you know, [inaudible] of fairness don't</p>
<p> really matter now. I mean the reality is that it's a great outcome</p>
<p> for Australia. And the political system is being seen to work. You've</p>
<p> had a mature approach from the Democrats and I congratulate Meg Lees</p>
<p> on the candid direct business-like ways that the negotiations were</p>
<p> conducted.</p>
<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>Because it does say a lot about the political system. The Democrats</p>
<p> in the end delivered. They weren't a threat to democracy. The</p>
<p> Senate wasn't a hindrance.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that's a fair observation. And I think quite a bit of, in</p>
<p> sense a bit of the political paradigm has been altered today. You've</p>
<p> seen this huge break through, an agreement between a right of center</p>
<p> Coalition, and the Australian Democrats who have a wide diversity</p>
<p> of views. They're left of the Labor Party on some issues, but</p>
<p> their culture is different. They have a strong commitment to certain</p>
<p> issues, the environment. And this is the most aggressive investment</p>
<p> of resources in the environment for decades. I mean you add it to</p>
<p> our natural heritage boost out of the sale of Telstra, which ironically</p>
<p> of course the Democrats were against. This Government is looking as</p>
<p> though it's got pretty green credentials.</p>
<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>You will be facing though, after July, the possibility of a fractured</p>
<p> Democratic party. Is that a problem?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't presume to talk about the internal affairs of the</p>
<p> Australian Democrats. That would be quite presumptuous. I think that's</p>
<p> a matter for the Australian Democrats. Look I think when you can bring</p>
<p> off what we've brought off today, the possibility of, you know,</p>
<p> the odd defection in another party is of minor significance.</p>
<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>Is it the biggest victory that you've ever chalked up in your</p>
<p> political career?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Policy-wise this is the greatest thing that I've achieved, policy-wise,</p>
<p> yes.</p>
<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>Is it the greenest thing you've ever done?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Probably is, yes.</p>
<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>If you look at the list of things the Democrats have listed, it runs</p>
<p> to a full page. It talks about: a greater effort on greenhouse gases;</p>
<p> investment programme for renewable energy, recycling, cracking down</p>
<p> on second hand engines. Are these the sorts of things that you would</p>
<p> have addressed in normal circumstances?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we have addressed a lot. Not as many as those, and I don't</p>
<p> want to take any credit away from the Australian Democrats. But we</p>
<p> were very happy to do them, and I think there's a lot of support</p>
<p> in the Australian community for environmental, what I call mainstream</p>
<p> environmental concerns. And just remember the Natural Heritage Trust</p>
<p> which invested more than $1 billion in things like tackling salinity</p>
<p> problems, and water pollution and all of those things.</p>
<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>To what extent will tax reform suffer generally by having to exclude</p>
<p> food?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It would have been better if we didn't have to. I don't</p>
<p> deny that the carving out of basic food will be a lot more complex,</p>
<p> and cause a lot of problems for people involved in the sale of different</p>
<p> items in their shops and their stores. Now, our preference was not</p>
<p> to do that but we couldn't get that up. And I am a realist as well</p>
<p> as an idealist and in the end when I knew I couldn't get that up I</p>
<p> knew that I had to try and work out an arrangement with the Democrats</p>
<p> to see what we could get up and we got up 85 per cent. Now, that's</p>
<p> much better than spitting the dummy and walking away.</p>
<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>So there are some losers, perhaps small business who now have to handle</p>
<p> the compliance details here?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They would much have preferred an alternative approach. I accept that,</p>
<p> I accept that.</p>
<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>Very much so because Peter Costello said that if you adopted this</p>
<p> it would be nightmare on main street for small business.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, clearly we would have preferred the food in' alternative</p>
<p> but we couldn't get that through the Parliament.</p>
<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>What are the changes on diesel fuel? What have you done there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, essentially reduce the additional incentive for the use of diesel</p>
<p> particularly dirty diesel in the cities. We have pared back the extension</p>
<p> of the exemption under the rebate scheme for off-road use of diesel,</p>
<p> not in relation to farmers or tourism or fishing. And we have increased</p>
<p> the road user charge from 18 to 26. But on the other hand, we have</p>
<p> extended the diesel exemption for rail which will be of particular</p>
<p> benefit say to wheat growers who have to send their crops long distances</p>
<p> to ports for exports. So overall it's a greener diesel package and</p>
<p> there are a lot of incentives for people to use alternative fuels.</p>
<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>Will farmers pay more for diesel fuel in this package than in the</p>
<p> original package?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>Not a cent more?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, they won't pay any more.</p>
<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>So obviously you feel the bush will accept the package?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it's a very good package for the bush.</p>
<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>No difficulty for the National Party to sell this to their constituents?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, well, the Liberal Party has a lot of seats in the bush as</p>
<p> well. I mean, the Coalition has a lot of seats in the bush and I have</p>
<p> taken particular care to see that the bush has been looked after because</p>
<p> they don't need...they need help. Things are a bit better. They</p>
<p> have had good seasons but the bush still needs a lot of help and a</p>
<p> lot of understanding. And if we can get a few more markets overseas</p>
<p> prized open and if the Yanks don't keep our lamb out, for example,</p>
<p> things will get a bit better.</p>
<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>Now, you have sat there for many hours listening to the Democrats</p>
<p> talk about diesel fuel. Is this pragmatism on your part? Are you persuaded</p>
<p> in any way that diesel fuel should be discouraged, that it is a health</p>
<p> problem?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am persuaded by some of their arguments, yes. It's not totally a</p>
<p> compromise. I mean, there are significant elements on the environmental</p>
<p> front that I felt easy about agreeing to.</p>
<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>Now, pensioners. What's in it for them?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, food is out and many would argue that that's a benefit. I mean,</p>
<p> we have our differences on that. But we have guaranteed in real terms</p>
<p> that the four per cent up-front compensation will be preserved for</p>
<p> all time.</p>
<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>In the end was that necessary given that food is out?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the Democrats argued for it. I mean, on a strict economic analysis,</p>
<p> no, but when you're dealing with a potentially vulnerable section</p>
<p> of the community it's always better to be overly cautious.</p>
<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>How much revenue will be lost and will you need to make that up in</p>
<p> some other way?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the net cost from forward estimates on Budget night of all of</p>
<p> these additional measures and changes and everything is in the first</p>
<p> year, $1.4 billion. Now, that's the net cost.</p>
<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>Do you try and make that up?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, you don't need to because we have substantial surpluses.</p>
<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>Now, Telstra. Are you prepared now to load up the social bonus in</p>
<p> order to win the votes of the two Independents?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I must say, Barry, I haven't read all the detail of what</p>
<p> the two Independents have said over the last couple of days. I've</p>
<p> been rather preoccupied on taxation. We'd like to get the extra</p>
<p> 16 per cent and obviously their views must be paid regard to but there's</p>
<p> no bottomless pit in these things. So you've got to be, once</p>
<p> again, mixing pragmatism and other considerations.</p>
<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>It must be tempting. You now know that it's within reach, you</p>
<p> just have to find a few hundred million dollars and you're there.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I mean, the national interest would be better served if we could pay</p>
<p> off some more of Labor's debt. So there's obviously a national</p>
<p> interest involved in selling that extra 16 per cent of Telstra. I</p>
<p> think the rest of Telstra should be privatised. I think it's</p>
<p> going to be harder because the Democrats are resolutely opposed to</p>
<p> that and they'll dominate the cross benches after the 30th</p>
<p> of June. But we'll keep trying. It's still our policy. We</p>
<p> still believe in it. I'd like to see Australia free of net debt</p>
<p> in the early years of the next century and we can do that if we were</p>
<p> able to sell the whole of Telstra.</p>
<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>Now, as I understand it at the height of it all tonight you had Mal</p>
<p> Colston in your office. What was that all about?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>He came around to see my Chief of Staff about something which...</p>
<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>Encouraging?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, look, Arthur and I have got to have some further discussions.</p>
<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>Now, just finally, Prime Minister, I suppose in the end the proof</p>
<p> of all of this will be in not only the details but the implementation,</p>
<p> if something was to go wrong  and you must be slightly nervous</p>
<p> about the possibility given the complexities  if something was</p>
<p> to go wrong there's only one major party out there now that is</p>
<p> anti-GST and that's Labor. Can you see a net benefit for them</p>
<p> in the end if this was to start to unravel?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah but it's not going to. I mean, I think at the moment the</p>
<p> Labor Party is chained to its irrelevance. And the Labor Party has</p>
<p> just engaged in vituperative negativity over tax reform from the very</p>
<p> beginning. They could have been major players. They could have influenced</p>
<p> the outcome. They have could have pressed the thing. They could have</p>
<p> said to their constituency, we have won benefits for you. Instead</p>
<p> of that they snarled and sniped and write themselves right out of</p>
<p> the play. And I think they will be condemned and will suffer politically</p>
<p> for that.</p>
<p>CASSIDY:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, thanks for your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
