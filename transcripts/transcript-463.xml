FOR PRESS ADDITIONAL PROTECTIVE PROCEDURES<br />
( Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister and<br />
Minister for Trade, Mr. J. McEwen)<br />
The Minister for Trade, Mr. J. McEwen, today elaborated<br />
the measures the Government proposes to take to extend the<br />
protective machinery at present available to Australian industry<br />
both primary and secondary which are affected by imports.<br />
He stated that these measures accord with the Government's<br />
policy of continued growth of the economy with employment for a<br />
continuously growing workforce.<br />
Mr. McEwen gave details of the machinery which will be<br />
set up by the Government to deal with requests for temporary<br />
protection to supplement the present temporary duty provisions of<br />
the Tariff Board Act. Mr. MeEwen pointed out that the present<br />
temporary duty arrangements had given effective results but -the<br />
Government felt that there were circumstances under which, as a<br />
temporary measure of protection, the quantitative restriction of<br />
imports may be desirable, combined with, or as an alternative to,<br />
temporary duties.<br />
" As made clear by the Prime Minister, the announcement of<br />
a willingness to use import restrictions under these circumstances<br />
does not signify any intention to revert to import licensing on a<br />
wide scale unless required by serious balance of payments<br />
difficulties. " There appears to be a misapprehension in some quarters<br />
that the Government itself intends to identify the range of items<br />
which require added protection by quantitative restriction and<br />
make decisions accordingly. Provision of protection to Australian<br />
industries has never been accorded on the initiative and judgment<br />
of the Government itself. The initiative is always with industry<br />
to request protection.<br />
" No departure from thi~ s -principle is intended. </p>
<p>-2<br />
" Broadly, two considerations are in mind. Firstly, as<br />
visualised in the Prime M~ inister's Policy Speech in November, the<br />
Government has recognised the particular difficulties of certain<br />
Australian industries where production efficiency and a reasonable<br />
cost level req~ uire the maintenance of a continuing high volume of<br />
output. Where an inflow of imports has reduced the Australian<br />
industry's share of the market so as to make an otherwise stable<br />
industry unlrofitable and even perhaps uneconomic, it may be more<br />
appropriate to apply quantitative limitation of imports, rather<br />
than a temporary duty.<br />
" Another circumstance wihich may warra~ nt temporary<br />
protection through import restrictions may be that substantial<br />
reduction of domestic demand resulting from general economic<br />
circumstances operat ing in Australia, may reduce an Australian<br />
industry to a serious situation unless the volume of imports is<br />
temporarily diminished.<br />
" The principle was established when the system of<br />
temporary duties vwas introduced that an immediate reference by<br />
made to the Tariff Board for normal consideration when a temporary<br />
duty is imposed. This provision will also apply if import<br />
restriction is provided as temporary protection.<br />
" As the Prime Kinistor has already announced, a Special<br />
Advisory Authority will bc established to advise on any request<br />
for orotection by restriction of imports. Vnhere it is established<br />
that imports are causing or threatonin3 to cause serious damage<br />
to a particular industry, the Special Advisory Authority will be<br />
able to recommend that any temporary protection shown necessary,<br />
be given by means of temporary duty and/ or import restrictions.<br />
This would not conflict with tho commitments Australia accepts<br />
under the G. A. T. T.<br />
The advice of the Special Advisory Authority could be<br />
sought also in a situation in which a serious run-down of overseas<br />
balances was threatened. This is an aspect of what the<br />
Government has in mind, referred to in the Prime Minister's<br />
statcment, that pressures which may develop should be dealt with </p>
<p>-3-<br />
by specifically designed measures.<br />
" Action will be taken, Mr. 1-ci Ewen said, " to bring the<br />
operations of the Special Advisory Authority within the a-mbit of<br />
the Tariff Board Act. However, if real urgency exists, the<br />
Special Advisory Aut. ority would be asked to advise the Government<br />
on these matters even before the necessary legislative action is<br />
taken." " In connection with the normal functioning of the Tariff<br />
Board the Government proposes to amend the Tariff Board Act so<br />
that under certain circumstances the Tariff Board after a full<br />
inquiry may recommend that protection should include import restrictions<br />
where the tariff alone would not give the necessary measure<br />
of protection." Mr. IicEwen mentioned that representations had been made<br />
recently to the Government, during its consultations with<br />
various organisations, that it should be prepared to afford<br />
protection to industries in respect of proposed extensions into<br />
new manufacturing, or industries proposing to sot up manufacture<br />
in Australia for the first time.<br />
" If the Government feels that the question of protection<br />
of a now industrial venture should, in the interests of the<br />
economy, be considered in advance of actual production, it will<br />
forward the matter to the Tariff Board for its consideration."<br />
Mr. McEwen stated also that consideration is being given<br />
to amending the Tariff Board Act, to ensure that requests for<br />
protection are considered with a minimum of delay. For instance,<br />
one opportunity would be to provide that evidence can be tendered<br />
to the Tariff Board in writing, under a statutory declaration, and<br />
made available to all interested parties unless accepted by the<br />
Board as confidential, as an alternative to the existing<br />
requirements that evidence be given in public on oath. The<br />
existing procedures result in a considerable time -loss, especially<br />
when witnesses have to read very detailed and lengthy evidence. </p>
<p>4<br />
" The Government regards the Tariff Board as an important<br />
advisory instrument in enabling the Government to achieve the<br />
national objective of continuing growth of the economy and employment<br />
of the workforce. believe that industrial expansion at<br />
a rate which will make an appropriate contribution to employment<br />
can, as . the Prime Minister has said, be reconciled with a<br />
reasonable stability of the Australian cost and price structure<br />
and with a strong external position.<br />
" The introduction of investment allowances in connection<br />
with the establishment of new plant and equipment used in manufacturing<br />
industry represents an encouragement by the Government<br />
to the installation of the most up-to-date equipment. By world<br />
standards the Australian home market is a small one and nothing<br />
is more critical to keeping costs of production low in today's<br />
industry than that our factory equipment should be abreast of the<br />
world's most modern.<br />
" Those investment allowances will, of course, embrace the<br />
equipment of industries processing primary products, for example,<br />
meatworke, butter factories, fruit and fish canneries, flour<br />
mills and the like.<br />
" The Gcvernment desires to sustain the rate of investment<br />
in manufacture, for today's investment increases tomorrow's<br />
productive resources and employment. Modernisation of equipment<br />
and the modification of our policies of protection, combine to<br />
better enable Australian industry to hold an adequate share of the<br />
home market, produce at lowest achievable costs and so be bettor<br />
enabled to reach out into export.<br />
" While the Government is extending additional aid to<br />
Australian industry, it is imperative that industry itself should<br />
explore every opportunity to reduce costs. This should include<br />
consideration of aspects of rationalisation and standardisation<br />
so that productivity may be increased and costs kept low which<br />
is so essential in a small volume market. </p>
<p>" The Government is anxious that the resources and services<br />
of C. S. I. IR. O. should be availed of by Australian industry in<br />
pursuit of greater productivity and cost reduction.<br />
" The decision by the Government to re-inforce its existing<br />
policies by the measures detailed above should be taken as an<br />
earnest of the Government's intention to give effective support<br />
to Australian industry in its essential role in fulfilling the<br />
national economic objectives.<br />
" The Government has shown it is prepared to play its<br />
part". Mr. McEwen said the Government wishes to strengthen the<br />
concept of partnership between Government and industry in pursuit<br />
of the nation's high objectives.<br />
