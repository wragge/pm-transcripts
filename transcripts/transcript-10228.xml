3 February 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
ANNOUNCEMENT OF VENUE OF PRESIDENT'S CUP<br />
MELBOURNE, VIC<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
Thank you very much Mr Walker; to Jeff Kennett, the Premier of Victoria; to Tim<br />
Finchem, the Commissioner of the PGA; to two of Australia's all time sporting greats,<br />
Peter Thompson and Greg Norman, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
I'm delighted as Prime Minister of Australia to formally acknowledge the decision that<br />
the next President's Cup, the President's Cup of 1998 is coming to Australia. This is<br />
an acknowledgment of the immense prestige in which Australia is held as a venue for<br />
major sporting events. It's an acknowledgment of course of the immense contribution<br />
that this country and its players of the years have made to golf<br />
The President's Cup is a special golfing event. None of the prize money is taken by<br />
the participants and the proceeds of it are contributed to various charities. It has been<br />
successfully staged in the United States on two occasions, and during his recent visit to<br />
Australia in October of last year the President and I discussed the possibility that the<br />
event might, for the first time, go outside the United States. And I encouraged in him<br />
the thought that it might come to Australia and that if that proved to be the case that<br />
he would find that a convenient and indeed overwhelmingly appropriate reason to<br />
return to our country.<br />
There's quite a long tradition in politics and sport of particular politicians associating<br />
attendance in particular parts of the world with particular sporting events and I<br />
encourage the President to follow that long tradition if, in fact, the President's Cup<br />
were to come to Australia.<br />
So it is coming to Australia. I'm delighted about that. I want to thank very, very<br />
warmly the PGA and the Commissioner for the PGA tour, Tim Finchem and also Mike<br />
Bodney, and I'd also like to acknowledge the contribution of Brian Allan, the Chief<br />
Executive of the Australasian PGA and of course the immense contribution of the two </p>
<p>Australian golfing legends that I've already mentioned, that's Peter Thompson, the<br />
Captain of the international team, and of course Greg Norman.<br />
I, following the pattern of Presidents, Bush and Ford, will be the honorary Chairman of<br />
the event. And of course once again this event will focus the attention of the sporting<br />
world and the world generally on Australia and the contribution that Australia is<br />
making to the life of this region and this part of the world and also the contribution<br />
that Australia is making to the world of golf I've said on many occasions to both<br />
Australian and international audiences that there is nothing that quite binds Australians<br />
together so enthusiastically and so spontaneously as our passion for sport and our love<br />
of the great sporting contest. And in the world of golf, in a short period of time, the<br />
President's Cup has grown into being a very great sporting contest that has brought<br />
together the uninhibited enthusiasm of great players but also the enthusiastic following<br />
of spectators and audiences around the world. It is an event that will of course receive<br />
worldwide extensive television coverage. It's an event that will showcase the sporting<br />
prowess, not only of Australia and the United States but the sporting prowess of many<br />
countries. So I am, as Prime Minister, absolutely delighted that once again the place of<br />
Australia in the world of sport, the place of Australia in the world of golf, the place of<br />
Australia in international sporting, cooperation has been acknowledged. And I'm<br />
delighted that the 1998 President's Cup will be coming to Australia.<br />
Thank you. 2 </p>
