FURTHER AUSTRALIAi' MILITARY ASSISTANCE FOR<br />
Statement by t e AtinPrime Minister. the Rt. Hon. J. McEwen<br />
Mr. J. McEwen, the Acting Prime Minister said this<br />
evening that members of Cabinet have been closely following<br />
recent developments in the Malaysian area and have given<br />
consideration to a request for further aid received from the<br />
Malaysian Government.<br />
" The Australian Government has now decided to extend<br />
further military assistance for the defence of the area," he<br />
said. Mr. M<. ewen="" said="" that="" the="" australian="" governmaent="" viewed=""></.>
with concern the substantial continuing build-up of Indonesian<br />
forces in Borneo and the steady increase in infiltration acro. gs<br />
the Malacca and Singapore Straits into Malaya and Singapore.<br />
This heavy build-up has been reported to the President of the<br />
U. N. Security Council by the Malaysian Government which has<br />
advised the Security Council of the seriousness ol the threat<br />
of more intensive Indonesian attacks against Malaysia in 1965.<br />
These developments had already required the British<br />
Government to deploy considerable reinforcements to the area.<br />
In view of all the circumstances and in accordance with<br />
the pledge pre-viously given, the Australian Government had<br />
concluded that the deployment of additional Australian field<br />
units into Borneo in the defence of Malaysia was now necessary.<br />
He said that an Australian engineer squadron had been<br />
for some time assisting in road and airfield construction in<br />
the Borneo territories.<br />
An Australian force is now to serve in this area, in<br />
company with Malaysian and British forces.<br />
This would be the Australian battalion in the Commonwealth<br />
Strategic Reserve in Malaya. On this arrangement, this<br />
battalion. would now scrve in Borneo in rotation with Malaysian<br />
and British units. In addition, an Army Special Air Service<br />
unit from Australia would be made available to carry out<br />
appropriate military tasks in the defence of Malaysia. This<br />
unit will also serve, as required, in rotation with British<br />
units in the Borneo territories.<br />
Mr. M: Ewen said that, in addition to the current defence<br />
aid programme which would continue throughout this year, further<br />
aid proposals for the development of the Malaysian Armed Services<br />
were also under examination by technical experts. The result<br />
would be placed before the Australian Government in the near<br />
future. Mr. McEwen said that he had been in communication with<br />
Sir Robert Menzies while the situation was under study. / 2 </p>

Mr. McEwen stressed the Australian Government's deep<br />
concern at the atmosphere of tension and conflict ^% cih the<br />
Indonesian " confrontation" policy had produced. Thfe Au: t::' alian<br />
Government would continue to use all its influence-for<br />
peaceful outcome in full awareness that the p a'Yndis economic<br />
development of the region of South East Asia deper, ded on<br />
conditions of security and stability.<br />
Mr. McEwen said that the Australian Go'-rnnment believed<br />
that the restoration of peace in the area would d.;, pend on<br />
observance of the principle of respect for the political and<br />
territorial integrity of the member countries c tne area.<br />
Mr. McEwen recalled his statement of 18th January that the<br />
Australian Government continued to hope for char-ges in<br />
Indonesian policy which would allow peace, security and<br />
prosperity to be established in the area.<br />
Mr. McEwen said that these new decisions were relevant<br />
to the Australian pledge to support Malaysia in defence of her<br />
territorial integrity and political independence. " Malaysia,"<br />
he pointed out, " is our Commonwealth partner and near neighbour."<br />
Mr. McEwen recalled that Australian forces have been<br />
stationed for some ten years in the Malayan area as port of<br />
the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve, and have already been<br />
engaged on sea, land and in the air, pursuant to the policy<br />
of maintaining the integrity and independence of a Commonwealth<br />
country. " Some six ships of the he said, " have been<br />
engaged in patrolling and other duties in Malaysian waters."<br />
The Australian Army battalion group had made a<br />
significant contribution in dealing with the Communist guerillas<br />
on the Malayan Peninsula and had more recently acted against<br />
Indonesian infiltrators in Malaya The RAAF had fighter aircraft,<br />
helicopters and transport aircraft stationed in Malaya.<br />
Mr. McEwen said that, as is known, in addition to the<br />
deployment of forces, Australia had also provided military aid<br />
in the form of equipment, ammunition, training in Australia<br />
and secondment of Australian officers to the Malaysian Armed<br />
Services, with a view to assisting the development and expansion<br />
of these Services.<br />
