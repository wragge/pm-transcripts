STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR JOHN GORTON<br />
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTIATIVES ON<br />
SEPTEMBER 1970<br />
Mr. Speaker, I received approximately two hours ago, a copy of Sir H-enry<br />
Bolte's Budget Speech, and I have noted the statement in that speech that it is not the<br />
intention of the Victorian Government to seek an appropriation from the Victorian<br />
Parliament for the purpose of paying payroll tax to the Commonwealth. Sir Henry<br />
Bolte indicated that exclusion of provision for the payment of payroll tax to the<br />
Commonwealth would mean a reduction of about $ 9 million in the payments side of<br />
the Victorian Consolidated Fund for 1970-1971, and I interpolate, it would also<br />
mean a reduction of $ 9 million in the amount of receipts into the Commonwealth<br />
revenue. Payroll tax has been imposed by the Commonwealth continuously since 1941.<br />
The relevant provision of the Commonwealth law concerning the payment of this tax<br />
by the States has since that time, 1941, remained unchanged. The relevant<br />
Commonwealth Act, the Payroll Tax Assessment Act 1941-1969, provides that an<br />
employer" for Payroll Tax purposes includes the Crown in the right of a State.<br />
The payment of financial assistance grants by the Commonwealth to the<br />
States has, since introduction of the payroll tax in 1941, allowed for the payment<br />
of payroll tax by the States and all the States have in fact paid payroll tax since<br />
1941 in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Act. If they had not paid<br />
payroll tax, then their reimbursement grants would have been less.<br />
At the June 1970 Premiers Conference, when Commonwealth/ State financial<br />
relations for the period of five years commencing with 1970-71 were discussed, I<br />
made plain to the Premiers that the Commonwealth proposals were on the basic that<br />
there were no significant changes in the financial relationships between the<br />
Commonwealth and the States during the five-year period. I indicated in particular<br />
that under the proposed arrangement we would expect that the States and their<br />
authorities would continue to pay payroll tax. The actual words used at that<br />
conference were<br />
" If we are to provide such a substantial increase in revenue assistance and<br />
in resources available to the States, it should be on the basis that there<br />
are no significant changes in the financial relationships between the<br />
Commonwealth and the States during the period of the agreement. In<br />
particular, we would expect that the States and their authorities will<br />
continue to pay payroll tax and that the distribution of tax resources<br />
between the Commonwealth and the States will remain unchanged." / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
Although the Premier of Victoria made claim that he did not regard hL<br />
Government as having agreed to the financial arrangements that resulted from the<br />
Conference, there was no indication by him or any of the other Premiers that they<br />
proposed not to continue to pay payroll tax.<br />
On the other hand, as I have indicated, there was a clear and Unequivocal<br />
intimation from the Commonwealth that the continuance of the payment of payroll<br />
tax was a key part of the offers made by the Commonwealth.<br />
The Commonwealth Budget for 1970/' 71 was accordingly formulated on the<br />
basis that payroll tax would continue to be paid by the States to the Commnonwealth.<br />
This was allowed for in the Budget estimate of payroll tax collections and also in<br />
the provision for the payment of Commonwealth grants to the States.<br />
If Victoria or any other State or States were not to pay payroll tax, there<br />
would Cius be a direct and significant effect on the -Commoniwealth Budget. The<br />
Government is therefore unable to accept the position talken by the Victorian<br />
Government, as stated in Sir Henry Bolte's Budget Speech.<br />
My Government will therefore consider what course of action it should take<br />
in relation to S--r Henry Bolte's statement in order to see that the Commonwealtha<br />
Budget is not impaired. </p>
