<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Good morning. The Prime Minister is with me in the studio. He will</p>
<p>   take your calls, as he does each fortnight. Mr Howard, good morning.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Neil. Good to be back. </p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>An inquiry into gambling, an $80 billion industry and it looks like</p>
<p>   Peter Costello and Jeff Kennett are at war again. Is that the case?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think they're at war again. Can I assure the Premier</p>
<p>   that this inquiry is not a tax grab. It's got nothing to do</p>
<p>   with grabbing tax. It's got a lot to do with exposing the ins</p>
<p>   and outs of the gambling industry in Australia, it's social</p>
<p>   and economic impact. There's no doubt within the community</p>
<p>   there is some concern about the level and the incidence of gambling.</p>
<p>   We are entitled as a national Government to know more about that.</p>
<p>   The community is entitled through us to know more about that. That</p>
<p>   is the basis of it and I very strongly support the Treasurer's</p>
<p>   decision which of course he discussed with me before he made it.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Nobody discussed it with the states. Jeff Kennett said he was told</p>
<p>   45 minutes after it was announced.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Federal Governments aren't under an obligation to discuss in</p>
<p>   detail everything they do in advance with the states any more than</p>
<p>   the reverse applies in relation to the states. This is an activity</p>
<p>   of the Productivity Commission and the Productivity Commission is</p>
<p>   a body that is completely under the control of the Federal Government</p>
<p>   and we believe there's a national interest in having this inquiry.</p>
<p>   It is not, as I say, a tax grab. There is no sort of hidden motive</p>
<p>   but my views and the views of the Treasurer and indeed, a lot of</p>
<p>   people in the community about the level and incidence of gambling,</p>
<p>   the economic and social impact, the impact on small business, the</p>
<p>   impact on families, it's something that we have been concerned</p>
<p>   about. We ought to know more about it and an inquiry like this will</p>
<p>   help that process.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But how does the Productivity Commission have the expertise to inquire</p>
<p>   into social impact? It's basically economists, is it not?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Certainly they are largely economists but it is within the capacity</p>
<p>   of the Productivity Commission when it does inquiries in particular</p>
<p>   areas to recruit as ad hoc members of the inquiry people who have</p>
<p>   a particular background or expertise in that area. When you make</p>
<p>   an inquiry, the Productivity Commission must take social and human</p>
<p>   factors into account. When, for example it was examining the footwear,</p>
<p>   clothing and textile industry, the motor car industry, it had to</p>
<p>   take the employment consequences of changes affecting those industries</p>
<p>   and the impact of those employment changes on local communities.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Would you expect the Commission then to make recommendations or</p>
<p>   is it more establishing where we stand? Does something come from</p>
<p>   it, in other words?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That will be a matter for the Commission.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>It's a bit hard to reverse that position with gambling, isn't</p>
<p>   it, because we seem to rely on it so much?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think there is a community dependence on it or government dependence</p>
<p>   on it and that's a worry that a lot of people have. However</p>
<p>   there's always the case that if you can't reverse something</p>
<p>   you can at least put an effective lid on it, an effective constraint.</p>
<p>   We do need to know more about its impact on the community, particularly</p>
<p>   on small business and we do need to understand better than we do</p>
<p>   at the moment not only the dependence of governments but also the</p>
<p>   way in which it affects the whole community.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Would the Federal Government have the power to put a lid on gambling?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Direct constitutional authority rests with the states but national</p>
<p>   governments have great persuasion in areas like that.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>You've been very uncomfortable about the level of gambling</p>
<p>   for some time, haven't you?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I have, yes.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What's that based on?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's based on a feeling that it does wreak an enormous</p>
<p>   amount of havoc on families who can't afford it. I mean, I</p>
<p>   don't mind the wealthy in this country losing large amounts</p>
<p>   at casinos. That troubles me not a jot and if wealthy people from</p>
<p>   overseas want to come to casinos and lose a packet well, good luck</p>
<p>   to them and good luck to us. That doesn't trouble me at all</p>
<p>   but I...</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>They're not coming here any more, not as many.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Not as much, not from Asia but they're still coming from other</p>
<p>   countries and they may increasingly come from other countries because</p>
<p>   of the currency fluctuation. It's partly based on my background.</p>
<p>   I was, I guess I grew up in an environment that didn't encourage</p>
<p>   gambling and it always struck me as something that was pretty wasteful</p>
<p>   and pretty destructive. I am not trying to visit those views on</p>
<p>   the rest of the community but I do feel uncomfortable about the</p>
<p>   way in which gambling has cut a swathe through many small businesses</p>
<p>   and the way in which gambling has affected families and has caused</p>
<p>   a lot of misery and a lot of heartache within families, and it does</p>
<p>   bother me.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Are you concerned that the letters between Mr Costello and Mr Kennett</p>
<p>   will leak in the papers today?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I suppose in the years that I have been in politics I've</p>
<p>   seen leaks. I mean, I don't know where that came from.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Pretty nasty words, pretty tough words being exchanged there. You</p>
<p>   have a Liberal Premier, particularly one as high profile as Jeff</p>
<p>   Kennett and the Federal Treasurer taking shots at each other in</p>
<p>   public is not good for you, surely.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Jeff's the sort of person who speaks his mind. Peter</p>
<p>   speaks his mind. I speak my mind from time to time. I don't</p>
<p>   think there's anything unhealthy about that.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Why an inquiry into gambling but say, not an inquiry into areas</p>
<p>   of possibly even more importance like health?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We did have a Productivity Commission inquiry into private health</p>
<p>   insurance last year, a very detailed one. We have responded to part</p>
<p>   of it and who knows, there may be further responses down the line.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you accept that the taxes on gambling are in fact a bit of a</p>
<p>   GST because I assume there's a lot of black money going through</p>
<p>   poker machines...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's an interesting way of looking at it.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, this is being taxed, isn't it.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you could put it that way, yes.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Would you like some of the tax slice?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the taxes out of gambling? No we are certainly not after those</p>
<p>   but I want to make it clear, this has got nothing to do with our</p>
<p>   tax agenda. We have a quite separate tax agenda and we will be presenting</p>
<p>   our tax plan to the Australian public before the election. We have</p>
<p>   worked very hard on it and the Treasurer and I have spent an enormous</p>
<p>   amount of time on it over recent weeks. We continue to work on it</p>
<p>   and we will be in a position to make it known to the Australian</p>
<p>   public before the election.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The waterfront.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Have you taken over control of the dispute?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I haven't.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The impression, you called a, well, I know you called a meeting.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I was involved in a meeting with Mr Corrigan and his lawyers,</p>
<p>   yes but that doesn't mean to say I've taken over control.</p>
<p>   In any of these sorts of things, from time to time the Prime Minister</p>
<p>   will get involved. I get involved in the budget discussions. I am</p>
<p>   heavily and directly and on a day to day basis obviously involved</p>
<p>   in the policy formulation regarding taxation but that doesn't</p>
<p>   mean to say I've taken it over any more than I have taken over</p>
<p>   the waterfront. The Prime Minister has a role from time to time</p>
<p>   to involve himself in any particular issue, particularly a high</p>
<p>   profile one. </p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is there any chance you could broker a compromise?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think it's a question of brokering compromises. It's</p>
<p>   a question of first of all waiting to see what the High Court decides</p>
<p>   but also remembering that our goal has never been the destruction</p>
<p>   of the Maritime Union of Australia. Our goal has never been the</p>
<p>   destruction of unionism. Our goal has been twofold. We want to get</p>
<p>   rid of compulsory unionism on the Australian waterfront. That is</p>
<p>   an absolute fundamental, immovable requirement and we also want</p>
<p>   reform on the Australian waterfront so that we can have world's</p>
<p>   best practice. </p>
<p>Now they are the two things that we require.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is there any reason why people who have been sacked could be, not</p>
<p>   be re-employed at some stage to work on the waterfront, some of</p>
<p>   them?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We have never said they shouldn't be.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>This could be a degree of compromise, couldn't it?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The compromise suggests that you move from one position you originally</p>
<p>   had and you alter it and you say, well I am prepared to adopt a</p>
<p>   softer position. We have never said that we want to get rid of the</p>
<p>   MUA. All we have said is we want two things. We want voluntary unionism,</p>
<p>   that's freedom of association on the waterfront and we want</p>
<p>   world's best practice. Now if we can achieve those two things</p>
<p>   then everybody is happy but most importantly, the country is the</p>
<p>   winner. The whole purpose of this was not to have an ideological</p>
<p>   battle. The whole purpose of this was to give Australia, which is</p>
<p>   a trading nation, an island continent, a more efficient waterfront.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>It's turned into an ideological battle, hasn't it. Do</p>
<p>   you think the Government has perhaps not handled it as well as it</p>
<p>   could have?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I don't agree with that.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What about Corrigan and Patrick? Have they handled it as well as</p>
<p>   they could have?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I am not going to give a running commentary on them but give</p>
<p>   them their dues. They took advice, they took certain action and</p>
<p>   we haven't heard the final comments made on the law.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>There's been a hell of a lot of pain. Was this pain necessary?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Nobody likes pain and difficulty but if you have a group of people</p>
<p>   who refuse to sit down and talk reform, I mean, let us not forget</p>
<p>   that Patrick's had been trying for three years, three years</p>
<p>   to get improvements on the waterfront out of its workforce, three</p>
<p>   years they were trying. They actually signed an enterprise agreement</p>
<p>   back in the beginning of 1995 and they have been negotiating ever</p>
<p>   since with the union to get the union to comply with the agreement</p>
<p>   the union itself signed. Now, people seem to forget that. They now</p>
<p>   talk as though the history of this dispute started on the 7th of</p>
<p>   April. It didn't. It goes back years and I think people have</p>
<p>   tended to be too dismissive of the efforts that Patrick's made</p>
<p>   to get a reasonable response from their workforce.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you think really the waterfront has now changed forever regardless</p>
<p>   of...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I do. You will never go back to what it was a few months ago.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>So have you almost achieved what you wanted to?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not saying that. What I am saying is that if we can get world</p>
<p>   class productivity and if we can get voluntary unionism then we</p>
<p>   will have achieved our two goals. I mean, we are not a stevedoring</p>
<p>   enterprise. We are a government and our responsibility is to set</p>
<p>   a national interest set of goals and the two national interest goals</p>
<p>   are voluntary unionism and higher productivity on the waterfront.</p>
<p>   If we can get those two things then whatever combination of workers</p>
<p>   employed by whatever employers on the waterfront is a matter for</p>
<p>   the parties to determine, not for us.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Are you interested in seeing the documents which allege to show</p>
<p>   that an adviser to Mr Reith was involved in this?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's of supreme indifference to me.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But I thought it would be important to have a look at them and see</p>
<p>   whether there was any truth in them?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well if somebody wants to give me documents, I am always happy</p>
<p>   to have a look at them but I think the whole thing is a little bizarre</p>
<p>   and almost comical. </p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you know why Dr Webster met the ...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Isn't it relevant?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't know that it is.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well it is relevant if you knew anything about Dubai.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he's denied any knowledge of Dubai. So has Mr Reith.</p>
<p>   The first I had heard of Dubai was when it was raised in the Parliament</p>
<p>   by the Labor Party. Neil, one of the things that sort of puzzles</p>
<p>   me amidst all of this is, would somebody please tell me what was</p>
<p>   in any event, quite apart from the question of knowledge, would</p>
<p>   somebody please tell me what was illegal or improper about Dubai</p>
<p>   anyway?</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, it would have been improper if the Government denied having</p>
<p>   been involved in it.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, leaving that aside, I mean, obviously if governments or</p>
<p>   anybody says something that they know to be incorrect then that's</p>
<p>   an issue in itself, I accept that but I don't accept that that</p>
<p>   has occurred but just leaving that aside for a moment, where was</p>
<p>   the illegality...</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I suggest it was very politically damaging to a government if the</p>
<p>   government had been involved in organising army personnel.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But if you just put that aside, just ask yourself, where was the</p>
<p>   illegality in any event? I mean, it always struck me from the very</p>
<p>   beginning, if there were some kind of, there obviously wasn't</p>
<p>   an effort made by some people who had trained some people overseas,</p>
<p>   now, whatever people think about the politics of the waterfront</p>
<p>   and whatever people think about the MUA, for or against them, there</p>
<p>   is nothing of itself illegal about a group of Australians trying</p>
<p>   to do that.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you think that would have been legitimate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>It might be legal, but would it have legitimate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What do you mean by legitimate? But, I mean, it's not the</p>
<p>   role of a government to go around and make a minute, micro moral</p>
<p>   judgement on every act of every individual Australian. I mean, we</p>
<p>   don't want big brother' government in this country.</p>
<p>But just for the record can I say again that I knew nothing about</p>
<p>   Dubai, Mr Reith knew nothing about it. He's received assurances</p>
<p>   from his staff to the same effect. And interestingly enough, the</p>
<p>   Labor Party sort of huffed and puffed before Parliament resumed</p>
<p>   this year that they were going ask a whole lot of questions about</p>
<p>   Dubai and to date we've not had one which is very interesting.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, if you wouldn't mind - the headphones.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>We'll take some calls for the Prime Minister now - 9696 1278.</p>
<p>   Hello, Malcolm, go ahead.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Hello, Neil. Hello, Mr Howard, how are you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hello, Malcolm.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, concerning the assistance for people under the new Job</p>
<p>   Network.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh yes.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>There was a time when people who weren't on a government pay-stream,</p>
<p>   like social security benefits, could use the CES and register as</p>
<p>   unemployed. That is no longer the case unless they wish to pay a</p>
<p>   fee.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, that's not my advice, no.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Why isn't it correct - could you answer that please?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's just not. We're not charging fees.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Well, okay, fine, there's no fee. People - working women,</p>
<p>   women who are partners of working husbands who aren't eligible</p>
<p>   for payment can no longer use the Job Network. How is that going</p>
<p>   to help unemployment and how will it affect the unemployment...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there's absolutely nothing - there's no substance</p>
<p>   in what you're saying.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>On Job Net, Mr Howard, because today's the day, the computer's</p>
<p>   still not ready. I'm getting messages that various providers</p>
<p>   aren't ready, various organisations aren't ready to get</p>
<p>   up and running. This could be a disaster.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it won't be a disaster. This is a very big, new approach</p>
<p>   and a much better approach to job placement. It provides people</p>
<p>   with greater incentive to help the unemployed and it gives the unemployed</p>
<p>   a greater range of choices. Obviously in the early days of it there</p>
<p>   will be some settling in, some adjustment problems but I ask people</p>
<p>   not to make a snap judgement, certainly not to make a final judgement</p>
<p>   on the basis of those things as Dr Kemp said yesterday. That sort</p>
<p>   of thing is inevitable whenever there's some kind of change.</p>
<p>   But it is a huge reform and I'll wager that in three months</p>
<p>   time, when I'm being interviewed like this, one beautiful morning</p>
<p>   in Melbourne, people will be saying what a huge success the Job</p>
<p>   Network has been.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Thank you, Malcolm. Lyn, go ahead please, you're next. </p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Oh, Mr Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I'd like to talk about the gambling issue and what's</p>
<p>   happening. I'm just one example out here - and it's really</p>
<p>   quite ironic that you're on today. We have lost $70,000 in</p>
<p>   two years - my husband, not me. I don't gamble.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>This is gambling or...</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>This is gambling on pokies. We are now going to lose our home.</p>
<p>   He has got to the point where he's now stealing from me, because</p>
<p>   we both work. I had a rather bad accident. I only got home from</p>
<p>   hospital last week. He has cleaned me out. And I have actually sat</p>
<p>   up for the last 48 hours in bed contemplating just ending it all</p>
<p>   because I can't live like this any more. That's what's</p>
<p>   happening in this country. And I know so many people in the same</p>
<p>   position.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, for a start, don't do that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, please, I mean, if there's one piece of advice and one</p>
<p>   urging, that will achieve absolutely nothing and could I encourage</p>
<p>   you to talk to the tremendous counsellors and others that are available</p>
<p>   from organisations like the Salvation Army and others who do have</p>
<p>   an understanding of these problems. And yesterday, could I say,</p>
<p>   I took part in a service in Sydney to commemorate the lives of people</p>
<p>   who'd committed suicide and I was surrounded by a large number</p>
<p>   of these wonderful counsellors from the Wesley Central Mission there,</p>
<p>   and their capacity to give people hope and everything is enormous.</p>
<p>   Could I first, the most important bit of advice I could give you</p>
<p>   is to get advice from people who are able to help in these circumstances.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>And we can give you some numbers, and then if you want to hold</p>
<p>   on...</p>
