PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 9 AUGUST 1990<br />
I congratulate Joan Kirner on her election to the<br />
Premiership. To this challenging assignment she brings<br />
considerable experience including most recently the<br />
important area of education.<br />
Joan is a capable and committed parliamentarian who<br />
deserves and, I believe, will receive the support of all<br />
members of the Party.<br />
I am looking forward to co-operating with her in<br />
advancing the interests of the people of Victoria. </p>
