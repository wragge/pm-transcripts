    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am delighted to express my support for the launch of the Queen’s Young Leaders Programme in London today.</p>
<p>Their Royal Highnesses, the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Henry of Wales will launch the programme to celebrate and support young leaders from across the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>This award scheme is now searching for the first 60 inspirational young people to receive a Queen’s Young Leader Award.</p>
<p>Australia is blessed with exceptional young people and I encourage Australians to nominate for the award.</p>
<p>Recipients of the Award will be people aged 18-29 who have overcome adversity to show leadership and service in their community. Successful applicants will receive training and mentoring opportunities to further encourage and inspire them.</p>
<p>The Queen’s Young Leaders Programme is a fitting tribute to Her Majesty, who, over 60 years as Head of the Commonwealth, has exemplified the ideals of duty and service.</p>
