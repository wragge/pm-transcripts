    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, there's been a lot of talk about Nauru this morning, how important it is that it doesn't become the next failed state. What do you have to say about the plight of Nauru at the moment?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we're very sympathetic and we have been in the past and I'll be demonstrating at this meeting a continuing sympathy for the position of the Nauruan people, I'll be meeting President Scotty to talk about things and we continue to have discussions with that country.  We want to help in the Pacific, we accept our obligations, we don't want to throw our weight around and we do want to help and there is a new spirit in the Pacific, there's a sense now that working together things can be done and I'm very pleased about that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What are the prospects then of concrete reforms coming out of this meeting? Or is it still a matter of...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's a question of a work in progress and of maintaining the momentum that was laid down at the last meeting.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So any concrete reforms then?  Any...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There will be, I'm sure, progress made in relation to governance and the transport survey and other things and there are a number of announcements that I will make during the course of the conference on behalf of Australia, which will be a further demonstration of our concern and commitment to this region and our desire to help our friends in the Pacific.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you suggesting Prime Minister that Australia could give more aid and assistance to Nauru?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we already have given a lot of aid and assistance to a number of countries in the region.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What about the forum more generally?  That was obviously why he wanted to be empower the forum so he could act...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well let's, I've only just arrived, I haven't even got my coat off.  Let me, let the meeting unfold.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On the transport study, what will you be highlighting to...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'll be indicating an Australian response, I don't want to get into the detail of that now.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will you be talking rugby Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, certainly, always talk rugby, particularly in the Pacific, I think we have made some real progress. I am very sympathetic to the attitude of the Pacific Islands states on rugby, I made that very clear at the meeting in Auckland last year and I have worked, respecting of course that the International Rugby Board controls these things, and the Australian Rugby Union has been very helpful, I have had some discussions with them and I am very sympathetic to the idea of having a Pacific Islands rugby team.  I think it's a fantastic concept, it means a great deal to the people of the Pacific Islands states and I understand how they feel and I hope international rugby in an appropriate way responds and I know the Australian rugby union has been very positive.</p>
<p>   JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, Mr Latham called a press conference in a chemist shop this morning and he agreed with you in the sense that the difficulty that you're having with the PBS is above the both of you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think it's important that people remember that this Free Trade Agreement is very good for Australia and that's more important than a short term political advantage for either of us. I think it's also important to keep in mind, very important, that the Free Trade Agreement does not in any way damage the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.  If it had have I would never have signed it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you reject some of the commentary that perhaps you've been outmanoeuvred by ...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look I don't comment and I don't comment on comment.  What I want is a strong Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and I want the Free Trade Agreement, it would be a tragedy for this country if the Free Trade Agreement were not passed into law, it is a once in a generation opportunity, and that is more important than any short term political advantage I might gain or Mr Latham might gain and if he is adopting that view as well then I welcome that.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
