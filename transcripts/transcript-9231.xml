TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
ADDRESS TO THE COLLINGWOOD FOOTBALL CLUB POST-BUDGET<br />
LUNCH, HYATT HOTEL, MELBOURNE, FRIDAY, 13 MAY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Thank you Chief Justice John Phillips, Leader of the Opposition John<br />
Brumby, guests at the official table, my friend Bobby Rose amongst them<br />
and ladies and gentlemen.<br />
I really am glad to have the opportunity the Collingwood Football Club<br />
extends to me as Allan ( MacAlister) said, for the first time in the week of the<br />
Budget to offer up a few thoughts. And, of course, I always get a few<br />
thoughts around the table.<br />
Since I first became one of the many thousands of Collingwood members<br />
and one of the millions of supporters, this lunch has become a bit of a<br />
tradition and we might have moved the date of the Budget, but we maintain<br />
the tradition of the lunch. The thing I've learned is you don't tamper with<br />
Collingwood traditions. As a result of all this I now get to pay a visit to<br />
Melbourne while there are still a few leaves on the trees and a little warmth<br />
in the air and I am very pleased to be here.<br />
As this national recovery grows, Melbourne is emerging as a major player<br />
and that has to be good.<br />
Victoria took a hammering for a few years, and I think it is a real measure of<br />
the character of the place and the people that they did not lose their nerve or<br />
drop their collective bundle.<br />
This is a city with genuine spirit and toughness. It does have class it must<br />
have because Leo Schofield has decided to move down here. Leo hasn't<br />
come for the football he's come for arts and because he's grown to love the<br />
place. And this is a great compliment from a Sydney sider for this great city. </p>
<p>Australia needs Melbourne to succeed. If this particular part of the nation's<br />
heart isn't pumping our whole constitution is weakened. So when we see<br />
companies down here beginning to thrive again, we're pleased. And when<br />
the Committee for Melbourne says it wants to build the Domain tunnel, we<br />
want to help. When the Goulburn Valley gets a plan for its future tdgether,<br />
we'll kick in with some Commionwealth assistance.<br />
You might notice there are not a lot of Labor voters among any of those<br />
categories, but, I think, the important thing is we all work together.<br />
It's like working with Jeff Kennett. I don't mind that, but what's more<br />
important, is given that he reckons we'll win the next election, he can work<br />
with me.<br />
But I want to say, I do like working with my mate John Brumby and I've done<br />
a bit of work with him over the past and we'll be doing a bit in the future.<br />
Mind you, the relationship will be more amiable if Jeffrey refrains from taking<br />
credit for Commonwealth projects. in Victoria. I don't like him riding on those<br />
trains in Spring Street when I pay we the Commonwealth to put the rails<br />
down or plumbing to the Treasury building which we decided to refurbish.<br />
And I also hope that in this new era of growth he doesn't forget I hope no<br />
one in Melbourne forgets that Melbourne's future depends on not just<br />
development but planning and preservation.<br />
The world is full of second and third rate cities skewered by sixty-story<br />
plinths towering over planning disasters. Monuments to myopia and short<br />
term private interests over long term public ones.<br />
The great cities of the next century, like the great cities of any century, will<br />
be those that look good and are good to live in.<br />
They will be efficient and vibrant cities which maintain their character and<br />
quality. In a very real sense that is what this last decade of the century is all about<br />
building the quality into Australia. Into the economy, into the society, into the<br />
nation. I mean knitting the skills and technology into our ambitions and<br />
traditions. I mean pulling all that great diversity and vast distance into a<br />
cohesive nation a loose federation and a singularly independent-minded<br />
and unregimented people, but a cohesive people.<br />
We have learned a lot about these things in recent years.<br />
We've learned that it's not enough to just grow and mine things we have to<br />
make things as well and service things too. And what we grow and mine and<br />
make has to be the best. </p>
<p>That has implications for how we grow it and mine it and make it and service<br />
it we have to do it as well as, or better than, anyone else in the world.<br />
So the quality has to be built in. I don't think this is the time to give you a<br />
talk on international best practice except to say that, whatever the degree or<br />
detail with which business applies it as a code for the pursuit of excellence<br />
best practice will increasingly govern the operations of the Commonwealth<br />
Government, and should increasingly govern those of state and local<br />
governments and regional organisations of this country.<br />
The nation itself in the 1990s should work to that same goal.<br />
We have built this into the regional development strategy we announced in<br />
the Government's White Paper because regions have to find what they do<br />
best and the best way of doing it. They have to find their niche in the<br />
modem Australian economy, and in the international economy.<br />
We are also bringing the same sorts of principles to the federation through<br />
the Council of Australian Governments, the States and the Commonwealth<br />
are beginning to remove a lot of the impediments to national efficiency. This<br />
is a great thing, working together co-operatively in a way we've probably<br />
never done before.<br />
The Commonwealth has a decade of economic reform behind it. The truth is<br />
that the next wave of change will have to substantially come from the States.<br />
We have improved the environment in which our firms operate through<br />
substantial microeconomic reform. Further progress is in store as we work<br />
with the States to extend greater competition to the public utilities. Recently,<br />
the COAG meeting in August will also consider specific reform to electricity,<br />
gas, water, legal services and the maritime sector. So a* lot will depend on<br />
what they do and on the sort of cooperative agreements we can strike in the<br />
national interest.<br />
The last decade of the nineteenth century, in some respects, followed an<br />
uncannily similar path. It began badly and ended in unprecedented national<br />
unity which is to say it ended in federation.<br />
We need to end this decade the same way we need a degree of national<br />
unity, cohesion and purpose such as we have never seen before.<br />
I think we sometimes lose sight of the fact that we made some really<br />
fundamental progress in this direction in the last decade. The Accord<br />
between the Government and the trade unions was a real and symbolic<br />
manifestation of the capacity for Australian workers and Australian<br />
management and the Australian Government to work together in the national<br />
interest. We have seen a cooperative culture develop in our workplaces as<br />
a consequence. And we are seeing the rewards in low inflation, higher<br />
productivity and greater competitiveness. </p>
<p>The challenge remains to maintain and extend this progress. To do it, we<br />
will have to vigorously push on not just with the microeconomic reform<br />
agenda, but with enterprise bargaining. Because, it is not simply the agenda<br />
of the government business enterprise which will determine how successful<br />
and competitive Australia is or will be, but the competitiveness and efficiency<br />
of each employing unit.<br />
A lot of the responsibility lies in realms which are not the Commonwealth's.<br />
In the case of government business enterprises or the States and regional<br />
governments and with employers and employees in the case of firms. We<br />
will only be truly successful when we build in the efficiencies from the ground<br />
up; when the quality flows right through the economy; when in every tier of<br />
government and every workplace the same goals and principles apply to do<br />
things as well as they can be done.<br />
That is what being internationally competitive means. It is also the<br />
precondition of a good society in the twenty-first century. If we want a place<br />
in the front rank of nations and the prosperity, opportunity and fulfilment that<br />
goes with it, we are all going to have to work for it.<br />
If this sounds a bit like a three-quarter time address, that is probably in the<br />
stage of our development, now, appropriate that it does. Because in the<br />
final analysis the words won't matter it will depend on what the players do<br />
and that's where the issue will be settled.<br />
I don't want you to get me wrong in thinking that prime responsibility to lead<br />
the process of reform and, in spirit and effect, encourage national unity and<br />
purpose lies other than with the Commonwealth Government it doesn't. But<br />
it has to be a shared responsibility and we will put the pressure on the<br />
States, on regional governments and on business and in the trade unions to<br />
make sure we all move along together.<br />
Perhaps the best illustration of what I'm talking about can be found in two<br />
reports we commissioned on regional Australia. Bill Kelty's Taskforce and<br />
McKinsey and Company surveyed the regions of Australia and each came<br />
up with the same essential conclusion the key to success in the regions<br />
was in the leadership and organisation. The key is finding the means by<br />
which the material and human resources, the talents and energies of regions<br />
can be put to best effect. This is a very telling set of surveys, a very telling<br />
couple of reports which reveal that, as always, there's no substitute for<br />
leadership and wherever we see it, we always see an organisation or a<br />
region doing well. The successful ones are better helping themselves.<br />
The lesson for the Commonwealth is neither to abandon regions in this<br />
country nor to pour in material assistance the lesson is to give strategic<br />
assistance, to give strategic help, the sort of assistance which will enable the<br />
regions of Australia to get the best out of their physical resources and their<br />
people. </p>
<p>You see how the parallel with the three-quarter time address returns. And<br />
the message is very similar we will succeed best if we share a sentiment<br />
and an identity, if we are working to the same purpose, if we cohere, if we<br />
call on everyone's talent and everyone's energy and will. In other words, we<br />
won't make it as a nation, as an economy or a society if we don't make it<br />
together. Success will depend on these factors tangible and intangible. But, the<br />
other thing it is going to depend on is skill.<br />
The phrase that is used these days, often in Australia, is value-adding. I<br />
daresay a decade ago very few Australians had ever heard of it. These days<br />
it is widely used and understood. It means, of course, adding another<br />
dimension to a product and, in doing so, adding to its value in the market.<br />
If value-adding was the catch-phrase of the last decade, kil's must be the<br />
catch-phrase of this one. Our success as a nation the success of any<br />
nation in the modern world will depend on the capacity of our workforce to<br />
add value to products, and that will depend on their skills.<br />
It follows that our ability to create jobs for Australians depends on the skills<br />
of our workforce. Skills are our greatest resource. We will never return to a<br />
time when there were vast numbers of unskilled jobs. If we want that place<br />
among the front rank of nations in the twenty-first century, we need our<br />
people to be skilled.<br />
The White Paper on employment and growth is very largely about just that.<br />
It is about skills. It is about making the country stronger and more efficient<br />
by giving the unemployed, and those at risk of becoming unemployed, the<br />
skills they will need if they are to find a job. That will make the country vastly<br />
more efficient and, of course, vastly more just.<br />
Some people have said that by training and giving work experience to the<br />
long term unemployed, and removing disincentives to work in the social<br />
security system, we are creating competition for new entrants to the labour<br />
market. This is a polite way of saying don't worry about the long term<br />
unemployed, just leave them behind. But commonsense and compassion<br />
tell us, I think, that we can't do that and with the White Paper the<br />
Government has said that we won't. It was never an option.<br />
It has also been said the cost is too high. The answer is the same: we can't<br />
leave them behind not if we want to maintain our national self-respect and<br />
our social cohesion and order. The answer to those who say that the cost is<br />
too high is count the cost of doing nothing. Count the cost to their lives and<br />
to ours. The cost of wasting their potential. </p>
<p>There are others who have said that the only answer is to so change our<br />
system of industrial relations, that wage rates should be cut and conditions<br />
of employment degraded. Well, this is a very old argument and a discredited<br />
one. In effect it means emulating the model of Great Britain and the United<br />
States. In Great Britain you will find men working as security guards for<br />
$ 2.50 an hour for an eighty-four hour week and women doing piece work for<br />
$ 6.30 a day. In the United States, where the unemployment rate is six and a<br />
half per cent, there exists an army of working poor, they are in jobs, but they<br />
are jobs which keep them well below the poverty line. In both countries the<br />
gaps in wealth are wide and profound and there are unmistakable symptoms<br />
of social disorder and decay symptoms which we do not want to see in our<br />
country, in our society.<br />
So, with the White Paper, the Government has signalled that Australia will<br />
be a high wage, high productivity country making innovative, value-added<br />
products. We have no intention of creating a first class economy but a<br />
second rate society even if it were possible to do so.<br />
With the White Paper I believe all Australians should understand, and most<br />
of our political opponents should understand that the days when economic<br />
progress was construed to mean a dog-eat-dog society are over forever.<br />
There are two very good reasons for this. The first is that by their decision<br />
at the last election, the Australian people registered the notion of such a<br />
society, they voted for social compassion and cohesion, for a safety net and<br />
for bringing the unemployed with us. As I said the other day at the National<br />
Press Club, in 1993 the Australian traditions of fairness and equity which<br />
had been born in the 1890s were profoundly reasserted.<br />
But the people did not just vote with their hearts. They also voted with their<br />
heads. They recognised the waste in leaving a great body of unemployed<br />
people behind. They recognised the folly in a doctrine of unmitigated<br />
economic rationalism the folly in believing that economic progress implies a<br />
return to the social conditions and mores of the 19th century.<br />
So, put another way, with the election of last year behind us in 1993 and the<br />
White Paper of 1994, Australia has embarked without qualification on the<br />
path towards a sophisticated social democracy underpinned by a<br />
sophisticated modern economy.<br />
We have made a decision to play in the premier league and that compels<br />
us to build quality into every sphere of our national life.<br />
That is what the White Paper is about and the Budget which consolidates it<br />
which takes those costs and fits them into the national, annual economic<br />
parameter. With them we say that economic policy and social policy go<br />
hand in hand. </p>
<p>We say that a first rate Australia, like a first rate city, will manifest not just the<br />
evidence of growth and development but of character and tradition. It will<br />
have a human dimension as well as an aesthetic one.<br />
We also say a first rate country, like a first rate business or a first rate<br />
football team, will be characterised by the strength which comes from shared<br />
sentiments and fellow feeling and the competitive edge that only skills<br />
provide. We say that a first rate country has all these things built in.<br />
And finally we say that in 1994 we have opportunity unprecedented in our<br />
history to do these things.<br />
And every reason, every confidence that we will be able to do it and in the<br />
doing of it set Australia out as a place that never lost its fix, its judgement or<br />
its values. Thank you very much indeed<br />
