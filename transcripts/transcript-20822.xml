    <content><![CDATA[<p>On this the 50th Anniversary of the cessation of hostilities we honour the brave Australian soldiers, sailors and airmen who fought and died in the Korean War.</p>
<p>  When North Korean troops invaded South Korea in June of 1950 the United Nations ordered into the field its first ever international peacekeeping force.  Australia was among the first countries to respond to the United Nations'; call for assistance, joining an international force ultimately comprising twenty-one nations.</p>
<p>This is a solemn and special occasion on which we remember and pay tribute to the three hundred and thirty nine Australians who sacrificed their lives in the Korean War and the over seventeen thousand Australians who served with great distinction in the War.  We also give thanks to and honour the friends and allies with whom the Australian forces served in Korea.</p>
<p>The Korean War was a conflict that cost a great many lives but ultimately culminated in the successful defence of South Korea and the establishment of the Republic of Korea.</p>
<p>Throughout the War at places such as Kapyong, Mariumsung and Samichon the fighting capacity, valour and steadfastness under fire, for which Australian forces have been known throughout the world, once again was in evidence.  The courage, sacrifice, compassion and mateship displayed by Australians in Korea goes to the very heart of the ANZAC spirit begun by Australian and New Zealand forces on the shores of Gallipoli in 1915.  The example set by Australians in Korea will not be forgotten and has forged an enduring bond of friendship between Australia and the Republic of Korea, as was evident during my recent visit to Seoul.</p>
<p>On behalf of the nation I gratefully acknowledge the sacrifice of those Australians who served in Korea and thank them for their courage, their selfless performance of duty and the honour they have brought to this country.</p>
<p>Today, the Minister for Veterans'; Affairs, the Hon Danna Vale MP, and members of the Korean War veteran community will represent Australia at the official commemorative ceremonies in Korea.  </p>
