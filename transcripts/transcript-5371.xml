PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA MONDAY 2 JUNE 1980<br />
SPEECH AT THE RECEPTION AT T" HE CENTRAL SYN4AGOGUE<br />
occasions such as this are always enjoyable because they bring<br />
together friends and families with common interests and a<br />
deep sense of community involvement..<br />
Functions such as this say much about your community and its<br />
values and provide a significant lead for what we try to<br />
achieve from community organisation.<br />
only recently, I had the privilege of opening the Yeshiva<br />
College at Bondi.<br />
An occasion which brought to my mind the contribution made by<br />
the Jewish community to Australia.<br />
At a time when there is a serious reappraisal of community,<br />
national and international values, the example of the Jewish<br />
community reminds us and we sometimes need reminding that<br />
the family is an irreplacqable source of affection, guidance,<br />
security and direction for' young people.<br />
At a time when we could be excused for thinking that, in many<br />
parts of the world, humanity is being stood on its head, I<br />
commend what is being done through this Synagogue as an instance<br />
of the values of humanity and learning that each of us must<br />
pursue in building a better community.<br />
This Synagogue, established 65 years ago, is the soul and<br />
symbol of your community, reinforcing the values we must seek<br />
to enshrine in the national way of life in the decade ahead<br />
persistence in the face of difficulty; dedication to selfimprovement,<br />
and to personal and professional success; and,<br />
the achievement of all this, with a respectful sense of history<br />
and heritage.<br />
This has been the text for the Jewish community down through<br />
the years.<br />
Well may it be the text for our nation in the<br />
The traditions which inform the Jewish community have been<br />
forged through thousands of years and countless struggles for<br />
independence in the pursuit of values and beliefs.<br />
These struggles regrettably continue today. </p>
<p>Jewish people are still discriminated against in the Soviet<br />
Union, and their rights as a people are suppressed.<br />
This only serves to highlight the increasing importance of<br />
Israel as a homeland; a dream achieved; a hope fulfilled.<br />
It also emphasises the importance of countries like Australia<br />
where there is an acceptance and a welcome for all people<br />
especially those of Jewish faith who have done so much for<br />
Australia. The contribution by the Jewish community, across a broad spectrum<br />
of life mnusic, the arts, literature, industry and public lifeis<br />
widely acknowledged.<br />
Many have left their marks in Australia's history of<br />
community service.<br />
The contribution made by your efforts is important; as is your<br />
company amongst us as proud Australians.<br />
Your role emphasises the acceptance and encouragement of<br />
diversity in the Australian way of life.<br />
This is not a country wherewe expect everyone to be the same.<br />
We believe we are a better, more tolerant and more mature nation<br />
because our people have come from many lands and from many<br />
different backgrounds.<br />
And the Jewish community plays a proud part in the successes<br />
that come from our diversity.<br />
For us all, the decade has opened in an atmosphere of international<br />
concern, of which the Middle East and South West Asia are the<br />
focal points.<br />
The difficulties involving and surrounding the strength and<br />
survival1' oE' the.-State of Israel; the Soviet invasion of<br />
Afghanistan; the'illegal detention of American hostages in Iran;<br />
the threat that all this poses to oil supplies for industrialised<br />
countri4Aes; all these cast shadows of turmoil and unpredictability.<br />
The minds of world leaders are centred upon these problems.<br />
Our hope is that they will secure practical and peaceful solutions<br />
to these grave and threatening crises.<br />
Against this background, the links between our nations have<br />
stood the test of time.<br />
In 1948, Australia was one of the strong supporters of the<br />
creation~ of the State of Israel.<br />
And we remain absolutely committed to its continuation within<br />
secure and recognised borders. </p>
<p>You are all aware that the Government has taken a most serious<br />
view of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.<br />
I have indicated in Parliament, and on other occasions, our<br />
difficulty in understanding how a country engaged in the invasion<br />
of another country and the suppression of its people can be<br />
regarded as a ' Lit host to the Olympic Games.<br />
Still, Soviet troops remain in Afghanistan in great numbers;<br />
brutalities continue.<br />
Mliddle-ranking country that we are, it would be a betrayal of<br />
our international responsibilities and an abdication of' our<br />
commitment to the international family, if we were to stand idly<br />
by and not make our position clear.<br />
many people, in calling for a boycott of the Games, have mentioned<br />
as a prime reason, quite apart from the Soviet invasion of<br />
Afghanistan, the treatment of dissidents in the USSR.<br />
What is just as intolerable as the invasion, is the fact that<br />
dissidents and others in the USSR who might seek to use the<br />
Games and the presence of tourists, athletes and the world's<br />
press as an opportunity to voice their protests, have already<br />
been dispersed to other parts of the Soviet Union.<br />
They will not be heard.<br />
They will not be allowed to em~ barrass the Soviet authorities.<br />
I am particularly pleased to learn of your support for the<br />
Government's stand on this question.<br />
It is important that we do not allow our relative remoteness<br />
over 35 years from major international disturbances to breed<br />
complacency in our attitudes.<br />
There are those, no doubt who would argue that Afghanistan is<br />
a long way away; that grave and all as the problem is, it has<br />
limited relevance for us.<br />
Such a view suggests that while the freedom of others can be<br />
chall-enged, we can enjoy, for all time, an immunity -Ero. m.<br />
challenge. Thiis is to suggecst that a free society can survive without effort,<br />
'-., ithout will, without commitment.<br />
TLhis view must be given no currency.<br />
is 1aa, v iws i wb t'rlenbythose wiihts o litt1lL eounderstanding o<br />
the incomparable benefits and virtues of democracy that they<br />
are able to allow them to be chipped away.<br />
People with so little understanding of the future that the<br />
present does not matter that much. .4 </p>
<p>Peocle who are luke-warm and uncommitted to idealism and<br />
Liberalism; uncritical of socialism or communism.<br />
Peo; ple who ask apologetically what's in a name.<br />
Peo Dle with so little to believe in that they have nothing<br />
to defend.<br />
. cnan appreciation of the virtues of a way of life is lost,<br />
ther-e is no will for its defence.<br />
Is J-t not time to understand that what we devalue today, we<br />
may lose tomorrow.<br />
Is it not time to ask whether or not we have underrated the<br />
precious gift of continuing peace; whether or not we have been<br />
spoilt by economic growth; whether or not we have been in<br />
receipt of so much of the world's goodness that vie have become<br />
blind to the world's threats.<br />
Discrimination, repression and exile are not only an affront<br />
to those who suffer at their hands; but also, they affront the<br />
values and principles which we seek to enshrine.<br />
On the other hand, world tensions serve to remind us of the<br />
importance of countries such as Australia where people from<br />
other lands are welcome; where members of your community have<br />
found a home and made a lasting and productive contribution.<br />
I w. elcome your continuing role in providing for the welfare<br />
needs of your community; and through the preservation of the<br />
traditional, social, religious and cultural values of Judaism,<br />
enriching the wider community to which we all belong.<br />
I comziend you for the work done in the " outreach" programmes<br />
to assist Jewish people in distress.<br />
Your work in the Jewish welfare society; for the care of the<br />
aged at the Montefiore Homes; provision for those who are ill<br />
or in need of medical care through the Wolper Jewish Hospital,<br />
are all evidence of how the Jewish community cares for those<br />
in need.<br />
I know that Rabbi Alony is a pivotal inspiration behind all<br />
these programmes; always on hand to counsel; offering dynamism,<br />
enthusiasm and support to a dedicated band of part-time staff.<br />
E spec ial ly do I commend the aims, objectives and the achievements<br />
of the Hineni Youth Movement.<br />
The complex and changed world in which we live does not always<br />
malke easy the transition of young people through the difficult<br />
Deriod of adolescence.<br />
Hineni acts as a social group for Jewish youth and a focus for<br />
the assiimilation by young people of the Jewish culture.<br />
0 , r </p>
<p>It is something of a truism to suggest that our youth is the<br />
foundation of our future.<br />
But by your community providing for the needs and security of<br />
the young, it is ensuring that that foundation is . sell laid.<br />
In moving amongst you all, one has a feeling of being part of<br />
a dynamic community with a genuine commitment to, and concern<br />
for the Jewish traditions and Australia's future.<br />
Long may that State of being continue.<br />
