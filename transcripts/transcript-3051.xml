VE NQ DATE<br />
M/ 153 October 1973<br />
PRIM~ E MINISTER AT JAPAN<br />
PRESS CLUB<br />
The following are the introductory remarks<br />
b, 2y6 MWtOhhceitr tolbPaer mri,, m e taoMn id ntihsesu tbeJsrae pqauanen dn tP rMeiqsnusie ssttCeilorunb sf oirna ndTF ookaryneosi wgenor nsA: ffairs,<br />
panseI last had the pleasure of mceting representat4. ves of the<br />
Veygreat charges have occurred in both our countries since then.<br />
Even greater changes have occurred in the prospects for our region.<br />
At that time, I was the Leader of the Opposition in the Parliament of<br />
my country. Now I have the honour to be Australia's Prime Minister.<br />
That is not a marvellously important change as far as you are concerned,<br />
though I have no doubt you will be interested in some of the changes<br />
of policy the election of my government has brought about. But at<br />
that last press conference, I had just completed a visit to Peking. Just<br />
2 days after I spoke to you, President Nixon made his historic announcement<br />
W t he intended to go to Peking before May 1972. I was still in Tokyo<br />
ehe made his broadcast. I well remember the reaction here at the time.<br />
I can assure you that the suprise was felt in my country as well as yours.<br />
There was even some shock in some quarters in Australia. I myself was<br />
suprised, but delighted. Japan has been able to move very rapidly towards<br />
established honourable and sensible relations wiith the People's Republic.<br />
W-6tralia recognised the Peoule's Republic as soon as the new Government<br />
took office. The American detente with both China and the Soviet Union<br />
has been followed by the end of her tragic and disastrous intervention<br />
in Indo-China. These are very important and hopeful developments in themselves.<br />
But because of the speed with which they took place, and because they<br />
represent such a marked change from the thinking and attitudes which<br />
have dominated the affairs of our region for a generation, they have<br />
created some uneasiness. It is not always easy to adjust to change,<br />
even when those changes are basically good and hopeful. in themselves. I<br />
believe hcwever, that countries like Japan and Australia have a duty to<br />
work together to ensure that the new opportunities for peace and progress<br />
in our region are not thrown away.<br />
As you know, the reason for my current visit is to attend the<br />
Japan/ Australian Ministerial Committee. This committee was established<br />
by agreement between the Governments of our two countries when a<br />
previous Australian Government was in office. The first meeting<br />
was held in Canberra last October. For this meeting in Tokyo, I have<br />
brought with me very senior Ministers in my government our Treasurer<br />
Mr Crean, Minister for Overseas Trade, Dr Cairns, our Minister for </p>
<p>Minerals and Energy, Mr Connor and our Minister for Primary<br />
Industries ( Agriculture) Senator lireidt. I think the composition<br />
of our delegation speaks for itself about the importance Australia<br />
attaches to the Committee Meeting and to the relations with Japan.<br />
And you also can get some idea of the matters to be discussed by<br />
looking at the Ministerial responsibilities of these Ministers.<br />
In particular, we recognise that our policies regarding investment<br />
from overseas and the use of our resources are of particular<br />
interest to Japan. Ive recognise that Japan is entitled to be<br />
reassured that she will continue to have secure access to<br />
Australia's resources at fair prices. The Government and people<br />
of Japan can be reassured on that point.<br />
The growth of close relations between Japan and<br />
Australia in recent years has been very remarkable. I am<br />
quite sure those relations will continue to the increasing<br />
mutual benefit of our two countries and I would hope to the<br />
benefit of our region.<br />
Q. I understand that there is much opposition within<br />
Australia against the signing of a Treaty of Friendship, Commerce<br />
and Navigation with Japan, and I am given to understand that you<br />
yourself, Mr Prime Minister, have come up with certain ideas<br />
about this treaty. Could you tell us what you have in mind?<br />
P. M. In past years the Government of Japan has<br />
suggested to the Government of Australia that Australia should<br />
enter into a Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation with<br />
Japan as very many other countries have already done.<br />
Earl~ ier Australian Governments were not enthusiastic<br />
about the offer. I wouldn't like you to think that they<br />
were hostile. That would not be an accurate description.<br />
It has never been a very big public issue in Australia<br />
but it would be correct to say that earlier Australian Governments<br />
were not responsive to the suggestion.<br />
My colleagues and I would welcome an arrangement between<br />
Japan and Australia which would acknowlede the voery real<br />
significance that we have for each other.<br />
We believe that there are great mutual advantages in<br />
our relationship. Vie believe there are great benefits to be<br />
shared between us in that relationship and we would like to have<br />
such an arrangement or treaty so that the conditions in which we<br />
co-operate and consult would be known to the whole world and<br />
would be acknowledged by each of the parties.<br />
I suspect that this general idea will be discussed by<br />
the JapDanese Ministers Rnd the Australian Ministers at this<br />
second Ministerial Conference between our two countries on<br />
Monday and Tuesday of next week.<br />
-2-</p>
<p>I am not suggesting that there should be a text laid on<br />
the table and people should discuss it in detail or specifics<br />
then, but I would think it desirable that in the weeks following<br />
this Ministerial Conference officials should discuss the general<br />
propo sit ion. Australia, in those circumstances, would be very happy to<br />
suggest the form of such written arrangements.<br />
Q. Prime M~ inister, in the penultimate paragraph of<br />
your prepared remarks you say that Australia recognises the<br />
Japanese view in which the Australians concurred, about the<br />
Australian Minerals and Energy policy.<br />
I would like to ask you whether you have come to Japan<br />
to spell out your policy. 0<br />
P. M. I have spent quite a deal of time in recent weeks<br />
discussing these matters with the four Ministers who are coming<br />
with me, and our officials have done the same.<br />
We Ministers and the officials have done so together,<br />
and I believe there will be quite an amount of specifics discussed<br />
or Monday and Tuesday.<br />
Q. This question concerns migratory birds0<br />
The Japanese Government has proposed that in the treaty<br />
for the protection of migratory birds an awful lot of them fly<br />
between Australia and Japan can you tell me what your view is<br />
towards this proposition and do you think this will be taken<br />
up at this Ministerial Conference?<br />
Last year we signed a similar treaty between Japan and<br />
the United States and recently we signed it with the U. S. S. R.<br />
We are trying to develop a coordinated system or<br />
network of such treaties for the protection of migratory birds,<br />
and could you tell us your view about the conservation and<br />
preservation of nature?<br />
P. M. This treaty is not on the agenda for this<br />
Ministerial Conference.<br />
We are very happy to enter into treaties to preserve<br />
wild life0 We have recently ratified, or taken steps to ratify<br />
an international treaty in this regard endangered species<br />
last year. My government has acted to ratify this treaty, and<br />
we would be responsive to this suggestion. </p>
<p>. There is, of course, one aspect of conservation which<br />
is of very great concern to Australia and Japan, and that is<br />
whales. Q. Prime Minister, you have a Companies Takeover<br />
Act which is a legacy of the previous administration which is<br />
to expire by the end of December this year.<br />
What is the view or policy of the Labor Administration<br />
towards overseas capital?<br />
P. M. We will probably extend this piece of<br />
legislation. I am not sure that by the end of the year we will be<br />
able to frame a better piece of legislation.<br />
Therefore, we will probably just extend the present one.<br />
' 9 as Japan'sO ura ttgietnuedrea l toa ttfiotruedieg n tocwaapridtsa l. foreign capital is the same<br />
One of the reasons why Japan has become so economically<br />
strong is that she has been very willing to learn from other<br />
countries but not to yield to other countries.<br />
Ever since the Meiji era the'governments of Japan and<br />
Japanese companies have determined to preserve Japan's<br />
sovereignty and identity and integrity.<br />
Japan, through the farsightedness and independence of<br />
earlier generations, is now in the situation of being the third<br />
greatest economic power in the world and the country which has<br />
the best economic future proportionately in the world.<br />
We believe in Australia we can learn from the Japanese<br />
example. Obviously we can't muster all the capital we need by<br />
ourselves. We can't develop all the skills we need by ourselves but<br />
this is not an excuse for being a minority partner or not being<br />
a partner at all in Australian resources and industries and<br />
their development. In the last 15 years or less in Australia, we have<br />
discovered very great mineral resources.<br />
Australian minerals as a whole are 62 per cent in<br />
f oreign hands. That is to Australia's disadvantage. </p>
<p>It is a reflection on preceding Australian Governments.<br />
We are determined to see that that percentage does<br />
not grow. We welcome partnerships within the discovery, the<br />
development, the marketing of our resources, and particularly<br />
we welcome partnerships with our best trading partners.<br />
Of those, Japan would probably be the best.<br />
Our understanding is that Japanese companies are willing<br />
to be good residents in other countries.<br />
They are more understanding and cooperative partners<br />
than some of the older ones with whom Australia has lived<br />
hitherto. We admire Japan's independence and farsightedness.<br />
We hope to emulate it, and to work with her.<br />
Q. In your prepared statement you talk about Japan's<br />
move toward China, the Australian move towards China and the<br />
American detente between China and the Soviet Union in the<br />
Indo-China war and then you say that these moves towards<br />
China have created some uneasiness and it is not always easy<br />
to adjust to change even when those changes are basically good<br />
and hopeful in themselves.<br />
Is there any more in this, can you elaborate?<br />
P. M. Last time I had a press conference in Tokyo was<br />
in July, 1971. As I recall in the statement I circulated, it was just<br />
at the time when Dr Kissinger' s visit to Peking was announced A^<br />
and the prospective visit of President Nixon was announced.<br />
This very clearly was an event which startled most<br />
countries in the region.<br />
It startled the Government of Australia at the time.<br />
And then events have moved with very great speed<br />
since them. Japan, for instance, switched from Taipei to Peking<br />
in September last.<br />
Australia did in December, and two years ago Peking<br />
was admitted to the U. N. and Taipei was excluded. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
Now in all these circumstances a great number of the<br />
countries in this region the western Pacific were caught by<br />
surprise, and some them still feel uneasy in the new<br />
circumstances. It is in that context that I made this remark.<br />
Q. There have been reports concerning the wreck of<br />
the Australian freighter " Blythe Star", apparently in -the vicinity<br />
of Japanese trawlers who were strongly advised to go to the<br />
rescue of the crew.<br />
They did not, disregarding one of the strongest rules<br />
of the sea0 Apparently they were pilfering Australian waters, and<br />
apparently they put fish above humzan ' Life0<br />
Are you going to take this matter up with the Japanese<br />
Government? P. M. There are allegations to this effect, there<br />
has been no confirmation of the allegations0<br />
The Ambassadors of' Japan in Australia and of Australia<br />
in Japan, both of whom are at this conference, would be the<br />
proper persons to follow up any such allegations if they were<br />
confirmed. Q. You men~ tion in your statement that the growth<br />
of close relations between Japan and ! Austraiia in recent years<br />
has been very remarkable.<br />
Could you cutline your-concept of the future of<br />
Australia/ Japanese relations?<br />
P. M0 There are two particular aspects which are of<br />
outstanding relevance to the region. one is the direct<br />
relation between Japan and Australia.<br />
Japan sells more things to Australia than any other<br />
country other than the U. S.<br />
We are of very great importance to each other0<br />
The other thing is that there is a vast contrast in<br />
development in all the economics and social standards between<br />
Japan and Australia on. the one hand and all the countries which<br />
lie between them on the other hand0<br />
Clearly, Japan and Australia can't be affluent enclaves<br />
in a deprived and potentially turbulent part of the world0<br />
Those are the two things which make it particularly<br />
important that Australia and Japan should acknowledge their<br />
relations with each other and their responsibilities to their<br />
neighour0 </p>
<p>Could I illustrate from one particular industry, the<br />
automobile industry.<br />
It is Australia's ' Largest industry.<br />
It is wholly in overseas hands0<br />
You know that in Japan you would never have allowed<br />
your automobile industry to be in foreign hands0<br />
We have noted the steps you took when Chrysler was<br />
waningto nvet hrewe noted the steps you took in that case.<br />
We should have had the foresight to act that way<br />
ourselves0 Some Japanese motor car companies are now interested in<br />
manufacturing in Australia, and the size,-the style, the safety<br />
of Japanese cars is every bit as good as the counterpart quality<br />
of the cars which are manufactured by other overseas companies<br />
in Australia0 We believe that the Japanese companies would be better<br />
partners in very many respects than the companies which we<br />
already have. Q You mentioned earlier that under certain<br />
conditions you would agree to a Friendship, Commerce and<br />
Navigation Treaty0<br />
What sort of conditions did you. mean?<br />
P. M. I decline to go into any further detail on<br />
this subject. Q. I -understand there is a certain fear in Japan<br />
about the future of Papua New G-uinea0 a<br />
Could you tell us a littl~ e about the future of Papua<br />
New Guinea and why should the Japanese be afraid of the future?<br />
P. M. I wasn't aware that there was any fear in Japan<br />
about the future of Papua New Guinea.<br />
There were no grounds in my view for any such fear.<br />
I take this opportunity -to discount any such fears.<br />
Papua New Guinea will become a self-governing country<br />
on 1 December this year.<br />
It will become an independent country within a very<br />
short time thereafter. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
Papua Nlew Guinea has shown, in the last few years,<br />
remarkable political development.<br />
The Chief Minister of Papua New Guinea is very well<br />
disposed towards Japan.<br />
His first schooling was received at the hands of the<br />
Japanese in the early 1940' s in his country.<br />
He has visited this country.<br />
His prospective Minister for Foreign Affairs will be in<br />
Tokyo at these ministerial talks on Tuesday afternoon.<br />
I would hope that Japanese companies and officials<br />
would have a continuing and confident interest in Papua<br />
New Guinea, as they should, I would suggest, have in all the<br />
countries between Australia and Japan because Japan has the<br />
greatest potential to realise and the greatest opportunity and<br />
I would therefore think the greatest obligation to help in the<br />
development of all these countries,<br />
Australia has similar opportunities and, therefore,<br />
obligations In kind although not, of course, in degree.<br />
Australia has done a very great deal to develop<br />
Papua New Guinea.<br />
We would welcome assistance ' by Japan.<br />
I think -the Government of Papua New Guinea -a very<br />
effective government would welcome such assistance too.<br />
I would thinic there should be no fears as to the<br />
future of Papua New Guinea.<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister: You have fcr some time been<br />
advocating a conference of the Asian and Pacific region.<br />
Do you mean this as a precedent for the now mummified<br />
ASPAC or SEATO or what were the implications for making such a<br />
conference in regard to the ASEAN.<br />
Do you intend to make this proposal in this ministerial<br />
meeting and do you also intend to make this proposal to China.<br />
P. M. I may well discuss the general idea both in<br />
Tokyo and in Peking.<br />
I don't want to commit myself to the word " conference"<br />
but I think that there are advantages in having arrangements<br />
under which the countries of the W~ estern Pacific and<br />
South Ea.-: t Asia can meet periodically to discuss matters of<br />
mutual interest. The great disadvantage, I believe, that so many of<br />
the countries have suffered hitherto and Australia has certainly </p>
<p>suffered from this, is that whenever heads of government or<br />
foreign ministers of any countries of the region get together<br />
people expect that there will be some aid program or military<br />
pact emerge from their discussions.<br />
We ought to become used to an exchange of view<br />
without any particular motive or agenda of that character.<br />
Reference has been made to SEATO which arose in the<br />
general context of the Geneva Conference of 1954 and ASPAC<br />
which arose in the context of America's involvement when the<br />
Geneva Agreement finally broke dcwnÃ± in the middle 1960' s<br />
We now see how ineffective such arrangements were.<br />
There are some economic arrangements and, for instance,<br />
one which Australia recently joined was the Ministerial<br />
Conference for the Development of South-East Asia, and we<br />
appreciate Japan's helpfulness in Australia joining that<br />
economic gathering. Let me draw a couple of comparisons: in Africa<br />
there is the Organisation of African Unity, in the Americas there<br />
has been, for longer, the Organisation of American States.<br />
When these bodies gather ft is to the advantage of all<br />
of them to do so.<br />
They all see advantages i~ n doing so.<br />
People don't have false hopes that there is going to<br />
be some military pact o~ r aid. program emerge from them.<br />
Another body to which Australia belongs is the<br />
Commonwealth of Nations -the British Commonwealth of Nations<br />
which so many woid rec-ognise it this is a body where there<br />
is no economic or military significance at all, but all the<br />
members find value .1n having this d-iscussion in that context.<br />
There is no such body in this region, and I believe<br />
wie are all the poorer for the want of it.<br />
The only body which has a regional significance and<br />
viability is ASEAN. RS&amp; J<br />
ASEAN is, understandablA'y, not wanting to extend until<br />
it has fully consolidated itself.<br />
It has made very great progress indeed.<br />
You mention China.<br />
Obviously there are difficulties in this situation </p>
<p>where some of the countries in the region do not recognise<br />
Peking I think that applies to two of them there are others<br />
whose relations with Peking have been suspended or have never<br />
been activated although the countries I had in mind there have<br />
never recognised Taipei-L to put it another way they do not<br />
assert, as Japani did and A-ustralla did until December last year<br />
that Genera'lissimio Z'hiang Kai-Shek was -the President of the<br />
whole of China. Obviously there are inhibitions in having such<br />
arrangements and consultations at this stage.<br />
We, I suggest.. want to get away from the idea that any<br />
arrangements in this region must have some ideological purpose<br />
or must have the participation of north Atlantic countries.<br />
Each the participation of north Atlantic countries,<br />
the ideological purposes have both been. shown to be<br />
couner-poducive Q. A supplementary qu. estion: Australia<br />
participated in the South-East Asian MYinisterial Conference<br />
for Economic Development recently in Tokyo for the first time<br />
and while Japan regards this gathering as a purely economic<br />
assembly, I take it that your view is not necessarily to<br />
regard it as pure. 1y an economic assembly.<br />
I don't think you have rejected the possibility of this<br />
body developing in the future into some kind of regional<br />
cooperation arrangement with some political overtones.<br />
May I invite you to comment on -this?<br />
P. MN. We accept this body in the context in which it<br />
has operated up until now -an economic one.<br />
We have no ulterior or concealed motives in joining<br />
It is valuable in what it does, and it is not a substitute<br />
for further organisations because people may think that one<br />
also means " ideological".<br />
I think one of the vices of ariangements in this<br />
region has been that so often they had ideological overtones.<br />
Really, in this region, we have got to work more and<br />
more irrespective of ideology.<br />
So, I don't want to use the word " Political" because<br />
". ideological" is one aspect of " political".<br />
The MEDSEA that we referred. to and youi asked about<br />
that's economic, and valuable as an economic body. </p>
