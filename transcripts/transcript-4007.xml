PR3 1/ 75<br />
18th Dece-ber, 1975<br />
The Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, has agreed to the swearing<br />
in of a new Ministry on Monday, 22 December, and to the announcement<br />
today of the proposed administrative arrangements.<br />
The new administrative machinery expresses the Government's<br />
deterination to undertake sound and economical management of the<br />
nation's affairs.<br />
Efficient and effective management of the Government's own<br />
administration is essential both for the achievement of prosperity<br />
and for genuine improvement in the position of the disadvantaged<br />
and in the standard of life of all Australians.<br />
The Government is determined to ensure that its administration<br />
remains informed by practical considerations. Accordingly,<br />
community groups, business and labour must have access to<br />
Departments concerned with the practical, effective administration<br />
of policy.<br />
These considerations are expressed in the reduction in the number<br />
of Departments, in the reallocation of functions between Departments,<br />
and in the appointment of an inner Cabinet.<br />
The number of Ministers is reduced from twenty-seven to twenty-four.<br />
There will be a Cabinet of 12. The number of Departments is<br />
reduced from 28 at present, to<br />
An investigation will be made of all the functions presently<br />
carried out by Federal Departments and authorities. The investigation<br />
will be directed towards identifying those activities which either<br />
ought not to be carried out at all, which might be carried out more<br />
effectively and efficiently,. or which might be more appropriately<br />
carried out by State or Local Government administrations. </p>
<p>-2-b.<br />
A statement will ba issued shortly concerning this investigation<br />
which begins immediately. It will draw upon the<br />
work of the Royal Com-nission on Australian Government Administration<br />
which is expected to submit its report by April 1976.<br />
