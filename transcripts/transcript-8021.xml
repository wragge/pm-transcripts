! 3AUBTRALIAL&amp;<br />
FOR MEDIA 8 MAY 1990<br />
At the invitation of Prime Minister Rabbie Namaliu. I shall<br />
make an official visit to Papua New Guinea from Wednesday<br />
May to Saturday 2 June.<br />
Papua New Guinea is one of Australia's most important<br />
regional neighbours, with whom we share many important<br />
strategic, political and economic interests.<br />
My visit to Papua New Guinea will return Mr Namaliu's visit<br />
to Australia last year. During the visit I will hold<br />
discussions with the Prime Minister and members of his<br />
Government on a range of matters of mutual interest,<br />
involving the bilateral relationship and broader regional<br />
developments. I shall also be meeting with members of the Australian<br />
business community there.<br />
In addition to Port Moresby, I shall also travel to<br />
important regional centres in Papua New Guinea.<br />
