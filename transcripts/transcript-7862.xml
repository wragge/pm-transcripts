PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 17 DECEMBER 1989<br />
So*, vi~ et Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov will visit Australia from<br />
1.3-16 February 1990. fie will be the most senior Soviet<br />
figure ever to do so.<br />
Premier Ryzhkov' s visit, which is in response to a<br />
long-standing invitation from me, underlines the important<br />
* contact that has been developed between Australia and the<br />
Soviet Union in recent years.<br />
My Government has worked to expand what was formerly a<br />
narrow and neglected bilateral relationship into one where<br />
we are developing co-operation in areas as diverse as trade<br />
and commerce, fisheries, human contacts and the environment.<br />
Premier Ryzhkov's visit provides a timely occasion to<br />
discuss and formalise developments in these areas. It will<br />
also allow uIS to examine opportunities for further expanding<br />
the economtic dimension of our relationship.<br />
Importantly, Premier Ryzhkov visits at a time when we are<br />
seeing dramatic and far reaching change in many parts of the<br />
world. The program of reform initiated by Soviet President Mikhail<br />
Gorbachev has brought about many positive and fundamental<br />
changes in the international. scene. Nowhere have thesa been<br />
more dramatically illustrated than in Europe, where the Iron<br />
Curtain of di~ vision is crumbling in the face of popular<br />
pressure for reform and unity. We have also seen the Soviet.<br />
Union and the United States co-operate in seeking to resolve<br />
long-standing regional conflicts such as those in Angola and<br />
Afghanistan, and in bringing about important progress on<br />
disarmament. I will1. pursue with Premier Ryzhicov these various<br />
international developments, as well. as issues of importance<br />
to our immediate region. 1 will also discuss the reforms<br />
1-hat have been put into place in the Soviet Union since I<br />
last spoke to Soviet leaders, including President Gorbachev,<br />
duting my last visit to Moscow in 1987. 11 1_ 8 I </p>
