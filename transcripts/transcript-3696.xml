PRIME MINISTER'S INTERVIEW WITH CHANNEL 10, AT TARCOOLA<br />
12.4.1975<br />
A. This is the biggest railway project which has been undertaken<br />
in Australia since the Fisher Labor government commenced the East/<br />
West Railway in 1912, but I think the significance of this occasion<br />
doesn't just depend on commencing this very large project<br />
$ 100 million, 830 kilometers long from the East/ West Railway here<br />
at Tarcoola up to Alice Springs. Sure, it'll be important for the<br />
pastoral and mineral and tourist industries in the whole of Central<br />
Australia. But in this week there have been several very important<br />
things happen. On Wednesday, my colleague Mr. Jones, the Minister<br />
for Transport, was able to table in the House of Representatives<br />
the terms of the Agreement under which the Commonwealth Railways<br />
acquire the South Australian Railways, the and on Thursday<br />
night Mr. Jones brought in~ a Bill to establish the Interstate<br />
Commission, which is mentioned in the Constitution and is designed<br />
to co-ordinate transport systems throughout the continent. So it<br />
is a very big week.<br />
Q. Do you eventually hope Sir that the line will go all the way<br />
through to Darwin?<br />
A. That will depend on the economic need for it, certainly.<br />
The Centre requires a regular traffic means, and as you know, only<br />
two years ago the existing railway to Alice Springs was out of<br />
service through floods for nine weeks. So it just became crucial<br />
to have an all weather railway and a railway, moreover, which was<br />
part of a national system, and of international standard.<br />
Q. Is it going to speed up the development of the Territory greatly?<br />
A. I feel certain it will pastoral, mineral, tourist industries<br />
all depend on a dependable form of transport and this will be such<br />
a form.<br />
A. Getting back to the take-over of the South Australian Railways,<br />
will there be a great change in the service once the Commonwealth<br />
takes over the South Australian Railways?<br />
Q. I believe that now the Australian Government has acquired the<br />
South Australian Railways, they will be able to have the amount of<br />
capital which they require. Any modern railway, modern because it<br />
has good rolling stock and a good signalling system, can be a good<br />
economic enterprise. There is nothing to compare with railways in<br />
long distance travel, and the tragedy has been that the Australian<br />
State railways have never been given enough capital since the War<br />
to provide proper rolling stock and proper signalling systems.<br />
Now the Australian Government has greater financial resources than<br />
the State Governments and just after the War the Chifley Labor<br />
Government placed orders completely to re-equip this East/ West<br />
Railway. And in the early fifties it became the first railway in<br />
r, e </p>
<p>Australia which had all its locomotives diesels, which had all<br />
its carriages air conditioned and which had all its trucks running<br />
with bogies, and accordingly it became a very fast, safe,<br />
dependable and in fact profitable service. Now I think by<br />
amalgamating the Commonwealth Railways and the South Australian<br />
Railways we will see that the whole of the core of the Australian<br />
railway system in national terms is modernised, because this<br />
railway system works with those of Victoria, New South Wales<br />
and Western Australia direct. It's central to the whole nation.<br />
Q. South Australian Railways are running at quite a loss at the<br />
moment. Do you feel you will be able to overcome that now?<br />
A. We believe that the non-metropolitan railways which are the<br />
ones which the Australian Government is acquiring through the<br />
new A. N. R. will with the new equipment, which will become available,<br />
become an economic proposition.<br />
Thank you very much. </p>
