    <content><![CDATA[<p>All who knew the Hon Michael MacKellar AM will mourn his passing.</p>
<p>Michael MacKellar was Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1975-1979) and Minister for Health (1979-1982) in the Fraser Government.</p>
<p>As Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, he oversaw the placement of tens of thousands of Vietnamese who were fleeing communism.  </p>
<p>The positive influence on our country of the Vietnamese who arrived under his watch and their descendants is his legacy.</p>
<p>Michael MacKellar was my predecessor as Member for Warringah and held the seat for a record 25 years. </p>
<p>When I became Member for Warringah in 1994, I was aware of the big shoes I had to fill.</p>
<p>Mike made friends easily.  He had a natural charm and a strong intellect.  He stood for the humane and the decent.</p>
<p>Mike’s success in public life was a reflection of his capacity to find common ground.</p>
<p>He was also a natural optimist.  In January, when we last caught up, Mike was spritely and engaged, despite his illness.</p>
<p>Mike will be missed.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Government – as well as the people of Warringah – I extend my sympathies to his partner Pamela as well as his children, Cameron, Duncan and Maggie and his grandchildren.</p>
