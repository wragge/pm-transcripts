PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 20 AUGUST 1991<br />
In the context of the Budget, it is appropriate that the<br />
Government announce the agreements reached with the ACTU at our<br />
meeting last Thursday.<br />
1, together with the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and the<br />
Minister f or Industrial Relations, met the leadership of the ACTU<br />
to discuss a range of issues related to economic policy and the<br />
future of the wages system.<br />
We reached specific understandings on superannuation and wages<br />
outcomes. These are recorded in the Attachment to this release.<br />
Further consultations are taking. place between us on the future<br />
of the wages system as part of our preparation of submissions for<br />
the forthcoming review of the National Wage Case principles.<br />
The Government and the trade union movement are committed to<br />
achieving greater flexibility and decentralisation in the wages<br />
system through the introduction of productivity-based, enterprise<br />
bargaining. This is an essential element in our strategy to make<br />
the Australian economy internationally competitive.<br />
As we move in this direction, aggregate wage outcomes will<br />
necessarily become less certain, depending on the extent of<br />
workplace bargaining based on -achieved productivity. In this<br />
difficult transition, the close relationship this Government<br />
enjoys with the trade union movement will be vital in containing<br />
inflationary pressures and ensuring that real productivity gains<br />
are secured.<br />
04r joint commitment to work towards an aggregate wage outcome in<br />
the order of 5 per cent for 1991-92 recognises the uncertainties<br />
but maintains the parties' commitment to the orderly evolution of<br />
the wages system.<br />
To finalise the Budget estimates, we have had to settle on a<br />
particular figure for National Accounts based average weekly<br />
earnings for 1991-92. The Government has adopted the figure of 4<br />
1/ 2 per cent as the most app~ ropriate for these purposes.<br />
The trade union movement has confirmed its commitment to join the<br />
Government in working to make low inflation a permanent feature<br />
Of the Australian economy, recognising that its members have<br />
nothing to gain from a return to higher rates of inflation.<br />
These agreements deliver the major outstanding element of Accord<br />
VI, while affirming our commnitment to continue to work together<br />
to improve the performance-of the economy and ensure it delivers<br />
benefits to all Australians. 739 </p>
<p>Attachment<br />
Agreemkent Between The Government And The ACTU<br />
Wages outcomes<br />
The more devolved wages system must necessarily involve a<br />
degree of uncertainty in assessing the aggregate wage<br />
outcome depending as it does on the extent of workplace<br />
bargaining based on achieved productivity.<br />
The parties agree to work towards an aggregate wage outcome<br />
in the order of 5 per cent for 1991-92. The Government for<br />
its part believes there is the prospect of the aggregate<br />
outcome coming in somewhat below this figure.<br />
In respect of 1992-93 and future years, the parties agree to<br />
work towards wage outcomes consistent with keeping<br />
Australia's inflation at levels comparable with those of our<br />
major trading partners.<br />
Superannuation As part of its retirement incomes policy, the Government<br />
will legislate for the phased implementation of a minimum<br />
level of employer superannuation support of 9 per cent by<br />
the year 2000.<br />
From 1 July 1992, subject to a threshold that omits small<br />
payments and very short-term employment, the minimum level<br />
will be: 5 per cent of ordinary time earnings for employees<br />
of employers who have annual payrolls larger than<br />
$ 500,000; and<br />
3 per cent of ordinary time earnings for other<br />
employees.<br />
The Government will provide for the gradual increase in the<br />
prescribed level of superannuation support having regard to<br />
the schedule published in the 1991-92 Budget Statements.<br />
This will form the basis for the broader community<br />
discussion on the implementation of these measures.<br />
Improvements in superannuation will be taken into account in<br />
future Accord negotiations.<br />
Consideration will later be given to ways, using employee<br />
contributions and tax cuts, of increasing the minimum level<br />
of superannuation support to 12 per cent by the year 2000.<br />
