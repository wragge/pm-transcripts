    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that His Excellency the Governor-General has accepted my recommendation that Mr Ken Matthews be appointed as Secretary to the Department of Transport and Regional Services.</p>
<p>Mr Matthews has held the position of Secretary to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry since 1998 and prior to that was a Deputy Secretary in the Department.</p>
<p>From the early 1990s he held a number of senior positions in the then Department of Primary Industries and Energy and in 1997 was convenor of the Wik Task Force in my own Department. Mr Matthews' significant experience in policy areas with a rural and regional focus will be a valuable asset in meeting the challenges of his new position.</p>
<p>Mr Matthews' appointment will be for the period 1 November 1999 until February 2003.</p>
