PRIME MINISTER<br />
E. 9 PROOF ONLY<br />
PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW, REGIONAL TV, 25 SEPTEMBER 1985<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you been speaking to Mr Hayden at all this<br />
morning? PM: NOt this morning, no.<br />
JOURNALIST: Or last night at all?<br />
PM: Oh, I could have been.<br />
JOURNALIST: What about the possibility of a Cabinet re-shuffle?<br />
PM: Not<br />
JOURNALIST: what about a domestic portfolio for Mr Hayden?<br />
PM: No, look. I love the Australian political media, as you know.<br />
They are delightful people. They have this tendency which, sort of,<br />
sparks up occasionally to beat-up, is the phrase. And this is a<br />
real beat-up.<br />
O'NEILL: yesterday that there would be a re-shuffle.<br />
PM: I was talking about now. Well, it's not on.<br />
O'NEILL: The re-shuffle is still on by the end of the year?<br />
PM: It may be-I mean, the question that annoys me that<br />
because you get asked a question here you get a great beat-up<br />
about re-shuffle. And I'm saying it is not on now. I may be<br />
looking at it at the end of the year, but I'm just not going to<br />
have a situation where because I respond to a question from a<br />
regional person who has got an interest in Mr Hayden, and I say,<br />
well yes, I might be looking at it. Then I get faced with this<br />
beat-up story about, you know, re-shuffle.<br />
O'NEILL: I just wanted to clarify it.<br />
PM: Yes, I know. I wasn't having a go at you, but that is my<br />
reaction. mA.,' </p>
<p>HARVEY: So it's r posibilityf not a probability?<br />
PM: Yes, it is something that I would think any Prime Minister<br />
at the end of the year in reviewing what has happened, will<br />
look at. And if the situation were there that there were a<br />
press ' ing desire on the part of someone, and I'm not saying there<br />
is on the part of Mr Hayden I want to make it quite clear<br />
there is no pressure or suggestion from Mr Hayden about this<br />
in any sense at all before me. And I put it toughly like that<br />
because I think people do over-react a bit:. </p>
