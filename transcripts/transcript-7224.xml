PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 25 SEPTEMBER 1987<br />
I am very shocked and saddened at the news of a second coup<br />
by the Army under Colonel Rabuka in Fiji. I believe all<br />
Australians will share this reaction.<br />
The informuation available so far is incomplete. But it is<br />
clear that the Army has taken over newspapers and radio<br />
stations and closed them down, that Suva is effectively<br />
under military control and that Colonel Rabuka, as he said<br />
on the radio in Fiji, has moved to prevent the formation of<br />
a bipartisan Government. He has said that he will move<br />
quickly to introduce Constitutional change in Fiji.<br />
What this amounts to is that the Army in Fiji has decided to<br />
abort, through the use of force in an utterly illegitimate<br />
way, the formation of a Government which, as I said in<br />
Parliament yesterday, would have represented a major step<br />
forward in resolving the problems of Fiji. That the Army<br />
has done so, is, from Australia's point of view, deplorable.<br />
The Australian Government has attempted to support and<br />
encourage the efforts of the Governor-General and other<br />
moderate leaders in Fiji in overcoming an extremely<br />
difficult problem already created for Fiji by the first<br />
coup. It is those'leaders in Fiji who are striving to<br />
restore democratic government in Fiji who have our support.<br />
We condemn tho: se who have opposed those efforts.<br />
We are well aware of the complexities of Fiji society and<br />
the delicate balance needed to ensure tnat the racial<br />
communities in Fiji feel secure and are accorded their<br />
legitimate role and rights. An action of the kind which has<br />
occurred today threatens to shatter this situation and the<br />
imposition of Constitutional arrangements which amount to<br />
anti-democratic oppression of a particular community could<br />
not be accepted.<br />
It is to be hoped that Rabuka's behaviour in defying the<br />
Governor-General arid the country's political leadership will<br />
not be tolerated and that th~ s latest ccup will be quickly<br />
ended and its leaders controlled and brought to justice.<br />
The Government will be urgently reviewing policy towards<br />
Fiji in the light of this development and consulting with<br />
other interested countries including those in the South<br />
Pacific. I. 4<br />

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has advised<br />
against any inessential travel to Fiji.<br />
Despite the interruption of communications in Fiji,<br />
effective contact is being maintained with the High<br />
Commission and all necessary steps will be taken to protect<br />
Australian nationals and Australian interests. O( T. 4 </p>
