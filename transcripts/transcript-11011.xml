<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>....[tape starts] deliver low unemployment in this country as the</p>
<p> Federal Government.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So the Carr Government can't claim [inaudible].....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, the strong economy in this State is overwhelmingly due to the</p>
<p> policies that we have followed over the last three years. And at every</p>
<p> turn, Mr Carr and Mr Beazley have tried to stop us doing the very</p>
<p> things that have now given us the prosperity and the jobs growth that</p>
<p> Mr Carr wants to skite about.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How do you see the Coalition campaign going here in New South Wales?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it's going very well. I think the Labor Party has got</p>
<p> very smug. I notice this morning that Mr Wran was luxuriating in predictions.</p>
<p> But one thing I have understood very well about the Australian people</p>
<p> is that they don't like being taken for granted and when political</p>
<p> parties start to say they are going to bolt it in or they are going</p>
<p> to win by a country mile or it's all over bar the shouting, the</p>
<p> disposition of the Australian electorate is to take it back a peg</p>
<p> or two. And I think this is a tough campaign but I think the campaign</p>
<p> is going very well for the Coalition. The last two weeks will be absolutely</p>
<p> critical and I think the Coalition's prospects are extremely</p>
<p> good. And I think Kerry has run an excellent campaign and the next</p>
<p> two weeks are really going to be fascinating and so far from predictions</p>
<p> of landslide Labor victories, I think it will be a very tight result.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So what advice have you given Mrs Chikarovski?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, you know what it's like in politics, you chat.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible] in the polls what do you say to that? In the opinion polls....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you know the stock political response to any questions about</p>
<p> opinion polls.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
