October 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JOHN STANLEY RADIO 2UE<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
STANLEY:<br />
John Howard, John Moore, do you think he should be sacked?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No I don't, he's not breached the guidelines.<br />
STANLEY: You've just heard what Kim Beazley said.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It was a very, very poor case. I mean the guidelines say that you can't have interests in<br />
companies which operate in your area of portfolio responsibility. Now, the comnpany<br />
that Moore has an interest in is not an industrial company, it's not a tourist company, it<br />
may have small holdings of shares in other companies. But what Kim Beazley is really<br />
saying is that anybody who's got a superannuation policy with the AMP is engaging in<br />
the commercial activities of every company in which the AMP holds an interest. Now,<br />
that is palpable nonsense. On that basis nobody who's got a superannuation<br />
entitlement, and most members of Parliament could be in that situation, have got any<br />
right at all. I mean, any Commonwealth public servant who's got money invested in<br />
the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund that in turn invest in hundreds of companies,<br />
is that Commonwealth public servant fixed with knowledge of the individual asset<br />
holdings of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund at any given time. I mean.. I'm<br />
afraid Mr Beazley has sort of misunderstood the way in which these things operate.<br />
Could I just make one very salient point that nobody has made a cent at the expense of<br />
the taxpayer out of any of this. There's been no allegation of dishonesty or<br />
4~ 4 Go Q&amp; l Iq -1 P I. </p>
<p>Fax from impropriety. There's been no allegation that anybody has helped themselves, has taken<br />
advantage of their position. Neither Brian Gibson nor Jim Short, in a month of<br />
Sundays, has taken anybody down. Both of them have been forced to leave the<br />
Ministry or in the case of Brian Gibson, cease as a Parliamentary Secretary not<br />
because of any misleading of Parliament intentionally, not because of any wrong doing,<br />
simply because they were in technical default of the rules because they breached the<br />
requirement that there must be no appearance of a conflict of interest. I mean, Jim.<br />
Short held shares in the ANZ Bank and there are tens of thousands of shareholders of<br />
the ANZ Bank. I mean, he took that routine decision to give a subsidiary of the bank a<br />
banking licence. He wasn't helping himself to anything. In the same way Brian Gibson<br />
is a shareholder with his wife and it's their superannuation from his previous business<br />
activities shareholder with his wife in the holding company of a company that he<br />
granted a futures exemption to. I mean, there's been no personal gain of any<br />
description. But they were technically in breach and in those circumstances there was<br />
an apparent conflict of interest they had to go. I'm very sorry about that, but they<br />
are the rules and they have been applied might I say, in the case of my government, a<br />
lot more toughly than they have been applied in the past.<br />
STANLEY: I'm just a bit confused about Mr Moore because didn't Mr Moore say, I think only<br />
yesterday he said that he was going to divest himself of these shares.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes but the point I'm making is he's decided to do that for more abundant caution and<br />
not because the rules require divestiture. Look, I don't have any shares. I have not<br />
had shares since I entered ministerial politics ion 1976 20 years ago. There's nothing<br />
in the guidelines that say I can't have them but I've just chosen not to have them. I<br />
just find it easier but I've got no right to say to people who don't own real estate, who<br />
don't own farms, who don't own flats, apartments, who don't invest in that fashion,<br />
I've got no right to say to them that under no circumstances can you have shares. You<br />
see, at the moment you can have a farim, you can have a block of units and you can<br />
negatively gear it and I am quite sure members of the former government did that. I<br />
think the former Prime Minister at one stage owned a couple of properties. Now I'm<br />
not criticising him for that. I'm just pointing it out and he may have, I don't know<br />
whether he got any investment income from it or not. If he didn't well, I don't make<br />
the allegation, but the point I'm simply making, John, is that not everybody chooses to<br />
sort of have the rather hermit existence that I did in relation to shares.<br />
Now people can have shares and what I've now said is that I want to look at the<br />
concept of a blind trust and a blind trust is basicaly that if you've got an investment<br />
like shares, when you go into politics, you go into the Ministry, you hand over the<br />
control of it to some trustees. They make decisions, not on your behalf but one hopes<br />
prudently and when you leave the Ministry you take back control and you don't know<br />
what is happening and in that way you can keep your asset but you can be at arm's<br />
length from it. Now this has worked very well in the United States. I think it works in<br />
the United Kingdom as well and it will I think, you know, prevent the situation arising<br />

<p>Fax from 15/ 10/ 96 19: 31 Pg: 3<br />
where we are literally going to scare people who have share investments out of going<br />
into politics.<br />
STANLEY:<br />
Does that mean the existing guidelines really now are almost in limbo while this new<br />
system is worked out?<br />
PREME MINISTER:<br />
No, no, no they're not in limbo and it's quite wrong of Mr Beazley to say that we're<br />
scrapping them, They've been in operation now effectively for about 20 years. The<br />
world has changed a lot in 20 years. Those guidelines were sort of based on a report<br />
done by the late Sir Nigel Bowen, the former Chief Justice of the Federal Court and<br />
they were done in 1979.<br />
STANLEY: You're still happy with those guidelines now?<br />
PRIE MINISTER:<br />
Many of them, yes I am, and I've applied them and they've been very tough, very, very<br />
tough indeed on two very decent men who've done nothing wrong. They have not<br />
paid enough attention to the detail of those guidelines. Neither of them has behaved<br />
dishonestly, neither of them has made a cent.<br />
STANLEYI think that's generally accepted but..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
They are as honest as the day...<br />
STANLEY: yeahL PRIME MINISTER:-<br />
They were inadvertent, they were careless. They didn't pay enough attention to the<br />
guidelines and each of them has paid a very heavy price.<br />
STANLEY: In both instances, they discovered the problem by going through their own records. 3 </p>
<p>Fax from La<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I mean, what can you do? I mean...<br />
STANLEY: Are you concerned that other Ministers might be doing similar searches now?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, so be it. I'm not frightened. I'm not frightened of the consequences of the<br />
application of a standard that I've laid down. I mean, I can think of, I mean, talk about<br />
ministerial standards, I don't want to talk about the other side but I think if you look at<br />
what I've done compared with what a number of former Prime Ministers have done,<br />
you will see that we've imposed I mean, a lot of people are saying to me, John,<br />
you're too tough. A lot of people are saying that this is an unreasonable, unreal<br />
standard. Now I don't think it is but I do want to look at this blind trust concept and it<br />
may be that we can add that to the existing guidelines because I don't want a situation<br />
where people that have got decent share portfolios are frightened to go into politics.<br />
STANLEY:<br />
Has this been your worst week since the election politicay?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, 1, it's not been a good week. I don't know whether I'd quite put it like that. I<br />
mean, you have some ups and downs in politics, of course you do, and if anybody<br />
imagined that the new Government was not going to have the odd glitch, then they're<br />
not real. They ought to get real. Of course you have glitches but we've maintained a<br />
standard. If anything, people will think that these people have paid a very high price<br />
for what was a technical glitch and nothing more. I mean, they haven't benefited.<br />
They haven't deceived anybody. They haven't consciously set out to cheat.<br />
STANLEY: Exactly, but you are confident that your other Ministers are now checking to make<br />
sure that they're flully in tune with the guidelines?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I would have thought that after the experience of the last week that everybody who is<br />
the least bit remotely connected with any Minister is checking everything.<br />
STANLEY: Okay. John Howard, thank you for your time.<br />
