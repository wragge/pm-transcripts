PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. 3. KEATING MP<br />
LAUNCH OF P40 KITTYHAWK PUBLIC DISPLAY, AUSTRALIAN WAR<br />
MEMORIAL, CANBERRA 26 AUGUST<br />
Dame Beryl Beaurepaire and members of the Council of the<br />
Australian War Memorial, my Cabinet Colleague Ben<br />
Humphreys and other parliamentary colleagues, veterans of<br />
the Milne Bay campaign, representatives of the veterans<br />
organisations, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
Thank you, Dame Beryl, for your warm welcome.<br />
I am a great admirer of the Australian War Memorial it<br />
is one of the great public institutions of Australia.<br />
I'm very pleased that my first official function here<br />
should take place on such an important anniversary, and<br />
that I should be celebrating with you a marvellous<br />
addition to the national collection.<br />
There is a great romance attached to the Kittyhawk.<br />
World War II invested them with certain almost humancharacteristics.<br />
They were sturdy, reliable fighters.<br />
Brave planes.<br />
They earned that reputation in a number of theatres,<br />
Milne Bay among them.<br />
The one we are about to inspect is a pedigreed<br />
representative of the breed it has a substantial and<br />
documented history of service with the RAAF, including<br />
service in the Battle of Milne Bay.<br />
It was flown at Milne Bay by puster Brow who is with us<br />
today. Later it was flown in New Guinea by-Wilf Arthur<br />
whose exploits in it-earned him the DFC. Mr Arthur is<br />
also here today.<br />
This plane will put visitors in touch with one of<br />
Australia's most important battles a battle which truly<br />
helped to turn the tide against the Japanese advance and<br />
secure victory in the battle for Australia.<br />
All nations commemorate their war dead. But the<br />
Australian War Memorial commemorates them quite uniquely.<br />
1576 it<br />

<p>Here are recorded the names of all servicemen and women<br />
who gave their lives for Australia.<br />
To walk in the Memorial's courtyard is a sombre<br />
experience yet it is one that I think every Australian<br />
should make.<br />
It is not an easy thing to comprehend the meaning of war<br />
in Australia's history.<br />
This Memorial testifies to enormous sacrifice. It also<br />
testifies to a great tragedy.<br />
It reminds us both of heroism and incredible folly.<br />
There are 60,00 names on the first World War roll.<br />
That is 60,000 young men and women who gave their lives.<br />
But we can only begin to comprehend the loss to a young<br />
nation when we know that they come from a force of just<br />
300,000 and a population of just over 4 million.<br />
The calamity of World War I can never be measured, but I<br />
know that from its inception, and the great efforts of<br />
its founders, Charles Bean and John Treloar, the<br />
Australian War Memorial has helped us get it in<br />
perspective. There is more than a list of names here.<br />
The Memorial holds records which allow us to see these<br />
young men and women in a personal light with the same<br />
aspirations and hopes that we all share; with a love of<br />
country from which we all can learn; with a hope for the<br />
future that was denied to them, but which we have a duty<br />
and a reason to maintain.<br />
The Memorial contains the story of Australia at war the<br />
story of the campaigns themselves, so vividly portrayed<br />
in the galleries.<br />
There are soldiers' uniforms here still encrusted with<br />
the mud of the battlefields of France, still speaking to<br />
us of the terrible winters that the first AIF endured.<br />
The Museum also contains, I understand, such icons of the<br />
national story as the boats used at Gallipoli to ferry<br />
Australian troops ashore.<br />
I gather that these boats and other large objects will<br />
soon be accessible to the public at the storage and<br />
display facility at Mitchell, for which, I am pleased to<br />
say, funding was provided in the Budget.<br />
I intend to see them one day. 1577 </p>
<p>3<br />
This is truly a people's memorial.<br />
Yet I think it can be reasonably said that the Australian<br />
War Memorial bore the marks of its origins a Memorial<br />
to the men and women of 1914-18 and there was not<br />
sufficient attention paid to the Second World War and<br />
subsequent wars.<br />
It was not until 1971 that extensions were completed to<br />
allow the Memorial to tell the story of those who served<br />
in World War II.<br />
I realise that because space had been limited for so long<br />
there was not the same urgency in collecting as there had<br />
been during and after World War I.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
I think you will know that I am keen to see that the<br />
story of World War II, and in particular the Pacific War,<br />
is told to Australians with the same intensity and<br />
understanding that characterised our telling of the<br />
legends of Gallipoli, France and Palestine.<br />
For this reason I hope that we will be able to find the<br />
means of helping the Memorial develop its Pacific War<br />
Gallery. The 50th Anniversary of the key battles and campaigns of<br />
the Pacific War has given us an opportunity to remind<br />
Australians of the risk the nation faced in 1942, and the<br />
debt they owe those men and women who defended it and I<br />
mean both on the battlefield and of f it.<br />
At Darwin and in New Guinea, Australians lost their lives<br />
turning back the enemy.<br />
The crucial battles of the Coral Sea and Midway, and of<br />
Milne Bay and Kokoda made sure that Australia would not<br />
be isolated and defenceless, but rather the crucial base<br />
from which the Allies would drive back the Japanese.<br />
Already this year it has been my privilege to take part<br />
in ceremonies commemorating the battles at Darwin, the<br />
Coral Sea, Kokoda and other places in New Guinea.<br />
I count my visits to the memorials to Australian soldiers<br />
in these places among the most moving experiences of my<br />
public life.<br />
I had hoped to visit Milne Bay but this proved to be<br />
impossible it seems I would I have needed a Kittyhawk<br />
to get there.<br />
Milne Bay is perhaps the most significant battle of all.<br />
1578 </p>
<p>Here, a combined operation of the three Australian<br />
services resisted and repelled a powerful Japanese force,<br />
inflicting on the Japanese army its first defeat on land<br />
since Pearl Harbour.<br />
The battle played a major part in thwarting Japanese<br />
attempts to take Port Moresby.<br />
Yet despite its importance in the defence of Australia,<br />
despite the bravery and skill and sacrifice of the<br />
Australians who fought there, it is a battle of which few<br />
Australians have any knowledge.<br />
The acquisition of this aircraft and the modest display<br />
associated with it along with the dedication of the<br />
Memorial's staff led by Brendan Kelson and Michael<br />
McKernan will no doubt help to enlarge our<br />
understanding of the Battle of Milne Bay, and through it<br />
the battle for Australia.<br />
It will also reclaim for those who fought there some of<br />
the recognition they richly deserve.<br />
Those of you who served and are present with us today may<br />
not seek this honour, but it is yours.<br />
Australia owes you a debt of gratitude. It owes those who<br />
fell there a debt that can never be repaid.<br />
I think we should all be grateful to the Memorial for<br />
having the vision and the will to significantly improve<br />
the way the story of Milne Bay will be told.<br />
The experience of war lives on to haunt generations of<br />
Australians who did not themselves take part. I know<br />
this from my own family's experience.<br />
By telling the story and paying due tribute, the<br />
Australian War Memorial has played an indispensable role<br />
in helping those who came after to understand.<br />
In its way it makes us all part of the story, and that is<br />
an essential comfort to any nation.<br />
The Memorial has done Australia a great service.<br />
So, Dame Beryl, I congratulate you, the Council and the<br />
Staff. This aeroplane will help tell the story of the defence of<br />
Australia in 1942.<br />
It will remind us of the debt we owe to those who fought<br />
and died.<br />
And it will ensure that their names will live forever.<br />
Thank you all for coming. 1 57 9 </p>
