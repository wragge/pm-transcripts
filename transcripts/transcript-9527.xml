TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
SPEECH AT PRESENTATION OF A REPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT ON<br />
NATIVE TITLE SOCIAL JUSTICE MEASURES ' RECOGNITION, RIGHTS<br />
AND REFORM", MURAL HALL, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 27 MARCH 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
One of the things that very greatly pleases me about receiving this is not so<br />
much for every detail that is written here, but for the fact that we are seeing<br />
the public manifestation of the esteem that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander people hold for themselves, have always held for themselves, but<br />
which in other times when that sense of justice and sense of decency in the<br />
country has not focussed on their concerns such a report like this would<br />
never have appeared.<br />
It is a great pleasure to me that Lois O'Donoghue is presenting it to me as<br />
head of the government because in this modern world today and as in any<br />
complex society, leadership is always everything and in the complex<br />
discussion over the High Court decision, it was Lois O'Donoghue who<br />
showed that leadership in pulling together that group of people who<br />
negotiated with the Government. I remember saying to her in one of these<br />
early meetings that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community must<br />
learn to negotiate. In saying that I was saying they must regard themselves<br />
as a force of such power that they are capable of negotiating and<br />
understanding what negotiation means. It means understanding what your<br />
core interests are and what is not in your core interest and that which you can<br />
see in the other persons point of view and trade away to come to a<br />
negotiated settlement or arrangement which reflects the broad interests and<br />
doesn't compromise the specific interest.<br />
That leadership has, I think, been reflected in the peak Aboriginal and<br />
Islander bodies and as a consequence we, together, wrote a very effective<br />
Bill with Native Title. It was a great victory for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander people and for social democracy in this country when the High Court<br />
held its validity seven judges to nothing a couple of weeks ago. And then<br />
on its heels, of course, we bailed up the Opposition with their manipulative<br />
approach in the Senate to try to destroy the integrity of the Land Fund Bill<br />
and despite the Leader of the Opposition's cockiness when faced with the </p>
<p>prospect of an early poll he caved in and passed it. So, we got the double of<br />
the century in a week. Seven to zero on native title and the Land Fund Bill.<br />
These are things which, I think, have made a great difference to the ambient<br />
climate out there in the community. I said here a week ago when Pat Dodson<br />
was presenting the Report of the Aboriginal Reconciliation Council that I think<br />
Mabo and the land fund, that the passage of Mabo has made Australians feel<br />
good about themselves. They know a right thing has been done. A just thing<br />
has been done and it has reduced racism. It has reduced racism. I think now<br />
that the wind behind the sails of the reconciliation council is part of that wind<br />
and it is the old thing: one good act begets, one good influence begets<br />
another. And, we are seeing with now a lot of horse power and much pride<br />
the presentation of that Report and similarly here today with this Report<br />
' Recognition, Rights and Reforms A Report to the Government on Native<br />
Title Social Justice Measures'.<br />
These were proposed when it was agreed amongst us, the Government and<br />
those Aboriginal people who we were negotiating with over Mabo, to say ' well<br />
look, these things shouldn't come down from on high, they shouldn't simply<br />
come from a group of representatives, but rather come from a broad basis of<br />
consultation.' I think ATSIC and the Aboriginal Reconciliation Council have<br />
gone out and done those things and ATSIC has certainly done it here by<br />
consulting with Aboriginal people around the country. The result is this and I<br />
promise you this Lois that the Government will consider it, we will look<br />
through it, we will follow the threads of the policy we have been following<br />
which says that Australia will never be one nation while ever the Aboriginal<br />
and Torres Strait Islander people are one apart from the rest of us.<br />
That is our policy and the things that fall within that, that we can get support<br />
for and that we can do we will do. If there is more in this than we can digest<br />
we will certainly be digesting that which we can and every bit will make<br />
progress along the way.<br />
Now, Lois said something important which shouldn't go above peoples heads<br />
and, I think, in a sense I tried to repeat that a week ago, the same thought.<br />
That is, what we are talking about here, about support for Aboriginal and<br />
Torres Strait Islander people, is rights not welfare and this is about rights.<br />
Social justice is about rights as well as it is about specific things. We are<br />
now talking about these intractable problems of health and housing and what<br />
we need is specific effective action. A week or so ago with Pat Dodson here I<br />
talked about some of the things we could do to be effective and when we get<br />
progress we get the snow ball affect. Just as we did with Mabo, we will get it<br />
with the other things and we do, as you say Lois, need to bring the States in<br />
and we need to bring local government in because the Commonwealth,<br />
through ATSIC, can't solve all the problems of the environmental situation<br />
with Aboriginal communities or environmental health, we can do things about<br />
direct health. I think the main thing is to get the generation of Aboriginal<br />
people out of the mind set. That some how it's welfare: it is a right, but we<br />
need to do it effectively and we need to do it together. </p>
<p>One of the lessons that came to me from the Cape York Health Council and<br />
my visit to Hopevale was that there, the community on the Cape, have<br />
regarded a commitment repairing the problem of health as needing a<br />
commitment by them to participate in the policies. Not just something that<br />
comes from outside, but something they are part of and without them being<br />
part of it, just the same with the non-Aboriginal community in this country,<br />
there is no way that their health can be attended to unless they are part of the<br />
solution and I think they need to be there as well.<br />
So, I want to guarantee that the next generations of Aboriginal and Torres<br />
Strait Islander people are not victims and are not treated as victims, that<br />
rather they are there to see this change, this shift in moral and to see that<br />
many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people assert their culture and<br />
their rights and their standings and determine not to be victims and to get out<br />
there and play a role in this community. I think that is happening and this is<br />
what this is about.<br />
I noticed in today's press, of course, with the by-election result in the ACT<br />
and elsewhere we have got all the pundits giving us the value of their views.<br />
One of the views I notice from one of them today is that Mabo and Aboriginal<br />
rights is a distraction. The republic is a distraction. Our identity is a<br />
distraction. It is really down to the grind stone in the mortgage and nothing<br />
else. Well, the person who wrote this, just as an example, I said to this<br />
person after the 1993 election ' how did you get it so wrong, how couldn't you<br />
pick the trends?' And the result was ' oh, that is what Hoggie told us. That's<br />
what Hoggie said to us.' Not that we are paid to think and to absorb the<br />
culture and to write, but no, like Mr Midnight, that is what Hoggie dropped in<br />
their ears. That Labor had no chance of winning and that the pundits should<br />
be clever and write us off.<br />
Now, one of them is today saying ' look, the Prime Minster's obsessions with<br />
the interests of Aboriginal and Islander people is a distraction'. They couldn't<br />
be more wrong, couldn't be further from the truth. That couldn't be further<br />
from the truth than that view because unless Australia understands that it<br />
succeeds as a society that is its economy and its community go together as<br />
a society unless all that happens together then there is little prospect of us<br />
reaping the economic rewards that bind all this together and getting those<br />
social commitments we need, whether it be from the broad workforce or from<br />
the Aboriginal community or where ever.<br />
So, let's say this. Three years ago, I think I am probably right in saying this<br />
Lois, we wouldn't have seen this Report. While the esteem was there always<br />
with the indigenous community about themselves and their indignation was<br />
there we wouldn't have seen this Report. It has come because the<br />
community has basically decided that these wrongs are going to be set right<br />
and these historic wrongs are going to be set right, to the extend that we can<br />
ever set them right, but at least acknowledge that the wrongs have taken<br />
place and seek to set them right. And, to follow the land change through<br />
which is, as you say, central to the future of indigenous people, with this<br />
Report which goes beyond that to look at a broader articulation of rights. I </p>
<p>4<br />
think that is what this means. That is what the Report which Pat Dodson<br />
presented to the Government means. It is what I think the Australian<br />
community means and it does feel better about itself and it does meet the<br />
notion of multi-culturalism in its broader sense have more meaning when the<br />
nation, as a society, decides that our indigenes will be taken to its heart<br />
forever. That is what the Report means and that is why I am so delighted to<br />
receive it.<br />
ends </p>
