PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
RAAF FAIRBAIRN<br />
THURSDAY 18 AUGUST, 1994<br />
PMV: This could be quite a defining moment in the history of the Federation,<br />
but it can only be so if the states embrace the challenge of competition<br />
as outlined by the Hilmer Report. There is a real test here. There is a<br />
Labor government, federal government, going to a, largely, a group of<br />
Liberal-National party states that is, nominally pro-market<br />
governments and saying, " Please embrace the market. We want<br />
you to embrace competition and competition policy." Now, as I say,<br />
this could be a defining moment in the federation but they will have to<br />
grasp it. And, the federation is not a device which is about<br />
aggrandising the status of the states. The federation was an event<br />
which took place to form the nation so there can't be any notion of the<br />
states hiding behind so-called federal rights or federal imperatives to<br />
turn back what is a central thrust of extending the Trade Practices<br />
legislation to guarantee that all Australians benefit from competition in<br />
states' authorities like electricity, like water, like gas.<br />
So, much can be done here, a great benefit for the Australian people,<br />
a great benefit for Australian business, for Australian competitiveness<br />
but the conservative states will have to grab the notion of<br />
competition in business. So, that's what it is about and there are other<br />
things on the agenda roles and responsibilities, that is the delivery<br />
of programs between the Commonwealth and the states. But, it is<br />
about, principally the Hilmer recommendations for free and fair<br />
competition by the states and their authorities, access by business,<br />
lower prices to Australian consumers and a better go for all Australians<br />
all ' round.<br />
J: Does that mean no compensation for the states, Mr Keating?<br />
PMV: No, it means a discussion about a real regime of putting these<br />
competitive changes in. In other words, the Commonwealth will be in a<br />
real discussion. But, if we have conservative governments trying to<br />
hide behind state parochialism, on the basis that they don't want </p>
<p>competition, while they are telling the rest of us we should be<br />
embracing the market, and they are pro business... They are pro<br />
business but if they show any problems about the embrace of business<br />
and competition well, then, of course, this moment will be lost.<br />
J: They want compensation, how far are you prepared to compromise on<br />
that?<br />
PM: Well, we want competition, that's what we want. What they want will<br />
be about what makes the deal go around.<br />
J: The Commonwealth games and the furore over Arthur Tunstall, your<br />
reaction to that?<br />
PM: Well, I think Mr Tunstall's remarks are to be regretted but, I think he<br />
regretted them, didn't he? I think he has apologised for them and I<br />
think that is appropriate.<br />
J: Are you concerned that Australia's reputation as a sporting nation<br />
could be damaged by these comments?<br />
PM: Well, he's an independent sports administrator and, in a sense, not<br />
representing the Commonwealth government. But, the fact that he has<br />
recanted, I think, is the important point.<br />
ends. </p>
