FOR PRESS: PM. NO. 103/ 1972<br />
COST OF ELECTION PROPOSALS<br />
Statement by the Prime Mlinister, the Rt. Hon.<br />
William McMahon, C. H., M. P.<br />
I was hoping to announce the cost figures of the<br />
Government's new proposals in the Liberal Party Policy Speech<br />
together with costs of the Labor Party proposals on a comparable<br />
basis. This is not possible. In many cases, there is no detail<br />
and no clear basis for costing Labor's proposals. The details of our<br />
proposals on a full year basis are set out below:-<br />
COSTING OF NEW PROPOSALS FULL YEAR BASIS<br />
PROPOSALS MILLION<br />
HOUSING Interest Rate Subsidy<br />
War Service Homes 7<br />
EDUCATION Pre-School<br />
Primary School Libraries<br />
Underprivileged Children<br />

Low-income Families Health Insurance 7-11<br />
Other ( physiotherapy, para-medical,<br />
handicapped children, etc.) 1-3<br />
WELFARE Pensions link with C. P. I. 7r<br />
TRANSPORT Urban Transport<br />
Main Line Railways 32<br />
Other ( Road Safety, Beef Roads) ./ 2 </p>
<p>INDUSTRY Depreciation Allo. wance on Buil ings 8<br />
OTHER Allowance to cover other smaller items<br />
loans for ex-servicemen,<br />
environment) 1<br />
TOTAL 333-349<br />
The above figures do not include expenditure on urban and<br />
regional development. As stated in the Policy Speech, $ 5 million<br />
has been made available to the National Urban and Regional<br />
Development Authority this financial year and Commonwealth<br />
expenditure is expected to rise to the rate of about $ 80 million<br />
a year in the first five years.<br />
These estimates have been checked by the Commonwealth<br />
Departments. They indicate that the total cost of the proposals<br />
would be under $ 350 million on a full year basis.<br />
The Labor Party has made some 90 promises on policy<br />
involving new costs. At this stage it has not been possible to<br />
make cost estimates for the majority because they are altogether<br />
too vague or general in expression. But in some cases, costs can<br />
and have been estimated. Nine out of the 90 promises have been<br />
costed. They have been checked by the relevant Commonwealth<br />
Departments. The total is some $ 1300 million on a full year basis.<br />
Details are:-VILLION<br />
EDUCATION ( full year basis)<br />
Tertiary Education 280<br />
( ii) Abolition of Fees ( from 1974)<br />
( iii) Pro-School Centres and completion of<br />
secondary education 50 at least<br />
HEALTH Insurance 110<br />
PENSIONS Increases<br />
HOUSING Mortgage Interest<br />
PUBLIC SERVICE week<br />
4 weeks' annual leave and other<br />
matters. 90 </p>
<p>TRANSPORT Takeover-of all State railways<br />
annual costs 190<br />
( ii) Upgrading the systems 230<br />
$ 1330 million<br />
A total of over $ 1300 million for thee. costs makes it<br />
plain that the costs of a lot of others coula be very substantial.<br />
There are many others. One example is regional devlomont.<br />
Another is the shipping proosals which are large indeed.<br />
If the Leader of the Opposition likes to give more detail<br />
on his promises, I will have the total cost estimated for him.<br />
Mr Whitlam made a statement on Thursday last in which he<br />
said, " All the proposals I have put and 1r McMahon has put are<br />
within the rope of Commonwealth financial responsibility."<br />
He is right about mine and completely wrong about his own.<br />
Mr Whitlam has said that the money to pay for his proposals<br />
would come f'obm a $ 5,000 million increase in Commonwealth revenue<br />
in the next three years.<br />
There are at least two comments which can be made about<br />
this statement. First, Commonwealth revenue increases without any tax<br />
changes would have beun of the order of $ 1,000 million between<br />
11 and 12 per cent in 1971/ 72 and this year.<br />
On that, the revenue increase over three years could not<br />
approach $ 5,000 million unless inflation ran riot and the tax<br />
burden was substantially increased.<br />
Second, Mr Whitlam has overlooked one fact one<br />
elementary fact the automatic growth of expenditure.<br />
Commonwealth expenditure has also risen by about $ 1,000<br />
million, or 11-12 per cent, in 1971/ 72 and this year. So that the<br />
rises in revenue and exoenditure have been roughly the same.<br />
A high proportion of the increase in expenditure goes to meet<br />
increased wage and other costs.<br />
