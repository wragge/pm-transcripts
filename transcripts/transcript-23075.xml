    <content><![CDATA[<p>I join my fellow Australians in expressing our deepest sympathies to the people of the Philippines in the wake of the terrible loss of life and damage caused by Typhoon Haiyan.</p>
<p>The Australian Government has already offered almost $400,000 for emergency relief supplies, including sleeping mats, mosquito nets, water containers as well as health and hygiene kits to assist those affected by this natural disaster.</p>
<p>Three Australian disaster experts are on the ground providing assistance to the Philippine Government and the United Nations to conduct a rapid needs assessment in the worst affected areas of the country.</p>
<p>I have written to the President of the Philippines, Benigno Aquino III, to pass on our thoughts and prayers to the Philippine people and to offer further disaster support if and when it is needed.</p>
<p>Sadly, a 49 year old Australian man, who had been living in the Philippines, has perished in this tragedy. The Australian Government is providing consular assistance to his family. The Department of Foreign Affairs is continuing to investigate whether more Australians in the Philippines have been affected by Typhoon Haiyan.</p>
<p>Australians who have concerns for the welfare of family and friends in the region, should first attempt to contact them directly.</p>
<p>Those unable to contact friends and family and who hold concerns for their welfare, should call the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on 1300 555 135 or +61 2 6261 3305 from outside Australia.</p>
