ASIAN TOUR 1967 LAOS<br />
SPEECH GIVEN BY TIE PRIME, MINISTER,-MR._ HAROLD HOLT<br />
AT THE STATE DINNER IN VIENTIANE 1APIL, 197<br />
Your Highnesses, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
First, Mr. Prime Minister, may I thank you very<br />
warmly for the welcome you have given to me and Mrs. Holt<br />
and all those who have accompanied us here to Laos. We<br />
found the warmth of welcome extended to us on our arrival<br />
today confirmed by all the experience which has since come<br />
to us during a memorable day in this capital city of your<br />
count ry. It is something of an occasion for my own country<br />
when for the first time in our history its Prime Minister<br />
makes a visit to this historic country and its notable<br />
capital of Vientiane, and we have appreciated greatly the<br />
ma~ nner in which you have welcomed us here.<br />
We welcome, Prime Minister, your assumption of<br />
the leadership of your country. We were confident that<br />
under that leadership your country would grow in strength<br />
and would attract support and confidence. We ourselves<br />
were confident in that belief and we congratulate you that<br />
this confidence has been so strongly evidenced in the<br />
elections which brought you added strength when they were<br />
last held. This visit I am making reflects the interest of<br />
Australia in an area of the world which previously did not<br />
exercise our attention very much. It is only in comparatively<br />
recent years wie have come to realize how deeply involved our<br />
own future and wiellbeing are in the future and wellbeing of<br />
the countries to our north, our nei.-hbours ol' the countries<br />
of South East Asia in particular and of the Asian and Pacific<br />
regions generally. It is particularly gratifying to me that you should<br />
have admitted me, as I understand th 3 first visiting foreign<br />
Prime Minister, to be allowed to enter your Cabinet and have<br />
talks there in confidence with you and with your colleagues.<br />
We have greatly valued this discussion. We feel that this<br />
has led to a better understanding of the problems of your<br />
country. kWe believe that it will be of assistance to us in<br />
the decisions which wie shall be making in future as to how<br />
we can best bring assistance and encouragement to you.<br />
Vie respect the neutrality which is the officioal policy<br />
of your country and which has been assured to you if others<br />
observe that assurance under the Geneva agreement. We know<br />
that, like ourselves, you have an urgent desire for a stable<br />
and continuing peace, that in a condition of peace you hope<br />
to be able to develop a country which has knowun so ma,, ny rzivages,<br />
both fromi nature and from man in years that have gone by. We<br />
know that, because of the security probleLm you face, there is<br />
only a fraction of your budget that you can devote -to<br />
constructive purposes, cons-1r'uctive works th:. tU will help to<br />
build a better life for your people. a s </p>

Australia is well aw,-are of the inroads which defence<br />
expenditure makes upon the national resources of finance and of<br />
manpower and we have found it necessary in our contribution to<br />
our own security and that of others in the area in which we live<br />
to double our expenditure on defence over a period of four years,<br />
and this Irs meant that less money is available for our own<br />
development, less money than we would wvish to see applied is<br />
available for the assistance of others. But despite these<br />
demands we have done what we could to bring assistance to others,<br />
and I was delighted to find the ready recognition on your own<br />
part of the value which this assistance has meant to your own<br />
country. It is fashionable for some who do not wish you well and<br />
do not wii-sh us well, to describe this process of assistance as a<br />
new type of colonialism, the neo-colonialist of the propaganda<br />
which you and I read about so often. So far as Australia is<br />
concerned, we emphatically reject any such interpretation of the<br />
help we have been trying to give. For our pa-. rt this is genuine<br />
help, help designed to assist others to a better way of life.<br />
Of course every country which gives assistance has a<br />
motive of self-interest, one sort or acnothler, but thu self-interest<br />
which I believe is uppermost in the minds of those giving<br />
assistance around the world at this time is a sincere desire to<br />
build a better world, to enable countries less fortunate, less<br />
able to make provision for themselves because of military threat<br />
or because of poverty of resources, to ca-rry on the work of<br />
progress in their country as a consequence of the aid which more<br />
fortunate countries can bring to them.<br />

on the part of the aid receiver. It is gladly given in the hope<br />
thalt this will help to make a better life for the people of that<br />
country. We recognise the problems and the difficulties which<br />
face your owin country. We have admired the courage of your<br />
Prime Minister in leading the country with such distinction and<br />
in uniting the Laotian people in the face of tremendous<br />
difficulties. We have also admired the progress that your<br />
Prime Minister has brought about and the stability he has achieved.<br />
I am very pleased that under his leadership the bonds of friendship<br />
have grown to such an extent between the, two countries. This kind<br />
of friendship, I hope, will continue in the future. </p>
