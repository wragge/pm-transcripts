    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..............................................................................</p>
<p> Well ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the APEC Leaders'</p>
<p> meeting concluded a short while ago and not surprisingly this meeting</p>
<p> has been dominated by the global financial crisis, in particular,</p>
<p> its impact on the economies of the APEC region and a lot of time was</p>
<p> spent on ways in which the region might respond to the crisis, the</p>
<p> lessons to be learnt and the mechanisms that could be put in place</p>
<p> at both the country level and also an international level to try and</p>
<p> prevent such events occurring again, or if they do occur again, mitigating</p>
<p> their impact.</p>
<p>I can report quite substantial outcomes in the three areas which I</p>
<p> identified before the meeting as essential for achieving the overriding</p>
<p> objective of an early return to growth. And they were the reaffirmation</p>
<p> of the Bogor commitments to open markets, a commitment to domestic</p>
<p> financial and economic reforms, and urgent and practical steps to</p>
<p> improve the international financial system.</p>
<p>These have been the subject of a number of speeches I've made,</p>
<p> most particularly the speech I made to the Financial Supervisors'</p>
<p> gathering in Sydney a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>The Australian Government's $50 million initiative on strengthening</p>
<p> financial and economic management was widely welcomed, particularly</p>
<p> by some of the least developed countries such as Vietnam and Thailand</p>
<p> and this is acknowledged in the statement in paragraph 28. There was</p>
<p> also an endorsement of Australia's proposals for implementation</p>
<p> of codes of international best practice Â– that's to be found</p>
<p> in paragraph 26 and there was an endorsement of my proposals for working</p>
<p> groups on capital flows and hedge funds and on crisis management and</p>
<p> reference should be made there to paragraph 25.</p>
<p>The latter, that is the one relating to the crisis management, to</p>
<p> develop for example practical proposals for orderly work out arrangements,</p>
<p> and this has been progressed either through the G22 which I guess</p>
<p> would be preferred or APEC finance deputies' forums, and I've</p>
<p> indicated to the meeting that Australia would be prepared to host</p>
<p> this group if necessary.</p>
<p>There was an endorsement of the blueprint for action on electronic</p>
<p> commerce and Australia was the co-chair of the working group which</p>
<p> looked after the blueprint and we also reached agreement on a co-operative</p>
<p> growth strategy, its reference being in paragraph 7, with particular</p>
<p> contributions there from the US/Japan initiative and the Miyazawa</p>
<p> plan.</p>
<p>As I've said before ,the EVSL outcome was second best, but we</p>
<p> did achieve a renewed commitment to moving forward to the Bogor targets,</p>
<p> which in the current economic climate is no small achievement. Sixteen</p>
<p> economies including Japan agreed to the full nine sector package being</p>
<p> taken to the WTO, that's in paragraph 19, and we were instrumental</p>
<p> in securing a strong reference to early agreement on broad-based WTO</p>
<p> negotiations.</p>
<p>Could I just conclude my introductory remarks by saying that the meeting</p>
<p> was, as I said at the beginning, dominated by the impact of the financial</p>
<p> crisis. It is obvious that the crisis has had quite an impact on the</p>
<p> social life and the political life also of many of the countries in</p>
<p> the region. Some of them are still very severely shaken as a result,</p>
<p> but the encouraging thing is that a number of them have already administered</p>
<p> large doses of very nasty, but necessary, domestic economic medicine,</p>
<p> and have begun to enjoy or reap, it's a more appropriate word,</p>
<p> some of the benefits of that.</p>
<p>I've said previously, and I can only repeat it again tonight,</p>
<p> that I admire the steps that have been taken by countries such as</p>
<p> Thailand to respond to particular problems. I'm very pleased</p>
<p> to report that there is widespread appreciation within the region,</p>
<p> of the very constructive role that Australia has played.</p>
<p>The last 18 months have seen Australia play the sort of role that</p>
<p> we ought to, and we can, and we should, and we are best equipped to</p>
<p> play in the region. We are not a world power, but we are a significant</p>
<p> regional power. We have a very stable political system, a very strong</p>
<p> economy, we have impeccably high standards of economic and corporate</p>
<p> governance. We have a sound legal system. We are therefore are in</p>
<p> a very strong position laterally to play an important role in the</p>
<p> region and we have been seen over the last 18 months as a good friend,</p>
<p> helping above its weight and willing to give a lot of practical help</p>
<p> to countries that are particularly important to Australia, and it</p>
<p> is evident that our efforts in relation to Indonesia and Thailand</p>
<p> and Korea are well appreciated within the region, and there's</p>
<p> an understanding that Australia is a very strong player, a very strong</p>
<p> participant, a permanent friend, not an uncritical supporter, but</p>
<p> a permanent friend of the region, and one that is going to continue</p>
<p> to play a very important role, indeed, an increasingly important role,</p>
<p> and one of the most gratifying things for me, as Australian Prime</p>
<p> Minister, was the recognition of Australia's role in region.</p>
<p>We don't have exaggerated images of it, we don't claim special</p>
<p> relationships freely with particular countries. We do play, of course,</p>
<p> a special and enduring interest in the region because it is our region,</p>
<p> it will forever be our region, and we do bring those particular assets</p>
<p> of our culture and our history and our geography and our background,</p>
<p> which is of enormous benefit, and we are increasingly seen as being</p>
<p> able to bring great value to our association to the region, and that's</p>
<p> been very evident over the last 18 months and it was very evident</p>
<p> at today's meeting, and we've certainly been able to demonstrate</p>
<p> that there is an Australian way which is different and is very valuable</p>
<p> and very positive in the region.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, are you convinced that, as you said the other day, the</p>
<p> APEC vehicle, as a vehicle for trade liberalisation, is in third gear</p>
<p> but can still go back up to fourth, and it is not going to go backwards?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I am quite convinced of that, yes. You have to recognise that</p>
<p> because of circumstances a decision was taken by one of the biggest</p>
<p> countries in the grouping that it couldn't proceed further on</p>
<p> the EVSL. Now, we were sorry about that, but once a decision like</p>
<p> that's been taken, you've got to be realistic. You've</p>
<p> got to understand the reasons why. But we do have a commitment from</p>
<p> all of the countries that they will go as a group in 1999 to the World</p>
<p> Trade Organisation in relation to those nine sectors. So that is obviously</p>
<p> a lot better than what the alternative to it would have been. Now,</p>
<p> when you remember what has happened over the last eighteen months,</p>
<p> you have to acknowledge that some kind of change of gear, to revert</p>
<p> to my original analogy, was perhaps unavoidable.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think that in the past expectations about APEC have been perhaps</p>
<p> a little bit too high, and as a result of this meeting, expectations</p>
<p> in future might be more realistic?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. I'd say yes, yes to both. It was probably, in retrospect,</p>
<p> and I don't blame anybody for this. I don't blame the former</p>
<p> government. I don't blame the media. I don't blame the present</p>
<p> government either, let me say. It was, I think, the case that some</p>
<p> of the expectations were a little too high, and I think people will</p>
<p> have more realistic expectations now. But, I mean we are continuing</p>
<p> to make very solid progress. And to think that after all that many</p>
<p> of those countries have been through, we've had the sort of outcome</p>
<p> we have today, and there's a lot of renewed optimism because</p>
<p> of that about the future, I still believe it would play an extremely</p>
<p> significant role.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What's your response to claims that APEC is really not going</p>
<p> anywhere and ought to be wound up?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think the claim is wrong and the suggestion is silly, and</p>
<p> would be against the interests...all the history of economic development</p>
<p> and the history of exchanges between nations suggests that you try</p>
<p> and use a number of vehicles and a number of forums to achieve outcomes.</p>
<p> One of the most significant things today, to me, was that nobody,</p>
<p> but nobody, seriously argued against globalisation. Everybody accepts</p>
<p> that globalisation now is a fact of life. People might say that we</p>
<p> have to handle it in a slightly different way. People might say we</p>
<p> have to improve our capacity to help people through the impact of</p>
<p> globalisation, but nobody was saying that we should turn our back</p>
<p> on globalisation or that there was really any alternative. The arguments</p>
<p> are all at the margin. The arguments are more about process and response</p>
<p> and not about direction.</p>
<p>Now, if it is a given that globalisation is a fact of life, and it</p>
<p> is, and I've argued that very strongly, and it's perfectly</p>
<p> obvious that it is, then the existence of a body like APEC is extremely</p>
<p> beneficial because APEC is a remarkable grouping of countries and</p>
<p> I, more than at the earlier two meetings, had driven home to me today</p>
<p> the differences, the contribution, of the three Latin American countries</p>
<p> and their experiences bring a very special emphasis to this gathering,</p>
<p> which is different from the experience of the Asian countries, strictly</p>
<p> defined, which in turn differs amongst themselves, between those that</p>
<p> have been more successful and those that have been less successful.</p>
<p> And then you add to that the experience of our own, one of the highly</p>
<p> developed countries, which has probably, along with the United States</p>
<p> and Canada, been less affected by the Asian economic downturn than</p>
<p> probably any other country, you don't get a grouping like that,</p>
<p> and you don't get a sharing of experiences like that, anywhere</p>
<p> else in the world. And to turn your back on that would be crazy, and</p>
<p> would be counter-productive and would be self-defeating, and would</p>
<p> really be throwing away the opportunity that being part of that grouping</p>
<p> presents to us. You don't get such a grouping anywhere else in</p>
<p> the world and it still remains the region of the future, of that there</p>
<p> can be no doubt. The rhetoric was perhaps a little high blown in the</p>
<p> past but it still certainly is very much the region of the future.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Given the emphasis on the financial arrangements, is the role of APEC</p>
<p> evolving and changing?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Inevitably it changes a bit, but it is still fundamentally a body</p>
<p> which is about trade liberalisation, about encouraging growth amongst</p>
<p> its members, and lifting the living standards of its peoples. And</p>
<p> you'll notice that in none of the proposals about financial management</p>
<p> is there any suggestion that we set up new bodies within APEC to rival</p>
<p> the IMF or anything like that. And there's a reference to G22</p>
<p> which I think is very desirable. I mean G22 is a very good body for</p>
<p> looking at international financial governance because, unlike the</p>
<p> G7, it does include a number of countries that are closer to the developing</p>
<p> countries. It is a more broadly based grouping than G7, and of course</p>
<p> G7, apart from Japan, does not include any Asian countries.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How important do you think this declaration will be then, in the sense</p>
<p> that you think the G22 as being the essential advisory body on changes</p>
<p> to the international system, as opposed to the G7?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It will add to the putative status of the G22, it will certainly add</p>
<p> to the status of G22. I don't want to put it any more strongly</p>
<p> than that because G7 includes, of course, the major industrialised</p>
<p> countries of the world, so does the G22, and there's always a</p>
<p> little bit of sensitivity amongst some of the big players about involving</p>
<p> others. From our point of view, we think G22 is much better, not only</p>
<p> because Australia is a member of it, but that's important because</p>
<p> we can bring some perspectives. I have to mention again the perspectives</p>
<p> that we were able to bring in relation to Indonesia. If others had</p>
<p> been left to run their course on that I think you'd have had</p>
<p> a much worse outcome in Indonesia than turned out to be the case.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, what does today's result make you think about the</p>
<p> future of the Australian export industries and the jobs that come</p>
<p> with them that have benefited from trade liberalisation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, what it makes me think is that we have to continue to improve</p>
<p> efforts at explaining the benefits of trade liberalisation to our</p>
<p> communities. I've said before that it's always easy to point</p>
<p> to an old industry that has been closed down or has been reduced in</p>
<p> size because it's been beaten by cheap imports. It's always</p>
<p> a lot harder to capture the examples, but I'm sure that Mr Fischer,</p>
<p> in his inimitable style, will be trotting out even more examples in</p>
<p> the months ahead. And I think it's very important.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How much difference did it make that President Clinton did not come?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Very hard to know, Paul, it is always a help to have the President</p>
<p> of the United States present. There is no doubt about that. It is</p>
<p> always a help but he had reasons for not coming which I understood.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Things would have gone more smoothly do you think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They would have gone differently.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Better?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it is always better to have the President, the occupant of the</p>
<p> most powerful political position in the world, around the table. It</p>
<p> is always an improvement to have that but that is not meant to be</p>
<p> critical of Vice President Gore.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Would he have delivered the same speech?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you will have to go and ask the White House that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think you struck the right balance of capital flows issue?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I do. Nobody is talking about regulating capital flows. I mean</p>
<p> we are specifically not talking about that, I mean we believe in capital</p>
<p> flows. They are the life-blood of international financial activity.</p>
<p> They are enormously beneficial.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Australia's individual action play of the review of all tariffs</p>
<p> by the year 2000 - when will that take place and what form will it</p>
<p> take?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It will take place by the year 2000. Well, I just don't know</p>
<p> precisely, Michael. I can't answer that but if you want to know</p>
<p> I will give some thought to it, but I just don't know off-hand</p>
<p> what precisely will be the review mechanism. I mean bear in mind that</p>
<p> in a number of areas we have a predetermined glide path and if you</p>
<p> are not going to change those and it is very interesting to reflect</p>
<p> on some of the criticism that was made of the government's decisions</p>
<p> on motor cars and textile, clothing and footwear against some of the</p>
<p> comparisons that now being made within APEC about who stands where</p>
<p> on levels of industry protection. I didn't hear any criticism</p>
<p> of Australia as being highly protective today or even in the corridors</p>
<p> of the meeting.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Was there a consensus today amongst the leaders that the Asian crisis</p>
<p> has passed its worst and is on its way back up?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That would be putting it too strongly. There wasn't the sense</p>
<p> of despair that some of the reporting of the crisis would have suggested.</p>
<p> But once again it is very impressive to hear from people like the</p>
<p> Prime Minister of Thailand and, of course, President Kim Dae Jung</p>
<p> of South Korea, who has personally been through so much and who is</p>
<p> undertaking a very fundamental economic reform program and in the</p>
<p> process his country is going through a lot of difficulties. Now, things</p>
<p> have got a little better but it is too early to say that Asia has</p>
<p> turned the corner. I think that would be gilding a little too much,</p>
<p> but there is evidence that things have bottomed. Let me put it that</p>
<p> way and you have to bottom in these situations before you, to mix</p>
<p> the metaphors, turn the corner. The lift off</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, given that the United States chose to use the APEC</p>
<p> stage to raise political and social issues (inaudible) How do you</p>
<p> see (inaudible) to try to get economic and political and social issues</p>
<p> separately?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think it is highly desirable that we continue to try and do</p>
<p> so otherwise it becomes yet another body and it loses its point and</p>
<p> it loses its relevance. Now, I don't know that it is the occasion</p>
<p> of a speech outside the formal APEC session where these comments were</p>
<p> made. I think it is perfectly realistic to keep trying but it is also</p>
<p> realistic to expect that from time to time political issues are going</p>
<p> to intrude. It is just a conjunction of time and circumstances that</p>
<p> causes that to happen.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Now that the Summit is over what can you say about the impact of the</p>
<p> United States/Malaysia row on the outcome?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't think it had any impact at all on the Leaders'</p>
<p> Declaration. I don't think it had any impact at all on the nature</p>
<p> and the quality of the debate. None at all. It didn't come up,</p>
<p> it didn't have one iota of impact and it remains as I mentioned</p>
<p> before, that is that we handled it in the right way having regard</p>
<p> to the Australian national interest and that's what I am interested</p>
<p> in. That's my responsibility.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How was the relationship between Dr Mahathir and Mr Gore at the Leaders'</p>
<p> Summit today?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, they were perfectly civil to each other, but if you want to</p>
<p> know something about their attitude towards each other, please ask</p>
<p> one of them. I am not answering for the Vice ... Well, everything</p>
<p> was perfectly harmonious and civil, but I am not going to get into</p>
<p> their relationship. That is a matter for them. I mean my position</p>
<p> is known. The Australian Government doesn't give out the views</p>
<p> of other countries before stating its position on these sorts of things.</p>
<p> We have national interest on having a good relationship with Malaysia</p>
<p> and that is what I have in mind and I also have a national interest</p>
<p> in letting the world know where we stand on political liberty and</p>
<p> human rights and we have done that and that is why we were the first</p>
<p> country in the region to actually say something critically about Malaysia.</p>
<p> That seems to have been forgotten over the last couple of days. We</p>
<p> were ahead of any other country in having something to say.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What do you think of the attire?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I won't be sandbagged when I walk in the door this time</p>
<p> by one of my sons as I was for that Canadian bomber jacket when I</p>
<p> came back from Vancouver last year.</p>
