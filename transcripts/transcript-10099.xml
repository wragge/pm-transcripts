R September 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD, MP<br />
ADDRESS AT THE WESTERN AUSTRALIA STATE CONFERENCE<br />
RADISSON OBSERVATION CITY HOTEL, WA<br />
Thank you very miuchi Rit~ hard, David Honey the President of thcr Western Australian<br />
Division of the Liberal Puity, my FRJeral and Statc Parliamentary colleagues, ladies and<br />
acntlemen. I can't describe to you tho sensc of plca~ urc and satis-flactiun it is-~ w at long last address a<br />
meeting of the Wostern Aajstmlian division ol' thc Liberal Patty as~ Primi: Minisier of<br />
Australa. It iq an historic moment to have again, aller 13 years of dnft and 13 years in th;.<br />
wilderness, to have on the platform here in Pejth both the Liberal Premirr and the iberal<br />
Prime Minister. And I want at the beginning of my address to express my immcnse<br />
graTitude to Liberal-, in We-ormn Australia, not only for the remarkablo achievemont of thc<br />
lu51. federal clection which saw, even on top of the great result achieved in 1993, saw<br />
lii inurc Labor sa lo.-r by thiat party. it wasa brie at achievement, and of course it<br />
built oni cuiur great achievements. It Is true, Richard, wthIis State contributes<br />
disproporiiawly atnd generously to tbe export income nf the entire nation. Tt is also<br />
true that until the last rudcraI tcle. rion ihil State contributed lis-pmrottitely to the<br />
fedcral succcss of the Libefal Pity and it took the othur States until the last election,<br />
particularly t States ofNcw Southi Waiks znd Queensland tQ catch up with thr. % ilnke<br />
rato or Western Australia. And I am vcry consisgous ol'thai and I am very gratcful for the<br />
work of thc Western Au.' itralian Divi. 5ion and Ilic pi ofc-iuzial ismn and the capacity to<br />
campaign effectively a( the grass roots that has always bcn a liallitnark of rte Liheral<br />
Party in Western Australja 21 both a Stato and a l~ cdcral lkvcl.<br />
It wju; a great Rchicvcment, the last election. And the dolighlt in -sccing even mos-c Labot<br />
scats lost and to have Don Randall and Jticky John.-Ion as, additional Liberal mcmbcrs in<br />
the House ol Reprc'scnitives, we are truly dolighted to have the both of you with us. It is<br />
imporl~ ta as we jstifishly refIlect with prido and lzatisraction and gonuine emotion in the </p>
<p>Fax from v2. 08/ 09/ 96 17: 22 Pg: 2<br />
aftermath of that Sz'at victory oin the second of March. it, Is Imporwtat hat we undorstwid<br />
why we won. Bec~ iow. in a proper understanding of why we won is die founidation of<br />
winning again. if we misqunderstand why we won l45t 1, l111, WC 11ay 1101 Win Again. And<br />
the political history of Australia Is littered with tht; butirN ( if party leaders anid Primc<br />
Ministers who didn't really understand why it, was, they won in the first place. We won<br />
on the second of March throutir u comnbination of eircumstanccs and factors, Of course<br />
we won in significanicma.' urc, because of tho accumulated frustration and hostility of the<br />
Austrulian pcople tuwards thc for-mr govermment and in particular the former Prime<br />
Minister. Wc should be realistic and pragmatic enough to understand that. It was a<br />
goyci ninenft that had grown out of touch with the mainstream of the Australian<br />
onimunity. It was a government which danced to the tunc arid the siren call of noisy<br />
nhinoriticti und not the great mainstream of Australians. It wag a governimerntiIhNi had<br />
grown arrogant, it was lead by ai group of people who itly harl hpanme pn~~ ssed with<br />
the idea thar the Labor Pary was bumn to rule. It tisetoA hia -uid of us. however wrongly,<br />
that we had born-to-rule wientality, yet if you lookc acros the House of Representatives<br />
chamber at question timew and iii Parliaimenrtary debates. thc mob who really do have the<br />
born to rule. mentality are Ithe new opposition memnbers In the House of Reprs~ Uiatvoe,<br />
They still can't Work nut why it is that they lost and they can't work out why it i thiat they<br />
Were rrjPCTCA. So it is in large measure the case ladies and guntleniiit that we won thec<br />
Ilisr election because of the unhappincss of the Australian ulcturati; with the prcviu-<br />
( iovernment.<br />
But It Is also the case that for tlir. first rime in 13 years we got the right distillaton of<br />
politics arid pulicy. Being succcssful in an election campAign is a comnbination of<br />
pullitiwl % kill and commitownt to forward-looking vnlues. If you only have the valuer~<br />
uwad ie cconomics right and you got thu politics wrong you mr not going to win it. And<br />
if you only have thc politics right and you've got no economic coinmitment and you've<br />
got no valuci thcn you don't roully ejescrve to win. And for the fir% t tme, I believe in 13<br />
years~ at a Federal level we got that combination right and the other thing that we got right<br />
is that we diTplaycd particularly in the 12 months leading tip to 1hhe election both within<br />
the Liberal Party and between the Liberal Party and I he National Vartywe displayed<br />
remarkable unity and we demonstrated the Adflg. that has been demonstrated again and<br />
again in Australian politicthaii when the iberal and National Parties work Together they<br />
win together and we did it very successfully. And the unity within our own rdnkb aud<br />
between the Parliamentary palrty and the organisation playi: 4 a very signmificant rule in that<br />
viciory. And I wunt express on behalf of the Federal Paarlamntaiy par ty dih immnlse<br />
gratitude for the unselish loyalty and devotin of Ilic rank wit) File of tie Liberal Party<br />
organisation particularly in the leatd up fu the ; lesuiioii. So it is important when we look<br />
back on why we won itr) t innber that of courst the detestation of our oppone~ nts was an<br />
clement. We got dic fight. distillation of politics and values, we had great political unity.<br />
But I think we also tutjd something else, another chord in the Austruliwi community<br />
and that wab u deoite to once again , lee the Governent of this country composed of men<br />
anad wsati who saw themnselves as thc modz. 4t, even on occasions, humble servants of<br />
dihc Australian pcoplc rathcr than u group of men and women who in tome way thought<br />
through divine ordination thoy had Q right to COrnPTre the Government of thir. country. </p>
<p>Fa fom08/ 09/ 96 17: 22 Pg: 3<br />
And that sonso that the Government was distant from the people and that sense that Ih.<br />
Govornment no lonper ropresented or undentood or listcncd to or tholight about the<br />
people of Australia was one of the most powerful reasons why the fnirmer ( iovernrent<br />
was rejected. And if we remember that,, then our prospect-r of reeciion are very good.<br />
But if on the other hand we forget it and thmiigh the paissage of fimei we bcnome arrogant<br />
and presumptuous in office then the same fate awaits us. The Austrnlian electoratu now<br />
is less tribalised politicAlly than it has evcr been since the enid of World War 11. 1Misy or<br />
the old aroiatic allegiances are gone. It is no longer invariably the t a. wC that I vote<br />
I . AMT because Dad did or I vote Liberal becauso Dad did. 1ii di ITerent grcrations ha've<br />
differemnt titudes. Political allegiances amungst people undcr the age oi-30 amein a state<br />
of convtant flux and mobility. Now that pioscnLts an enornmous ehallenge and it also<br />
presents grint oppoitwiftics aind if we understand the nature of the ohanged cleotoratelwe<br />
undesuid oil or those things then we have grcat prospects for the future.<br />
The; theme of this Conference ladics and Sentlemen is about the fbture and that is what<br />
out attention ihould bo dircted towards. We we elected by the Australian people of<br />
counie to rcspcct the past and respect the rich history of the Australian nation but we<br />
Wcrc also elected to provide to the Australian people goals and aspirations for Ithe future.<br />
I remember Sir Charles Court once saying to me, he rmay have forgotten -about cight or<br />
nine years ago, when I was the previous ( Opposilion Leader, he qald; Jot/ n what you've<br />
always got to do is tell the Australian people what you're goas are about their fiure,<br />
And that was a very sound piece of political advice. Australians are aspirational people<br />
they c.~ in he inspired. they are Suspicious of humbugpand properly svbui they " nw bc<br />
encouraged to fift their aspirations for the futurv. And it is onily tiatural as we move<br />
toward the next millennium and as we mov; iowtudt-, tde celebration of the centenary of<br />
the foundation of the Coinmonwcalili of Aubtilia that the Austra~ lian people should look<br />
toward the next cuntuiy tuid Aiould look toward the futuro. Thicy want a Government t<br />
undetistnuds that tho world of the year 2000 will be very different from the world of 40 or<br />
years ago, Thoy don't want us to forgect out past. They want us to nurtarc it and<br />
rv~ pect it but they want us to implement policies that do build ror the future, And that is<br />
the tosk wo set Oursclvcs when we assurmd offico after the second of March. And<br />
budget recently brought down by Poter Costello, I want to taethe opprtunityaofpayinp<br />
a personal tribute to the remarkable job that Peter, as Treasurer and Deputy Leader of the<br />
Liberal Party. did in preparng, bringing down, presenting and propotmding a very<br />
succegsful. Federal ) iudget. That was the first of the building hlnrktq for the future<br />
because what the Budget did was what the Atiqlralian people wanted in to do. They<br />
wanted us at the irst availahie opporwnity to tackle the fiscal. legacy that we had<br />
inherited from the former Government, They wanted us to attend to the payment of fth<br />
hankcard liabilities that we had inhcriied from our predectssors. The: y diiju' waunt Wt~ o<br />
leave it to year two or year three. And 1 don't think wny or uw suppoylers would havec<br />
thanked us for saying well its a bit difivhult to do ic ruist year we'll get around to do it </p>
<p>Fax fraom 08/ 09/ 96 17: 22 Pg: 4<br />
in year two or year three because they would know instinctively that if you weren't game<br />
to tackle it in the first year immediately in office you were never going to do it in the<br />
second or third year. So we did set about doing that und thc Budget has been very well<br />
received in the Australian community, The positive nature of the reception or the Budget<br />
has of course aggravated our political opponents. ) I has been seein by and large by the<br />
Australian comrmunity as a strong but fair Budget. The Australian people will always<br />
accept difficult decisions on two conditions. First and foremost the decisions have got to<br />
bc fair and in thq national interest and secondly they've got to be properly explained and<br />
understood. And if you do that, if you look every interest group in the eye and say well<br />
you won't l ike what I have done but when you look at what has been done in other areas<br />
and you look at the dimension of our problem you will undcrstand why it was nccisary<br />
to do it. And I believe that in every area we can do exactly that. We can look an interest<br />
group in the eye and say we know you don't like it but you will understand that in all of<br />
the circumstances that it was necessary. And the other grcat achievement of the Budget<br />
is that we have been able to keep faith with the core commitmecnts that we took to the<br />
Australian people at the last election.<br />
I amt very proud indee that the family tux~ initiative will be delivered in full on thle<br />
promised date. I am very proud that the health insurane rcbate, the tax rebate will be<br />
dclivcred in full on the promised date, I am very proud that the tax incentives in capital<br />
gains. tax for small business will be delivered nn the prmtsed date.<br />
And if ttic Australlian Senate is wise. which 1 hope in the end it will<br />
be. we'll be able to deliver In full, once we have sold ont third of TcIsula, dt liwgsL3 tee'<br />
capital Investment In the env~ ronmiental fuLUMOful Auitndi. Aiid if you're looking about<br />
building for the future of Australia, ir you ate lifting your sights to the nort. millonnium<br />
and you cart about thc wiaunul ruivironiuent of this country, something Australians of an<br />
ag~ cs;% aubb all genefations and aoross ail patty divisions now rcaully do caro about, and<br />
will in your heart want to % ee that Si billion go into that groat National Heritage Trust of<br />
Australia, that will tackle tho ongoing, the really important environmental challenges of<br />
Australia, the saX.-Az$ the pollution of our river systems, the degradation of our R-oil.<br />
They arc things that do have to be taick led if we are to build for the future and if we camw<br />
about the environmental inheritane or our children and our grandchildren.<br />
I'm~ very proud of the first Coalition Budget since 1982. I'm' valry prond that it did<br />
properly distil our economic, our social and our rinlitiCal e. pnsihilities. Fm proud to<br />
call it a strong, fair budget, I'm proud to call it a huciget for the mainstream of die<br />
Australian communiiy. Rut that wsa-. hut the first of the building blocks as we look<br />
inwarttq the future. There are many ollher Tbings. hti and gcrulcmnen. We campaigned<br />
before the election on a number of central platforms. One of thern, or icuurm, wms our<br />
very strong commitment to the centrality of the ruanhly unit ill AuuMieflWI society. Welvc<br />
already begun to refLc our priorities in that tuetu uvug i t budgct announccmnrts. V/ c<br />
also hold vory d= u tho r. of butull lbuviiimss within not only the Australian economy but<br />
815u within dio broade4 " omuntilty. so many of u3 int the Libcral rarty owc our<br />
philosophic idcntification with our Party to its &amp; rcat comynitniont to private enterprise and<br />
smfall b7usirICss. SO f the Australian druam that you and I understand is the ide4 that you<br />
might art your working lifc with nothing, take a lot of risks. build up a business, work<br />
your inside out in the proem und pass on something better and something more<br />
substantial to your childran1 that has always been very muceh part of the Australian<br />
dream as I've understood it and iWa a dream that's favoured ii lut in recent years and it's<br />
stomething that's got to be given more lire and more vigor. And thats Mne at* ihe vaainnP<br />
why I have for ten years, and so many of my colleaigu'es her. Ioday and all around<br />
Australia have campaignted so strongly for lnehir-frial relations reforrm. industrial relations<br />
reform le-at at the heart of m better economic climate for small business in Australia. </p>
<p>Fax from 6. 88/ 89/ 96 17: 22 Pg: S<br />
Unless~, at a national level we can liberate the Industrial relations System Of this CoUffitY<br />
we will not be able to have the free and vigorous and positive and productive climate that<br />
small businesses need in Australia. Unless our indumsrial rlationas reformus az~ passed by<br />
the Australian Parliament, we Will HIot be~ able to gct rid of Laui ic Biereton's stupidJob<br />
destroyinlg, ucitair disnisal law. That iimdw ial rtlations reformn bill, the workiplacc<br />
iclatioos bill, is without any arguments, the most imporlunt pioce of legislation to bc<br />
pi-csrnted by the new Coalitioun Covernment. It contains within it ive es'.' cntial<br />
commitments. the unfair dismissAl Commitment, the commitment to getting<br />
of compulsory unionism, the commitment to get rid of the restriction. l5 on dio formation of<br />
enterprise unions, the commitment to bring back the very effective secondary boycott<br />
prohibitions in the Trade Practices Act that have protected Fo mnany businesses around<br />
Australia from the predatory behaviour of trade unions, mid finaally of course the very<br />
important comnmitment to allow Australian workers to havc a real choice between<br />
whether they remain under an award or whetlier they go Into a workplacc aigecrnct.<br />
And we'll know within the ncx few weeks as to whether we ait gvt that Iejgislatiop<br />
through the Parliament, We continue to ; cgutiutc in Moud faith with the minor parties in<br />
order to, T hope acieive their 5uppoit. It is an iportant pice of legislatien, and if it is<br />
passed mctial unimpair it will crcac at a natignal level a now and better climate for<br />
workplace rclation3. It is not an anti-workcr bill, it is not an nnti-union bill, it is a pro<br />
freedom, pro-small business bill and that is why we are so very st4rongly committed to it.<br />
But We AISOr'" ~ the election, ladies and gentlemen, on thc issue of<br />
unemnployment. I don't mind acknowledging. ARAI Australia".~ eoncemed, about the less<br />
fortunate in our community or to acknowledge that unemploymecnt, particularly amongst<br />
the young, ctill remains the greatest unresolved social problem that we havis. Tiliae are<br />
many reasons for high unemployment, some of then ore. the consc'rjwences of the<br />
degenerative. processes, particularly in family lie, in The social structure of this country of<br />
the progre. rl over Ihe lasqt 20) or 30J years. A lot of the explanation lies In the rigidity of<br />
our lahour ma~ rkets; and our industrial relations system. It Is no accldcnt that countries<br />
like New Zealand and the United States that have freer labour markets have lower levels<br />
of unemployment. I know it's uncomfortable for our political opponents to be iimindcd<br />
of thaw, but It happen,% to he a centrul reality. It is albo ut rut;( tlnit over the last 10 years the<br />
Australian euotionly lass hotL () Cem ablu to Rfow at a SUfficiently fa,-' t rdile to allow jobs to<br />
jcuerus and uiteiploymcnt to come down without that strong r5rowth spilling over to ai<br />
current account deficit or balance of payments crisis. And year after ycar we've had the<br />
problem that whcnevcr we gct a bit of economic growth goingwe suck in too mnuy<br />
imnports, there's a balanco of paymonts problem, inlterest rates go up and the whole show<br />
gets olosed down. Now what we've got to do is to remove the speed limits on growth in<br />
thin country and you can only do that if you free up the supply side of tie economy. If<br />
you get rid of the rigidities, you get rid of the stupidity which created the situsition a<br />
couple of years ago where beef produccrs in Australia could sell their product off the hoof<br />
at ,; omething like 60 per cent less than beef producer in the Onihl trate. that after it<br />
had gone through the procer. Ring and the. distrihnfinn and The Transportation chain, it<br />
ended np eMng 40) rents a kilIn dearer for tihe Australian peoplc than for the United States<br />
wholesalers. And that was because of all of the rigiditics of our industrial relations<br />
system. You don't find bloody minded unionism much worse in this country than you'd<br />
find It. I n the meat processing Industry, and It's a very good exarnple, a luic growni<br />
example. a painful example, of just how titust; rigiuitics add. to ici cost of ploduCtiOn ill<br />
daib WUtiwry. So gvltig rid of ilao spccd limits on girowth in Australia is very much about<br />
oconomic rcform. And then you hear govcmmrcnt~ i both at the state and the fedcral level<br />
talking about economic reform and you hear them talking about industrial relations,<br />
waterfront, transport, clectricity, gas and all qarts of other reforms. They are not talking<br />
dull, dreary accountinS concepts, they are talking about the real life and flesh and blood<br />
of the competitiveness of Australian industry.<br />
So building for the future is about getting the budget back in tho black. R's about<br />
addressing ! he problems of small business. t . e. sa lso very much about addresing the need<br />
for accelerated micro-economic reform in this contry. It's about devetonpine, ar a </p>
<p>Fax from national level, the energetic, outward looking, innovative, entreprenewring culture which<br />
is so redolent in most of Western Australia. And I don't want to finish this pleasure of<br />
addressing the Western Australian audience without acknowledging th eir particular<br />
contribution pf Wcstcni, Australia ; o the economic stengths and the economic vitality of<br />
Australia. You are rightly proud of the contribution that your State makes to the export<br />
income of the nation. You rightly remind any federal government of the impact of<br />
particular laws and particular attitudes on the economy of Western Australia.<br />
I am, as Prime Minister, very conscious of the imnportance of thc rcsourcc sector as well<br />
of course of other sectors of the Western Australian economy. We have that very much<br />
in mind when decision-. were taken in relation to such things as the diesel fuel rebate in<br />
the budget. We also had that very imuch in mind in our desire to effect reforms to the<br />
Native Title Act to make that active accordance with mny pre-election commitment more<br />
welcome because it. is undoubtedly the case vith that Act in its preqent forin doe&amp; need<br />
change and reform in order to make it more workable, more workaible for miners, mome<br />
workable for the indigenous people of Australia, more workablc for pastoralists, and<br />
more workable for governments at both a State and federal level-<br />
Unity between Federal and State governments of the same political persuasion is very<br />
important. We have the happy circumstance at. present that we have feeral government<br />
and governments in five of the six States of Australia and the two territories of Australia<br />
of the same political stokc. it is a long time sine wc had that happy conjunction. I want<br />
to say how important it. isto me as federal leader, to have the understanding and the<br />
cooperation of my State colleagues. I have immense admniration for the job that Richard<br />
Court has done as Premnier of Western Australia. Hc has been a grcat contributor to the<br />
national political debate while at the same time as any State Premier must and should do,<br />
he's been a staunch and outspoken advocate of the particular concerns and the particular<br />
interests of the State of Western Australia. And whenever hie may choose to face thc<br />
people of Western Australia, I am very confident * of what thc outcome will be, and he will<br />
go into that battle and he will go into that political contest with a wholehearted support<br />
and admiration and respect of the Federal Parliamentary Liberal Party and of myself<br />
personally. I suppose it's something like this, the temptation to say something, even a<br />
little bit, about your political opponents is almiost impossible to resist. Although, you<br />
know, some people say John, you shouldn't say anything about them. And I wasn't<br />
intending to say anything about my political opponents today, 1 was in an extremely<br />
charitable mood as I flew across the Nullabor, but thcn I happened to have been reading<br />
the paper as I came across a little item in the Sydney Morning Herald, the side column of<br />
that, normally amusing, not always but often political insightful column of Alan Ramsey.<br />
in which he talked about CGareth Evans' mental political state. lie recalled an interview<br />
that Gareth made with Derryn Hinch a few wccks ago and lic was talking about what it<br />
was like to be in opposition. I mean, he could have asked me, I would have told him.<br />
And Garethi complained. he said they don't take much notice of you and he said it's called<br />
relevance deprivation syndrome. He went on to say nobody takes any notice of you even<br />
though you're busting your tail off day in, day out to get a niessage out. It's that<br />
combination of impotence and irrelevance that really is pretty, pretty mind boggling<br />

Dear, dear me. Dear mue.<br />
That ladies and geinlenieia, I) a SCIiNe, 5tiid it tall. You recilil at tht: beginning of my<br />
1peech I % aid one of the reasons why we. won was that thle Austialiaas pwple: Ulhouht that<br />
the previoui crowd really had got hopelessly out of touch, really were taking thm for<br />
granted, and really aqsurnwd thait tall thcy had to do was turn up on polling day and get<br />
reelected. Once politicians start thinkinS like that and behaving like that then they realy<br />
deserve to be thrown out of office and I think the fact that somebody fools like, publicly<br />
talking about just how dreadful it irG... if you've been a cabinet mninistcr for 13 year, which<br />
he was, and you held a portfolio of Foreign Affairs and a few other senior portfolios and<br />
you've only been in opposition for seven monthF. and you feel that you've got to burst<br />
into public and whinge about It. you really have got a problem with your ego. And I think<br />
it say-, a lot ahfll the~ Arrngnnce of the former government, but it's a lesson to us, it's a<br />
lemson to remain in tnuch with the Aisrtrliafl pEople.<br />
The last tling I want to say to you today, ladies and gentlemenl Is a very personal thing<br />
and that is that to be the Prime Minisce of AuStralia Is without doubt the greatest<br />
pri'vilegrc thut could evcr wne the way of any man or woman in this country. I want to<br />
bay to you that all that I have aclikvvd in public life I uwc. to thc great party to which all<br />
of us belong. I became a memiber of Parliament because or the Liberal Pairty. I became a<br />
minister in the Fraser government bcerisc of the Liberal Party, T bcame leadoi or the<br />
Liberal Party and I'm Prime Minister because I kcad the Liberal Party and tho Libtral-<br />
National Patry Coalition. Like so many people in this room Ilvc devoted ail of my adult<br />
lita4-! S a lot more to the service of the Liberal Party.<br />
I've been through the good times and the bad times and the good tines again. So I've<br />
never lost sight Of affirmative influences on my political thinking in my early years in<br />
the Liberal Party in Sydney. But the people who were my heroes then are the people<br />
from whom I took advice and received encouragement and, on occasions, inspiration.<br />
The Liberal Party has never been a zealously ideological party. But it's reached its<br />
greatest heights and its greatest moments when it's been a party of both ideas and<br />
ideals. People say to me is the party an ideological one I say ' no, this is a party of<br />
ideas and it's certainly a party of ideals. If you look at the last 50 years the great<br />
ideas have come from our side of politics. The great in himigration tolerance, the<br />
white Australian policy, the reception of so many Indo-Chinese refuigees in the 1970s,<br />
that came from our side of politics. Many of the great social welfare reforms, the care<br />
for the genuinely needy came from our side of politics. The great principle of quality<br />
of opportunity and choice in the education of children, irrespective of whether it was<br />
a government school or an independent school. That was pioneered by our side of<br />
politics having been resisted for almost two decades by blindly ideological Labor<br />
Party that couldn't see the essential principle of freedom that's involved in that. The<br />
great ideas in the economic debates of the late 70s and through the 1980s they were<br />
changed from our side of politics. It was the Coalition that proposed financial<br />
deregulatrion. It was the Coalition that first propounded an industrial relations reform.<br />
It was the Coalition that first propounded privatisation in the public interest.<br />
Remember when Bob Hawke and Paul Keating said ' that if you sold the<br />
Commonwealth bank Ben Chifley would turn in his grave'.-They said it was akin to<br />
burning down the gum tree to do so. Getting the of time because we had led the<br />
intellectual debate they succumbed and they came into line and they rather..<br />
complied because they need the money and now they pretend that their opposition to<br />
a sale one third of Telstra is based on some great principle of commitment to<br />
public ownership in this country. After what they have done, after the hypocrisy they<br />
have displayed on issues like the Commonwealth Bank and Australian Airlines and<br />
Qantas, they have no right even to be in the debate of our privatisation in this country<br />
any longer. </p>
<p>Fax from We are most importantly of all, we are a party of ideals. We believe absolutely in the<br />
importance in the individual worth and decency of every man and woman in this<br />
country. We believe that self flulfilment and self esteem is important, that that is<br />
always more important in the imposition of the collective corporatist wheel on<br />
individual freedom and individual liberty. We believe very, very passionately in the<br />
role and the importance of the family unit within our society. Of course, not all<br />
families are happy but that doesn't in any sense destroy the fact that a stable,<br />
functioning, united family is the greatest source of personal happiness and material<br />
security that has yet been devised by mankind. And collectively those functioning<br />
united families also happen to comprise the most efficient welfare delivery system that<br />
mankind has ever devised. So ladies and gentlemen, this is an occasion to reflect with<br />
personal and collective humility on the great responsibility that has been given to us<br />
by the people of Australia. It is an occasion for me to thank the Liberals of Western<br />
Australia for the tremendous loyalty, stoicism and commitment and support that so<br />
many of you displayed over such a long period of time. It is an opportunity for me to<br />
express my gratitude to the Liberal Party and it's an occasion for me to commait myself<br />
and my colleagues to the service of the people of Australia. An occasion to say that<br />
on all occasions the great goal of my Government will be to do good things for the<br />
people of Australia. Thank you. Farxom 08/ 09/ 96 17: 22 Pg: 8 </p>
