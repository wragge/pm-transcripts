PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE WITH HIS ROYAL<br />
HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH, WWF INTERNATIONAL PRESIDENT,<br />
SIR NINIAN STEPHEN, AMBASSADOR FOR THE ENVIRONMENT,<br />
PETER HUNNAM, COORDINATOR WWF SOUTH PACIFIC CONSERVATION<br />
PROGRAMME, WWF AUSTRALIA OFFICE, SYDNEY, 23 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Does Australia put itself in a difficult<br />
position, being a relatively wealthy country telling<br />
developing Pacific nations they should make environment a<br />
higher priority?<br />
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS: No, because, that's exactly what I was<br />
trying to say, that that's not the way it works. The fact<br />
that Peter Hunnam here will be, the programme will be<br />
developed in conjunction with the people in the region. I<br />
mean, nothing will be imposed on them. They won't be told<br />
what to do. Their problems will be discussed with them and<br />
we will of fer to design projects to meet their particular<br />
problems. Sc' it's very much a two way business.<br />
PM: Could I just add something to what His Royal Highness<br />
said there. As I've said before, talking about the<br />
relationship of Australia with the countries of the South<br />
Pacific generally, we've always got to be careful, we've got<br />
to walk a fine line between, on the one hand recognising<br />
what is the truth and the reality that they are sovereign<br />
independent nations, and secondly that we are in economic<br />
terms the big brother of the South Pacific and we have the<br />
capacities to help and assist them. So we want to do that<br />
in a way which recognises their own responsibilities. Now<br />
we've tried to fashion our decisions in this sort of area,<br />
as in others, in a way which recognises those realities.<br />
Now how have we done that? For instance, we've made a<br />
significant amount of money recently available to enable<br />
them to participate in their own right at international<br />
meetings and the international panel on climate change. We<br />
just didn't go along and say look we're representing these<br />
bodies. We made the money available to them so that they<br />
could go and represent themselves. Secondly in the very<br />
important area of the greenhouse emissions and the great<br />
concern that we as a world community have about rising sea<br />
levels, which for some of those islands are literally a<br />
matter of life and death. I mean, if you look at Tuvalu or<br />
Kiribati as probably the most obvious. I mean, we are<br />
talking about literally life and death for those people. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Now what we've done there is to make a significant sum of<br />
money available where we're setting up monitoring stations<br />
in these island countries and we're going to be training<br />
their own people so that they can man those monitoring<br />
stations so that they have a real sense of involvement in<br />
the world-wide approach to dealing with these challenges.<br />
So I think, while we'll never get it perfectly right, I<br />
mean, I think we've got the basic approach right.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, one of those areas, that of<br />
course borders the Pacific is Cape York. Yesterday His<br />
Royal Highness mentioned as a first priority get that<br />
joint land use study underway up there. I just wonder what<br />
the hold-up mnight be?<br />
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS: Could I just we had a discussion<br />
about this before and there's obviously been a<br />
misunderstanding. I said that this was necessary, well in<br />
point of fact the Commonwealth Government has made the<br />
0 finance available, the commitment has been made. This was<br />
not apparent in Brisbane when I was there. There's<br />
undoubtedly -the commitment by both Governments to a land use<br />
assessment and eventually a land use plan for Cape York is<br />
not in doubt. The commitment is not in doubt. I think, at<br />
the moment, there's possibly uncertainty about how far it's<br />
got. That's about all there is. But there's certainly a<br />
moratorium on activities. I did want to put this straight<br />
because I'm afraid I gave the wrong impression the other day<br />
in Brisbane. I'm sorry would you<br />
PM: Well I'm indebted to His Royal Highness. The position<br />
there is that we have had discussions with the Queensland<br />
Government and you can always tell whether discussions have<br />
advanced or not. There's one very simple test. That is<br />
whether you've committed money in your budget. Now I've<br />
committed $ 1.5 million in this financial year's budget and<br />
million in the next budget. That's already down, it's<br />
committed, it's promised. We will undertake with the<br />
0 Queensland Government this land use study which will be<br />
looking at the environmental implications of proposals for<br />
development and, of course also very importantly, the<br />
implications for our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island<br />
people. we are really at this stage, as Your Royal Highness<br />
said, we are in the process of working out the mechanics<br />
between us of how that's being done. But the commitment is<br />
there and you can be assured that no decisions will be made<br />
unless and until both Governments are satisfied that any<br />
such proposals are consistent with the proper environmental<br />
and Aboriginal safeguards that should be in our minds.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there any real threat from the Chile meeting<br />
that mining will be sanctioned in the Antarctic or not?<br />
PM: No. I would, as I said, the Spring racing carnival is<br />
over now, th~ e season of betting has passed. I'd be prepared<br />
to take any sort of wagers you'd like I think the<br />
Antarctic is; safe from mining. </p>
<p>3.<br />
JOURNALIST: Your Royal Highness, with the French nuclear<br />
testing and the burning of the chemical weapons on Johnston<br />
Atoll, do you think there's a sort of an attitude from<br />
Europe that the South Pacific is one of the dumping grounds?<br />
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS: It's difficult to say. I suppose there<br />
is. JOURNALIST: Do you disagree with the chemical weapons being<br />
placed therel<br />
HIS ROYAL HIG; HNESS: I'm delighted that chemical weapons are<br />
being destroyed. I would imagine that the science of this<br />
business is such that they're not in danger. I would be<br />
very surprised if people who were doing it were so<br />
irresponsible as to cause any sort of problems. I would<br />
have thought that was very unlikely.<br />
PM: Could I just make the point there because it has had<br />
some coverage in recent months following the South Pacific<br />
Forum. I mean, you should be aware, as I think you probably<br />
are, that the United States accepted a delegation from the<br />
Forum countries who had the opportunity of going there and<br />
inspecting the operation, and of course more recently<br />
President Bush met with the representatives of the Pacific<br />
island countries in Hawaii. He, there, repeated the<br />
assurance that was given earlier, and it's very important<br />
that it should be understood, that the Johnston Atoll<br />
facilities will be limited to these categories; those that<br />
are already t~ here, those that are already stored, secondly,<br />
and with the agreement of the Pacific island countries that<br />
if there are any others that are found still in some of the<br />
Pacific island countries, for instance, there's still some<br />
in the Solomo~ n Islands area, those will be taken there plus<br />
those that have been brought, this lot that have been<br />
brought from Europe. It will be limited to that. The rest<br />
of the disposal program by the United States will be done in<br />
mainland America. Now I think from the feedback we've got<br />
from the Pacific island countries that as a result of the<br />
visits they've had and the discussions they've had with<br />
President Bush that they're very, very much more satisfied<br />
now than they were earlier when we were having the<br />
discussions before and when they still felt they didn't have<br />
all the information.<br />
