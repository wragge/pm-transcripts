    <content><![CDATA[<p>63/ 132<br />EMBARGO NOT TO BE PU3LISHED, BROADCAST OR TELECAST BEFORE<br />7.15 P. M. ON THJRIDAY, iiOV" MBE 14.<br />BROADCAST NO. 1<br />BROADCAST BY TE-2 PRIME 1iNISTER THE RT. HON. SIR<br />ROBERT MENZTES OVER NATIONAL S-AIONS AT 7.15 P.-i.<br />THURSDY, NOVEMB 14, 1963<br />Already I have been encountering a whispering campaign<br />which is also being shouted aloud by Mr. Cawell.<br />The story is that, having won the next election,<br />I will then " hand over" the Prime Ministership to Mr. Holt,<br />giving him what is described as an " arm-chair" ride into<br />office. This story is not only a silly and malicious story,<br />but it is also the greatest confession of weakness that Mr.<br />Calwell has made. Where did Mr. Calwell get the idea that after<br />being re-elected I would move out? The fact is that, if the<br />people of Austral a wish me to continue as their Prime<br />Minister, I will continue to do so so long as I have health<br />and vigour. So far as I know, I am in full possession of both.<br />You have heard this kind of story before. Over<br />the last fourteen years my opponents have promoted me, in<br />anticipation, to the House of Lords. Now they seem to have<br />given up the idea of the House of Lords.<br />Where did they get this idea of someone having<br />an " arm-chair" ride into the Prime Ministership? I did not<br />have one. Mr. Calwell will not have one. How did Mr. Calwell<br />become Leader of the Labour Party? By the votes of the<br />members of his Parliamentary Party. How did I become the<br />Leader of my Party and Prime Minister? By the votes of members<br />of vy Party at Canberra. If and when the day came that, being<br />still in office, I decided that the time had come to make way<br />( and I am not contemplating this event) who will choose my<br />successor in the leadership of my Party? I wontt. The<br />Parliamentary Members of the Party will make the choice and<br />they will do so with complete freedom. Is that an " arm-chair"<br />ride?<br />0I said that this story was malicious. I will tell<br />you why. My distinguished colleague, Mr. Holt, is the<br />Treasurer. Three years ago, on behalf of the Cabinet as a<br />whole, he produced a eries of special financial measures.<br />Even Mr. Calwell should know that a Federal Treasurer does not<br />act on his own without regard to Cabinet opinion. Well, the<br />1960 measures were as we felt they would be, unpopular for<br />the time being. So Mr. Holt got the blame. It is in human<br />nature that we should like to blame someone in particular. So<br />instead of blaming me or my colleagues, as they were entitled<br />to, some people blamed Mr. Holt. So what does Mr. Calwell do?<br />He says, " Now, I must cash in. I do not think that if the<br />issue is between Calwell and Menzies the people will choose<br />Calwell. If I can persuade them that the issue is Calwell<br />versus Holt, and that Menzies is not in the picture at all, I<br />might snare a few people."<br />I take a poor view of such tactics. But I emphasise<br />to you that this is on amazing public confession on the part of<br />Mr. Calwell that in a fair fight he would not expect to beat me,<br />or the Government. After all, if he really believed that he<br />could defeat us in a general election which involved a contest<br />of leadership, he would not have found it necessary to resort<br />to this rather nasty manoeuvre designed to persuade people that<br />for purposes of this election I am a more figurehead, to be<br />set on one side when the eloction is over.</p>
