PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MY<br />
DOORSTOP, NT MUSEUM ABORIGINAL ART GALLERY<br />
DARWIN, 12 FEBRUARY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J. This morning's papers, the story on the new evidence about the East Timor<br />
massacre, have you got a comment on that? It seems to be more savage than we<br />
thought.<br />
PM: Well this was a very murky period and I don't think any of us profess to know the<br />
full details. There were still people missing, unaccounted for. But nor can we rely<br />
upon the reports that we have. I am afraid Mr Pilger's credibility is always under a<br />
cloud as his views about Cambodia last year revealed very starkly. At any rate, our<br />
Ambassador has got a routine visit with the Indonesian Foreign Minister in the next<br />
day or so, so we will be putting some questions to the Indonesian Government and<br />
no doubt we will get a response.<br />
J: The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory has described as blackmail your view<br />
that should there be a challenge to the Mabo Act,-no money will be forthcoming for<br />
the setting up of the administration in the Territory. What's your view?<br />
PM: Well, the Commonwealth has made a very generous offer. I mean, we have these<br />
niggly remarks sometimes by other people, but we are paying half the legal costs of<br />
managing, half the managerial costs of this claims process, and hearing process, and<br />
we are picking up 75 per cent of the compensation costs right back to 1975. Now,<br />
you have got to say, well, what else would they require of us? You know, to pick<br />
up 100 per cent of everything? I mean, it is after all these Governments who issued<br />
the leases, not the Commonwealth. So, it is very generous on our part. At any<br />
rate can I say that these issues will be worked out over time and we will be trying<br />
to make the whole system work as effectively as we can.<br />
J: But it is a big ask to ask State Governments to surrender their fight to challenge<br />
Commonwealth legislation. So the land rights Act here was in th-e-Courts for years<br />
from both sides sorti-n-git out to a workable piece of legislation.<br />
PM: We can't ask anyone to surrender their rights to challenge anything we do in the<br />
courts. And we are not asking them. But nor can they suggest that the<br />
Commonwealth Parliament hasn't a ight to legislate of course we have. </p>
<p>J: So, that last line in your letter from last Friday, I think, is not a suggestion to the<br />
States that they won't see any money if they're non-cooperative in challenging the<br />
Act through the Courts will be seen as being non-cooperative?<br />
PM: If they are not adopters of the scheme of arrangement in the Bill, they will be a<br />
non-cooperating State and Territory and they will carry the costs themselves.<br />
Now, that's what we are making clear to them. The Commonwealth Parliament's<br />
legislated a State or a Territory has the right to go it alone, but then they will not<br />
have the financial support we have just spoken of.<br />
J: Will there be a consent provision in the social justice package attached to the<br />
Native Title issue?<br />
PM: What do you mean?<br />
J: Veto. Certainly the Aboriginal groups are pushing for missed the veto..<br />
( inaudible)... Native Title legislation.<br />
PM: Native Title legislation has no veto arrangements, and there are two things which<br />
the Aboriginal community sought, but which we were not able to give them. That's<br />
the ownership of minerals and a veto right. What we have got is, I think, usefual,<br />
workable, consultative negotiation processes and an arbitration process in the<br />
Native Title Bill. It is a very good piece of legislation. And that's why, frankly, all<br />
the States should support it, and that includes the Northern Territory and that<br />
includes Western Australia.<br />
J: But the Northern Land Council and others are hoping for a veto under the social<br />
justice package, are you completely ruling that out?<br />
PM: There will be no vetos. There are not going to be vetos.<br />
J: Is there any danger that this afternoon's football game, which you have primarily<br />
come up for, is a black against white game, not black against black and white?<br />
PM: No, I don't think so. I think it is a good thing to celebrate the contribution of<br />
Aboriginal sports people to this country. And in the great code of Australian rules<br />
there has been a tremendous contribution by Aboriginal Australians. Now, nobody<br />
says when they get the State of Origin side together to battle it out with NSW...<br />
and in some way there is a sort of, what shall we call it, some sort of regional<br />
Queensland thing... any more than I think it is appropriate to say that if the All<br />
Stars come together as a team drawn from all over Australia to play Australian<br />
rules against one of the great sporting clubs of this country, Collingwood, that it is<br />
in any way other than what it seems. That is, basically, a celebration of the fact<br />
that just like the members of the State of Origin play all over the rugby league code<br />
in this country, so too will the All Stars play all over the code of Australian Rules.<br />
So, you know, I think that stuff is basically narks.<br />
J: So, who is going to win?<br />
PM: I think everyone is going to win, I said this yesterday, I think everyone is going to<br />
win. Because it is a good thing to be doing. It will be pretty hard to get a draw </p>
<p>out of all this, so someone will probably win the game. But everyone will win from<br />
having had it.<br />
J: Territory Labor has been in the political wilderness longer than the Federal<br />
Opposition, what advice would you give your colleagues on<br />
PM: To keep on doing what they are doing. I think they are about to come out of the<br />
wilderness in a big way. I am very confident that we will see the defeat of this tired<br />
administration here in the Northern Territory. Tired, without ideas, not up to the<br />
great fuiture which I think the Territory has. And I think the team which Brian Ede<br />
leads has every opportunity now of becoming the Government of the Northern<br />
Territory at the next election.<br />
J: You have probably heard that journalists in the top end are pretty fair game for the<br />
pollies up here, any thoughts on Territory politics?<br />
PM: On Territory politics?<br />
J: The style.<br />
PM: On the style. I think politics is much the same the country over. But just as after<br />
years a Labor Government came to Canberra and renewed and reinvigorated<br />
this country, rebased its wealth, I think the opportunity of the Northern Territory<br />
now as it is close, one of the great gateways, the nearest gateway to Asia, growing<br />
as it is in these great tourism and mining industries and agricultural industries it<br />
requires a Government better than it has. And I think the Labor Party can provide<br />
that Government.<br />
Ends </p>
