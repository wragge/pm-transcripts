STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, TH1 IHO N P J KFATING SIP<br />
VISIT TO NEW ZFALAND<br />
At the invitation of Prirnc Minister Bolger, I Shall Make an official visit to<br />
New Zealand from 20 to 23 May.<br />
The visit will provide a valuable opportunity to rcaffirmn the relevance and vitality of<br />
the Australia-Ncew Zealand relationship at a tinie when bothi countrics are undergoing<br />
significant economic and social change, and as we position ourselvcs to take full<br />
advantage of closer integration with the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
It is fitting that New Zealand should be the destination of my first over-seas visit since<br />
the March election. Thc trans-Tasman relationship is among Australia's most<br />
important reflecting thc weight of the interests and values we share with New Zealand.<br />
Two-way trade bctween the two countries has grown rapidly since the signing of thc<br />
Australia-New Zcaland Closer Economic Relatioi s To ISAgreenient ( CER) in 1983<br />
and reached over $ 5 billion in 1991-92. New Zealand is Australia's third largest<br />
trading partner, and Australia is Ncw Zcaland's largest. Investnment between Australia<br />
and Ncw Zealand has also grown rapidly to reach a two-way total of about<br />
$ 13.5 billion in 1991.<br />
Increasing interaction between the Australian and New Zealand economics provides a<br />
sound basis for the two countries to eomipctc succesully in the wider international<br />
economy. Creating a singlc mnarkct in Australasia under CER should not be an end in<br />
itsclf. Rather the CER process should be uscd as a platform for both countries to<br />
engage more closely with the dynamic Asia-Pacific regio.<br />
The strength of the bilateral relationship is also reflected in the scale of people-topeople<br />
contacts between the two countries. Over 800,000 Australians and<br />
New Zealanders travelled across the Tasman on short-termi visits in 1991. Australia is<br />
the largcst source of visitors to New Zealand, and New Zealand ranks third as a source<br />
of visitors to Australia. Nearly 290,000 New Zealanders are long-termn residents of<br />
Australia. I expect the agenda for my discussions with Prime Minister lHolger and his Ministers<br />
will be wide ranging and include the further development of our substantial economic<br />
relationship, trans-Tasman aviation and travel arrangements, defence relations, our<br />
respective approaches to closer economic integration with the Asia-Pacific rcgion, and<br />
Australia-New Zealand cooperation in the South-West Pacific.<br />
