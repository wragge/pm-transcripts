    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So, Prime Minister - are you concerned that General Powell's comment seems to back up the recollection of Mike Scrafton?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I'm not because he reported Mr Scrafton's version of a conversation with somebody else - it doesn't back it up. It merely reports that that's what Mr Scrafton said.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You spoke to him twice that night - is it possible that you got it wrong?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I'm not going into any of the detail. I had these statements taken and I decided in the interest of full disclosure and transparency to put them out. I think the public is bored, bored to death with this issue. They want to move on, they want to hear about the future of this country from me and from Mr Latham - they're not interested in arguing the toss about the outcome of the last election.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, why was it important to talk to Mark Scrafton twice that night?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I've already explained that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you saying this is not going to be a federal election issue this time around?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I haven't said when the election is going to be. I haven't at any stage encouraged speculation about a particular date.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will this be an issue?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm not getting into that. There will be an election and it will be fought on the future of Australia. The Australian public want to know my vision for the future of this country, they're not interested in rehashing the last election.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, do you accept the findings of the US investigation regarding Major George O'Kane?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't Senator Hill is getting further briefing on that and I indicated this morning that when we have further information we'll have something to say about, but until we do have that information it's important that we just hold our piece.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Was he prevented from talking?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are getting information on the American report and until we have that information I don't have anything further to say.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, just back on this Scrafton matter clearly if you do return to parliament next week there would be a great deal of interest in it and they again would be hauling you over the coals or attempting to at least - is there more of a temptation now to go to Yarralumla on Sunday?  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The Australian public, and they're the people I care about, are interested in the future of this country, they're not interested in re-fighting the last election. Mr Beazley and the Labor Party might be, but I'm not, nor are 19-20 million Australians.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the Opposition is saying that this is maneuvering to leave the way open for an election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, isn't that interesting because two days ago Mr Latham was saying bring it on. Two days ago Mr Latham says bring it on, today Dr Emerson says the complete opposite. They don't even have their lines right on, sort of, pre-election speculation.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, how can you say that the Australian people are getting sick of this issue? What's your indicator?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's what they have been telling me. Lots of people. I talk to a lot more people than, I think, some other people do. Any other questions?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, do you think it's a mistake the Labor Party have focussed so much on this issue?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that is a matter for the Australian people to judge but what I'm telling you is that the Australian public want to know from me about the future, not about the past. The next election will be about the future, it will not be about the past. Thank you.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Tasmania?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah, Tasmania. Yes.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>These statutory declarations that your office has signed, were this statutory declarations signed?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no. There were no statutory declarations.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, because you're not required to make a statutory declaration when you make a signed statement and the statements from the General and the Commander were not statutory declarations either.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Just on Tasmania - should we expect a Tasmanian package from your side of politics?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think you will find in the election that we will have something special for Tasmania. We always have in the past.  Not withstanding the fact that 60% of the Tasmanian Budget comes from the GST and Federal Government payments, in the past we've always had something additional for Tasmania and that will be the case in this election as well.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Nothing to tantalise us with?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Can I tantalise you? No, I don't think I'll tantalise you tonight. But I can assure you that there will be a Tasmanian package.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, do you think any dissatisfaction of the State Labor Government's handling of the Richard Butler affair could translate federally for you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I do know there's deep anger within the Tasmanian community stretching back to the original appointment, most Tasmanians saw it as a very bad appointment and are unhappy about the way in which it's been handled and I can say that I think it's been handled with great dignity and skill by Rene Hidding. I think he handled it carefully and in a way that didn't do damage to the office, but rightly sheeted the blame home to the Government. In the end these appointments are made by Governments, by Premiers and it was a very bad appointment, it should never have been made and it's scarcely surprising that it ended the way it did.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What do you make of the size of the ex gratia payment made to him?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I share the view of a lot of people on that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Our Premier wants the issue to go away?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sure he wants it to go away.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Is there more to this?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, look, I think it's a matter for the Tasmania parliament and the Tasmanian people but I can understand the depth of anger because you are dealing with an important office and whether you are a republican or an anti-republican - that matters not, it's an important office, it's particularly valuable in a state like Tasmania and it should be treated with the respect that it deserves.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is it your view that there is inextricable link between the payment and his resignation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I'm not going to get into the detail of that. That is a matter for the local practitioners to look after. I think we might call it a night. I've done well.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can I ask how committed you are to perhaps picking up that third Senate seat, perhaps Brian Harradine...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I never take anything for granted in politics. I will work very hard to win the support and trust of the Tasmanian people in the election. I hope to win some seats - it's going to be hard, but I've got some good candidates, particularly Michael Ferguson here in Bass.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is Bass a real contest?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Of course it's a contest.</p>
<p> Thank you.</p>
