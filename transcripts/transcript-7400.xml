    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Â 22 SeptemberÂ 1988</strong></p>
<p>1 am very pleased to announce that the President of Italy,Â His Excellency the Honourable Francesco Cossiga, will make aÂ State visit to Australia in our Bicentennial year. He willÂ be in Australia from 10-17 October.Â </p>
<p>During his visit, President Cossiga will travel widely inÂ Australia and will meet the Premiers and Governors ofÂ New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland.Â He will also meet members of the Italian Community in manyÂ centres around Australia. While in Canberra, PresidentÂ Cossiga will stay at Government House as the guest of theirÂ Excellencies the Governor-General and Lady Stephen.Â </p>
<p>I look forward to welcoming President Cossiga as the firstÂ Italian Head of State to visit Australia in more than 20Â years.</p>
<p>The President's visit will add an extra dimension to theÂ very close and friendly relations which already existÂ between the peoples of Australia and Italy and will also, IÂ believe, help point to some of the economic, cultural andÂ other areas where our relationship has potential to expand.Â The Italian economy is one of the most outstandinglyÂ successful in Western Europe with Italy now being one of theÂ top five industrial powers in the world. There is thus, IÂ am sure, great scope for the expansion of economicÂ co-operation between our two countries.</p>
<p>The President's visit will also serve to celebrate theÂ magnificent contribution to this nation of almost,Â one million Australians who are ethnically and culturallyÂ linked to Italy.</p>
<p>The President will be accompanied, in Brisbane and Canberra,Â by Italian Foreign Minister Mr Guillo Andreotti andÂ Mrs Andreotti. The Italian Deputy Foreign Minister,Â Mrs Susanna Agnelli, will accompany the President fromÂ Brisbane in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney. Mr AndreottiÂ will hold separate talks with the Minister for ForeignÂ Affairs and Trade and other Cabinet Ministers. PresidentÂ Cossiga will also be accompanied by Mr Oscar Mamni, Minister Â for Telecommunications, and Mrs mammi, and Ms Vincenza BonoÂ Parrino, Minister for Culture.Â </p>
