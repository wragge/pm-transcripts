<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister could you give us your impressions of what you';ve seen at the Acropolis?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it';s an impressive place.  I';ve visited here a couple of times previously, but not at such a stage of advanced restoration.  It';s a reminder of the ancient contribution of Greece to the world, particularly in the area of democracy.  You can';t come to Athens without thinking of the debt that we all owe to the Greeks for giving us the most durable and best form of Government mankind';s ever devised.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Does it embolden you to lobby the British Government to return the Elgin Marbles?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I put the view of many Australians to the British Prime Minister.  In the end it';s a matter between Greece and the United Kingdom, but certainly he';s aware that there are a lot of Australians who have views on it and very strong views.<br />
JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what does it mean to you to be here as leader of a nation in the cradle of democracy?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you always I suppose go back to your basic values and emotions when you come to a place like this just as you go to Westminster in our tradition you are reminded of that contribution.  If you go to Washington and go to Congress you';re reminded of that being a great citadel of freedom, so in different ways all of those places but none earlier and none in a more enveloping way than Athens is contributed to our system of Government.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what do you (inaudible) on the eve of your visit to Rome and your meeting with the Pope?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I';m looking forward to seeing his Holiness.  I have a great respect for him as an individual.  The contribution he made to the freeing of his native Poland at the time of the solidarity movement and the part that played in the destruction of the Soviet Union is something for which, separately from his religious leadership of the Catholic Church, he';ll be remembered as a member of the broader Christian community, albeit with a different heritage than the Pope';s.  I admire and respect him very much and I will be carrying with my meeting with him, I';ll be carrying the greetings of many millions of Australian Catholics and I think the goodwill of all Australians, whether they are Catholic or not.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, do you expect the issue of stem cell research to be raised by the Vatican?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I';ve no idea what he';s going to raise.  I mean he';s perfectly entitled to say anything he likes to me I think, I think Pope';s are entitled to express views on any subject they choose and I certainly won';t be delivering any advance guidelines to what  His Holiness should raise with me.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But you don';t find it uncomfortable to have to defend the position would you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don';t find the position I have on stem cell research as being in any way uncomfortable.  I have, in the end, looked to my own conscience as we';re all required to do on these matters and I';m satisfied that the position being put in the Bill is a proper one and balances all of the interests.  I respect the fact that there are a number of people in my own party and indeed some in the Labor Party who would disagree with me and that';s why we';re having a conscience vote, a free vote, each person to look to his or her conscience.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
