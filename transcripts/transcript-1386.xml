FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 85/ 1966<br />
ASSISTANCE TO SUGAR INDUSTRY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
The Premier of Queensland has made strong representations<br />
to me concerning the difficult situation facing the sugar<br />
industry in Queensland and New South Wales.<br />
Primarily this has come about through the catastrophic<br />
fall in the world free market price for sugar. This has<br />
happened at a time when the large expansion programme undertaken<br />
by the industry some years ago is coming to fruition in a big<br />
increase in sugar production.<br />
Recognising the great importance of the sugar<br />
industry to Australia, especially as an export producer, the<br />
Commonwealth has been examining this problem earnestly and<br />
sympathetically. It is far from being an easy problem. Although on<br />
the production side the sugar industry is unquestionably sound<br />
and efficient, and although it has showm a commendable spirit<br />
of enterprise, it is up against a world market for its product<br />
which is extremely weak and may well remain so for a considerable<br />
time to come. In the circumstances, these quite uneconomic prices<br />
impose great financial difficulties on producers in the sugar<br />
industry and on the substantial communities in large areas in<br />
Australia which have been developed through the establishment<br />
of the sugar industry and depend on it for their livelihood.<br />
For the most part, there are no comparable alternative<br />
opportunities for production and employment in these areas.<br />
My colleagues and I have been-treating the matter<br />
as one of the greatest urgency and, in co-operation with the<br />
Queensland Government, our efforts will be continued until a<br />
solution has been found.<br />
