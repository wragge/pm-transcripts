TRANSCRIPT OF SPEECH AT RARUNGA SPORTS AND CULTURAL<br />
FESTIVAL, NORTHERN TERRITORY 12 JUNE 1988<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
Traditional owners Of Barunga, tradtional owners from<br />
throughout the Northern Territory and those from South<br />
Australia, Western Australia and Queensland who are present<br />
with us today, Chairman, the Northern Territory Land<br />
Council, all Aboriginal people from elsewhere in Australia,<br />
my friend and colleague the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs<br />
Gerry Hand, and friends one and all.<br />
Could I say to you on behalf of Hazel and myself how<br />
thrilled we are to be with you today. I want to thank<br />
everyone who in any way has been responsible for the<br />
organisation of this welcome and for the which you have<br />
presented to us. To anyone who in any way has been<br />
responsible for today, our heart-felt thanks,<br />
As you know 1988 is a special year in Australia. I hope<br />
that you will understand that before this year arrived I had<br />
been trying to make all Australians understand that the 200<br />
years that are being talked about in this bicentenary year,<br />
I've asked all Australians to understand that those 200<br />
years which come on top of 40,000 years of Aboriginial<br />
culture, traditions and civilisation, that it is the<br />
Aboriginal people who were the prior occupiers and owners of<br />
this land. You were the people who for 40,000 years have<br />
cared for this land and it's only if we understand that that<br />
we are entitled in any way to have these celebrations in<br />
1988. It's because I see now the signs that are strongly emerging<br />
of the preparedness on the part of Aboriginal people and of<br />
non-Aboriginal people to start to talk sensibly about these<br />
things that I am so happy. I want, in front of all of you<br />
if I may, to pay a particular tribute to Gerry Hand, the<br />
Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, who I think more than<br />
anyone in non-Aboriginal Australia has taken the initiative<br />
to make these processes possible.<br />
What we have witnessed here today has been historic for two<br />
reasons. Firstly you have given us the opportunity of<br />
seeing the survival and the renewal of your great traditions<br />
and we thank you for the way in which you have allowed them<br />
to survive and ensured that they will. But the second thing<br />
that we have seen today is, I believe, truly historic. I<br />
have had the opportunity as you'll have witnessed to sit<br />
there with your leaders and they have put to me proposals<br />
with which I have been able to agree. </p>
<p>ILL 114 eo 1 1,2 1') o . u21 V.<br />
2-<br />
Those proposals that they have Put and with which I have<br />
agreed are these. Firstly, that there $ hall be a treaty<br />
negotiated between the Aboriginal people and the Government<br />
on behalf of all' the people of Australia. Secondly, that<br />
the next step is that you the Aboriginal people should<br />
decide what it is that you want to see in that treaty. The<br />
third step is that I have agreed that we should provide you<br />
with assistance to establish those consultation processes<br />
and in particular that there should be a committee of seven<br />
of your traditional elders who will have the responsibility<br />
for organising those consultations with the view to<br />
organising at the end of the consultations an Australia-wide<br />
convention which will represent the culmination of your own<br />
negotiations and discussions. Fourthly, that when you have<br />
conducted these processes of consultation that we as a<br />
government should then be prepared to receive and to<br />
consider the results of your thinking and your consultation.<br />
And fifthly, that we agreed that these processes should<br />
start before the end of this year and that we would expect<br />
and hope and work for the conclusion of such a treaty before<br />
the end of the life of this Parliament.<br />
Those are, the five considerations that your elders put to me<br />
and to which I agreed. So now what we expect to happen is<br />
that on your part, as I on behalf of the Government, having<br />
agreed that you will now start these processes of-talking<br />
amongst yourselves under the leadership of that committee of<br />
seven of your elders, to work out just what it is that you<br />
want to see. As you do that I give you the commitment of<br />
the preparedness, the willingness, the desire of my<br />
Government to respond positively.<br />
At the end of this process when these things-are done my<br />
fervent wish that I expressed, as you'll recall last year,<br />
my fervent wish is that at the end of that process a<br />
position will have been reached In which the non-Aboriginal<br />
people of Australia will recognise the injustices of the<br />
past, will recognise the obligations that we have to create<br />
an Australia in which your culture and traditions will not<br />
only be able to survive but to flourish, in which you the<br />
Aboriginal people will have the opportunity of living in<br />
dignity, living in an environment in which you will have the<br />
opportunity for self-management, in which your law and<br />
tribal customs will be able to apply to the maximum possible<br />
extent, that these things will be done, that you will have<br />
that sort of Australia in which to live and that you on your<br />
part will accept then that Australia has accepted and will<br />
continue to dischaig. e its commitment.<br />
when those things are done, when that agreement can<br />
culminate in that treaty, compact call it as we will<br />
decide that then after this 200 years that truly we will<br />
have an Australia within which the Aboriginal and the<br />
non-Aboriginal Australia will be able to live together truly<br />
in peace and in dignity in the situation in which we will<br />
respect one another and in an Australia in which you and all<br />
other Australians will be able to live the life that you<br />
desire. </p>

-3-<br />
It's been too long, far too long in achieving or even being<br />
able to think that we will reach that position and I do<br />
truly believe that as a result of what's been happening<br />
recently, and a large part of what we've been able to do<br />
today it's my belief that really now for the first time we<br />
can expect that sort of outcome to which I have referred.<br />
So to all of you that had any part in creating this positive<br />
atmosphere in which we can expect this outcome, I repeat my<br />
thanks and deep gratitude and give you my commitment, the<br />
commitment of my government and certainly the commitment of<br />
my minister that we will now stand ready to respond to these<br />
processes to which we have agreed today.<br />
Finally, on behalf of Hazel and myself I thank you for the<br />
paintings arid the other gifts that you've given to us today.<br />
We will take them back to Canberra with us and they will<br />
serve to remind me and Hazel, not only for the time that<br />
we're in government but for the rest of our lives, of a day<br />
that will always be in our memories. Thank you.<br />

TRANSCRIPT OF SPEECH BY GALARRWUY YUNUPINGU, CHAIRMAN, CENTRAL<br />
LAND COUNCIL, 12 JUNE 1988<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
I can see some smiles in the faces which is very much<br />
encouragement to all of us and I think to talk about after those<br />
statements that the PM has made it is something that we wanted to<br />
hear particularly at this gathering.<br />
PM does not know that the presentation hasn't ended yet so we<br />
will give him another surprise. And this surprise is one very<br />
important as a reminder to the PM and his Government and as a<br />
reminder to any other government who will take power of this<br />
country. That it will be something, something to remind any<br />
government who will run in its power to change policies and<br />
constitutions that Aboriginal people will always be in front of<br />
their policy making and decision making that we are people<br />
to this country, that the notice that we will present to the<br />
Prime minister' now will remind, not only Bob Hawke, but the next<br />
one after him and the next one after him and the next one after<br />
him and the next one after him and we can count that for another<br />
twenty to a hundred years. And after and more after and forever.<br />
This is the country we are talking about, the country of<br />
Australia and if that is the case you are now witnessing the<br />
people who express their desire of ownership and belongingness,<br />
that we are part of it. We always will be as we, in this<br />
celebration of the Bicentennial year, we do want to celebrate the<br />
way it is being celebrated this year, but separately. Let's<br />
celebrate the next 200 years of Australia jointly and if that<br />
statement will go and last for the next 200 years let's achieve<br />
it now, And I'll stop there because somebody with big ears and<br />
televisions and radios, they are all over the place here, might<br />
twist my political statements and make it as a political<br />
nonsense. But if that is the case let them make their own<br />
statements, let them run it, but let's run it if there's a media<br />
in the crowd please make it right. Make it right that we have<br />
been waiting for the day that has happened now.<br />
( tape break)<br />
a petition that unites Aboriginal people throughout<br />
Australia. That thi6 petition will be presented to the<br />
Commonwealth Government of Australia while Bob Hawke is the Prime<br />
Minister and pass it on to the next one and the next one and the<br />
next one and the next one and the next one and the next one. And<br />
I will make him responsible that he will honour that this<br />
petition will greet this brand new Parliament House of Australia,<br />
not forgetting and leaving Aboriginal people right out of what<br />
Australia is all about.<br />
Thank you.<br />
