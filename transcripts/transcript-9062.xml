Further to my Statement to Parliament of 28 September, I am pleased to<br />
confirm that His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales will visit Australia from<br />

His Royal Highness will visit New South Wales, Tasmania, Western Australia<br />
and Queensland. The detailed program has been settled in conjunction with<br />
St. James's Palace and the relevant States.<br />
Features of the Prince of Wales' visit to New South Wales will include<br />
participation in Sydney's Australia Day celebrations at Darling Harbour; and a<br />
visit to Parkes and Forbes to meet farmers. He will also hold a meeting of his<br />
Business Leaders' Forum. In Tasmania the Prince will visit Hobart; spend a<br />
day in Strahan and Queenstown, with a focus on the mining and tourist<br />
industries; and visit Launceston to see work on the Railway Yards restoration<br />
project. In Western Australia he will visit Perth, hold discussions with youth<br />
trainees engaged on restoration work; and visit a child health institute. He<br />
will visit Karratha to view the Woodside LNG plant, and Deep Gorge<br />
Aboriginal site. In Queensland, His Royal Highness will visit Gladstone,<br />
Bundaberg and Fraser Island.<br />
Details of the State programs will be announced by the relevant State<br />
