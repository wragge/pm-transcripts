PRIME MINISTER FRIDAY, 23 MAY, 1980<br />
From the Press Office<br />
SUMMARY OF ABC'S a<br />
The Australian Olympic Federation today makes its T_ alA<br />
decision on attending the Moscow Games. ' AM' look~ tL<br />
the way other countries throughout the world have r' ~ xded,/<br />
to the call for a boycott of the Games, as well as t~ . vews<br />
* of the Australian Government and Opposition. First, the<br />
Prime Minister, Mr. Fraser:<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
I very strongly adhere to the view that the Government<br />
has stated right from the outset. Even though we know it<br />
involves difficulty for athletes and are sympathetic to that,<br />
we strongly have the view that Australia should not send a<br />
team to the Moscow Olympics. The Soviet Union has moved a<br />
very large and powerful army into Afghanistan.-a small,<br />
inoffensive, nion-aligned country. There is no justification<br />
for their move whatsoever. The Soviet Union has to understand<br />
that the Western world, independent nations of the world,<br />
are prepared to take actions to bring home their abhorrence<br />
and repugnance of that active invasion and suppression of<br />
a people. That is what it is all about. I have hardly<br />
met a person who doesn't say that boycotting the Moscow<br />
Olympics is the best way of bringing the message home to<br />
the Soviet Government and people. our own Olympic Committee<br />
and Federation know the Government's views. I very much hope they<br />
will heed the Government's views in this particular matter,<br />
because when they make a decision it will be one that does not<br />
only involve sport, it involves the future of Australia in<br />
a real sense. It doesn't only involve sportsmen and women,<br />
it involves all Australians, young and old.<br />
Next, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Hayden:<br />
Hayden I believe Aus tralia ought to go. Australian athletes ought<br />
to participate.-it is quite clear that there will not be<br />
an effective boycott. A majority of the important countries<br />
of the world are going. It even seems as though the West<br />
German athletes may go. But in any case, most of the important<br />
countries are going, a majority of the African, and the Latin<br />
American countries are going. The simple fact is this: not<br />
being there will just impose an enormous sacrifice on Australian<br />
athletes; deny them the opportunity, quite literally, of a<br />
lifetime for them. It will do absolutely nothing about the<br />
Soviet military presence in Afghanistan. If anything, that<br />
presence will be larger and more formidable after the period<br />
when these Olympics are over. And there are other ways which<br />
will have to be explored to try to discourage Russia for her<br />
behaviour, quite inexcusable, in Afghanistan. But imposing this<br />
burden of sacrifice on Australian athletes is not the solution,<br />
and more than that, it reflects a very unfair, a very uneven<br />
way of responding to this problem. Wool, wheat, meat, minerals,<br />
all these things where vast profits are being made, continue to<br />
be sold to the Soviet Union. And indeed, contracts which expire<br />
for wheat, for instance, will be re-negotiated. / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
" AM" prepared an international round-up on the boycott.<br />
First to the home of the boycott, the United States.<br />
Report from Geoff McMullen.<br />
United States<br />
In President Carter's words, the United States does not<br />
wish to be represented in an Olympic host country that is<br />
invading and subjugating another nation in direct violation<br />
of human decency and international law. The American<br />
Government has fought hard to carry out the spirit of<br />
Mr. Carter's words and to rally other nations to express<br />
opposition to that picture of Soviet tanks rolling across<br />
Afghanistan, a strategic event, according to the Americans,<br />
that leaves the oil supplies of the Western world more<br />
vulnerable, and the Soviet Union poised to encourage more<br />
internal subversion in the shaky states around the Persian Gulf.<br />
The American Congress, and this nation at large, have been<br />
overwhelming supportive of President-Carter's call for a<br />
Moscow Olympic boycott. Few have expressed much pleasure<br />
about not competing in. Moscow, but it was widely agreed here<br />
that this was the moral and strategic course of action. For<br />
America's athletes, one of the greatest competitive teams on<br />
earth, I saw them at their training camp in the Rockies, feeling<br />
wretched that years of work would not give them the chance<br />
at an Olympic gold medal. In Washington today, a minority<br />
of 25 athletes was defeated in a last court action to request<br />
their Olympic Committee to change its mind. Difficult as<br />
that decision was last month, the American Olympic Committee<br />
voted overwhelmingly to boycott the Games, and that sealed<br />
America's course. The majority of the athletes, and of all<br />
Americans, has accepted and reacted with solidarity and<br />
patriotism to the President's call.<br />
Canada Despite the intention of several European countries to<br />
send Olympic teams to Moscow, the Canadian Government is<br />
holding firm to its commitment to boycott the Games. The<br />
decision, which had been made on April 22, will not be changed,<br />
says External Affairs Minister, who has also made it clear<br />
that the Canadian Government is disappointed by the defection<br />
of so many European allies from the boycott. In fact, it<br />
was on the premise that those allies would speak with a single<br />
voice against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, that Canada<br />
made its own announcement, somewhat belatedly compared to<br />
other countries. A few weeks before Ottawa had announced its<br />
intention to boycott the Games, the Canadian Olympic Committee<br />
had said it would send a full team. But when the Government<br />
finally did act four weeks ago, the Olympic Committee quickly<br />
acceded to the Government's wishes. Canadians by and large<br />
seem to favour the boycott. That is partly because the US<br />
is Canada's closest neighbour and major defence partner. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
New Zealand<br />
Here in New Zealand, the national Government of<br />
Prime minister Rob Muldoon has made its no-go policy very<br />
clear. It has withdrawn the right of employees of the State<br />
to take special leave to go and participate, axed offical<br />
Government presence at the Games, and ordered its Moscow<br />
Embassy to provide none of the special assistance to<br />
competitors usually provided. But it is sticking to its<br />
policy, in name at least, in not interferring in sports<br />
decisions. The sportsmen themselves are split. IMost favour<br />
going, though yachtsmen, for example, voted against it, some<br />
with their boats already aboard ships steaming for Moscow.<br />
Meanwhile, the New Zealand Olympic Games Association is also<br />
divided. It has already voted as a whole to go, and the<br />
acceptance has gone to the Russians. But New Zealand<br />
Olympic chief, Lance Cross, has indicated he is against that<br />
decision and has called a meeting to review it. That<br />
was due last night, but it has now been postponed until next<br />
Thursday, much to the disappointment, we understand, of<br />
Australian Games officials who were hoping for a strong<br />
New Zealand vote in favour of going to strengthen their hand<br />
in making their decision today.<br />
Most African countries are going. However, as John Burrell<br />
reports, the continent's newest nation, Zimbabwe, is still<br />
undecided. Zimbabwe/ Zambia<br />
Newly independent Zimbabwe has not yet decided whether it will<br />
be sending athletes to the Moscow Olympics. It has been<br />
invited by the IOC, but Prime Minister Robert Mugabe, whose<br />
relations with Moscow are far from good, has yet to give the<br />
go-ahead. While sportsmen wait for the decision, however, the<br />
local Olympic Committee is preparing a team which will<br />
athletes, a shooting team and yachtsmen. The Committee<br />
Chairman said it would be a pity, after so many years of<br />
isolation following Mr. Smith's unilateral declaration of<br />
independence*, if newly independent Zimbabwe was not<br />
represented at: Moscow. Across the Zambisi River in Zambia,<br />
preparations for the Moscow Olympics have been underway for<br />
months. Like many other African countries, Zambia has rejected<br />
American pleas for a boycott of the Moscow Games. Its argument<br />
is that as Western countries refusedto support Africa's appeal<br />
for a boycott of the last Commonwealth Games, because of<br />
New Zealand's sporting links with South Africa, there is no<br />
reason why Zambia should support a basically Western boycott<br />
of the Moscow Olympics.<br />
Israel Israel's Olympic Committee decided to boycott the Moscow<br />
Games by a vote of 17 against 8 just 48 hours before the<br />
deadline. This followed a recommendation for boycott by<br />
the Prime Minister, Mr. Begin, and by the sports committee of<br />
the Knesset Israel Parliament in Jerusalem. The athletes are<br />
disappointed, but they don't question the wisdom of the Olympic<br />
Committee's boycott decision. This country has often been the<br />
victim of discrimination by Arab States in international sports / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Israel ( cant)<br />
meets, Israel has told the United States that in future<br />
it counts on American support to fight such discrimination<br />
against Israel as a gesture to mark Israel's refusal to<br />
go to Moscow.<br />
The debate in Britain has been an intensely political one, with<br />
the Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, taking a tough stand<br />
against participation.<br />
Britain Most of Britain's sporting bodies have rejected Government<br />
calls to boycott the Olympics. So Britain will be represented<br />
at Moscow. But some teams won't be there. The yachting,<br />
equestrian and hockey teams have decided not to go, and the<br />
shooting team are still deciding. And the overall size of<br />
the British Olympic team has had to be cut by a third to<br />
200 athletes. The Olympic appeal has fallen well short of<br />
its target. The Government grant has been withdrawn, and<br />
many companies have also withheld their financial support.<br />
Mrs. Thatcher has conducted an unrelenting campaign against<br />
Britain's athletes for their decision to go to Moscow, and<br />
this wveek she made a final appeal for a change of heart.<br />
She said medals won at Moscow will be of inferior worth, and<br />
the ceremonies a charade. But most British athletes have<br />
said they are sick and tired of the repeated calls for a<br />
boycott. It is generally agreed that Mrs. Thatcher made<br />
a tactical error in pushing them too hard and too early,<br />
and if anything, it has strengthened the resolve of many<br />
sportsmen and women. to press ahead regardless, to Moscow.<br />
Scandanavia<br />
Sweden will go the Moscow. There has been no significant<br />
public opinion against going, and no Government involvement<br />
in the decision. So, on Tuesday this week, the Swedish<br />
Olympic Committee opted to go to the Moscow Games. As far<br />
as the other Nordic countries are concerned, only Norway<br />
has decided to back Carter's boycott. The Norwegian Government<br />
came out early, and strongly, for a boycott. The Norwegian<br />
Olympic Committee decided to let Parliament make the decision<br />
and thedecision was not to go. The day the word came through,<br />
Norwegian wrestlers walked out en masse from the European<br />
Wrestling Championships, saying that if they were not to be<br />
allowed to compete against Russians in Moscow, it was<br />
hypocrisy for Norway to compete against them in the European<br />
Championships. The wrestlers action was a protest at their<br />
own Olympic Committee. Norway, Denmark and Iceland are all<br />
members of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, and<br />
are allies of the United States. However, the Norwegian<br />
Government was alone in its will to boycott. Denmark and<br />
Iceland are going. Finland and Sweden are neutral countries,<br />
but Finland's neutrality is of a special sort, overshadowed<br />
as that country is by the Soviet Union, and with, the same sort<br />
of friendship treaty with Moscow that Afghanistan enjoys, or<br />
enjoyed. Thus, Finland announced early that it would be taking<br />
part. There was no dissension. </p>
<p>Italy Reported the Italians are deeply divided over whether<br />
to obey their Government's official decision this week<br />
to boycott the Games.<br />
The Italian. Government decided last Monday to follow the<br />
lead of most other Europeans and to boycott the Games.<br />
But the following day this decision was reversed by the<br />
Italian National Olympic Committee by a large majority<br />
vote. So now the athletes themselves are confused by what<br />
they call a decision Italian-style. About 200 Italian<br />
athletes were due to go to Moscow, a third of them serving<br />
in the armed forces. For them there will be no choice.<br />
They have to obey the Government order not to go. Teachers<br />
of physical education employed in State schools will also<br />
have to obey the ban. But many athletes say they intend<br />
to travel to Moscow all the same, even if there is no<br />
Italian flag and no national anthem.<br />
France France is also divided, despite the National Federation' s<br />
recent decision to take part in the Games.<br />
The French Government's attitude has always been that a boycott<br />
of the Games is an inappropriate repost to the Soviet<br />
intervention in Afghanistan. The Minister for Youth and<br />
Sport agreed, however, that there will be no point in France<br />
taking part in Gamnes reduced by other people's boycotts<br />
to an assembly of communist countries. On the other hand,<br />
it was for the French Olympic Committee to decide, which<br />
it recently did, saying France will take part in the Games.<br />
Not that this was a reflection of unanimous support. Four<br />
groups, representing football, hockey, ' ice skating and sailing<br />
wanted to delay a decision. Two, representing shooting and<br />
equestrian sports, had already announced that they did not<br />
wish to go to Moscow. Reaction among ordinary people has<br />
seemed to me uncomfortable. Athletes are divided as their<br />
Committee decisions showed, but one strong group here has<br />
announced that ' we don't want to be the hostages of politics.<br />
The Games belong to athletes and not-to Governments'.<br />
West Germany<br />
West Germany, regarded by many as the lynch pin in the<br />
boycott debate, has decided to stay away from Moscow.<br />
The Germans are angry and annoyed. Their decision to boycott<br />
the Games leaves them isolated in Western Europe, and their<br />
neighbours all decided to send teams to Moscow, with the<br />
exception of Norway, and tiny Lichenstein and Monaco. After<br />
the US boycott decision, the Bonn Government left no doubt<br />
it favoured a ban and it has given the political advice to<br />
the National Olympic Committee not to participate. After<br />
a lot of soul-searching, there was a majority of 59 to<br />
in favour of... a boycott. This met with public approval<br />
as 80% of the population were against German participation.<br />
The athletes are thinking differently. Their spokesmen said<br />
flaming appeals to the representatives to consider the interests<br />
./ 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
West Germany ( continued)<br />
of the athletes and not vote against Moscow. There<br />
is bitterness now, since the Germans are practically the<br />
only major sports nation in the world, besides the<br />
United States, which is not going.<br />
Here in Australia, the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr. Ellicott,<br />
has discounted reports that the German Olympic Committee<br />
is going to re-consider its decision to boycott the Games.<br />
Question IMr. Ellicott, is there any truth in the report that the<br />
Germans are re-considering their attitude towards competing<br />
in the Moscow Olympics?<br />
Mr. Ellicott<br />
I have had checks made with the Australian Embassy in Bonn,<br />
and the information we have received from them is that there<br />
is no substance to the story that the West German Committee<br />
is likely to re-consider its decision. And that has been<br />
checked with the Foreign Ministry in West Germany.<br />
Rita flamlyn in Melbourne: From what we learnt last night,<br />
the Australian vote today will be close. Kevin Gospers,<br />
the Australian representative on the International Olympic<br />
Committee has just arrived in from overseas to attend the<br />
meeting. Ten delegates in all, three from Victoria and<br />
NSW, one each from South Australia, Western Australia and<br />
Tasmania. The chairman. is Syd Grange from Sydney. We were<br />
told last night that he has never used his casting vote, but<br />
there was speculation that today it could be different.<br />
Secretary-General, Judy Patching, was non-committal about<br />
which way the delegates would vote. It would be, we were told,<br />
a very, very close vote. It would be a democratic vote.<br />
John Rodder, South Australian-delegate,-says " yes, we are<br />
going", for Tasmania it is predicted that they will follow<br />
the no vote-. of the State body earlier this -year..<br />
West Australian Housen(?) is in the hot seat. Every sporting<br />
body in that State wants to go. NSW, from what we have learnt,<br />
appears divided. One of the most active pro-Moscow lobbyists<br />
is athlete, Chris Wardlaw. . He believes the vote will be very,<br />
very close, but they will make it to Moscow.. -His prediction:<br />
6 to 5 in favour. 1: 00 o'clock the meeting will begin. Four<br />
hours later, at 5: 00 pm, President, Syd Grange announces the<br />
result live on ABC radio. It will all be over: to Moscow<br />
or not. The tensions of the last few weeks will have ended<br />
for the delegates who have been -torn between the Federal<br />
Government's wish for a boycott, and the wish of most<br />
athletes to compete at Moscow. Last night, Kerry Wheel<br />
spoke to a tense Phil Coles in Sydney about the agonies of<br />
the boycott decision today. </p>
<p>-7<br />
Phil Coles<br />
I have known what was expected of me and I have canvassed<br />
the views of all of the sports involved in participation<br />
in the Olympic Games.<br />
Question If we do go then, what are our medal prospects?<br />
Coles Well, without putting too much pressure on the teams<br />
concerned, we have outstanding performances likely in<br />
rowing, canoeing. We have two very definite medal<br />
prospects. I understand the swimmers are really setting<br />
the pool on fire up in Brisbane, and there are one or two.<br />
track and field athletes that are bound to show up.<br />
Question<br />
How much. though, do you think the medals will be worth?<br />
Coles Well, I suppose you can say what is the worth of an<br />
Olympic gold nedal at any time.<br />
It is argued by some officials of the Australian Olympic<br />
Federation that the absence of the United States and<br />
West German athletes will affect only the track, field and<br />
swimming events in the Games. They further argue that<br />
if Australia goes to the Games, it has a good chance in other<br />
events. This argument seems curious if you look at<br />
Australia's medal history. Report from Graham Ramsey.<br />
Since the modern Olympics began in Athens in 1896,<br />
Australia has won a total of 175 gold, silver, and bronze<br />
medals. Most of those, 73%, have been awarded for swimming<br />
and track and field events. The rest, only 27%, have been<br />
presented for events such as yachting, equestrian sports,<br />
boxing and cycling.<br />
The civil insurrection in the provincial capital of<br />
Kwangju in the southwest of South Korea, has developed<br />
into a stand-off. 10,000 soldiers surrounded the city and<br />
the Korean airforce is standing by ready to strafe the<br />
city if necessary. Talks are being held between the South<br />
Korean administration and representatives of the people<br />
of Kwangju. / 8 </p>
<p>8<br />
Probably the most relieved Federal Minister now that<br />
Parliament is breaking for the winter recess, is<br />
Mr. Tony Staley. The Minister for Post and Telecommunications<br />
has been the target of Opposition Members in both Houses<br />
wanting to know why no action was taken over complaints<br />
by Sir Reginald Ansett that the Murdoch News Group had<br />
breached the Broadcast and Television Act in their purchase<br />
of Melbourne's Channel 0, now Channel 10. There have<br />
also been questions about the future of the Chairman of<br />
the Broadcasting Tribunal, Mr. Bruce Gyngell, whom Mr. Staley<br />
has appointed manager-designate of the proposed independent<br />
Multicultural Broadcasting Corporation. Talking of the<br />
independent Multicultural Broadcasting Corporation, the bill<br />
which would have brought the service into existence, was<br />
yesterday referred to a Senate committee, casting some doubt<br />
on the proposal to start ethnic television in October.<br />
, ir. Staley interviewed.<br />
In France, the governing board of the International Energy<br />
Agency has achieved important co-operation between its<br />
member countries, including Australia, on the question<br />
of oil imports. Report from John Starr in Paris: the IEA<br />
meeting has agreed to a substantial cut in oil imports by 1935<br />
as a means of conservation. 000---</p>
