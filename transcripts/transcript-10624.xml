    <content><![CDATA[<p>ANNOUNCER:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Howard says it was his most difficult and solemn</p>
<p>   decision. Now having agreed to offer military support to the US</p>
<p>   in the confrontation with Saddam Hussein, Mr Howard is on the media</p>
<p>   trail, his aim to sell the decision to the Australian people and</p>
<p>   boost the diplomatic pressure on Iraq in the hope that the military</p>
<p>   option may not be needed. In Canberra John Howard is with Paul Lyneham.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Prime Minister welcome again to Nightline.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Well you will be broadcasting live on the TV sets of Baghdad tonight</p>
<p>   via CNN, what is your message to Saddam Hussein?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p>For the sake of your own people comply with the United Nations</p>
<p>   resolutions.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>But it is going to have to be a total capitulation for the Americans</p>
<p>   to sail away now after they have put all that fire power in place,</p>
<p>   isn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p>What is involved here is, first and foremost, an endeavour to settle</p>
<p>   it peacefully by diplomatic means. Nobody wants a military strike.</p>
<p>   President Clinton said to me this afternoon on the phone that he</p>
<p>   does not want....</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Even with three carrier battle groups in place?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p>People don't like resorting to military force. I didn't</p>
<p>   find it easy to take the decision that was taken this morning, no</p>
<p>   Australian Prime Minister would.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Now the Americans don't really need Australia's help,</p>
<p>   do they? This is all about us showing that we are standing with</p>
<p>   Uncle Sam, isn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p>It is more than that. The most important thing is that it is a</p>
<p>   combined demonstration of a number of countries that people who</p>
<p>   imagine that they can stockpile and potentially use of weapons of</p>
<p>   mass destruction are going to be denied that capacity by the rest</p>
<p>   of the world. So it is not just a demonstration of our bonafides</p>
<p>   with the United States.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>But it is partly that, isn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p>The two reasons why we took the decision, are first and foremost</p>
<p>   as a demonstration to Saddam Hussein. And secondly, and very importantly,</p>
<p>   to defend the authority and the position of the United Nations.</p>
<p>   Because the inspections that Saddam refuses to have are being carried</p>
<p>   out under United Nations resolutions.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>But Prime Minister, Indonesia, Israel have been flouting UN resolutions</p>
<p>   for years and we are not going to send the SAS in against them?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p>But they are not threatening or have the capacity to deliver weapons</p>
<p>   of mass destruction against their neighbours.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>In Washington some are saying this is the time to wipe Saddam Hussein</p>
<p>   out once and for all, good idea?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is to enforce the United Nations resolutions,</p>
<p>   that is the purpose of it.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>But given that this military action is contemplated precisely because</p>
<p>   the Americans don't know exactly what he has got and where</p>
<p>   it is, how can any strike be in any way precise?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I wouldn't necessarily agree with the basis of that question.</p>
<p>   I think the American intelligence is a lot better than that.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>On the ground in Baghdad?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The American intelligence is quite good.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>So you don't think there is a real risk of major civilian</p>
<p>   casualties? Those horror pictures on the news?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Nobody can rule that out. And I want to say at the outset that</p>
<p>   I am not pretending that this will be pleasant, it won't if</p>
<p>   it happens and anybody who pretends that is being dishonest. But</p>
<p>   what alternative is there.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>But unless you flatten Baghdad and the surrounding regions he will</p>
<p>   just pick himself up again as he did after Desert Storm?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p>That is not the advice that we have.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>How could it be otherwise?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p>Well the advice is that there is a capacity for these strikes to</p>
<p>   be quite effective in relation to the material that we are concerned</p>
<p>   about.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>And no danger that with his back to the wall he may actually say,</p>
<p>   well let us use them then?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p>Well we don't believe so. We have taken a decision on the</p>
<p>   basis of intelligence and military advice, and not only from our</p>
<p>   own sources, which are very good, but also from the United States.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>And the fact that other countries like France, like Russia, like</p>
<p>   China, Saudi Arabia don't want to go along doesn't concern</p>
<p>   you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p>Well you haven't heard the last from those countries, you</p>
<p>   haven't. And I am very confident that as the days go by there</p>
<p>   will be support added to the United States-led effort.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>And the claim that this has been allowed to drift along for years</p>
<p>   but is now being accelerated by President Clinton because of Monica</p>
<p>   Lewinsky?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p>I don't believe that. I can understand why some people say</p>
<p>   it, but I don't believe it. I have looked at the merits of</p>
<p>   it, and the whole Cabinet looked at the merits of it, and the fact</p>
<p>   is that attempts have been made by the United Nations inspection</p>
<p>   teams to secure compliance over weeks and they have been rejected.</p>
<p>   Now I just don't accept it.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>And do you have any fears in your heart this could go terribly</p>
<p>   wrong some how?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p>You always have fears and worries. It is the hardest decision I</p>
<p>   have taken. It does involve risk to young Australian lives if there</p>
<p>   is a military operation, I understand that. I think the people involved</p>
<p>   understand that and our thoughts and prayers are very much with</p>
<p>   them if that ultimately turns out to be the case.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Prime Minister thanks for your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
