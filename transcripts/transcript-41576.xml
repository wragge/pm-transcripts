    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Now the first day of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting has concluded. Very productive deliberations.</p>
<p>But they began, as you know, at Buckingham Palace with the thanks of all leaders, all governments, all nations, for the extraordinary leadership Her Majesty the Queen has provided to the Commonwealth, founded in 1949. The modern Commonwealth was founded in 1949 by her father. She’s provided that leadership for nearly 70 years and it has been remarkable. Spanning so many decades, so many leaders so many chapters of history. So we’re all very grateful to her and all encouraged to hear the strong support for Prince Charles to succeed her in due time, as the Head of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Turning to the deliberations. Focused as always on ensuring the security and prosperity of the people of the Commonwealth, adherence to the rule of law is more important than ever. The rule of law is the foundation on which our security is based and of course that is the foundation for our prosperity as well.</p>
<p>So we were speaking about the importance of maintaining the rule of law in the cyber-sphere, online as well as offline. The importance of resisting absolutely, the use of chemical weapons, particularly as we’ve seen most recently here in the United Kingdom in Salisbury and of course in Syria where the decisive and calibrated action of the United States, the UK and France were so effective and has received such strong support.</p>
<p>So coupled with all of that, has been a lot of discussion about trade, vitally important. I didn’t see any protectionism around the table today, which is encouraging. A lot of discussions about the importance of the Trans Pacific Partnership and quite a lot of enthusiasm from countries that are not in the TPP, for potentially joining it in the future, including the United Kingdom I might add.</p>
<p>Finally I just note the emphasis today on the oceans. We in Australia have stepped up to take a leading role in terms of the maintenance and protection of coral reefs. We have special expertise of course in that area and there are many Commonwealth countries that are seeing their coral reefs under threat from pollution and of course from warmer sea temperatures.</p>
<p>So a very productive discussion and we look forward to the Leader’s Retreat tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>If Barnaby Joyce lost his job for engaging in an extramarital affair, why shouldn’t Prince Charles lose his plum position now? I mean, with his chequered history?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Thanks. Next question.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST: </strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister in what way did the UK express serious interest in joining the TPP?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>The United Kingdom has shown real interest, I’ve talked about this before Dennis. The UK has shown real interest in it. Obviously they’ll have to leave the European Union first, but we’ve had very preliminary discussions I guess, would be the best way of describing it. The UK has shown real interest and you can see the attraction of it to the UK, because if they were to join the TPP, they’d be entering into a high-quality trade agreement with 11 other countries in one hit.</p>
<p>Now of course, it’d have to be negotiated with all those 11 other countries including Australia. Nonetheless, it’s impressive, I think, to see the strong interest shown by the UK. Of course they’re just one of a number of countries. South Korea has shown strong interest as indeed has a number of other countries.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST: </strong></p>
<p>Would that be a good way for the UK to send a signal to the region about creating an economic [inaudible]? </p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>The answer is, Phil, potentially, yes. You’ve asked me whether the UK joining the TPP would be a way of extending British influence into the Asia Pacific. I think that it would be, the reality is that in the 21st Century the world is a very small place in terms of communications and trade. So, everywhere is close to everywhere else but the attraction of the TPP is very considerable. I just note that the UK has announced a number of new diplomatic missions, including three in the Pacific and we welcome that as well.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST: </strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister, you did say that all the leaders supported the promotion of Prince Charles going on to be the Commonwealth? I think that’s what you said?  Is that - ?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>No well, what I said is, there was strong support there, a huge debt of gratitude to Her Majesty the Queen. Overwhelming thanks from all of the leaders and Australia, as you know, strongly supports the continuation of the King and Queen of the United Kingdom as the Head of the Commonwealth. Of course Prince Charles will in the course of time, succeed his mother.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST: </strong></p>
<p>Sorry, just on your own position, you’ve made it clear in Australia’s case, we should shift towards a republic from the end of this monarch’s life. Why is it [inaudible] continue?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Well most countries in the Commonwealth are in fact republics. Of course the largest, India, is a republic and indeed India’s accession to the Commonwealth as a republic was that real evolution of the Commonwealth in 1949 that Her Majesty the Queen was referring to today.</p>
<p>So there is no inconsistency in being someone who advocates and supports Australia having an Australian as Head of State - as opposed to the monarch of the United Kingdom – and at the same time, saying that the Head of the Commonwealth, which is a ceremonial role, a role of honour rather than one of political authority, that role, I think should continue. I think this is the very widespread view; it should continue with the Queen’s successor.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST: </strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister, would you consider banning synthetic plastics in Australia? </p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, you’ve asked me about banning them in Australia? Look, the banning of plastic bags and other items of plastic has been debated in Australia over many years, it’s largely a matter of state regulation. The Productivity Commission has had a look at it and it’s something that has come up for review. But it - </p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST</strong></p>
<p>Do you support it?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, it’s not a simple matter, because it can impose additional costs and in fact create additional pollution. So the important point is to ensure that plastics, plastic waste does not find its way into our oceans.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST: </strong></p>
<p>News reports this morning suggests there was a robust exchange between the Chinese military and three Australian Navy (inaudible)</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>All I can say to you is that Australia asserts and practices its right of freedom of navigation throughout the world’s oceans, including of course the South China Sea. I’ll just take one more.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>All I can say to you is that we maintain and practice the right of freedom of navigation and overflight throughout the world and in this context, we’ve talking about naval vessels on the world’s oceans including the South China Sea. As is our perfect right in accordance with international law. Yes?</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST: </strong></p>
<p>The banking Royal Commission, do you express concerns [inaudible]?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>The Royal Commission is now established. It was established on very broad terms of reference, much broader than those that have been proposed by our opponents. The Commissioner is undertaking his work and I think we should allow that to continue. I just want to say in respect of, for example, the new, increased penalties that have been foreshadowed by Kelly O’Dwyer, this work that has been ongoing for some time.</p>
<p>We have taken the view that it’s important for the Government to get on with the job of financial reform. You’ve seen that we’ve strengthened ASIC. We’ve introduced one tranche of stronger financial regulation legislation after another, to protect consumers. Obviously all of that work will be informed by the work for the Royal Commissioner and I look forward to the completion of the inquiry.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
