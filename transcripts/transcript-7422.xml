CHALLENGES IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION'<br />
THE HON. R. J. L. HAWKE, AC, MP<br />
Sir Robert Garran was the first public<br />
servant of the Commonwealth of Australia and,<br />
in the period immediately after Federation, he<br />
was briefly our only public servant. In the<br />
succeeding decades Garran played a leading role<br />
in establishing the foundations of the public<br />
service as we know it today. At his retirement in<br />
1932 he had been a permanent head for thirtyone<br />
years a record period of service that, as<br />
the Australian Dictionary of Biography notes<br />
( Parker 1981, p. 623), is unlikely ever to be<br />
broken. Billy Hughes is supposed to have once said<br />
that " the best way to govern Australia was to have<br />
Sir Robert Garran at his elbow, with a fountain<br />
pen and a blank sheet of paper, and the War<br />
Precautions Act" ( Parker, p. 623). This<br />
judgement by Hughes goes to the heart of<br />
Garran's unique skills. Anyone reviewing this<br />
extraordinary career and assessing his immense<br />
contribution to the Commonwealth of Australia<br />
cannot but be impressed by two outstanding<br />
elements. First, Garran was the paragon of<br />
professionalism. He served eleven different<br />
Attorneys-General and sixteen Governments,<br />
covering the spectrum of political affiliations in<br />
that initial period of quite rapid political change.<br />
He served them all with absolute loyalty, and<br />
received their confidence and trust, setting a fine<br />
example of one of the most fundamental values of<br />
our Westminster-derived system of government.<br />
Second, as Garran responded to all the<br />
diverse challenges of administration he faced<br />
initially as an advocate and agent of Federation,<br />
then as the trailblazing public servant and<br />
parliamentary draftsman, then in the international field during and after the First<br />
World, War he proved an unquenchably<br />
creative force. In a time of change, his creativity<br />
in building new institutions, developing practical<br />
solutions and creating workable machinery still<br />
stands as an admirable model for his successors<br />
today. On the basis of my own experience of five<br />
and half years as Prime Minister, I can say that<br />
the Government I have the honour of leading has<br />
been well served by a public service which has<br />
sought, largely successfully, to emulate Garran's<br />
professionalism and his creativity.<br />
Indeed, I argue that today's public<br />
administrators those elected to parliament as<br />
well as those appointed to the bureaucracy<br />
face even greater challenges than those presented<br />
to Garran by Federation, Depression and World<br />
War. As tough as it would have been to establish a<br />
Commonwealth Government where none had<br />
been before, it is perhaps even tougher to manage<br />
and to reform machinery of government which is<br />
inherited. In the era of nuclear missiles, optical<br />
fibres, instant news and 24-hour money markets,<br />
it is anomalous that we face these challenges with<br />
a Constitution inherited from the days of the<br />
penny farthing bicycle.<br />
In the economic sphere, we face the<br />
challenge to restructure the Australian economy<br />
so as to guarantee the future prosperity of our<br />
people. And we must do this in an era when we<br />
can no longer assume, as those of Garran's and<br />
succeeding generations of Australians assumed,<br />
that greater prosperity results simply from<br />
shearing more sheep, harvesting more wheat and<br />
finding fabulous new veins of minerals and<br />

Melbourne; October 198&amp; </p>
<p>HAWKE<br />
metals. This restructuring process has been the<br />
principal activity of our Government over the<br />
past five and a half years. It has demanded a<br />
fundamental rethinking of the economic<br />
assumptions that we inherited from the past. At<br />
the same time it requires vigilant attention to<br />
ensuring our political arrangements remain<br />
relevant to the task we face without of course<br />
modifying the democratic and parliamentary<br />
character of our political system.<br />
To a large extent, meeting this challenge of<br />
restructuring has relied on improving the<br />
performance of the private sector, through for<br />
example practising the hard discipline of<br />
becoming more productive and competitive,<br />
making our manufacturing industry more<br />
efficient, boosting our research effort, and<br />
building new industries in the service and high<br />
tech areas.<br />
These have been areas of special priority for<br />
this Government and, thanks to the tremendous<br />
contribution we have received from the entire<br />
community, we are starting to see the fruits of our<br />
efforts: a more diverse and efficient economy<br />
capable of competing and winning on world<br />
markets. But it would have been senseless to have<br />
believed that restructuring was a task solely for<br />
the private sector and that the public sector was<br />
immune from a similar need to improve its<br />
performance. The public sector is a substantial employer<br />
and producer in its own right, and its functions in<br />
regard to the private sector, such as taxation,<br />
regulation, economic analysis and policy advice,<br />
have assumed critical importance in determining<br />
the overall efficiency of our economy.<br />
Further, the tendency over many years, and<br />
with increasing frequency since the Second<br />
World War, to see the answer to emerging<br />
community needs lying almost automatically in<br />
an expanded role for government has in fact<br />
created a number of problem areas, both<br />
potential and real. These include:<br />
* inefficiencies of excessive regulation;<br />
* the expensive spiral of government<br />
assistance, be it by direct payment to<br />
welfare recipients or indirectly to<br />
inefficient industries;<br />
* the distortion of the taxation system by the creation of rorts for the privileged few;<br />
the inefficiencies of overlapping local,<br />
state and federal jurisdictions;<br />
the pervasive role of statutory authorities;<br />
and the drain and danger caused by excessive<br />
federal budget deficits.<br />
In declaring my pride in my Government's<br />
record of achievement in minimising these<br />
danger areas, I hasten to point out that we have by<br />
no means accepted the simplistic analysis that<br />
small government is necessarily better<br />
government or that deregulation is a desirable<br />
end in itself. That is a misconception to which<br />
our conservative opponents fal victim with<br />
amazing regularity in the same way as, for that<br />
matter, some on the Left find themselves making<br />
the too-easy assumption of the desirability of<br />
government intervention. Deregulation and<br />
intervention are not ends in themselves; they<br />
may simply be means to the real goal which must<br />
be the creation of a fairer and a more efficient<br />
Australia. As a Labor Prime Minister I am proud of the<br />
way in which we have met our responsibilities as<br />
a Government, protecting the needy, helping the<br />
battlers, and making Australia a fairer society.<br />
And as a Prime Minister committed to reform, I<br />
am proud of Labor's proven capacity to improve<br />
the efficiency and competitiveness of our<br />
economy which is helping to guarantee the<br />
prosperity of all Australians.<br />
My point is that, in today's circumstances,<br />
unless there is constant vigilance by an elected<br />
government alert to the demands of the<br />
international economy, and unless organisational<br />
and attitudinal change becomes a constant part of<br />
the government's management of the<br />
bureaucracy, the public service may succumb to<br />
the almost overwhelming temptation to look<br />
inwards; to become absorbed in its own process<br />
rather than its output; to grow inexorably; in<br />
short, to serve its own ends. If that were to<br />
happen, our overall economic performance<br />
would suffer and the community would be the<br />
poorer. The business of government must be the<br />
provision of the greatest public good at the least<br />
private cost and the public service must<br />
achieve those ends without losing its professional<br />
capacity to serve governments of differing </p>
<p>CHALLENGES IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION<br />
political views and with different policy<br />
priorities. Indeed, that capacity should be always<br />
enhanced. In today's environment, when the economy<br />
as a whole must overcome its entrenched<br />
inflexibilities and inefficiencies, that<br />
prescription poses a massive management<br />
challenge. The aim of government must be not only to<br />
ensure that the public service does its own job<br />
professionally and efficiently. The aim must also<br />
be to ensure that the public service is not a<br />
stumbling block for broader, economy-wide<br />
change; indeed, that the public service becomes<br />
where possible an effective instrument for the<br />
achievement of that change.<br />
Having established this broad context, I<br />
want to describe the efforts my Government has<br />
made to achieve those goals, and to spell out our<br />
consistent set of principles which has<br />
underpinned those efforts. You will be broadly<br />
familiar with the extent of our reforms the new<br />
legislation in 1984, the budget reforms, the<br />
streamlining of personnel administration in 1986<br />
and our continuing reforms of statutory<br />
authorities. I have briefly outlined these changes<br />
in an appendix to this Oration. I will address in<br />
more detail here the important structural changes<br />
I announced in July last year and the associated<br />
changes in cabinet arrangements I announced the<br />
following month.<br />
Most commentators on the machinery<br />
changes have, perhaps not surprisingly, tended to<br />
concentrate on whether or not the two-level<br />
ministerial structure is working effectively.<br />
From my perspective it is working well a point<br />
I will return to shortly.<br />
It follows, however, that the commentators<br />
have put too little weight on the very substantial<br />
changes that have been wrought in the public<br />
service itself, and the improvements they have<br />
made to the quality of policy development work,<br />
to the capacity for co-operation and coordination<br />
within the public service, and to the<br />
degree of accountability and flexibility for<br />
managers. The likely benefit of these changes in<br />
improving the quality of management and<br />
decision-making was more important to the<br />
Government than the achievement of savings<br />
through the elimination of overlap and duplication. Commentators have similarly overlooked<br />
the importance of the changes in the cabinet<br />
committee system we introduced, and in<br />
particular our decision to establish three policy<br />
development committees:<br />
the Structural Adjustment Committee<br />
which co-ordinates reform of the microeconomy<br />
to achieve medium-term growth<br />
in our economy;<br />
the Social and Family Policy Committee<br />
which focuses on the development and<br />
implementation of our social justice<br />
strategy to ensure the fair distribution of<br />
the proceeds of economic growth<br />
throughout the community; and<br />
the Public Service Reform Committee<br />
which is concerned with further<br />
improvements in management in the<br />
public sector.<br />
Cabinet, of course, remains the supreme<br />
organ of the decision-making processes of the<br />
Government, and any major matters which<br />
might have their genesis in the committees will in<br />
the end be determined by the cabinet itself.<br />
But these new committees, like the<br />
Expenditure Review Committee in relation to the<br />
budget, have become the engine rooms of our<br />
decision-making processes. They are the forums<br />
in which ministers most directly concerned with<br />
the policy area can collectively and in detail<br />
consider the subject matter and develop policy<br />
proposals or positions for consideration by the<br />
full cabinet. Through these committees, we are<br />
generating a much greater ability for ministers<br />
collectively to engage in policy development,<br />
which had been essentially the preserve of one<br />
minister and most often one department.<br />
Moreover, the new policy development<br />
committees are supported in their work by<br />
groups or task forces of officials who are<br />
interacting more closely with the collective<br />
policy development role of the ministers.<br />
The new two-tier structure of government<br />
has undoubtedly facilitated this approach. Fewer<br />
departments need to be drawn into any particular<br />
policy development exercise and the barriers<br />
which used to exist between departments have<br />
been substantially reduced perhaps because<br />
each department now brings a broader area of<br />
responsibility and broader perspectives to bear </p>
<p>HAWKE<br />
on any given matter.<br />
A very good illustration of the benefits of<br />
this new approach was contained in this year's<br />
May Statement, in which we unveiled a major<br />
program of structural reform, substantial<br />
developments to advance our social justice<br />
objectives, and significant returns from the<br />
Efficiency Scrutiny program ( Keating 1988).<br />
These measures had been largely developed<br />
through the processes of the three policy<br />
development committees I referred to earlier,<br />
and by a great deal of hard work on the part of<br />
both the ministers on those committees and the<br />
officials supporting them. The new machinery<br />
has also, as I expected, fuirther improved our<br />
budget processes.<br />
This Government's period of office has been<br />
characterised by an unprecedented period of<br />
sustained expenditure restraint.<br />
The last three budgets have actually seen<br />
Commonwealth outlays fall in real terms, and<br />
outlays as a share of GDP are now the lowest<br />
since 1973-74. This fiscal achievement so<br />
essential to the Government's overall economic<br />
strategy has required five years of hard slog by<br />
Expenditure Review Committee ministers.<br />
The sustainability of this process of<br />
expenditure restraint has required us to<br />
concentrate on improving financial management<br />
especially through the progressive<br />
introduction of program budgeting and on<br />
streamlining budget processes.<br />
Our innovations have proven successful.<br />
Rather than wait until just before the August<br />
budget to sift through all the bids ministers may<br />
make for new spending, ERC is now provided<br />
early in the year with a list of ministers' new<br />
policy proposals. Sifting through those bids,<br />
ERC identifies a range of high priority or<br />
unavoidable proposals which are then<br />
scrutinised more closely prior to delivery of the<br />
budget in August.<br />
Streamldining the budget process has also<br />
involved eliminating the need for ERC ministers<br />
to decide on the trivial detail of budget-making,<br />
in particular the minor savings options and<br />
minor new policy proposals costing $ 2 million or<br />
less. This desire on the part of ERC to extricate<br />
itself from the detail of budget-making<br />
complements the trend towards letting ministers<br />
take greater responsibility for their portfolios. These twin goals have been pursued in the most'<br />
recent budget period through the use of portfolio<br />
targets. Thus, in the run-up to the August budget,<br />
ERC can now concentrate on significant new<br />
policy proposals and wrap up remaining budget<br />
matters within portfolio expenditure targets.<br />
Subject to their reporting to ERC on achievement<br />
of those targets, portfolio ministers are now free<br />
to pursue minor policy proposals and minor<br />
savings options without the previous detailed<br />
involvement of ERC ministers.<br />
Another important change I made last year<br />
was, to replace the former Public Service Board<br />
with a much smaller Public Service Commission<br />
reflecting and enhancing our clear preference<br />
for devolving responsibilities for personnel<br />
management to portfolios instead of<br />
concentrating on outdated central agency roles.<br />
A part-time Management Advisory Board was<br />
established to advise the Government on<br />
significant management issues and to be a forum<br />
for considering major management activities<br />
affecting the service as a whole.<br />
As well as these changes, the Department of<br />
Finance has progressively become less involved<br />
in detail and changed its financial management<br />
controls to promote greater responsibility for<br />
operating departments and greater incentives for<br />
managers. The Department of the Prime<br />
Minister and Cabinet is also now substantially<br />
less interventionist, with greater concentration<br />
on its fuindamental role as a co-ordinating agency<br />
this reflects a change both in concept and in<br />
the character of the chief political office holder!<br />
The savings that I foreshadowed could arise<br />
from these major machinery changes will be<br />
achieved. But I repeat that they were not the<br />
primary purpose of the changes. Indeed we<br />
recognised at the time that there would be<br />
substantial costs associated with the changes and<br />
substantial dislocation and disturbance both for<br />
agencies and many individuals.<br />
It was my expectation that adjustments<br />
would be necessary over some two years to<br />
accommodate changes of this scale. No certain<br />
assessment of the success of the changes would<br />
be possible before then.<br />
I can say, however, that although they are<br />
difficult to quantify, significant benefits are<br />
already evident to me in the areas of policy </p>
<p>CHALLENGES IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION<br />
development and decision-making processes,<br />
and in the area of delegation to, and incentives<br />
for, managers. I return now to the issue of the two-level<br />
ministry and to the associated issues of<br />
accountability. I do not need to remind an audience such as<br />
this of the relentless pressures on ministerial<br />
time in modem government. Among these<br />
pressures are:<br />
* responsibilities in relation to the<br />
minister's electorate and constituents;<br />
* unavoidable party political duties inside<br />
the parliament and in the broader party<br />
organisation;<br />
* legislative and parliamentary obligations;<br />
* overriding responsibility as a member of<br />
the executive government, and associated<br />
responsibilities to cabinet and cabinet<br />
committees;<br />
* and finally, responsibility, derived from<br />
the Constitution, to administer his or her<br />
department.<br />
The immensity of these competing<br />
pressures under the Government of Malcolm<br />
Fraser prompted an investigation by political<br />
scientist Patrick Weller and journalist Michelle<br />
Grattan into the chilling question Can Ministers<br />
Cope? ( 1981).<br />
I do not pretend that ministers of my<br />
Government face no problems in reconciling<br />
competing demands on their time. But I do point<br />
out that the two-tier ministerial structure was<br />
designed to make, and I am convinced is making,<br />
it easier for my ministers to do so.<br />
In introducing these new arrangements we<br />
addressed head-on the legal question which had<br />
bedevilled so much previous consideration of the<br />
rational allocation of functions to departments.<br />
The question whether section 64 of the<br />
Constitution permitted more than one minister to<br />
administer a department had long been the<br />
subject of learned consideration by the lawyers.<br />
Most, including Sir Robert Garran, have been of<br />
the opinion that it was possible the most<br />
notable exception being a narrow interpretation<br />
in 1958 by Mr Barwick, as he then was, as<br />
counsel. I am pleased to note that there has been<br />
subsequent judicial endorsement of the broad<br />
interpretation of section 64 ( see Griffith 1987).<br />
The positive view however has always been tempered by caution because of the potential<br />
consequence of disqualification of a member or<br />
senator if the negative view were held to be<br />
correct. This was an important factor leading to<br />
frequent, costly and inefficient machinery of<br />
government changes.<br />
The revised arrangements we have put in<br />
place provide the flexibility necessary to<br />
accommodate changing political priorities and<br />
circumstances, including new ministerial<br />
appointments, without the need to change the<br />
machinery of government with all the upheaval<br />
that entails. Indeed, one of the virtues of the new<br />
* machinery is that there is great flexibility within<br />
portfolios in allocating responsibility to<br />
ministers and re-drawing lines of operation for<br />
officials flexibilities which also assist<br />
departments and ministers to cope with changing<br />
pressure points.<br />
Under the new system, non-cabinet<br />
ministers are undertaking many functions on<br />
behalf of their portfolio ministers such as<br />
parliamentary duties, correspondence, day-today<br />
administration of specific areas within the<br />
portfolio enabling senior ministers to devote<br />
precious time to broad strategic issues of<br />
government. Not insignificantly, non-cabinet<br />
ministers are also enabled to focus much more<br />
closely on the nitty-gritty issues that are often<br />
vital to the welfare of the individual clients of<br />
government. As I envisaged at the time, it has been<br />
necessary occasionally to refine the<br />
arrangements. This will, no doubt, continue to<br />
be necessary. Overall, however, I believe the<br />
two-level ministry arrangements have worked<br />
remarkably well. As you would be aware, the<br />
Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, has<br />
publicly welcomed many aspects of these new<br />
arrangements, including the two-level<br />
ministerial structure, and I welcome his support.<br />
For my part, I regard the new machinery as<br />
setting the basic pattern of Australian<br />
government administration for many years<br />
ahead. Major changes of this kind are disruptive<br />
and, while minor adjustments must be made<br />
where necessary, no major changes at the<br />
departmental level should now be necessary as<br />
far ahead as I can see.<br />
In the lead-up to my visit last year to the<br />
Soviet Union, I had drawn to my attention a </p>
<p>HAWKE<br />
-omment of Lenin's. It was a comment of great<br />
relevance to the reforms sought by Mr<br />
Gorbachev, and has been quoted approvingly by<br />
an influential Soviet economist, close to<br />
Gorbachev, seeking to condemn the rigidities<br />
and inefficiencies of the Soviet system<br />
bequeathed by Brezhnev. Lenin's comment has<br />
unexpected relevance today, less because of his<br />
definition of the problem than his articulation of<br />
the solution. If you will forgive Lenin's<br />
unfortunately scatological language, I will read it<br />
to you: In our country everything is swamped in a foul<br />
bureaucratic morass of " departments"* Great<br />
authority, intelligence, and strength are needed<br />
for the day-to-day struggle against this.<br />
Departments are shit; decrees are shit. Seeking<br />
out people and entrusting the work to them that<br />
is all that matters ( cited in Shmelev 1987).<br />
And in many ways, seeking out people and<br />
entrusting the work to them is all that matters to<br />
reformers of the public service, and indeed of the<br />
private sector, in Australia today. In our pursuit<br />
of greater efficiency and effectiveness in the<br />
public service, we have followed a consistent set<br />
of principles. With rather less brevity than<br />
Lenin, let me outline the principles<br />
underpinning our reforms. They have been<br />
aimed at: clarifying the lines of accountability at all<br />
levels of government, including through<br />
greater delegation of responsibility to line<br />
managers; retaining and where possible enhancing<br />
the professional character of the public<br />
service and its ability to serve the elected<br />
government of the day;<br />
pursuing greater equity in public<br />
administration including in the delivery<br />
of services; and<br />
providing maximum scope for our<br />
greatest resource, our people in the<br />
workforce, through greater individual<br />
initiative, innovation and job satisfaction.<br />
Let me now discuss how these principles<br />
have been advanced.<br />
As to the first, accountability is a pervasive<br />
principle, that at one end of the spectrum ensures<br />
voters can endorse or reject a government in the<br />
ballot box, and that at the other gives force to the<br />
claim of a pensioner seeking assistance over the counter of a Social Security office.<br />
It has been in pursuit of this principle that we<br />
have: redefined, in legislation, the relative<br />
responsibilities of ministers and departmental<br />
secretaries for the administration<br />
of departments;<br />
enhanced ministerial responsibility<br />
through the new two-level ministry<br />
system; introduced a range of measures designed<br />
to reduce central agency controls and put<br />
responsibility more clearly in portfolios<br />
and complementary measures to<br />
reduce central controls within portfolios;<br />
and improved budget processes and financial<br />
controls.<br />
Within these differing levels of<br />
accountability, one layer seems particularly<br />
problematical: the accountability of the<br />
executive to the parliament.<br />
The parliament, through question time,<br />
parliamentary committees, and detailed scrutiny<br />
of legislation, provides the means by which<br />
government is called to account during its term of<br />
office. It has been my Government's desire,<br />
particularly through its budgetary reforms and<br />
the manner in which financial information is<br />
made available to the parliament, to do all it can<br />
to make the processes of government as<br />
transparent and amenable to parliamentary<br />
scrutiny as possible.<br />
Given this subtle and multifaceted process<br />
of accountability, it is depressing that, at least in<br />
some quarters, the whole concept of<br />
accountability gets reduced to a barren quest for<br />
ministerial resignations. Opposition parties<br />
today and, I suppose, of earlier periods<br />
seem to believe they are engaged in a game of<br />
cricket. They are too eager to cry LBW, and tend<br />
to do so for all the wrong reasons.<br />
The true measure of ministerial<br />
accountability, here and in Britain, has never<br />
been the tally of ministerial resignations. Even in<br />
the slower and simpler formative period of our<br />
system of government, the strict theory that<br />
ministers were fuilly accountable for every act or<br />
omrission of their departmental officers was,<br />
simply, far-fetched. In today's environment the<br />
traditional hypothesis just cannot be reconciled </p>
<p>CHALLENGES IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION<br />
with political and administrative realities.. The<br />
relationship between ministers and officials is far<br />
more complex than the hypothesis, with its alltoo-<br />
neat dichotomy between policy and<br />
administration, permits.<br />
Clearly there are many areas where the<br />
detailed development of policy proposals is,<br />
within a broad framework of ministerial<br />
direction, entrusted to officials; similarly, there<br />
are many matters of administration in which<br />
ministers take a close interest.<br />
In other words, ministers must, of course,<br />
continue to be answerable to the parliament and<br />
to take any necessary corrective action. But the<br />
truth is that there is no requirement for them to<br />
resign except where a significant act or omission<br />
was theirs, or was taken at their personal<br />
direction, or was a matter about which they<br />
obviously should have known and done<br />
something. Ministerial responsibility of course is but<br />
one strand in the web of accountability that<br />
pervades our whole political and administrative<br />
structure. It is a principle to which, as all our<br />
public service reforms show, we attach very great<br />
importance. It is not, let me stress, in any way<br />
contradictory to the second principle we have<br />
pursued: maintaining and enhancing a highly<br />
professional public service.<br />
Some critics of the changes made to<br />
appointment and tenure provisions for<br />
departmental secretaries argued they would lead<br />
to politicisation. Four years later, no one could<br />
reasonably claim that the portfolio secretaries<br />
serving my Government are other than highly<br />
professional career public servants who have<br />
also served previous governments in senior<br />
positions. The public service remains, at all<br />
levels, a highly professional institution.<br />
The third principle I referred to, which<br />
draws out the importance of equity in public<br />
sector management and employment, has also<br />
been advanced. In terms of government outputs,<br />
this is reflected in the advances we have made<br />
towards our social justice objectives. In terms of<br />
staffing it is best reflected in the legislative<br />
advances in 1984 and in the new machinery to<br />
follow those changes through and to foster a<br />
management culture in the public service which<br />
pays proper regard to the merit principle, to<br />
industrial democracy and to equal employment opportunity. These developments tend to be seen as soft<br />
optional extras. This is short-sighted; there are<br />
substantial management benefits in all of these<br />
measures. I regard the continuing efforts the<br />
Government is makcing to foster EEO as<br />
especially important in seeking to harness for the<br />
public sector the best available human resources<br />
in our multicultural society.<br />
The final principle, enhancing scope for<br />
initiative, innovation and job satisfaction, does<br />
not lend itself so readily to assessment. Much of<br />
our effort has gone into providing a framework<br />
Within which managers at all levels have clearer<br />
lines 6f responsibility and a greater degree of<br />
autonomy. I recognise we have more to do on these<br />
qualitative issues but we have been necessarily<br />
living through a period of stringency and<br />
adjustment, and it takes time for a new<br />
management culture and envirornent to be<br />
established. I should say, however, that there<br />
have been many examples of innovative policy<br />
development and innovative changes in program<br />
management. Despite the apparent size and sometimes<br />
impersonal face of government there is, I believe,<br />
tremendous scope in the public service for<br />
individual initiative and sense of satisfaction<br />
arising from contribution to the public good. The<br />
changes we have made should, over time, lead to<br />
greater scope for such innovation and, I believe,<br />
greater potential for job satisfaction.<br />
One of the management challenges we face<br />
is to ensure that this is the case. Another is how to<br />
achieve greater recognition for the substantial<br />
contribution to this nation made by those in the<br />
public sector employment.<br />
Public servants have come a long way since<br />
Kafka gave bureaucracy a bad name or since Tom<br />
Collins gave a particularly Australian twist to the<br />
characterisation. Tom Collins, of course, was the<br />
pseudonym adopted by Joseph Furphy in his<br />
classic of the Australian bush Such is Life. At the<br />
outset of Chapter 1 the recently unemployed<br />
Collins writes of his days in the public service:<br />
One generally feels a sort of diffidence in<br />
introducing one's self; but I may remark that I<br />
was at that time a Government official, of the<br />
ninth class; paid rather according to my grade<br />
than my merit, and not by any means in </p>
<p>HAWKE<br />
proportion to the loafing I had to do ( Furphy<br />
1944, p. 5).<br />
That was a laconic way of putting Lord Samuel's<br />
dictum: that a public service will find a difficulty<br />
for every solution.<br />
It's unfortunate that such stereotypes persist<br />
in the public mind. I repeat what I said at the<br />
outset that I consider my Government to be<br />
very well served by the federal public service.<br />
And I take considerable pride in the fact that the<br />
reforms my Government has made to the public<br />
service have served further to increase its<br />
efficiency and professionalism.<br />
As you are well aware, over recent years I<br />
have been stressing over and over again to the<br />
business community, to the union movement,<br />
to our primary producers, and to workers<br />
throughout Australia, the overwhelming need for<br />
adaptability and readiness to accept change if we<br />
are to prosper as a nation. Similar adaptability<br />
and readiness to embrace change is absolutely<br />
imperative in our public institutions if they are to<br />
provide the framework within which our visions<br />
of an econon-ically prosperous and socially just<br />
Australia are to be realised.<br />
As we approach the end of this century and<br />
the centenary of the establishment of the<br />
Commonwealth, in which Garran played such a<br />
large part, I am confident that our measures to<br />
create a management environment and culture<br />
which emphasise the ability to promote and<br />
adapt to change will be seen as among our most<br />
significant achievements.<br />
For those who question the directions we are<br />
taking, let me refer you to some remarks of<br />
Garran about the constitutional debates of the<br />
1890s: Looking back over these debates, one is struck by<br />
the vanity of human fears and precautions<br />
( T) hose fifty of the elect of Australia spent<br />
months discussing dangers and difficulties, most<br />
of which the experience of half a century has<br />
shown to be imaginary. On the other hand, many<br />
of the troubles that, as it turned out, have beset<br />
the Constitution since its establishment are<br />
matters that never occurred to them ( Garran<br />
1958, p. 112).<br />
For reasons that are obvious enough, I say<br />
nothing at this point about constitutional reform<br />
and the difficulties thereof. But I do make the<br />
point that change is a constant. The last decade in<br />
particular has seen so many of the certitudes of<br />
the past brought into question, modified or<br />
despatched to the dustbins of history. These<br />
winds of change have been no respecter of<br />
ideological boundaries. In differing degrees they<br />
have blasted China, the Soviet Union and the<br />
West and in differing degrees the public service<br />
has been affected by, in some cases indeed is<br />
central to, how these changes are worked out in<br />
the society in question.<br />
In the Soviet Union, for example, the<br />
success or otherwise of the historically<br />
momentous changes enunciated by Secretary-<br />
General Gorbachev will be determined by his<br />
capacity both to overcome the opposition of so<br />
much of the bureaucracy to those changes, and<br />
then to harness a leaner public service as a<br />
positive element in the processes of change.<br />
In Australia, where the challenge of change<br />
is a compelling constant for all of us, I believe we<br />
are singularly fortunate in having an Australian<br />
Public Service which has, in my judgement, both<br />
the character and capacity to enable it fully to<br />
meet that responsibility.<br />

<p>CHALLENGES IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION<br />
APPENDIX Against the background of the policy positions developed in opposition as reflected in the document Labor<br />
and Quality of Government, my Government moved quickly in 1983 to set up the task force chaired by Mr<br />
Dawkins, then Minister for Finance and Minister assisting me for public service matters. A wide-ranging<br />
discussion paper was published in December 1983. The resultant legislation, the Public Service Reform Act 1984,<br />
was passed in June 1984.<br />
The Act made it quite clear that the responsibility of departmental secretaries for " the general working, and<br />
for all the business" of their departments was subordinate to the fundamental responsibility of ministers, derived<br />
from the Constitution, to administer departments. It also provided for more flexible appointment and tenure<br />
provisions for secretaries.<br />
We established the Senior Executive Service in place of the former second division, again with more flexible<br />
appointment and tenure provisions. All SES vacancies were opened up to people outside the public service. Far<br />
greater emphasis was placed on mobility and management development programs. The Public Service Board, and<br />
later the Public Service Commission, were given important roles in ensuring the integrity of SES staffing<br />
decisions. We moved to establish separate legislation, the Members of Parliament ( Stafi Act, for the employment of<br />
ministerial consultants and ministerial and electorate staff, to facilitate appointment of people not drawn from the<br />
public service, while removing any possible charges of politicisation. The Act also provides an umbrella for career<br />
public servants to gain experience in a minister's office.<br />
A significant start was made in what was to be an ongoing process of devolution from central agencies to<br />
departmental management. From 1 July 1984, secretaries were given the ability to create and abolish positions and<br />
to reclassify them. We also began the process of integrating staff number and financial controls, by moving<br />
responsibility for the former from the Board to the Department of Finance.<br />
Significant changes were also made in personnel policies. The merit principle and anti-discrimination<br />
provisions were included in the Public Service Act. Requirements were introduced for equal employment<br />
opportunity programs and industrial democracy plans. Part-time employment was introduced for permanent staff.<br />
A new grievance and appeals body the Merit Protection and Review Agency was established under its own<br />
legislation. Running parallel to these changes were our reforms to the budget and financial management processes, the<br />
most important of which has been the progressive introduction of program budgeting. For the first time this has<br />
enabled ministers and the parliament to be given reliable costings of government activities, program by program,<br />
rather than the previous unhelpful breakdown by type of expenditure, such as travel, telephones, stationery.<br />
Such information is vital for two reasons. First, it gives individual managers a far greater sense of<br />
responsibility for the expenditure of program funds. Secondly, it enables ministers to take far more informed<br />
decisions on the competing priorities of various policies and programs. In the present fiscal climate, program<br />
budgeting has assisted in the continuing and rigorous search for offsets and trade-offs.<br />
At the same time we adopted a policy of releasing forward estimates of expenditure and, contrary to long-held<br />
views in some quarters, this has not had the dire economic consequences predicted.<br />
In 1986 a dramatic turn-around in our terms of trade created economic circumstances which made the<br />
processes of reform on the government's agenda much more important and, urgent. There needed to be a<br />
fundamental restructuring in the private sector of the economy to enable us to compete internationally and enable<br />
continued domestic growth. It was necessary to ask the private sector to make sacrifices in this adjustment process<br />
and to find means of further increasing its efficiency.<br />
We could hardly do so without considering what adjustments should be made in the public sector to assist the<br />
process of change in the private sector, and indeed without seeking to set an example by accelerating the drive for<br />
greater efficiency in the public sector.<br />
That is the background to the public sector decisions announced by me in the parliament on 25 September<br />
1986. An efficiency dividend was required from departments and agencies for the three financial years beginning in<br />
1987-88, initially set at 1% of administrative expenses and subsequently amended to 1. 25<br />
An Efficiency Scrutiny Unit was established under the leadership of an experienced businessman, Mr David<br />
Block. A large number of scrutinies of administrative approaches and practices was conducted under the umbrella<br />
of the unit. They were carried out by departmental staff specially selected and trained for the purpose. Some 25<br />
of the savings achieved ($ 100 million in a full year) was allowed to be retained by the departments as an incentive,<br />
and that incentive remains in place with responsibility for further scrutinies resting clearly with departments. </p>
<p>HAWKE<br />
Other incentives for improved management were also put in place.<br />
For example, there was provision for greater flexibility in financial management, in particular by permitting<br />
some carry-over of funds from one financial year to the next and by providing greater freedom to move funds<br />
between salaries and administrative expenses votes.<br />
There were, as well, major changes to the arrangements for the redeployment or retirement of public service<br />
staff, and many changes streamlining personnel management, including further devolution to departments.<br />
I also foreshadowed, on 25 September 1986, the extensive restructuring of public service job classifications<br />
designed to remove obsolete distinctions, to reduce the overall number of personnel transactions, and through<br />
multi-skilling to provide greater flexibility in the use of personnel. These changes are now being implemented<br />
following Conciliation and Arbitration Commission approval as part of the second-tier wage round in accordance<br />
with the government's wages policy.<br />
As well as the substantial reforms in the public service, we have given close attention to statutory authorities.<br />
In January 1986, our policy statement Reform of Commonwealth Primary Industry Statutory Marketing<br />
Authorities was issued and subsequently legislation has been passed enabling these authorities to adopt a more<br />
flexible commercial approach to the marketing of rural products.<br />
A policy information paper Policy Guidelines for Commnonwealth Statutory Authorities and Government<br />
Business Enterprises was tabled by my colleague, Peter Walsh, in October 1987 and since then extensive work has<br />
been done, especially in the transport and communications portfolio, on the reshaping of government business<br />
enterprises to enable them to operate more competitively, to be freed of many bureaucratic controls, so that they<br />
may be held more accountable for their performance.<br />
Details of the changes made in relation to these business enterprises were contained in the May statement this<br />
year, and further work is proceeding in relation to other business enterprises and statutory authorities. </p>
