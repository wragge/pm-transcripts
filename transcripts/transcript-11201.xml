    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.............</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Thank you very much for sharing your time with us this morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's a pleasure.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I believe Australia and Japan relations remain one of the most stable</p>
<p> of bilateral relationships. Were there any further points that you</p>
<p> stressed during discussions with Prime Minister Obuchi yesterday?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I said that I wanted us to reinvigorate the relationship. It's a very</p>
<p> strong relationship. We now have an opportunity together to take a</p>
<p> lead in the region to encourage further trade liberalisation through</p>
<p> APEC and ultimately through the World Trade Organisation. Both of</p>
<p> our countries have a lot to gain from a more open world trading system.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>A new round of WTO is to begin in November this year. What are the</p>
<p> issues of concern for Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we want it to be a very comprehensive round. We want agriculture</p>
<p> there, we also believe it should cover manufacturing and services.</p>
<p> It's very important that we all, in countries like Japan and Australia,</p>
<p> we give a lead because there are some countries that would if they</p>
<p> were not encouraged in the opposite direction, they would slide back</p>
<p> into protectionism and that would be not only bad for them, it would</p>
<p> be bad for the whole region.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I believe there were some talks on the Olympic Games as well?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the Prime Minister, particularly over dinner last night - one</p>
<p> of your champion judo contestants who will be almost certainly at</p>
<p> the Sydney Olympic games - he was very interested to hear the progress</p>
<p> that is being made and we are making tremendous progress and I'm quite</p>
<p> certain that it will be a marvellous celebration not only of sport</p>
<p> but also a celebration of what Australia means to the rest of the</p>
<p> world and we will have lots of visitors and I know lots of Japanese</p>
<p> people will come to Australia and enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I wonder how the trio is doing. I learnt the names off by heart -</p>
<p> Sid, Millie and Ollie? Are they busy preparing for the Games?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think there's tremendous enthusiasm in Australia. I think all walks</p>
<p> of life in Australia are going to be so well prepared for the Games</p>
<p> that they'll be beyond, I think they'll be the best ever.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I thought it was quite impressive that those mascots symbolise certain</p>
<p> aspects of Australia</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they do to many people around the world they are a marvellous</p>
<p> resonance to people around the world of how they think about Australia.</p>
<p> Australia of course, is a very modern, diverse society, it's a very</p>
<p> open, tolerant society and it's a very friendly country and all of</p>
<p> those characteristics are going to be on display and those mascots</p>
<p> in a way remind people in a very warm way just what sort of country</p>
<p> Australia is.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What is it that you would like to convey through the Olympics?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that we are an open, tolerant, harmonious, welcoming country.</p>
<p> We also are very competitive and there will be a huge Australian team</p>
<p> at the games and we will be competing very hard. We're very proud</p>
<p> of our sporting capacity in a lot of sports and there will be plenty</p>
<p> of activity on the Australian side and we look forward to some outstanding</p>
<p> Olympic events.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Concerning the events and updates within the Asia Pacific region I</p>
<p> believe you're personally watching the updates in Indonesia now that</p>
<p> the election is over. How do you assess the current situation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Indonesia is to be congratulated for its huge shift towards democracy.</p>
<p> There are 211 million people in Indonesia and this is the most democratic</p>
<p> exercise that the country has been involved in for almost 40 years</p>
<p> and it is a remarkable thing and I don't think Indonesia has received</p>
<p> enough credit for what has happened, for the transformation that has</p>
<p> been undertaken. The vote has not been finished, well the vote's been</p>
<p> finished but the count has not been finished and it will be a little</p>
<p> while yet before we know the final shape of the Parliament and who</p>
<p> the next president will be. It's too early for me to make a prediction</p>
<p> but I do welcome the fact that the vote has been completed with so</p>
<p> little violence, far less violence than people predicted and the Indonesian</p>
<p> people are entitled to take a bow for having achieved such a big transformation.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Considering the current situation in East Timor what would be your</p>
<p> concern?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we are concerned about the security position in East Timor. We</p>
<p> pushed very hard to have a free and open ballot and it's very important</p>
<p> that that occur and Indonesia's world reputation will be affected</p>
<p> badly if it looks as though a free vote is not allowed and that is</p>
<p> the message that I am conveying on a regular basis to the Indonesian</p>
<p> Government, and I know it's a view that is shared by Mr Obuchi, the</p>
<p> Prime Minister of Japan, and President Clinton and many others. We</p>
<p> are really saying to the Indonesian Government it is in your interest</p>
<p> and the interest of your country that there be not only the reality</p>
<p> but the appearance of a free and open ballot in East Timor. Because</p>
<p> if we have an outcome which people don't believe then that will do</p>
<p> great harm not only to the people of East Timor but also to Indonesia's</p>
<p> international reputation.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What would be some of the area where perhaps Australia and Japan could</p>
<p> contribute to stabilising the society?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well both of us are contributing civilian police and that is very</p>
<p> important. We are contributing significantly to the cost of holding</p>
<p> the ballot that's been completed in Indonesia proper but also to the</p>
<p> cost of the operation in East Timor and we've also contributed some</p>
<p> millions of dollars of aid and Japan has also provided assistance.</p>
<p> We need to be there to help both in the transition to whatever form</p>
<p> of future government East Timor has. We also need to be there to help</p>
<p> afterwards, particularly if East Timor opts to go independent.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>There seems to be so much stress on issues like election because it</p>
<p> is telegenic in a sense. But what comes after the election, establishing</p>
<p> the order phase is equally important.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well in some cases it's more important. Now if East Timor decides</p>
<p> to separate from Indonesia then that new country will need a great</p>
<p> deal of help because it will be a very poor country. It has fewer</p>
<p> than one million people and it will need a great deal of help.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And Australia would be standing by?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Australia will help. We feel we have a particular responsibility but</p>
<p> we can't do it all on our own and we will need the assistance of other</p>
<p> countries, including of course Japan.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I understand that you are envisaging Sydney to be a financial hub</p>
<p> in the region. Could you possibly elaborate on the programme and the</p>
<p> reform that is taking place?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Australia of course is very, very strong economically at present.</p>
<p> We have a very high growth rate, we have very strong business investment,</p>
<p> we have undertaken a lot of reforms, and we have a very stable political</p>
<p> and legal system. And we have a very well supervised financial system.</p>
<p> And all of those things are very attractive because they bring stability</p>
<p> and predictability and transparency and those things are very important.</p>
<p> And the reforms that we have undertaken, and are undertaking, to our</p>
<p> taxation system will make it more attractive for securities transactions</p>
<p> to occur. We will be getting rid of stamp duty on share transactions.</p>
<p> We're undertaking a major review of our business taxation system.</p>
<p> We're removing stamp duty on certain financial deposits. So all of</p>
<p> these things taken together with our great lifestyle and Sydney in</p>
<p> particular, but not only Sydney there are other cities in Australia</p>
<p> that offer a great deal in the way of financial services. Australia</p>
<p> in many ways can become, because of the sophistication of our markets</p>
<p> and the transparency and the prudential supervision of them, becomes</p>
<p> a very attractive place in which to transact securities business.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Am I right to say that a preparatory team has been launched the 1st</p>
<p> of July envisioning.?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, what we have done is we're establishing really an office in</p>
<p> Sydney and to promote this and we have a Minister in the government</p>
<p> who is particularly responsible for this and his job will be to accompany</p>
<p> me on occasions, and on other occasions to go on his own to different</p>
<p> parts of the world to promote the notion of Australia as an international</p>
<p> financial centre. I'll be in New York next week and we're holding</p>
<p> a major investment seminar there to promote the attractiveness of</p>
<p> Sydney and Australia as a financial centre. Now we are in open competition</p>
<p> with other cities like Tokyo and Singapore and competition is what</p>
<p> makes markets strong and the financial system thrives on competition.</p>
<p> We believe that we can do it better than others and we are touting</p>
<p> ourselves around the world. But we do it in the spirit of strong competition</p>
<p> and rivalry.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What would you say your advantageous edge is?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we have a very strong economy. We have relatively low costs.</p>
<p> We have a great lifestyle. We have a very predictable, clear and transparent</p>
<p> legal and corporate governance system. All of those things are very</p>
<p> valuable.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I believe a goods and services tax is to be introduced soon.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes the 1st of July next year.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But will it not dampen the economy?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, no because it's accompanied by big cuts in income tax. So</p>
<p> people will have more money in their pockets to spend. If anything</p>
<p> it will give a boost to economic activity and in the longer term it</p>
<p> will reduce business and export costs and therefore produce a more</p>
<p> efficient economy. It's a reform that we have needed in Australia</p>
<p> for 20 years and at long last it has been achieved.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>When we talk of reform, we often say reform is often accompanied by</p>
<p> pain and cost. What would those pain and cost be in Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well some reforms are accompanied by pain and cost but you must remember</p>
<p> that if you don't reform then the pain and the cost is all the greater</p>
<p> because you reform in order to have a share of the changed world environment</p>
<p> in which you are living and if you don't reform then you don't get</p>
<p> that share and you suffer even more. But there is adjustment pain</p>
<p> associated with some reform and all governments have a responsibility.</p>
<p> We have isolated communities in Australia that are feeling the strain</p>
<p> of globalisation more than other parts of the country and we are trying</p>
<p> to look after those communities but not in a way that holds back progress</p>
<p> or reform. Because in the long run they have nothing to gain by putting</p>
<p> a protective barrier around Australia. In the long run you have to</p>
<p> go into new activities and new industries. If people are no longer</p>
<p> willing to buy the products of old industries.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So that is the strategy of how Australia survived the economic crisis</p>
<p> that has given serious blow to major Asian economies.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think there are other reasons why we survived. We survived because</p>
<p> we strengthened our economy. We got rid of our budget deficit. We</p>
<p> got our inflation rate down and our interest rates down and we also</p>
<p> ran a very flexible exchange rate management system and as a result</p>
<p> of that we were able to shift our exports away from the declining</p>
<p> markets in Asia into some new markets in Europe and North America</p>
<p> and that greatly aided Australia. And we were helped also by the fact</p>
<p> that many of our exports to the Asian region were in the form of long</p>
<p> term contracts with countries like Japan and even though they were</p>
<p> affected in some way the effect was not so dramatic.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Concerning globalisation of economy as you say. WTO certainly is going</p>
<p> to play a major role in enhancing that free-trade regime.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's critical that we open up markets and all of those communities</p>
<p> that are effected by globalisation have more to gain by opening up</p>
<p> new markets. A country like Australia needs expanding access to markets</p>
<p> and so does Japan. Japan built her prosperity in the 1960s and 1970s</p>
<p> on the strength of her capacity to trade vigorously around the world.</p>
<p> So it is in the interests of both our societies that we have a more</p>
<p> open and more liberal trading system.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What are some of the voices that could be heard from your primary</p>
<p> industries sector.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well our primary industries are very strongly in favour of open trading.</p>
<p> Because we have a small domestic market and we are very efficient</p>
<p> farmers and miners. They are amongst the most efficient of all our</p>
<p> industries and amongst the most efficient in the world, and they don't</p>
<p> have any subsidies. They don't have the protection that farmers in</p>
<p> other countries, including your own have and as a result they have</p>
<p> more to gain than virtually anybody else from an open trading system.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>When you go back to Australia, what are the points that you would</p>
<p> like to talk to your public as fruit of your visit to Japan?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that first and foremost Japan remains our best customer, it's</p>
<p> a very close relationship, it's a very mature relationship, and it's</p>
<p> more than economics. We are a model to the rest of the world of how</p>
<p> two very different societies can work together and achieve common</p>
<p> goals whilst respecting the cultural differences in each society.</p>
<p> And that's a very important message of cooperation to the rest of</p>
<p> the world. That both of us have a leadership role in the region in</p>
<p> encouraging the lurch towards protectionism that is evident in some</p>
<p> societies.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Thank you very much Mr Howard for coming this morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
