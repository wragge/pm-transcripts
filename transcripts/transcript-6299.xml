E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF SPEECH AT OPENING OF HUGHES CAMPAIGN, UNITED<br />
SERVICES CLUB, SUTHERLAND 27 JANUARY 1984<br />
Les has made his decision. We are obviously going to have<br />
the services in Canberra of an extremely talented young man in<br />
the person of Bob Tickner. I look forward to welcoming him<br />
into the ranks of the party in Canberra and I know that he will<br />
make a constructive and telling contribution to the affairs of<br />
the party and to the affairs of government.<br />
Now, if I could I would like to pick up the approach that has<br />
been adopted by Neville Wran in opening this campaign because it<br />
is necessary if we are going to understand where Australia is<br />
today the threshold of 1984 to remember just what this<br />
country was like 12 months ago.<br />
I don't want to spend any time in going into those details<br />
because despite whatever attempts we may make to push the matter<br />
out of our mind they are etched too deeply in the consciousness<br />
of Australians, easily to be forgotten.<br />
Rather I want to remind you of the promise that I made on behalf<br />
of the Australian Labor Party, being elected as leader there in<br />
February and being catapaulted into that early campaign that was<br />
thrust upon us by a desperate Prime Minister.<br />
I perceive that underlying every other problem in this country<br />
was the fact that we had had seven desperate years of division<br />
under a Prime Minister who proceeded ( inaudible) role of<br />
government to set Australian against Australian. There had<br />
never, in our relatively short history as one nation, and it<br />
is, as you know, coincidental with the century never before in<br />
its history had there been a time of such divisiveness and we<br />
were tearing ourselves apart under the impetus of that approach<br />
from Canberra.<br />
So, I promised you, you will recall, that a major task of my<br />
Government would be on its election to undertake the process of<br />
national reconciliation because it seemed to me then as it<br />
still seems to me, whatever grand policies we may have and we<br />
must have them and programs and we must have them that<br />
until you get a sense of community of purpose, all else<br />
substantially will be in vain and so I promised you that we would<br />
undertake the task of national reconciliation as the basis for<br />
recovery and reconstruction. / 2 </p>
<p>It is less than 12 months since you gave us that mandate on<br />
March 1983, but I believe I am able to come to the people of<br />
Hughes and report that we have significantly achieved that<br />
task of reconciliation.<br />
I said that within one month of coming to office we would call<br />
a national economic summit conference. We were commissioned<br />
in of fice on 11 March and on 11 April in the house of the people<br />
in the House of Representatives we called that historic<br />
conference where the representatives of business, large and of<br />
small business, the trade union movement, the great State<br />
Governments, the local governments, community organisations, they<br />
gathered there historically in the house of the people and in<br />
a sense that was a beginning, if you like, of formalising of a<br />
pact between the people of Australia and their representatives<br />
a commitment that as far as it was conceivable within the<br />
democratic processes where we do have differences as far as it<br />
was possible and consistent with the pursuit of principle, both<br />
people and their representatives would commit themselves to trying<br />
to work together for the benefit of Australia and they went away<br />
from that inspired not simply by the conference but with a view,<br />
I believe a determination to make the principles of the Summit<br />
conference work. We, on our part as government, said that we<br />
would move from the Summit to legislation to establish an Economic<br />
Planning Advisory Council where the sort of representation that<br />
had been there in large numbers at the Summit, would be reflected<br />
on a statutory basis in the Economic Planning Advisory Council.<br />
And we have received t he support in that processs from business<br />
and the farmers, the trade unions, welfare organisations and<br />
that Economic Planning Advisory Council is something to which<br />
the Government attaches very significant importance. It meets in<br />
the Cabinet room under my chairmanship and senior ministers present.<br />
I want you to understand what that reflects because it is a<br />
fundamental change in the approach to government and by government<br />
in the history of this country, because we make available to<br />
your representatives, whether they are the representatives of you<br />
as Australian citizens, as workers, as businessmen large or small<br />
or in the community sphere, or, as I will be saying tonight in<br />
Corangamite, the rural community your representatives are there<br />
and we make available to them the information that we have as<br />
government and reciprocally those representatives of great<br />
organisations of Australia come to us and give us the benefit of<br />
their thinking, of their experience, so that now in a very real<br />
sense I believe we have translated the concept of Lincoln with<br />
government of the people by the people for the people into a<br />
reality because we don't say, as the elected people there in<br />
Canberra that we have all wisdom. We certainly believe that we have<br />
experience. We believe that we have appropriate policies and<br />
programs, but there is no monopoly of wisdom as far as we ' re<br />
concerned. We really want to tap the resources of the Australian<br />
people and that is what we are about and that is how we have<br />
undertaken the process of national reconcilation. / 3 </p>
<p>We started at the Summit, transferred it to the Economic<br />
Planning Advisory Council. And all of my Ministers all<br />
of them know that what we want and what is their desire<br />
is that in the discharge of their important portfolios<br />
they reflect in their microcosms, if you like, of government,<br />
the same concepts as are involved in the Economic Planning<br />
Advisory Council.<br />
In other words they are consistently consulting with the<br />
organisations which are relevant to the discharge of their<br />
portfolio and that is how you make good government and that<br />
is how you get a cohesive and effective community not to<br />
impose decisions but to try and share information and<br />
reciprocally get information back as experienced from the<br />
community and that has been the basis of this government.<br />
And that is why we are now, in less than 12 months, able to<br />
point to the result in those secondary processes of recovery<br />
and reconstruction.<br />
I want to remind you, without exhausting you with a whole range<br />
of statistics, but I go to some of the important areas<br />
reflecting that success in government. Now, of course, the<br />
most important area is employment. I remind you of the promise<br />
I made on behalf of our party in the February/ March by-election.<br />
The promise was in three parts.<br />
I said we would halt the explosion of unemployment. I said we<br />
would start to create jobs. Thirdly, I said that in a period<br />
of three years we would create half a million new jobs in this<br />
country.<br />
Now, they were deliberate statements of intent and I am able to<br />
say now, in less than* 12 months, that we have achieved what we<br />
said we would do.<br />
Let me be specific.<br />
You know that the rate of unemployment is coming down. we not<br />
only have stopped the exploding upward rate of unemployment,<br />
we've brought it down and we will continue to do that.<br />
Secondly, we already have created a significant number of new<br />
jobs. In the Budget, being cautious in our approach, we<br />
expected that in financial 83/ 84 we may create 90,000 new jobsthat<br />
is between 1 July 1983 and 30 June 1984 90,000. Already<br />
we have created over 130,000 in that financial period and<br />
indeed, in the period since we've been in office until the<br />
present time, 158,000 new jobs. So that you can see that in<br />
that three year period where we promised half a million new<br />
jobs we are already right on target.<br />
So, in that area of basic importance to the Australian people,<br />
we've altered that disaster that characterised particularly<br />
the last 2-3 years of conservative rule. Now, we don't say<br />
that with any sense of complacency because it is going to be<br />
difficult to get back towards those experiences of full<br />
employment that characterised the post-war generation, but we,<br />
in less than a year, have demonstrated our commitment to do </p>
<p>things to reverse the trend and what we are calling on is<br />
the community as a whole to understand that this problem<br />
of unemployment is a community problem, not just one for<br />
governments. We have demonstrated our commitment, we have<br />
given evidence of our capacity. We call upon the rest of<br />
the community now to join with us so that we can progressively<br />
remove this blight of unemployment and the frustration of<br />
the hopes and aspirations of the young, from this community.<br />
So that's employment and unemployment.<br />
We also said that we would adopt policies which would address<br />
themselves to the great problems of inflation and interest<br />
rates. We have succeeded.<br />
You know in respect of interest rates from your own daily<br />
experience that we have significantly reduced interest rates<br />
and that is not accident. It has followed from the responsible<br />
and carefully thought through economic strategies which were<br />
involved in the May Statement of last year and in the Budget<br />
process. And in the result business, home buyers, large<br />
business and small business, all people dependent upon the<br />
use of money in this community, know that there have been<br />
significant reductions in interest rates. It has for home<br />
purchasers released their capacity to satisfy their aspirations<br />
and to meet their needs in other ways.<br />
Inflation we said we would bring that down and we are<br />
signficantly doing so. The figures that came out just Wednesday<br />
show a continuation-of that downward trend, it's now down to<br />
8.6% and I promise you that in the year 1984 inflation will<br />
come down significantly more so in those areas of employment,<br />
interest rates and inflation, we have delivered what we<br />
promised.<br />
We recognise that one of the great tragedies that characterise<br />
the mismanagement of the Australian economy is the way in which<br />
the housing industry has been run down to a point where there<br />
was a significant under-utilisation of capacity. That is an<br />
economic and a social disaster and WE! immediately took<br />
deliberate steps in both the public and the private housing<br />
sector to turn that around.<br />
In the public housing sector we gave the largest increase in<br />
funds for public housing that has ever occurred, increased<br />
the funds from 363 million up to 500 million an increase of<br />
In the private sector we introduced a scheme which has come<br />
to be recognised by all sectors of the industry as the most<br />
effective scheme in the history of this country the first<br />
home owners scheme which had the two benefits firstly of<br />
being directed towards those on higher income most in need of<br />
assistance and secondly being a scheme which is directed towards<br />
the building of new housing rather than financing the transfer<br />
of existing housing stock between the upper income sections of<br />
the Australian industry. </p>
<p>And in the event the housing and construction industry is<br />
now moving to a point where it is operating very close to<br />
the limit of its capacity and we will achieve the objectives<br />
that we expressed in the Budget of having hous'ing running<br />
at an annual rate of at least 135,000 units which is right<br />
up there to the top of its capacity.<br />
So, in all these things we have acted in ways which were<br />
calculated on the basis of cooperation and consensus to turn<br />
this economy round and in aggregate terms the figures are<br />
there the year before we came in ' Leaving farm products<br />
aside because some suggestions to the contrary we do not<br />
claim credit for the breaking of the drought. Putting farm<br />
products aside, just looking at non-farm products, in the<br />
year 82/ 83 there was a 1% decline in gross domestic product,<br />
including farm product in this year the growth 83/ 84,<br />
the growth will be 6% -so we've had that turn-around from<br />
up to 6% and that, if you like in aggregate terms, reflects<br />
the success of the policies of this Government.<br />
In conclusion I want to say that when you examine the<br />
operations of democracy, it is not sufficient just to talk<br />
about what a government does. You have to look at an<br />
opposition because an opposition is part of the function<br />
of the democracy. Unfortunately you haven't got much to look<br />
at in this country, so it won't take me long to talk about it.<br />
But as has been said, led by Mr. Peacock on the one hand and<br />
Mr. Sinclair on the other. I don't want to talk too much about<br />
them in personal terms. I believe that some of my colleagues<br />
will not be capable of being restrained in talking about<br />
Mr. Sinclair when the Parliament resumes. We are told that<br />
he is waiting for Parliament to resume because he can't reply<br />
to what was in the Cross Report until. Parliament resumes. I<br />
don't quite understand why that is so. There is no muzzle<br />
across his mouth.' People ought to be able to talk before<br />
Parliament resumes. Is it because he feels that he may say<br />
something in the Parliament that he is not game to say outside.<br />
Nevertheless there will be a full opportunity, I can assure<br />
Mr. Sinclair and-the Opposition, to have a full analysis of the<br />
contents of the Cross Report, the most damming indictment of<br />
any politician in the history of this country.<br />
But more importantly than those problems of leadership of the<br />
Opposition, I would remind you of how they have, in fact,<br />
behaved during this year of our Government, because you will<br />
recall that when we went to the peop: le in February/ March, we<br />
said to them that we believed that one of the great stings of<br />
the previous government had been that they had been so<br />
distinctive and discriminating in their approach to the<br />
application of the laws to the people of this country in terms<br />
of the responsibility to pay tax. There had been a vast<br />
tax evasion and avoidance industry grown up under seven years<br />
of conservative government. Ile said that we could not perceive<br />
the beginnings of justice in a situation where ordinary<br />
Australians workers and small businessmen had no alternatives. </p>
<p>They met their obligations under the law automatically and<br />
we saw no justice in the situation where hundreds of<br />
millions indeed over the years billions of dollars had<br />
been avoided by a relatively small section of the Australian<br />
community. So, we said that we would take action in the<br />
Parliament to ensure that as far as it was within our power,<br />
the law would operate in a way that everyone met their<br />
commitment. Now, we passed the law, passed the legislation, passed the<br />
bill in the House of Representatives, but in our bicameral<br />
system it doesn't become law until it is passed by the Senate.<br />
Unfortunately, the will of the people of 5 March election<br />
was not reflected in Labor having control of the Senate.<br />
So that legislation which has been up there three times to<br />
ensure that everyone meets the law in regard to the payment<br />
of tax, has on three occasions been rejected by this<br />
unholy alliance the Liberal Party, the National Party,<br />
some of the Democrats, and Senator Harradine. Now, that<br />
has meant very simply that our capacity as a Government to<br />
deliver to you the promise that you would all be equal before<br />
the law has been frustrated and it means that there continues<br />
to be an additional obligation upon ordinary taxpayers to<br />
meet more of the tax bill because a wealthy few and when I<br />
say wealthy I'm not talking about all wealthy people it's<br />
a minority, but significant have avoided their obligations<br />
and it means that ordinary people have to pay more. Now, we<br />
are still committed to the position that we will pursue the<br />
commitment that we made last February and March. I give<br />
notice that there will be a further opportunity to this<br />
Opposition in this year to make it clear to the Australian people<br />
whether that is what they want to continue to do to directly<br />
impose a greater tax burden upon the ordinary people of this<br />
country. I am committed, my Government i s committed, as we go to the<br />
next Budget to try and reduce the deficit and to bring in tax<br />
reduction. You would notice that the extent to which we will<br />
be able to do that will depend upon the readiness of the<br />
Opposition in the Senate to match the clearly expressed will of<br />
the Australian people and so, my friends, you here at the<br />
electorate of Hughes, have the opportunity on 18 February to<br />
and to renew the mandate that was so effectively carried<br />
out over so many years by Les Johnson, renew that mandate on<br />
18 February through Bob Tickner, who will bring, as I say,<br />
great capacity and talent to the Parliament.<br />
I thank you for the support that you've given us over the<br />
years. I ask you to renew that on 18 February and we will<br />
continue to give you the service the Government of the<br />
sort that we've given in the first 12 months. We believe it<br />
has been successful. We believe it is the sort of Government<br />
that will guarantee the future of this great country of ours.<br />
Thank you very much. </p>
