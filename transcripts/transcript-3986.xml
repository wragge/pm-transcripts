ELECTORAL TALK BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND MEMBER FOR WAINNON<br />
MR MALCOLM FRASER -4f<br />
Three events of major significance occurred this week. One of<br />
them promises great benefits to the neglected Northern Territory<br />
and the second will give people of the A. C. T. more say in their<br />
own affairs. The third event marked a shocking deterioration<br />
in the level of political debate in Australia.<br />
This week the Liberal and National Country Parties set 1980<br />
as the goal for achieving statehood for the Northern Territory.<br />
The Territory made steady progress for almost a quarter of a<br />
century under a Liberal National Country Party Government.<br />
It prospered and Dariwin grew from a city of 8,000 to a city<br />
of 48,000.<br />
But for three years now, under Labor, there has been economic<br />
stagnation, bureaucratic neglect and muddled planning.<br />
Cyclone Tracy gave the Whitlam Government the chance it was<br />
looking for to experiment with long range town planning.<br />
As a result, the city remains unbuilt while bureaucrats<br />
squabble over the best way to make a start. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER 2.<br />
The Whitlam Administration stopped the people of Darwin from<br />
getting on with the job themselves and yet was unable itself<br />
to achieve results.<br />
The Coalition Parties have undertaken to start putting into<br />
effect the recommendations made by a Committee of the<br />
Parliament on transfer of powers to the Territory' s own<br />
elected Legislative Assembly.<br />
This report has lain neglected by the Whitlam Administration,<br />
gathering dust for a year. 0<br />
That means that the people of the Territory will start running<br />
their own Museums, Art Galleries, Housing Commission, Tourist<br />
Board and Public Service.<br />
It means they will begin to collect their own taxes and. take'<br />
over such local and regional functions as agriculture, transport,<br />
electricity and sewerage services, liquor licensing and gaming<br />
laws. However, we propose to take these recommendations much further<br />
and to give the people of the Territory the opportunity to work<br />
for statehood within five years.<br />
Following many representations and the report of the Joint<br />
Parliament Committee of the A. C. T. it is clearly now appropriate<br />
for the people of the A. C. T. to gain through the Legislative<br />
Assembly more responsibility for their own financial management<br />
and: decision making. 1 </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER 3.<br />
After December 13 we will set up a full time Task Force to<br />
examine the ways and means of giving some executive authority<br />
to the A. C. T. Legislative Assembly.<br />
There will be a devolution of powers and responsibilities to<br />
the residents of the A. C. T. which is in accord with the<br />
principles embodied in our Federalism Policy.<br />
Canberra in the A. C. T. is the seat of Government for the nation<br />
and the. Federal Parliament must always have an interest in many<br />
S aspects of its affairs.<br />
The other major development this week was the deplorable collapse<br />
of political debate in this country to violence.<br />
Protest and demonstration, jostling and egg throwing has been<br />
a characteristic of political life in Australia for some years.<br />
0 But now letters have been received in my Department as Prime<br />
Minister, in the Department of the Premier of Queensland,<br />
Mr Bjelke-Petersen which contained bombs while a third bomb<br />
has been intercepted in mail addressed to the Governor-General,<br />
Sir John Kerr.<br />
In my Department the bomb was detected and defused.<br />
In Brisbane the device exploded on a desk, wounding two people,<br />
one of them so seriously as to endanger his sight. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTERÃ¸ 4.<br />
The type of violence by which 50 or 100 people set out to<br />
disrupt a meeting is regrettable but that this approach should<br />
degenerate into violence and anger is shocking to all Australians.<br />
There is an obligation on political leaders to avoid language<br />
which inflames passions.<br />
When political leaders talk of extremism, they will create an<br />
extremist response. There is an obligation in the circumstances<br />
of today to keep the campaign in moderate and reasonable terms. 0<br />
The Liberal and National Country Parties have sought to avoid<br />
inflammatory rhetoric and we will continue to avoid doing so.<br />
I am sure the overwhelming majority of Australians support me<br />
in deploring this shocking development.<br />
This week too, the Liberal and National Country Parties pledged<br />
themselves to adopt and implement two reports on the beef<br />
industry by the Industries Assistance Commission.<br />
The first of these reports provides for emergency aid to this<br />
hard hit industry.<br />
The I. A. C. recommends that the export levy on beef of 1.6 cents<br />
per pound be suspended and that special funds be provided for<br />
producers worst affected by the fall in meat prices. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER<br />
Their second recommendation is that producers should be<br />
compensated when their cattle show positive reactions to<br />
tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication tests.<br />
Farmers everywhere: have suffered because of the uncertainty<br />
which Labor has created during the past three years.<br />
The Whitlam Administration's hard line resources policy has<br />
encouraged our trading. partners to be just as tough with us.<br />
The successfully cultivated Japanese market for meat has been<br />
disrupted and last week the U. S. authorities closed their<br />
market to further imports from Australia for the rest of this<br />
quota year.<br />
There is much to be done after December 13 to repair the<br />
damage which has been wreakedin the past three years.<br />
One step we will take immediately is to initiate Government<br />
to Government discussion to resolve past misunderstanding. </p>
