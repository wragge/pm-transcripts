    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..............................................................................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what do you hope to achieve on your trip?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I hope to have the opportunity of talking about the commitment</p>
<p> we have to an orderly and peaceful resolution of the difficulties</p>
<p> in East Timor. It's important to understand what Australia can</p>
<p> achieve. It's also important to understand that Timor is part</p>
<p> of Indonesia and it's absolutely essential if progress is to</p>
<p> be made that we engage the Indonesian government in a very positive</p>
<p> and constructive way.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How hard are you going to push for disarmament given there's</p>
<p> been somewhat of a threat if we send Australian troops over there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it's very important on a mission like this that you don't</p>
<p> start setting public conditions, you start laying down in public exactly</p>
<p> what you're going to say and what you're going to do. It's</p>
<p> important also that we have a realistic sense of what Australia can</p>
<p> achieve. There are too many people who talk rather carelessly about</p>
<p> what Australia might do without understanding that in international</p>
<p> affairs it's influence in the end that counts, and those who</p>
<p> believe that Australia should do other than exert influence really</p>
<p> have an obligation of saying what that is. And it's very important</p>
<p> that we have a realistic assessment of what can be achieved.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Would you include in that those who've said that we should be</p>
<p> pushing for a presence of UN peacekeeping troops, and that maybe we</p>
<p> should use our defence ties for example, or the Timor Gap oil treaty</p>
<p> as bargaining chips, to get a bit leverage?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I can't think of anything more counterproductive to what</p>
<p> is to take place tomorrow than for me to start talking about bargaining</p>
<p> chips and putting this or that aspect of the relationship on the table.</p>
<p> It is in the national interest of Australia that we have a close association</p>
<p> with Indonesia. It is also in the national interest of Australia that</p>
<p> that relationship be based on an understanding by Indonesia of our</p>
<p> values and also an understanding by Australia of Indonesia's</p>
<p> position. And an understanding of the fact that the leadership of</p>
<p> Indonesia is grappling with a horrendous challenge. Over 200 million</p>
<p> people, the worst economic downturn in 40 years, tens of millions</p>
<p> of people in that country living in absolute poverty. Now they are</p>
<p> the sort of challenges that should be understood, and the implications</p>
<p> of them for what Indonesia can do in relation to Timor should also</p>
<p> be understood. That of course, there's not in any way gainsay,</p>
<p> the immense concern we feel for the loss of life, for the bloodshed,</p>
<p> and the denial of human rights that's clearly occurred. But we</p>
<p> have to have a sense of balance, and also an understanding of what</p>
<p> has been achieved by the Indonesian government, under Dr Habibie's</p>
<p> leadership over the last 6 or 9 months.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will General Wiranto turn up, and if he doesn't what does that</p>
<p> mean?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, who comprises the Indonesian delegation is a matter for the</p>
<p> Indonesian government. I'm told that General Wiranto will be</p>
<p> present.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Someone said though that if he's not there it means a bit of</p>
<p> slap in the face for President Habibie, and may even mean that he</p>
<p> doesn't exert the influence that perhaps he would like to.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm not going to comment on every bit of trivia written</p>
<p> about this meeting.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>There's also on the death of Arthur Boyd, some comments.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I do. He was one of the greatest Australian painters of the 20th</p>
<p> century, and his death does leave a very significant void in the visual</p>
<p> art world. He was also a very philanthropic Australian and he demonstrated</p>
<p> by the gift of his Bundanon property to the Australian people, and</p>
<p> his other activities that he believed in public philanthropy. And</p>
<p> in doing that he set an example to many other Australians but he'll</p>
<p> be best remembered for the way in which he helped interpret and helped</p>
<p> many Australians come to better understand the Australian landscape.</p>
<p> He was by any measure a world class painter, and one of the greatest</p>
<p> that Australian has produced this century.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>One other thing, with the cricket team copping a little bit of a hiding</p>
<p> over there. What have you got to say about that being a cricket fan...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I have just listened to an interview by Steven Waugh the Australian</p>
<p> Captain, and I had a lot of sympathy to what he had to say. I think</p>
<p> it is quite distressing that mob violence and mob intimidation can</p>
<p> have an impact on the result of a game. It does appear from what I</p>
<p> heard that the umpire's decision was altered as a result of threats</p>
<p> by the crowd and an indication that physical safety could not be guaranteed.</p>
<p> As a well- known cricket lover, and as a well-known sports lover I</p>
<p> find that quite appalling and the fact that the last two one-day games</p>
<p> have been tampered with by crowds is something that is of great concern</p>
<p> to the international cricket world. And this is a problem for the</p>
<p> international cricket administration. They really do have to come</p>
<p> to grips with this problem. Sports administrators around the world</p>
<p> have got to show more leadership on these issues, and they really</p>
<p> do have to come to grips. Of course there's a particular responsibility</p>
<p> on the West Indies. And it's such a shame because in every other</p>
<p> respect it was a magnificent series. It was close, there was some</p>
<p> brilliant cricket by both sides, a wonderful recovery by Brian Lara</p>
<p> of personal form, and some of the most enthralling cricket that I've</p>
<p> seen for a long time. But I'm just saddened that this should</p>
<p> have happened and I sympathise with what Steve Waugh had to say. I</p>
<p> think he put it very well. Thank you.</p>
