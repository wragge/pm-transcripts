    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today I will travel to Lima, Peru, to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Community (APEC) Leaders’ Summit.</p>
<p>No other region has benefited more from open trade and investment than the Asia-Pacific.</p>
<p>In just over two decades, the per capita incomes of APEC economies increased by 45 per cent and millions were lifted out of poverty.  Open trade and investment policies were critical to achieving these results.</p>
<p>I look forward to discussing these issues with other leaders, including President Obama.</p>
<p>The APEC meeting in Lima is an opportunity for leaders to stand up for strong and inclusive growth — growth which creates jobs and doesn’t leave people behind.</p>
<p>In Lima, I will support further steps to improve trade and investment flows in the region, advocate for reforms that enhance productivity and emphasise the benefits of open markets.<br />
