    <content><![CDATA[<p>A $213 million upgrade to the Navy’s Garden Island facility in Sydney will improve Defence operations, enhance national security and create hundreds of jobs.</p>
<p>The wharf upgrade project has been referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works today with work expected to begin in mid-2017, subject to approval.</p>
<p>The Cruiser Wharf and Oil Wharf will be demolished and a new wharf with different alignment will be constructed; an adjoining wharf will be extended to reduce the new wharf’s protrusion into Sydney Harbour.</p>
<p>The Garden Island upgrade will provide critical capability for Navy as part of the 2016 Defence White Paper.</p>
<p>The Australian Government is investing significantly in securing our national security by increasing Defence spending, including a $40 billion investment in Australia’s future naval capabilities.</p>
<p>Our investment in Naval ship building means we also need high-quality Defence infrastructure to support and maintain our Navy and Garden Island is one of our key operating bases.</p>
<p>The project is expected to create about 300 direct jobs with flow-on benefits for the local economy.</p>
<p>Defence is committed to engaging local and Indigenous suppliers on this project as well as consulting with the local community.</p>
<p>Building a new wharf that is equipped with engineering services, including electrical, water, and fuel, along with a crane, will enable maintenance work to be conducted well away from residential areas, reducing the noise and visual impacts.</p>
