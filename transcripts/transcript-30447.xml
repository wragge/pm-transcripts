<p><font size="3">Â </font><b><font size="3">JOURNALIST:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">Prime Minister is it true, have you asked the former Australian cricket captain to help with the "no" case?</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">PRIME MINISTER:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">No.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">JOURNALIST:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">The Sun-Herald has put out a press release saying that it stands by the story, it says that there has been talk between your office and the ACM about recruiting him.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">PRIME MINISTER:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">Look thereâs been no talk between me, or anybody on my behalf, and Mark Taylor. Can I say that if I get the opportunity to talk to Mark Taylor I donât waste time talking about the republic. We tend to talk about cricket, and Iâve had no discussions with him about the issue at all, any view he might have on the subject would be entirely his own.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">JOURNALIST:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">Would you like to see him enter the debate?</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">PRIME MINISTER:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">Thatâs a matter for him. I respect Mark Taylor enormously for what heâs done for Australian cricket and because heâs Australian of the Year. The question of his entering any political debate is entirely a matter for him. I donât recall ever having discussed the issue with Mark at any time. Iâm surprised that the story was written and I repeat that Iâve not discussed it with him and nobody on my behalf has discussed it with him, and in those circumstances I think itâs an extraordinary story. Thatâs not the only extraordinary story the Sun-Herald had today. Iâve had something to say about another one.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">JOURNALIST:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">They also say in their press statement that the decision was to be announced within a month or so but that Mr Taylor hadnât made up his mind.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">PRIME MINISTER:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">Look I donât know. You go and talk to them and talk to Mr Taylor. I just repeat that Iâve had no discussion with him and nobody at my request or on my behalf has had any discussion with him. I repeat that when I talk to him I donât talk about the republic, I talk about something a little more interesting to me, namely cricket.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">JOURNALIST:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">Heâd be handy to have on side though.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">PRIME MINISTER:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">Look, what he does is a matter for him, and I regard somebody whoâs been the Australian cricket captain as in a sense being somebody that the entire community identifies with. The question of what he does on individual issues is a matter for him but I have not asked him to do anything in relation to any political issue and I donât intend to.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">JOURNALIST:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">You mention another Sun-Herald report. Are you talking about these reports that your wife opposed the appointment of someone to the ABC board?</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">PRIME MINISTER:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">Yes. Itâs self-evident what Iâm talking about and Iâve made a statement about it and Iâve got nothing further to add.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">JOURNALIST:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">Prime Minister at the Cabinet meeting this week, is there likely to be a decision on the wording of the referendum question?</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">PRIME MINISTER:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">I think it will come up.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">JOURNALIST:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">Do you think it will change from the current question?</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">PRIME MINISTER:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">Well weâll have a look at it, but the proposed question is a truthful, accurate reflection of what the Australian public will be invited to decide on and any suggestion that that question is loaded is one that I reject. The idea that you should have a question that doesnât mention the method of election of the president seems quite extraordinary to me, yet that seems to be the view of some.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">JOURNALIST:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">Neither does it mention The Queen and yet sheâs the one facing removal as our head of state.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">PRIME MINISTER:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">Well if you say youâre going to have a republic of course you are removing The Queen.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">JOURNALIST:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">Are you open to changing the question?</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">PRIME MINISTER:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">Am I open to change? Well you only change something if what youâve got at the moment is defective. And what we have at the moment as far as the question is concerned is not defective. The Cabinet will, like all of these things have a look at it, and Iâm not going to pre-empt what Cabinet does, Iâd never do that.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">JOURNALIST:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">It seems the question of negotiations on the preamble, youâve already been speaking to Aden Ridgeway this week, is there the possibility of that making the referendum?</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">PRIME MINISTER:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">Well weâre continuing to talk.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">JOURNALIST:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">Any movement on the words mateship, stewardship, custodianship?</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">PRIME MINISTER:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">Well you know how fond I am of mateship.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">JOURNALIST:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">Aden Ridgeway says that there has to be either reference to traditional ownership, stewardship or custodianship. Are they in, are they likely be in?</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">PRIME MINISTER:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">I donât write preambles on the slopes of Oxford Falls.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">JOURNALISTS:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">What about the suggestion from Kim Beazley of a second referendum to boost the yes vote?</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">PRIME MINISTER:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">Well why would I agree to that?</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">JOURNALIST:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">Well what are your thoughts about it?</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">PRIME MINISTER:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">Just for the purpose of boosting one side or the other? Well what an extraordinary proposition. I thought the whole idea was to get a decision as to whether this country wanted to become a republic. Now thatâs the question, I canât see the point of having another question. Look can I just make the observation that we went to a Convention and the understanding was that whatever came out of the Convention the government would put to the people and thatâs what weâre doing. It seems as though the supporters of the yes case because they are troubled about their prospects are now casting around for people to blame. Iâm doing everything I told the Australian people I would do. Iâm having a referendum, Iâm having a vote. Iâm expressing my view, Iâm holding to my opinion, Iâve not changed it and I wonât be changing it, and itâs a matter for the Australian people not for me or Kim Beazley or anybody else to decide.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">JOURNALIST:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">East Timor, Prime Minister. What strategy does the government have in case the UN pulls out of East Timor?</font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">PRIME MINISTER:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">Well I donât accept that that is going to happen. Australia wants a free and open vote and then we want everybody to respect and support the outcome of that vote and that means that if the people of East Timor vote for independence then that should be respected and supported in an orderly way by the Indonesian government. There should be an orderly transfer of power, there should be no precipitive withdrawal by Indonesia, but the rest of the world must understand that if there is a vote for independence then Indonesia will quickly lose interest in the territory and the rest of the world, particularly Australia, will be obliged to provide help and weâll be ready to do that.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Itâs not very productive to be talking in doomsday terms about what may or may not happen if a particular scenario transpires. The important thing is that weâre going to have a free vote and in a free vote everybody who supports having the free vote should respect and support the outcome and thatâs what weâre going to do and weâll continue to play a very constructive and supportive role and I ask the rest of the world to also understand that if the vote goes in favour of independence Australia alone canât look after East Timor, weâll want help from other countries. Weâll play a role, weâll play a major role but we canât play the only role. And those whoâve been yelling loudest for independence for East Timor must be willing to play a role alongside Australia in helping what will be a very weak, fragile and vulnerable country. Fewer than a million people â itâs going to be pretty difficult, pretty tough and the people of that area will need a lot of help.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Thank you.</font></p>
