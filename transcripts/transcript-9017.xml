TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, WISMA NEGARA STATE GUEST HOUSE, TUESDAY,<br />
26 OCTOBER 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Minister, you have had a very brief meeting with the Indonesian<br />
President, can you give us some idea of what the discussion was<br />
about?<br />
PM: It was just a welcome and I think it had a nice relaxed air about it with<br />
a kind of informality that one can't engender without some real basis of<br />
a relationship which I hope we have developed over the last couple of<br />
years. So, it was a very convivial meeting and we'll get onto the matter<br />
of substance tomorrow, although I did have a chance on the way into<br />
the city to talk to Foreign Minister Alatas about some of the issues.<br />
J: What are the matters of substance Prime Minister'?<br />
PM: Essentially I think, they are going to revolve around trade and<br />
investment issues and most particularly of course, the forthcoming<br />
APEC meeting in Seattle in November.<br />
J: Will you be asking the Indonesians to agree to APEC becoming a<br />
community?<br />
PM: I think the Indonesian Government understands well what the Eminent<br />
Persons Group has recommended and I think supports the general<br />
development which APEC is taking. But, again, that is a matter for<br />
Heads of Government and leaders at the November meeting and that<br />
is the whole point of the meeting they will put the construction on<br />
APEC which they think is the appropriate one.<br />
J: Their view seems to be though softly, softly.<br />
PM: Maybe softly, softly, but I don't think slowly, slowly. I think they have<br />
got a nice balance between the pace of change and what it should </p>
<p>encompass, as I think we have as a country which has been very much<br />
involved in the development of APEC from its inception.<br />
J: Mr Alatas has just told us he really appreciated your remarks in<br />
Washington on human rights, will you be going further down that path<br />
here?<br />
PM: What I said there was one deals with a country on the totality of its<br />
relationship and we see the relationship with Indonesia in the broad,<br />
that is a large country of 180 million people, very geographically close<br />
to Australia, developing now at quite a pace and reaching out to the<br />
world and it also has its particular problems as developing countries<br />
do and this has been expressed in a number of ways. In part, of<br />
course, the problems in Timor a few years ago. But, I think the<br />
important thing is to see the relationship in the totality; we have made<br />
our position clear about these human rights issues, but we also are not<br />
a sort of mono-dimensional government. We are looking at Indonesia<br />
in the broad.<br />
J: Prime Minister, given ASEAN's importance to APEC, at Seattle if the<br />
ASEAN leaders that are there have some doubts about changing to<br />
any kind of community faster than perhaps you would like, will<br />
Australia support that position?<br />
PM: I don't think you understand well I mean the importance that the<br />
ASEAN countries put upon the development of the Asia-Pacific or<br />
APEC, they are more positive about this than the media generally<br />
gives credit. Australia, as a prime mover in this has had to take all<br />
views into account those of the major powers, China, Japan the<br />
United States, Indonesia, those of the smaller countries, I think we<br />
have got the balance about right.<br />
ends </p>
