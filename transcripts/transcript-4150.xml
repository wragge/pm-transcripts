THE QUEENS VISIT TO AUSTRALIA: MARCH 1977<br />
The Queen accompanied by The Duke-of Edinburgh will<br />
arrive in Australia at Canberra on Monday 7 March 1977<br />
by air from New Zealand and will leave from Perth<br />
on Wednesday 30 March.<br />
In the course of their stay and after Canberra, they will<br />
engage in an itinerary which will take them to Queensland,<br />
New South Wales, Tasmania, South Australia, the Northern'<br />
Territory and Western Australia, in that order.<br />
The Queen has not visited South Australia and Western<br />
Australia since 1963. In March 1974 here planned visits to<br />
both States had to be cancelled in order to fulfill<br />
constitutional duties in Britain following a General Election.<br />
At-that time it was. I-. er Majesty's hope and intention to<br />
re-visit these Sta~ es; when it proved possible and appropriate.<br />
For next year's viszit, The Queen has asked that her<br />
itinerary include adafed time in both States. They will<br />
therefore be in South Australia from Saturday 19 to<br />
Wednesday 23 March and in Western Australia from Saturday 26'<br />
to Wednesday 30 Ma-rch.<br />
It has already been announced by the Papua New Guinea<br />
authorities that The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh will<br />
visit PapuaTheiur-Guinea from 23 to 26 March. During that<br />
period the Royal Yacht Britannia will travel from South Australia<br />
to Western Australia.<br />
On Wednesday 26 March the-RIoyal iraf on its -flight frboM<br />
Papua New%* Guinea ti) Western Australia,, will stop at Da-rin to<br />
enable. Her Majesty and His Royal Highness to have some<br />
time with citizens of the Northern Territory.<br />
The precise amount of time which The Queen and The Duke of<br />
Edinburgh will spend in the States on the eastern side of<br />
the continent has yet to be determined. It is unlikely in<br />
any instance to exceed two days. The dates which are in<br />
mind at present could undergo slight changes when -further<br />
details of the transport possibilities are related to<br />
the planning of the program. .2 </p>
