PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 431<br />
16 January 1975<br />
AUSTRALIA/ USSR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL CO-OPERATION<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. E. G. Whitlam, and<br />
Soviet Prime Minister, Mr. A. N. Kosygin, yesterday signed in<br />
Moscow an agreement between the Australian and USSR Governments<br />
for scientific and technical co-operation.<br />
In the first instance five fields are to be given<br />
priority for co-operation. They are: earth sciences, plant<br />
industry, radioastronomy, entomology and textile technology.<br />
Small groups of experts in these fields will exchange visits<br />
so that long-term programs for co-operation can be prepared.<br />
The first of these visits has been made by an<br />
Australian group of earth scientists which toured the USSR in<br />
December 1974, for discussions with their Soviet counterparts.<br />
Soviet groups in textile technology and radioastronomy will<br />
visit Australia in February for talks with Australian<br />
scientists and inspections of laboratories. Other exchanges.,.<br />
will take place in subsequent months.<br />
As a result of the pri6r negotiation of the agreement<br />
there has already been a strengthening of scientific cooperation<br />
between Australia and the USSR in some of the<br />
priority areas. It is hoped that the agreement wil'l benefit<br />
scientific development in both countries, and thereby contribute<br />
to furthering bilateral relations between Australia and the USSR.<br />
The agreement will facilitate increased co-operation in both the<br />
natural and the social sciences.<br />
The text of the agreement is attached.<br />
