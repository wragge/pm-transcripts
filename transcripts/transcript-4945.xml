PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 25 JANUARY 1979<br />
BANQUET SPEECH AT NEW DELHI<br />
I address you tonight on the eve of the 26th January, the date<br />
of the deepest significance for both our countries.<br />
For India, the 26th January represents the culmination of<br />
your struggle for independence as a republic. That struggle<br />
constitutes one of the epics of modern history.<br />
I am very conscious that for many of you it is more than that,<br />
that it is biography rather than histroy, something you lived<br />
through and participated in, and which has been a part of you<br />
ever since.<br />
For-Australia, too, this is the day on which we commemorate our<br />
acflevement of nationhood and reflect upon our aspirations as<br />
a nation.<br />
Both our countries achieved independence after a long periodof<br />
colonial rule. I think that we are both free enough of any<br />
inferiority complex and sure enough of our identity to reflect<br />
on that period dispassionately.<br />
It brought us many things which were good and which even today<br />
contribute greatly to our welfare including, notably, modern<br />
science and technology..<br />
I mention those aspects in particular because both our countries<br />
have subsequently been conspicuously successful in building on<br />
those foundations and creating scientific and technological<br />
establishments which are impressive by world standards.<br />
Despite the very great differences in our colonial experiences,<br />
the fact that we were both British colonies means that we share<br />
many things: Common heritage of parliamentary government,<br />
the principle of common law, the independent role of the<br />
judiciary and the rights and privileges of our citizens. It<br />
is a heritage to value.<br />
But when all this is acknowledged, and it amounts to a great<br />
deal, it is still true that colonialism was colonialism, not<br />
to be endured, not to be continued. </p>
<p>Apart from the balance sheet of costs and advantages for<br />
individual countries, the extent to which the world we live in<br />
has been shaped by the colonial experience is striking.<br />
It is very evident in the way states are grouped and labelled<br />
today, and we are living in a world which is obsessed with labelling.<br />
Our countries have had contrasting tags attached to them over<br />
the years. Thus India is a " developing" country, member of<br />
the " Third World", part of the " South" in the North-South<br />
dialogue.<br />
Australia is " developed", " Western" and part of the " North".<br />
How inadequate, and, in some ways, positively misleading these<br />
labels are.<br />
As far as India is concerned, they work to obscure the fact<br />
that, while still a developing nation, you are in many important<br />
respects, industrially, scientifically, culturally, amongst the<br />
most developed countries of the world.<br />
The term " Third World" applied as it is to cover both yourselves<br />
and many countries which are not a hundredth of your size in.-<br />
terms of either population or area, serves to disguise rather<br />
than to illuminate the distinctive character of India.<br />
Similarly, in the case of A stralia, simply calling us " North"<br />
when we are situated deep in the Southern Hemisphere, or " West"<br />
when we are thousands of miles from the centres of western power,<br />
is to miss much of what is distinctive and individual in our<br />
character as a country.<br />
One can understand the appeal of this type-casting. It represents<br />
an attempt to make an increasingly complex world more comprehensible<br />
and manageable.<br />
But insofar as it tends to obscure the living reality with an<br />
abstract concept the unique character of the particular case with<br />
a stereo-type it has its dangers.<br />
Both India and Australia are in important respects atypical<br />
countries whose experiences cut across accepted patterns, which<br />
have a very pronounced characters and voices of their own.<br />
It is precisely in terms of that individuality that, it seems<br />
to me, they can make their most valuable contribution to the<br />
world today.<br />
That world is one characterised to an increasing extent by<br />
bloc diplomacy and bloc thinking. Unless the central<br />
problems which confront it, prob0lems such as: Racialism, with<br />
its unique capacity to poison human relations, the need to redefine<br />
relationships between rich and poor countries inflation which<br />
has the capacity to destoy the international system, and to harm<br />
all people: Unless these problems are solved, we are faced with<br />
the prospect that those blocs will harden, and that rigid<br />
confrontation will result. 3 </p>
<p>The problems we face are not isolated, discrete ones. If the<br />
colonial experince taught us anything it taught us that what<br />
start as economic matters quickly assume political and strategic<br />
implications. In the interdependent world in which we live, one in which issues,<br />
as well as countries, are interdependent, that is a lesson which<br />
it is essential we remember.<br />
Famine, energy shortages, frustrated aspirations for a better<br />
life can lead directly to political crises. And, as recent<br />
events in the Middle East have illustrated, political turmoil<br />
can quickly render ecomonic projections meaningless.<br />
There is a real danger that extremism will prevail, extremism<br />
that takes the form of a refusal to understand the perspectives<br />
and problems of others, the lack of respect for the legitimacy<br />
of different approaches. Let our passion be in pursuit of<br />
tolerance. I believe that, both by example and by acting as voices of<br />
moderation, our two countries can contribute significantly to<br />
averting that danger.<br />
We have it within our capacity to strengthen the cause of reason<br />
and co-operation both within the groups to which we respectively<br />
belong, and by acting as moderators between those groups.<br />
The very fact that we are not typical, that we have distinctive<br />
perspectives of our own and are not inclined simply to run with<br />
any other, make it easier for us to do so.<br />
India already has a distinguished record in this regard. At<br />
the risk of drawing criticisms from all sides, you have been<br />
militant in upholding the cause of moderation.<br />
In your practice, the stress you place on self-reliance,<br />
on solving your own problems and creating the right domestic<br />
conditions for growth and development has provided a healthy<br />
and salutory example.<br />
For while there is most certainly an urgent need for some changes<br />
in the international economic order, this can never be a substitute<br />
for responsible and determined domestic programmes.<br />
In this regard, India's performance over the years stand high.<br />
As India has disassociated itself from the extreme position<br />
sometimes found in the Third World, which depicts relations<br />
between it and the West in terms of irreconcilable antagonism:<br />
So has Australia firmly disassociated itself from the extreme<br />
position in the First World which claims that the Third World's<br />
troubles are all of its own making, that there is nothing that<br />
can be improved inthe international ecomonic system.<br />
In recent years we have increasingly taken initiatives, over the<br />
Common Fund, in the Commonwealth context, in our own region,<br />
to develop and sustain a constructive dialogue between developed<br />
and developing countries. / 4 </p>
<p>Within the councils of the OECD countries we have taken a lead<br />
to ensure that the case of the developing countries is considered<br />
at its strongest and in a sympathetic and positive spirit.<br />
We have done so, and we shall continue to do so, because we believe<br />
very strongly that much is at stake.<br />
The international system will be placed under increasingly severe<br />
strain if the voice of moderation, of plain ordinary commonsense<br />
fails. I hope that our two countries can find ways of collaborating to<br />
diminish the chance of that happening, both by consulting and<br />
co-operating at the diplomatic level, and by developing_ a<br />
mutually beneficial bilateral relationship which will stand as<br />
an instance of what is possible.<br />
I feel very honoured to be your guest on this occasion, My family<br />
and I look forward immensely to the coming week and to the richness<br />
of experience it promises. </p>
