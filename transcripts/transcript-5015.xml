J1, AUSTRALIA &amp; g<br />
PRIPWA1E MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 8 APRIL 1979_<br />
OPENING OF HOCKEY STADIUM,, PERTH<br />
I am delighted to be in Western Australia and to be amongst<br />
sportsmen and sportswomen. It is indeed an honour to be asked<br />
to open the " Commonwealth Hockey Stadium" Australia's gift<br />
to Western Australia on the occasion of its sesqui-centenary<br />
celebrations. The stadium is also a tribute to the<br />
hockey associations of Western Australia.<br />
It is a matter of regret that the late Eric Eastman whose<br />
vision this stadium was did not live to see it completed.<br />
I'm sure we all wish that he was here to share this<br />
day with us.<br />
No doubt, the sesqui-centenary celebrations will remain long<br />
in the memory of all the people of the State and this<br />
stadium will stand as a permanent mark of the interest that<br />
the Commonwealth has taken in this milestone in Western<br />
Australia's history. The game that has'just finished has<br />
shown us how the stadium will add to the sporting life of<br />
Western Australia.<br />
Synthetic all-weather grounds are a remarkable development<br />
and this is a particularly fine example. We have just seen<br />
played on it -an excellent game of women's hockey. I had to<br />
put a restraining hand towards Tamie, a former hockey<br />
player herself.<br />
The women's hockey teams of Western Australia have a<br />
magnificent record with one exception. They have been<br />
Australian champions every year since 1962 and nine captains<br />
of Australian women's hockey have been West Australians.<br />
The Western Australian Women's Hockey Association has been<br />
helped immeasurably by the drive and enthusiasm of a large<br />
number of people, but to mention two the names of<br />
Pat Goodrich and Bertha Beecroft will be familiar to all<br />
those who-love hockey in this State.-<br />
The Commonwealth chose a hockey stadium as its gift for two<br />
reasons. First the gentle arm-twisting of your Premier who<br />
is no mean arm-twister, and secondly, the unabashed advocacy<br />
of the Commonwealth Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs,<br />
Mr. Viner. He is a redoubtable Minister, and, I am-reliably<br />
informed,, is an equally redoubtable and active hockey player<br />
in Western Australia. But influence or not, I am very happy<br />
that we have managed to hit on something which will be<br />
2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
manifestly useful and which meets with the wishes<br />
of Government, sportsmen and sportswomen in<br />
Western Australia.<br />
Western Australia has made its mark in sport over many<br />
years. It is still producing stars, and I go no further<br />
than to mention Rick Charlesworth, Captain of Western Australia<br />
at cricket and Captain of Australia at hockey.<br />
Western Australia has made its contribution to Australia's<br />
reputation in international sport, just as it makes its<br />
contribution to Australia's reputation in many other fields.<br />
For example, in cultural affairs, in education,' in community<br />
activities and commiunity welfare and in the development of<br />
the State's tremendous resources.<br />
One cannot be in Western Australia for long without<br />
acknowledging the tremendous part that your Premier,<br />
Sir Charles Court, has played in its development in mining,<br />
and the international trade in iron ore in particular,<br />
which has had a tremendous effect on Australia's prosperity.<br />
We look now to the encouraging prospects of the North-West Shelf<br />
to provide further stimulus to the economy.<br />
Truly, Western Australia is in the forefront of Australia's<br />
development.. But we are not quite at the stage as his<br />
Royal Highness, Prince Charles, suggested of expecting<br />
Western Australia to buy out the East.<br />
The Commonwealth Government, as you know, has its own programme<br />
for assisting in the development of sport and in particular,<br />
the encouragement of excellence in sport. We are assisting<br />
with financing the Olympic Appeal and Australian hockey has<br />
shone in the Olympic Games. I believe that since 1956 it has<br />
never finished lower than sixth in th e Olympic Games and in<br />
that time it has won two silver medals and a bronze medal<br />
a record of which it can be justifiably proud. Also, in<br />
1978, the Australian team won the Bronze Medal in the world<br />
cup competition.<br />
Ian Viner doesn't let me forget that Western Australia has<br />
played a key part in Australia's success and for many years<br />
has provided the nucleus of Australian international hockey<br />
teams, as well as a number of Captains for our teams such<br />
as Ian Dick, Brian Glencross, Kevin Charlton and Ric Charlesworth.<br />
This stadium is the outcome of the dedication of many people the<br />
outcome of energy and single-minded purpose. It is a magnificent<br />
arena, a fitting gift from the Commonwealth of Australia to<br />
mark Western Australia's sesqui-centenary. I have much<br />
pleasure in declaring the " Commonwealth Hockey Stadium" open.<br />
