ADDRESS TO A2TIONAL P ESS CLUB, CANIHEiH<br />
ON PRIIE : INIS'iER'S ETU. N FiROI VISITS<br />
TO THE UNITED STATES AND BRITAIN 18th July, 1966.<br />
Mr. Chairman, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
It doesn't seem so very long ago that I was talking to<br />
another National Press Club, in Washington, and I w-as able to say<br />
to that gathering that an invitation to speak to the National Press<br />
Club in ' ashington had become a sort of status symibol in the life<br />
of the potential statesman. I think the way you are shaping, Ir,<br />
Chairman, the Canberra National Press Club can claim that sort of<br />
prestige for its functions and I wish you success in the development<br />
of an institution which has added, significantly I believe, to the<br />
value of attending Canberra gatherings by those who have come to be<br />
named amongst the world's most notable.<br />
You had very recently one of the great men of contemporary<br />
times in Dean Rusk I happened to be in New York at the time and<br />
you were being noted with so much significance that a fe: w entlemen<br />
holding up a piece of calico by way of protest to hr. Rusk s<br />
presence found themiselves honoured by front-page treatment in the<br />
" New York Times", but I doubt whether anything I say here today<br />
will be similarly publicised there, but at least the National Press<br />
Club here in Canberra has been noted in this way in one of the<br />
most august papers of the United States.<br />
Nci I don't know that I clearly apprehend how I should go<br />
about this business this afternoon because there was such a<br />
comprehensive cover in the Australian press of everything I did<br />
while I was overseas that it would be a waste of your time to go<br />
over the ground in a narrative way again. It is one of the<br />
significant development of modern times that a public figure in a<br />
position of leadership going abroad does have a coverage,<br />
particularly from his native press and the other communications<br />
media of television and radio, surpassing anything that we have<br />
ever known in the past, and in a sense this is a good thing since<br />
the workings of a democracy require an understanding in some<br />
detail of what it is the head of that democracy is putting publicly<br />
at any particular time. But I would like you to know what this<br />
adds up to in demands upon the itinerant statesman. If, at every<br />
airport his plane touches down, even if only to refuel, he finds<br />
himself met with a battery of television, radio, and newspaper<br />
representatives, then by the time he reaches the country of<br />
destination much of what he wanted to say has been dissipated<br />
along the route. There is always the alternative of turning<br />
rather rudely away from the complicated apparatus that people have<br />
brought at considerable inconvenience and expense to greet him,<br />
but that is not a very popular alternative, and so one usually<br />
obliges by making some comment which the doctors have advised is<br />
not well-considered within 24 hours of a jet journey. Perhaps<br />
that is why so many foolish things are said at airport interviews.<br />
The other thing is that accompanying you these days is a<br />
team of pressmen. In my case I had the comforting presence of<br />
radio and television representatives as well, and the result is<br />
that back home my own people got very full treatment. They<br />
have all heard what I have been saying and doing. They have<br />
read so many accounts of the same sort of general proposition<br />
that some must have wondered why I have been talking so much,<br />
but in point of fact it is necessary to thump your way as hard<br />
as you can to make the slightest dint in the press of the country<br />
in which you are appearing, and I think it is as well for our own </p>
<p>2.<br />
poeple to mkno that. Although . we feel that in some of the<br />
significant areas of policy making and with some of the leaders<br />
of policy around the world, Australia is able to exercise an<br />
influence, the space we occupy in the national press of the<br />
countries concerned is unflattering to our egcs and this must<br />
be accented as one of the facts of contemporary political life.<br />
So don't be surprised if in the course of a journey such as I<br />
have just made you find your spokesman saying apparently over<br />
and over again the sort of thing that you read a week before.<br />
To make his point, to register the argument, w. ith the press and<br />
the public of the country he is visiting these things have to be<br />
done. Well, I think that b' dint of diligence and persistance<br />
on this occasion the points that I desired to make were registeeod<br />
at least in quarters where they will have some impact, and I will<br />
say a wor or two about that as I go along.<br />
. y prime purpose, as you know, w-as to establish closer<br />
working relations with the Prime Lnister of the United Kingdom<br />
and with the President of the United States of America. Both of<br />
them independently of each other had proposed to me that I should<br />
visit then for this purpose. Both of them, independently of<br />
each other, had proposed to me when I took office that I continue<br />
with them the same intimate co; mmunication by way of correspondence<br />
and cable that my predecessor, Sir Robert Inenzies, had conducted,<br />
and this itself is a reflection of the growing place which<br />
Australia occupies in the affairs of the world at this time, or<br />
at least in this area of the w, orld in which we find ourselves.<br />
For my part I w; as very glad to receive these invitations,<br />
believing that it would be nationally advantgeous if I could<br />
develop closer working relationships.<br />
In the result that aspect of the journey turned out far<br />
better than in my most optimistic moments I could have hoped.<br />
Hy visit to President Johnson, as first log of the journey,<br />
proved -: arm, cordial and laid the foundation for the closer<br />
discussions which took place on the second visit, but there were<br />
some valuable discoveries to be made from the first and as these<br />
items have not previously been commented on publicly by me,<br />
I mention them now.<br />
The first was the welcome discovery of how fit and<br />
buoyant the President looks. I had imgined that, having come<br />
through an operation of a serious kind quite recently, and<br />
noting as I had before in the case of President Eisenhower that<br />
the newspaper photographs seemed to take a lot of the blood out<br />
of tho subject, it was encouraging to find in charge of the<br />
affairs of that great democracy this live, vigorous man. Not<br />
only w. as he fit and alert, right on top of his ow-n particular<br />
responsibilities, but that morning he had sat up until 4 o'clock<br />
w'aiting for the reports which had come from the oil installation<br />
bombing operations. I could hardly have tined my visit better<br />
because he lwas anxious to know the results of the bombing and<br />
also to hear the reactions around the world. Je had been<br />
consulted beforehand, we had made known beforehand that in our<br />
view this was a -icgitimate exercise of military tactics, but<br />
it was fortuitous that T happened to be in Washington just on<br />
the morning w-hen the new. s broke, and Wvhat I was able to say<br />
then in support of that decision was welcomed widely by all in<br />
the Administration and by many people throughout the United<br />
States generally. </p>
<p>But one matter I think I shoul. d put quite finrly on the<br />
record. It is important that this should be Imade w. idely known.<br />
There may be doubts around the world, certainly I believe these<br />
doubts exist in the Cormunist w. orld, aboub the strength of<br />
resolution of the President of the United States and leading<br />
members of his Administration in their detclrination to see the<br />
issue through in South Viet Nam. I have no doubtin my mind,<br />
I say that not merely because he made this clear in emphatic<br />
terms to me, but because of my own assessment of the man and of<br />
the very able team of men he has around him. You saw one of<br />
them in the person of Dean Rusk here quite recently. I repeat<br />
I have no doubt in my own mind of the strenth of the President's<br />
resolution, his determination to see this strugle through.<br />
Now I say it is important that this should be known<br />
because those who lead the Commui-' nist forces are not familiar, or<br />
seem to be unfamiliar with our methods of government. To them<br />
it would be unthinkable in their own country that a government<br />
should find itself faced with the hostile voices that one hears<br />
in a democracy without taking some action to supress those voices.<br />
They find leading figures in American life, academic leaders and<br />
others, critical as we find them in our own country. This<br />
influences their own thinking. It becomes a subject matter for<br />
the propaganda material which they subsequently prepare and<br />
consequently it becomes important for us to stress publicly the<br />
belief, if belief exists, and in my case it is the strong belief,<br />
that the President, backed by the capable men he has around him,<br />
is determined to fight on in South Viet Nam until a peace which<br />
meets our concepts of justice and fair dealing and effectiveness<br />
can be procured in that country.<br />
I saw. in one press editorial this morning a query as to<br />
whether there was any substance in the suggestion that the<br />
Americans were determined to go ahead and secure a military<br />
victory before any negotiations would be entertained. Well, as<br />
recently as the time of the release of the communique by the<br />
President and myself, in Washington, it was made clear that<br />
negotiations would be welcomed at any time, and the sooner the<br />
better. We both commended the efforts, negative though they<br />
have since proved to be, of the Prime tinister of India, in seeking<br />
to promote negotiations as early as practicable.<br />
And so we are fortunate, I believe, those of us who are<br />
held secore by the strength, the military might, the free world<br />
leaderh. ip of the United States, we are fortunate that there<br />
should be in that leadership at this time a man of the resolution,<br />
the clarity of vision, and the will to see this thing through<br />
with a view to producing a better world order in that area, in<br />
the person of the President of the United States. Don't let's<br />
overlook the fact that it is not the decision merely of President<br />
Johnson that has been given effect in South Viet Nan. There is<br />
a disposition to think that this is a product of the will and<br />
judment of this one particular Presidential figure in point<br />
of fact he is the third President in succession .' ho has felt that<br />
free world interests and the proper policies for the United States<br />
require an American participation in strength in this area. For<br />
our part, we in this country have the authority of two successive<br />
Prime iinisters backing the judgrcnts of those three Presidents. </p>
<p>In the United Kingdom I had talks which were just as close<br />
and just as cordial with Mr. Iarold iilson. It's rather<br />
unfortunate that not so much pro-: inence has been given to these<br />
talks because they formed for no a basis for continuing<br />
collaboration with him in a most cordial fashion, and, no less<br />
than in the case with President Johnson, I was able to build a<br />
personal relationship with him. ' We spent together one night at<br />
Chequers, the historical residence of Prime Ministers of Great<br />
Britain. We had 3 hours alone in which we canvassed all the<br />
problems I had put down on a sheet of notpaper, matters which<br />
I wanted to raise with him. Later that night I ticked off each<br />
item, in case it proved necessary to follow up next day in the<br />
course of further discussion we had arranged some matters which<br />
had been overlooked. I found that we had covered the whole<br />
field, and although there are differences of viewpoint which<br />
I think have become well identified between the United Kingdom,<br />
the United States and ourselves I for one as a parliamentarian<br />
who has had to work both with a majority of one and with a<br />
majority very much larger than that, don't underrate the political<br />
problems . which Mr. Wilson has to contend with.<br />
Knowing those political problems, the President feels, and<br />
I certainly feel that 1r. Wilson has shown great courage and<br />
firmness in holding his government in support of our presence in<br />
South Viet Nam and in support of the objectives we have there.<br />
I mentioned this to the President and at the same time talked<br />
about concern at what seemed to be a lack of substantial interest,<br />
and even more so on the Continent of Europe, in what is going on<br />
in this area of the world. One has only to pick up the papers<br />
and scan through them each morning to see how little space is<br />
given to events in this area of the world, outside of the day to<br />
day military reporting in Viet Nam itself. And the fact of the<br />
matter is and who are we to be critical of it because I suppose<br />
we don't take all that much interest ourselves in what is going on<br />
in some of the countries of Europe that the people of Europe,<br />
and this goes for the mass of people in Great Britain also, regard<br />
these countries as remote and relatively unknown and thus<br />
possessing no great or direct significance in their eyes.<br />
I happened to arrive about the same time, in fact a day or<br />
so after the French Prime Minister, and great prominence was<br />
given to all that he said and did while he was there. From the<br />
more significant papers, such as " The Times" and one or two<br />
others, we had quite a good press cover of what I was putting,<br />
but clearly the mass of people did not have this interest and if<br />
the mass of people don't have the interest then the Parliament<br />
tends to reflect that attitude of mind and these days Great<br />
Britain, the countries of Western Europe, tend to be inward<br />
looking into their own affairs rather than outward looking in a<br />
way which would embrace the problems of areas asremote as ours.<br />
Well this, from our point of view, may be unfortunate, but<br />
if it exists then it is important that we should know about it<br />
and we should adjust ourselves accordingly. And I come back to<br />
this country with a more balanced assessment, I believe, of the<br />
relative strength of feeling about the future of the area and<br />
this must have its effect on policies as they emerge from time<br />
to time. </p>
<p>In the United States it seemed to me that there was very<br />
vivid reporting and a. groat deal of it of the actual fighting<br />
and events relating to military ocprations in South Viet iNai.<br />
But, again, one found a quite noticeable lack of public reference<br />
to the more positive developments occuring around the South East<br />
Asian area. Now these are not drar. tic in a new. sense, and,<br />
taken, isolated one from the other, perhaps don't seem to amount<br />
to a very great deal. But to those of us who have been dealing<br />
closely with these things over the years, wo feel a great hope<br />
from developments which are now taking firmer shape, which do<br />
evidence a growing co-operation, particularly amongst those<br />
countries of the area -ho have felt thensolves threatened by<br />
Colmunist subversion or attack, or feel the potential danger<br />
which could develop as a result of CoInunist penetration if<br />
country after country were to fall.<br />
And so wo have seen an organisation such as the Asian and<br />
South Pacific Council eecrge with 9 countries, of w: hich Australia<br />
and New Zealand are two not a great power country amongst them<br />
other than that Japan must be considered a great power in an<br />
industrial sense, but in a ilitary sense, not a great pow. er<br />
amongst them. But all of them feeling unity of purpose or danger<br />
from the fact that they are on the periphery of Asia or in<br />
sufficiently close contact to the events in South Viet Na. and in<br />
China, to believe that unless there is a chock to that aggression<br />
then they could be endangered in the future.<br />
We have seen over recent years the way in which countries<br />
formerly threatened, like South Korea, Taiwan and Ialaysia, have<br />
been able to strengthen their economies and to build up their<br />
resources shielded by the strength of the United States and its<br />
establishments throughout this area of the world. And so I made<br />
a point wherever I could of ephasising this and it was heartening<br />
to find that the theme had attracted the interest and enthusiasm<br />
of the President and his Administration. I don't claim that there<br />
was novelty in the matters that I was putting forward, and indeed<br />
Australia has always mi ntained an initiative in this field. You<br />
may remember that Lord Casey, as Iinister for External Affairs, was<br />
one of the very few linisters of Foreign Affairs of any country<br />
outside of Asia directly, who went around those countries and<br />
made our viewpoint known clearly, built up good personal relations.<br />
There was the pioneering work of Sir Percy Spender with the Colobo<br />
Plan. The work then followed up by Sir Garfield Barwick and,<br />
more recently, my colleague Mr. Hasluck.<br />
Therefore, it is not by accident or by geography that<br />
Australia does possess a very warm, friendly and close -: working<br />
relationship with so kmany of these countries. even have a<br />
friendly basis with countries which don't enjoy that same kind of<br />
relationship with very many in the area. For example, we have<br />
very good relations with Cambodia and indeed, represent United<br />
States interest in Cambodia.<br />
Right through the period of confrontation, we nevertheless<br />
managed to maintain a channel of friendship through to Indonesia.<br />
1Vith Thailand, there was the exchange of visits between<br />
the Prime M. inistcr and myself, he visiting Australia first this<br />
year. In the course of my own visit later to South East Asia,<br />
I was able to develop a still closer relationship with him.<br />
These are just syrptoms of the times. The emergence of an<br />
institution like the Asian Development Bank; the arrangements<br />
we are making together for the developnent of the kekong Valley;<br />
the grant by Japan of 800 million dollars of credit to South<br />
Korea as part of the close economic and trade relationships with<br />
that country. These, I repeat, are only sympto but we're </p>
<p>6<br />
dealing wit more than half the numan race East of Suos and with<br />
a population growth rate higher than almost any other country or<br />
area in the world.<br />
By the end of this century that billion and a half of<br />
people may very well have doubled, and in this area the United<br />
States has expressed its determination to join in developing the<br />
resources of this new Asia, in joining in co-operation with<br />
others in order to make more effective use of their own resources<br />
to provide a ray of hope for a better way of life for the people<br />
of these countries. Evidence of this has been quite dramatically<br />
provided for us in the course of the past foe days by the President<br />
of the United States.<br />
Now this was a theme which was expressed quite vigorously<br />
by me and before I had left America and, indeed, by the time<br />
I wont back again for a second visit, had become well taken up by<br />
the Administration and had formed the material for a lot of<br />
approving editorial comment throughout some of the leading<br />
journals of the United States. And I regard this as being just<br />
at the beginning of our activities in this field. Australia and<br />
Japan have given a notable demonstration of what can be achieved<br />
in our friendly trade one with the other. It has multiplied four<br />
and a half times since the early 1950' s and, we believe, we are<br />
just at the beginning of this process.<br />
Now somebody asked I think you, Mr. Chairman, in<br />
introducing me, how far did " All the Way" mean in relation to<br />
the President. I only hope that those who'vc given currency in<br />
this country to the phrase have studied as closely all the other<br />
things that I said while I was there. They would then have<br />
developed a well balanced appreciation of what it was I was<br />
trying to express. It doesn't mean, certainly, that Australia<br />
has any lack of independence of mind, and anybody who knows the<br />
President would be paying him no compliment if they felt that he<br />
was looking for the kind of friend who was never prepared to<br />
have an argument with him. He has a vigorous mind of his own<br />
and he looks for a vigorous exchange of views from those who<br />
invoke friendship with him.<br />
Quite shortly after seeing him in Washington I put some<br />
views in New York to the American-Australian Association which<br />
certainly didn't coincide with Administration policy of the<br />
momeht. I spoke of the need to penetrate both the iron and the<br />
Bamboo Curtains to build up trade as a means of opening up<br />
personal contacts, personal relationships, to have more<br />
frequent visits by reporters, by scientific and cultural groups<br />
and in these and other ways help to establish a human quotient<br />
which would assist in breaking down these resistances. The<br />
phrase I used then I think is worth repeating, not because of<br />
its excellence, but because it does express a concept that I'm<br />
sure all here would adopt. We can't afford to look on the rest<br />
of the world in terms of the " goodies" and the " baddies",<br />
contending that all the right people, the good people, are on<br />
our side, and all the " baddies on the other in the Communist<br />
camp. There are intelligent people, dedicated people, working<br />
for their own national interest in all communities around the<br />
world. For our part, it is for us to -see where those who are<br />
willing to look for a better world can come together in some<br />
settlement arising out of present differences, and apply the<br />
tremendous resources that men are capable of now attaining, to<br />
the betterment of mankind for the better world to which we all<br />
aspire. In the President, we have a practical rnn who is, at<br />
the same time, a man with vision of a better world whether it is<br />
the society that he works for in his own country, or for an </p>
<p>application of the fruits of science and technology to the needs<br />
of the rapidly increasing human race.<br />
Now, out of these discussions, I feel that a basis has<br />
been established in which Australia can play a useful part in the<br />
future. Adopting the old Aesop Fable oi the Lion and the ' i~ uso,<br />
I said-that " Little friends can prove great friends' and Australia<br />
is so placed geographically and in terms of the relationships we<br />
have built up with the countries of Asia, that 0e can, I believe,<br />
serve in a useful way both with the United Kingdom and with the<br />
United States in doing more in this area of the world. The<br />
United Kingdom is conscious of the limitations upon its own<br />
capacities. " Overstrtcdh" was the wori which seemed to signify<br />
the situation in that country. It was put to me by members of<br />
the Government itself. They'. re very conscious of their cormitments<br />
at a time w-hen their resources are not adequate to meet the<br />
extent of the commitments they have undertaken. They have to<br />
bring themselves into a better state of balance. But with the<br />
United States, the position is rather different. If only a<br />
situation of peace and stability could be restored in South East<br />
Asia, then the vast resources that are currently going into<br />
military purposes could, with advantage, be turned to the tasks<br />
of reconstruction and development of areas possessing so much<br />
potential in themselves.<br />
Now, I believe that Australia as a result of all those<br />
talks, finds itself in a position where both the United States<br />
and the United Kingc. om look to us as a country of influence, a<br />
country capable of playing a significant part in the future of<br />
the area. I can say, without any reservation, that no<br />
additional commitments have been sought of this country. These<br />
matters did not arise in discussion between us. I think, both<br />
in the United States and in the United Kingdom, it is recognised<br />
that as Australia grows, so will our contribution, in a security<br />
sense and in the provision of aid. There is a more realistic<br />
appreciation that this country is not making a military<br />
contribution merely in one area or the other, that ' we're doing<br />
so at several points. And there is a more realistic appreciation<br />
that the country which has still a vast continent to develop,<br />
with such limited resources of population, has its own limitations<br />
upon what it can accomplish.<br />
Having said that, gentlemen, I dor't imagine I've covered<br />
your queries by any manner of means, but, broadly, that is the<br />
field which was covered at this time and I feel, in my own<br />
heart, greatly encouraged by the reception given to me as the<br />
representative of this country. It illustrated for me better<br />
than anything else perhaps that I could look for, the regard and<br />
the respect which the Australia of these times is held in the<br />
countries which mean so much to us. The vwanr, co-operative and<br />
friendly relations which these great democratic leaders have<br />
developed for Australia and for its own leadership are, I believe,<br />
happy auguries for the future of this country.<br />
I would just, by way of final cor. ent, say Mr. Chainman,<br />
that the reporting of those who acconipanied me on this tour was<br />
I believe in the best tradition of the craft of journalism, and<br />
I would like to express my personal thanks to them for faithful<br />
reporting and for every consideration given to the subject.<br />
Thank you very much. </p>
<p>QUESTION: L'r, Prime Minister, having soon you in successful<br />
action in Washington, I know the circumstances in which you said<br />
" All the -way with Apparently this has been risconstrued,<br />
not only in Australia but in various parts of Asia. Could you<br />
please reconcile the apparent inconsistency in our desire to be<br />
part of Asia and to participate actively in Asian affairs, and<br />
our equally empha. tic wish that Britain should remain East of<br />
Suez, and that we should be so close to America?<br />
MR. HOLT: Well, gentlemen, in South Viet Nam, and my remarks of<br />
course were directed to that, I had no hesitation in indicating<br />
our full support because, as I've said so often before in this<br />
country, my Government believes that Australia is more directly<br />
involved in South Viet Nam even than the United States of America<br />
itself. We believe that the security of this nation ultimately<br />
is involved in successfully resisting Communist agression in that<br />
country. If it can't be successfully resisted there, then<br />
ultimately, we believe, it will spread through Asia I'm not<br />
saying this is a matter of vears, it may be decades but<br />
ultimately it will spread through South East Asia generally. And<br />
the kind of world in which we will then live will be a very<br />
different world from that which we see today and the even brighter<br />
world which is within our sights tomorrow. And so, when it comes<br />
to American participation, American resolution to see the issue<br />
through in South Viet Nam, Australian undoubtedly is " All the iay".<br />
QUESTION: In view of what you've just said, and in view of the<br />
fact that we know America is in process of a further massive<br />
increase in its forces in Viet Nam, do you foresee at this stage<br />
the possibility of us having to increase our commitment?<br />
HOLT: This was not raised with me, as I have already said,<br />
and I don't regard it as a matter within our early review. Of<br />
course, as time goes on, we will review w. hat the Australian<br />
contribution should be, but there is no escalation in dimension in<br />
contemplation. QUESTION: Was any indication given by Washington of how long the<br />
Viet Nam war could continue?<br />
MR. HOLT: Well, I think a lot of people would like to be able<br />
to forecast this, but r. y political opponent is the only regular<br />
forecaster I know w. ho is prepared to put a precise time on these<br />
matters. I don't think anybody can say with precision, because<br />
it depends on your definition really of military action. I've<br />
always believe that as the Communists were either defeated or<br />
repulsed in major military engagements, they would turn increasingly<br />
to the kind of guerrilla activity which they can conduct at<br />
relatively small, cost to themselves and considerable nuisance and<br />
cost to the forces on our side. We had to contend with that in<br />
Malaya for, what was it, 12 years or thereabouts. But the fact<br />
of the matter is that I had a very thorough briefing on all this<br />
at the headquarters of Admiral Sharp just two days ago as we came<br />
through Honolulu. There is no rmaor engagement these days that<br />
the Viet Cong is winning. Whore the Viet Cong measures up in a<br />
major force, then the forces opposing them are gaining the victory.<br />
the loss ratio is running at about 5 to 1 in respect of the Viet<br />
Cong and North Vietnamese forces against those on our side. Our<br />
people are much better equipped and better organised. There is<br />
improvement in intelligence. There has been a good deal of<br />
success in halting the flow of materials, but even so materials<br />
do get through. We know that the North Vietnameso and the Viet<br />
Cong are having difficulty about food supplies, even more so with<br />
medical supplies. But how long they'll go on taking this kind of </p>
<p>punishment is in their minds, not in ours. So no one can give<br />
you a precise answer on it. I said when I came back from South<br />
Vit Nam that the Viet Cong could not win, and that ve were<br />
making good progress in the military field. That is confir,. cld<br />
by the latest advices which reach me, and results in the guairod<br />
optimism -which has been expressed in 1Washington in recent tim~ i<br />
QUESTION: You state the need to penetrate the Bamboo Curtain<br />
by way of trade and cultural and scientific exchanges. Did you<br />
put this specifically to President Johnson, and, if so, could you<br />
give us his reaction?<br />
IM. HOLT: I did not put it specifically on my first visit. We<br />
had very lir. ited time on the first visit for close personal<br />
discussion. By the time the various ceremonies were carried<br />
out we had a luncheon at the iJhite House where we both spoke;<br />
the next day he left on a speaking tour himself for a couple of<br />
days. He had said to me that he wished to speak with me further<br />
and as this had not arisen by the time we left, I wasn't altogether<br />
surprised when in London he urged me to come back via Washington<br />
before I camjron to Australia. But, in the meantime, and of my<br />
own initiative, I advanced these views while I was in New York.<br />
I think that a large body of opinion in America would favour some<br />
development along those lines. It's not easy for a politician<br />
facing election to advance some of these ideas. I felt they<br />
should be advanced and did so and I don't think anybody was<br />
unduly disturbed by them. I think more hard thinking is now<br />
being given to what ought to be done in relation to China, just<br />
as I hope that inside the Communist camp more hard thinking is<br />
being devoted to w. here they are getting by their present policies.<br />
They must see that they are driving a lot of the non-Communist<br />
world more closely together and that if they allow another ten<br />
years of this process to go on, then there will have been built<br />
up economic strength and trade relationships which they might<br />
find prejudicial to their own interests later on.<br />
. QUESTION: Now that it is clear that the bombing of Hai Phong and<br />
Hanoi has not compelled Hanoi to negotiate on terms acceptable<br />
to the United States, there seems every possibility of an<br />
escalation of bombing in North Viet Nam. There have been<br />
forecastsby American spIkesmen that the next steps might be to<br />
knock out power lines, dams and canals. If this eventuates,<br />
can we assume that the pledge you gave Mr. Johnson of " All the<br />
Way" means that, in advance, we have endorsed such actions?<br />
MR. HOLT: You're dealing with some quite hypothetical situations.<br />
As far as Australia is concerned, just as we were closely<br />
consulted before the other operation, I . m s~ irc . io .: iuld bL-made<br />
, ahy :; fig nifici. at dchngc in American tactics.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Holt, as Australia is proving herself such a<br />
firm friend of America, did you seek American aid for national<br />
development in Australia while you were there, such aid that<br />
America has given to countries that have been hostile to her?<br />
LR. HOLT: No. I made it clear when I got there that I hadn't<br />
come ' to ask for anything. We are, it is true, a good friend of<br />
America and I hope that's a general feeling in this country.<br />
I don't know where people would choose to look for the security<br />
of this country were it not for the friendship and strength of<br />
the United States. There is no lack of will on the part of the<br />
United Kingdom Government, for example, no lack of goodwill </p>
<p>toward this country, but its own capacity to help is limited<br />
these days, and you and I and the rest of us are secure in<br />
Australia today because our security has been guaranteed under<br />
treaty by the United States of America.<br />
QUESTION: If I right take an earlier question a little further.<br />
You have had the opportunity of seeing the situation in Viet Nan<br />
yourself and these talks in the capitals in London and iWashington<br />
how much hope do you put in peace in Viet Nan say, for example,<br />
with Mr. Wilson's forthcoming mission?<br />
MR. HOLT: You don't want me to predict in advance<br />
that it's not going to got anryhcre. I prefer to leave<br />
any cocnt on that until we see the-outcome.-I'mi sure we wish<br />
MIr. . i. lson well in his efforts. He has, of course, made many<br />
visits to Moscow in the past, particularly during the period<br />
when he was President of the Board of Trade, and so he is well<br />
known personally to several of the leading personalities there.<br />
I'm sure that there could be nothing but value from the close<br />
talks that he would have with Mr. Kosygin and other loading<br />
members of the Administration. But, whether the Russians would<br />
act independently of any general Communist attitude, I think is<br />
highly doubtful. But at least as Co-Chairman with the United<br />
Kingdom, there is purpose in them having talks together and from<br />
what I have seen of wilson, if anybody is capable of putting<br />
a view clearly and compellingly, then he possesses those<br />
attributes. QUESTION: Mr. Holt, in place of an extension of the bombing of<br />
North Viet Nam, do you see a greater likelihood of American<br />
ground action from bases in Thailand? Has the President given<br />
you any indication of what the next phase is if the bombing<br />
fails to stop the movement of troops along the Ho Chi Minh Trail,<br />
and if ground action is in his mind, do w. e support it?<br />
MR. HOLT: Well, I dor'lt want to canvass publicly what were<br />
clearly private discussions between us on various possibilities<br />
which may arise. I've already said that we were not asked to<br />
increase our commitment nor have we. But we shall certainly<br />
be closely in touch with the United States regarding future<br />
developments. My own impression is that the Thais have made<br />
it known that they wish to cope with terrorist activity within<br />
their own borders. But I wouldn't claim to be inside their<br />
ninds on that matter, I haven't had any recent discussions with<br />
them. QUESTION: Do you feel that the United States regards Australia<br />
as a more important ally in the South Pacific than Britain?<br />
MR. HOLT: I wouldn't know about that. I'm sure that the<br />
United States values Great Britain's tremendous influence in<br />
world affairs, and there has been for a considerable time a very<br />
close working relationship between the United States President<br />
of the day and the United Kingdom Prime Minister of the day.<br />
In the case of President Johnson and I1r. ' iilson, there have been<br />
frequent exchaiges, visits by iMr. W-ilson to him. Indeed, Mr.<br />
Wilson will be making another one within the next week or so,<br />
on my understanding. The United States would, I think,<br />
believe that Great Britain will tend to decrease its role in<br />
this area of the world. It sees in Australia a country, not<br />
only which already enjoys good relations with others in the<br />
area and which itself by virtue of its geography and circumstance<br />
is placed significantly in the area, but that looking at some<br />
point well ahead from where we are now, we shall be a country<br />
of increasing population, increasing economic strength, able to </p>
<p>11.<br />
play an incroasing part in the affairs of the area. And it<br />
is understandable therefore that , e should be regarded as a<br />
partner, and cw are undoubtedly now regarded as a w,-arm and close<br />
friend. QUESTION: You said a moment ago, Sir, that you did not discuss<br />
the question of trade with China with the President on your first<br />
visit. Could you say whether you discussed it on your second<br />
visit? IR. HOLT: Notin specific t. nrms<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Holt, have you asked the President to come to<br />
Australia and, if so, has he been able to give a time when he<br />
might be able to visit here?<br />
MR. HOLT: I've made it clear that there would be a warm welcome<br />
for him whenever he can arrange to come, and I know he iwould like<br />
to come indeed after we'd gone for the journey down the Potomac<br />
he took me back to the vihite House and arranged for a screening of<br />
a 20-ninute film which he'd taken out here some 25 years ago or<br />
thereabouts, when he was a servicer. an in this area of the world;<br />
it was like most moving films taken by an amateur photographer,<br />
not the best example of the cinematic art, but I've asked him for<br />
a copy of it for our own national archives.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, you've spoken about our alliance with the United<br />
States. You've said that the British attitude towards this part<br />
of the world is going to have some influence on our policy<br />
thinking. You were also reported as saying while you were away<br />
that it was expected that defence expenditure in this country<br />
would rise to about 5 per cent of our gr: oss national product.<br />
Does not this junct. ure of circumstancos mean that we are. going to<br />
have to expect substantial increases in our national sacrifices to<br />
play our part in this part of the world in the coming years?<br />
MR. HOLT: Well, that depends on productivity, the run of the<br />
seasons and a variety of other matters. ! e have, as you know,<br />
entered into some arrangeonts to spread part of the cost of the<br />
defence equipment that we're scocuring a little more widely. The<br />
figure of 5 per cent is one which was mentioned to me by the<br />
Treasurer as a figure which seemed to be looming on what he<br />
could see of the trend in defence expenditure. An end to<br />
confrontation would have a bearing on what our costs are, but<br />
I would hope that we would be able to manage these things without<br />
eating unduly into our development prospects. One f the factors<br />
here which will have a bearing will be the extent to which<br />
capital inflow is sustained. We've had a remarkable year in<br />
that respect, an all-time record inflow, but there are the<br />
restraints being imposed in Great Britain on a voluntary basis,<br />
and some uncertainty as to the future availability of capital from<br />
the United States now that money has shot up in price so much<br />
all around the w-orld. Quite remarkably in *. estern Germany, the<br />
Government is pa-ing there 8, 9 and 10 per cent for money. And<br />
in Great Britain, of course, a 7 per cent bank rate has just been<br />
introduced. So the cost of money may itself prove one of the<br />
limiting factors on the availability of capital here. Now, these<br />
things could all have a bearing on how far we have to restrain our<br />
own expenditures. There is only one country in the w orld that<br />
currently withholds a higher percentage from consumption of its<br />
gross national product, a fixed capital and investment, and that is<br />
Japan. Australia ranks next. So we're already doing a great deal<br />
to help ourselves. I would hope that, with our own efforts, and<br />
with the sort of inspiration that this growth, this feeling of growing<br />
responsibility, a growing place in the world brings,, will result for<br />
us all a better national tema. work enabling us to meet these cor:. itmont, </p>
