EMARGO: 4.00 p. m. SUNDAY<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 8 OCTOBER 1978<br />
PAPUA NEW GUINEA NATIONAL LIBRARY OPENING<br />
The-Prime Minister will visit Port Moresby on 29-30 October to<br />
present Australia's Independence Gift to Papua New Guinea<br />
the National Library of Papua New Guinea. The Library will be<br />
officially received and opened by the Prime Minister of Papua<br />
New Guinea, Mr Michael Somare.<br />
The Government of Papua New Guinea selected a National Library<br />
in 1975 as its Independence Gift from the Government and people<br />
of Australia. The Library was designed by the Commonwealth<br />
Department of Construction in collaboration with the Government<br />
of Papua New Guinea, the Australian National Library and the<br />
Department of Foreign Affairs.<br />
The steel framed building provides approximately 2,900 square<br />
metres of mostly air-conditioned accommodation. Local timber<br />
has been used extensively. Australian slate has been used<br />
in the Foyer and exhibition space. Key features of the design<br />
are two steeply pitched roof forms, modelled on the traditional<br />
Papua New Guiniea architecture of the " Haus Tambaran".<br />
The National Library has space for 180,000 volumes, over 10,000 films<br />
Audio and Video cassettes and other library material.<br />
The Library will also house the Papua New Guinea Collection and<br />
provide a repository for material published in Papua New Guinea.<br />
The building also contains a gallery where displays and<br />
exhibitions can be mounted. </p>
