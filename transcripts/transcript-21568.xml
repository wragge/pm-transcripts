    <content><![CDATA[<p>Good afternoon Ladies and Gentlemen.</p>
<p>I had a meeting with Dr Blix and Kofi Anan.</p>
<p> Dr Blix will report to the Security Council on Friday and it will be a very important report and a very important event in this unfolding issue. He has certain responsibilities under Resolution 1441. The judgements that have to be made are judgements of the Security Council. He has to report on a factual basis as to his experiences. He said some things publicly which you are aware of. I don't intend to add to those or qualify them or detract from them. I don't think it's helpful at this stage for me to be trying to put some particular interpretation on the discussion I had. I certainly found it very useful and illuminating. He was very helpful and very forthcoming about his experiences. I think I will now leave it to him.</p>
<p> He's done a very professional job to date and precisely what form his report takes is a matter for him. I can separately, from what he's told me, repeat what I've said earlier and that is that this is an issue that is obviously one that is coming to a head and it's a matter that the Security Council has to deal with. And a point that I made to him, and I've also made to the Secretary General, is that this whole matter involves, represents a very big challenge to the Security Council. It's a test of the Security Council's capacity and determination to deal with a very challenging issue.</p>
<p> It remains the case in the Australian Government's view that Iraq has failed over a long period of time to comply with Security Council resolutions and there's been nothing in our view that's occurred over the past few days that alters that situation.</p>
<p>As well as talking about Iraq, I had a lengthy discussion with Kofi Annan on a number of other subjects, about East Timor where both of us have concerns about the domestic situation. There is a need to strengthen the domestic policing arrangements. We also talked about the situation in Afghanistan and also in some detail about the need for all of the countries of the world to continue searching hard for some kind of accommodation in the Middle East between the Israeli's and the Palestinian's.</p>
<p> This is an issue I averted to in my address to the Parliament last week. It is our very strong view that Ariel Sharon should use the authority of his re-election and particularly after he's formed his government to try and respond to any opportunities that arise to have constructive peace discussions. It may sound of forlorn hope given the violence that's occurred there but. It's a very important long-term consideration.</p>
<p> We of course, been a very staunch and reliable friend of Israel's, but we're also very strong supporters of the notion of an independent Palenstinian state and there has to be a renewed attempt by the world community to do something about that and that's a responsibility that rests as much on, it rests on both sides and it's very important that it be pursued and I hope that the authority that Sharon has received from his re-election will encourage him to reach out.</p>
<p> I think it was a pity that the Palenstinian's were not able to be physically present at the conference that took place in London. I think that was a mistake. And I don't think anything is lost by facilitating as much contact between the parties as possible.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister you were speaking in terms of a faint hope over the last two days in terms of a resolution coming out of the Security Council.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I wasn't talking about a faint hope of a resolution. I was talking about the faint hope of a peaceful solution would best be realised if you had a resolution. I don't think there's a faint hope of a resolution. I think there's something stronger than a faint hope of a resolution. But I don't want to assert that it's going to happen. I haven't for some time thought another resolution was only a faint hope, but my point about faint hope was that if there was a faint hope of avoiding conflict, military action, then that is to be found in everybody getting behind a new resolution and the whole world saying the one thing to Iraq and most particularly the Arab States at the last minute exerting some influence.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you more or less optimistic?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, my position on that hasn't altered no, no.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>After your discussions over the last few days do you think Iraq has arrived at any genuine acceptance that it needs to disarm?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Do I?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.   No I don't. I don't think there's any evidence of that no.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister are you aware of a new resolution submitted by the Americans and the British by the end of the week. Do you know if that report is accurate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I have no evidence to suggest that that is definitely going to happen. I've heard a lot of suggestions from a lot of people but my latest mail Laurie from both those countries is that there are discussions but it's just not specific.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is it timing or the fact that there is discussions about a resolution?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think there've been discussions going on in an informal way amongst a lot of people about resolutions, but I mean I don't know anything as hard and fast and clear cut as that. I mean as of, I can honestly say, as of this morning I think the matter is still a bit at large as to the detail. I mean clearly the Americans have indicated that they would support a resolution in appropriate terms. They've indicated that.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Shouldn't they wait?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well obviously they've got to wait. They won't doing anything before Blix. Definitely not.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, did Kofi Annan review -prosecute with you the case that he's been making publicly that this issue must be resolved by the UN? Did he appeal for your support for a UN solution?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>He didn't appeal for my support in those terms but he understands our position and our position I've articulated and I repeated it to him. He obviously understands the centrality of the role of the Security Council in this and I do too and I think it's got a very important role. I've been saying that in different forms now for quite a period of time, but look he understood from the discussion I had with him this morning he clearly understands that this is an issue which is very challenging for the United Nations and that if out of this the United Nations is sidelined or bypassed that will do it damage. That's my assessment, they are not precisely the words he used.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did he express concern about the prospect of the United States and Britain leading a move to deal with Iraq without the United Nations?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>He didn't put it in those terms, but how he put his view was he understood how important it was for the United Nations to be involved and to act and to ensure the disarmament of Iraq. I mean we both agreed the goal was to disarm Iraq and if in the process there was regime change well that was one of the consequences, but I didn't get the impression that he was other than somebody who was going to work very hard to see that there was an outcome that was faithful to the decisions that the United Nations has already taken. I mean that is obviously his job.</p>
<p> I have a high regard for him. I think he's been a very good Secretary General and I share the judgement the Foreign Minister made a few days ago that he's been the best Secretary General of the United Nations in our political experience. I think he will try very hard to do the right thing by the United Nations. He also understands the gravity of the situation. He understands that it's coming to a head. I mean I made that point to him and I make that point to, everybody must understand that. The idea that there can be a last minute fudge on this is something that people have to put right out of their minds. It's not going to happen.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did he make any comments about forward deployment of troops?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. None. Oh none, none whatsoever and there was nothing that I heard this morning that suggested, other than that one of the reasons why we've got as far as we have is that there's been pressure applied. Nothing I heard from anybody this morning contradicted that. That's a very important consideration.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Now that you've spoken to Mr Blix do you take seriously the Iraqi concession on spy planes. Do you think it is a genuine (inaudible).</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I said Laurie in answer to an earlier question, did I think anything, John Shovelan asked me, did I think there had been a fundamental change, I forget his exact words, of heart by Iraq. The answer is no and that is based upon publicly available developments.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister is there anything that you'll be taking from your talks yesterday and today that you'll be taking with you to Britain that you will be discussing with Mr Blair when you're over there or this purely,this visit purely for Australia's satisfaction? Is there a peace broker sort of role that you're playing at the moment with these talks?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, what between Britain and the US? I don't think...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You've talked to the President, you've talked to the United Nations today and tomorrow you're...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What I'm doing is as Australian Prime Minister because it is very much in Australia's interests that at this very critical stage of this issue I am fully aware of the what the major players are doing. That I've got my opportunity to put an Australian perspective and there are some very different Australian perspectives.</p>
<p> I mean, our relationship with Indonesia for example is something that we have and is a perspective to this issue that the Americans and the British don't have. And I've made that clear and I mean we have an Australian interest that is largely occupying some common ground. Occupying common ground with the United States and the UK and others, but as in all of these things there are some additional dimensions and issues just as the British have to deal with their European relationship and just as the Americans have to deal with the responsibilities of being the one superpower left in the world and all that that entails so a country such as Australia whilst our major motivation in committing ourselves to the diplomatic effort and the deployment that we have thus far our major motivation is our concern about the twin evils of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of rogue states and terrorism we also have relationships and I mean I'll obviously be explaining Australia's position when I'm in Indonesia as well as doing the other things that I've done, that I 've said I'm going to do.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You've told us on a number of occasions that the pre-deployment was proven military (inaudible) has there been equally prudent planning for an Australian role in reconstruction and perhaps dealing with refugees?.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, as far as what happens if there is military conflict you can be assured that Australia will, as she's done in the past, make a very strong and effective humanitarian contribution, I think I can best put it that way. I've indicated previously that we don't have the capacity and we don't intend to get involved in some kind of sort of major peacekeeping presence if that were to arise, I mean obviously we would be willing to contribute in other ways where we could, but just as we had a few about being involved in the force in Afghanistan, so we might, we would take the same view in relation to an involvement in Iraq. But I mean that is once again sort of jumping a couple of situations ahead and I don't know if it's particularly productive to what we might still be trying to do on a peaceful outcome front going into too much of that detail.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Will Australia take it's fair share of refugees as you argued in the case of Kosovo?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think it's too early to say other than that we'll do the right thing by our international obligations.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What's your reaction of Mr Crean's censure motion following President Bush's remarks about the willing coalition?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well,that's an utterly predictable move I think. I suppose you've got to say something.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did you discuss the question of refugees with the Secretary General either in relation to Afghanistan or Iraq?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No no, not specifically. No. We talked about, you know, obviously we had in contemplation...there's going to be humanitarian need if there were conflict. We both understood that but there could well be, I mean if there were a wonderful change of regime without conflict in Iraq there'd be humanitarian need then because the full extent of the nature of the regime would then become apparent and I think there'd be worldwide pressure for humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible] Prime Minister, whatever regime change whether [inaudible] peaceful or non-peaceful means you're going to have disruption in Iraq,the Kurds, the Shi'ites,the Sunnis,there are going to be refugees anyway.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Jim our position is we'll meet our international obligations.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you spoke about the damage that failure on Iraq could do to the United Nations. How concerned are you about that.? Are you concerned for the organisation future?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think if the Security Council is not seen to be handling this issue in a very direct authentic way difficult though that might prove to be then that will do a lot of damage to the Security Council and because of that to the United Nations. I mean this is a very important test. I mean we're on our what, 17th or 18th resolution, the thing was left dormant, it came back to the UN because of the Americans and you know, that shouldn't be forgotten. I mean there are plenty of people around the world now lining up to throw rocks at the Americans on this. They ought to remember that if it hadn't have been for President Bush's presentation in September it probably would not now....it wouldn't be back in a serious way before the Security Council and I'm certain as I can be of anything if it hadn't have been for the American military deployment you wouldn't have inspectors in Iraq now.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is the Council's credibility on the line?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I just content myself with the words I've used.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, is it serious enough to regard it as a last chance for the United Nations in terms of its role in international peacekeeping....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I refer you to my minds.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did Mr Annan talk to you about any alternative views being proffered by France or Germany or the Russians ...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>In a general way. I mean our discussion proceeded on the basis of the publicly known and perceived differences of approach.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What did he say in a general way about this? You said he talked about it in a general way. Well what did he say though....?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What did he say? Well I mean he said that it was important that the authority of the United Nations be maintained. That's what he said in a general way. That was the whole sort of basis of the discussion and I can understand that, that's his job and he does it very well.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, does the Secretary General believe that [inaudible] deteriorating security situation in East Timor may mean a longer presence for the UN forces and of course Australian troops in East Timor?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look we both agreed that whilst it would be undesirable to have a premature withdrawal, the main area of improvement would have to be in that of domestic policing. You can't forever use peacekeepers as domestic police and it's a misunderstanding of their role to think you should.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is there any role for Australia to help....?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we've already done quite a lot. We've had Federal Police there training people. In fact a very distinguished former member of my own security detail has been up there for six months training people.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you envisage an increased role?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well if there were a good case for it and if we thought it was going to make a material difference we'd have a look at it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Any change to the expected timetable?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Not at the moment. I was just stating the principle that I don't want a premature wind down but that is not the major issue. The major issue is domestic policeing.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister,you called this a peace missione.Have you accomplished anything in the way of peace.What do you think this mission has achieved so far?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think it's certainly given me an even better understanding of the determination of the United States to see the issue resolved, of their willingness to try very hard for that to occur through the United Nations, of the necessity of the United Nations Security Council facing fairly and squarely their responsibilities. I'm impressed with the attitude taken by the Secretary General and he understands the central role of the United Nations and particularly of the Security Council and I'm more convinced than ever that if there is to be found that faint hope of which I've spoken it will best be found, it will only be found if the world community speaks with one voice and in a very strong way in terms of Resolution 1441. And I do see a potential role in that context particularly for many of the Arab states.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can I ask you for an assessment of the Blix Report. His first report said they hadn't begun to cooperate. If he says they have seriously begun to cooperate....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's only two days off, three days off and I'll give an answer to that when I've heard it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So he did he say to you this morning they've now seriously begun to cooperate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm not going to go into any further detail about what he said to me this morning. I'm not. It's reaching a pretty critical important stage. He gave me the, you know, I had the privilege of talking to him for three-quarters-of-an-hour. He'd just got back from Baghdad. He was then going off to talk to Condoleezza Rice. I think it's a matter for him if he wants to say more. He's got an important report to deliver on Friday and I don't really want to speculate publicly about what might be in that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, is there anything though that Dr Blix said to you would convince you that the inspectors with extended time....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look I don't have anything to add to the answer I gave to your distinguished colleague.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, you say the idea of a last minute fudge is out of the question, are you referring to the United Nations or to Iraq?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The world and including both, including the Iraqis and including everybody. I mean this things has got to be dealt with once and for all. That's what I'm saying. People should understand that there's a determination on the part of the United States to ensure that it's dealt with properly. I mean it's been fudged before and I think that quite a number of countries including Australia who, whilst we've been critical in the past of the United Nations and will probably be so in the future on certain issues and we reserve the right to be so. We think this is an important test for the Security Council and if it gets it wrong it will do very significant damage, long-term damage.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On another subject P.M. what about Warnie?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look I am so sorry about that. Obviously it's got to be dealt with in accordance with the processes laid down for these things by the cricket authorities. I hope it all works out for the good, I really do. He's a great Australian cricketer. I had quite a long talk to him in the dressing room at the MCG after the last one-day match against England and he talked quite excitedly about remaining in test cricket for some years into the future and he was a bloke who was very committed. I don't know the circumstances. I know nothing other than what's been in the papers. I just hope the thing is handled in the right way. I'm not suggesting what that right way is but my natural reaction is to hope it all works out well and that he's back playing for Australia.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Any response to criticisms about Telstra supplying yourself and Senator Alston with digital....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Not supplying us, lending us.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Lending,yes. Labor's criticising it. Any reaction to that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I put it on the record, I put it on the public record and I'll be returning it in a few weeks time. It was disclosed, it doesn't breach the rules. I don't know that I've got any more to say.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What did you think of the technology?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's quite impressive, it's quite impressive yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>When you say you put it on the public record Prime Minister, what do you mean?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I disclosed it on the register back in August. I think it was reported in the gossip column of one of the newspapers I think.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did the Secretary-General not give you any indication of the timetable for a possible resolution after the Blix Report?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I don't think he knows.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think anybody knows. I mean you're dealing with 15 countries and they have various shades of opinion. I mean there are no, I mean obviously the British and the Americans are very close on most things but they're not absolutely identical on everything and you can't at this stage start talking about particular days. I mean it is obviously coming to a head. I mean if people start talking about months of the thing being put out that's just out of the question. Let me chance my arm and say if you start talking about a lot of weeks. I think that is being unrealistic too.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>It hasn't got down to days [inaudible] ?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No anybody's talking about days.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did the secretary seek your counsel on Zimbabwe?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no he didn't. Thank you.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
