PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 30 JUNE 1986<br />
I am pleased to announce that, after consultation with the Queen,<br />
His Excellency the Rt Hon. Sir Ninlan Stephen, AK, GCMG, GCVO,<br />
KBE, will remain in office as Governor-General of Australia until<br />
the end of 1938.<br />
I welcome te fact that the Governor-General will continueoin<br />
office throughout the Bicentennial year. Both Sir Ninian and Lady<br />
Stephen have rade an outstanding contribution to Australia since<br />
Sir Ninian'u appointment in 1982 and will continue to do so.<br />
While the appointment of a Governor-General is not for a fixed<br />
term, it hai seen a tradition that appointments are for a period<br />
of about fivo years and that was Sir Ninian's understanding when<br />
he took up th: office. I am grateful to Sir Ninian for indicating<br />
his willingneos to continue in office until the end of the<br />
Bicentennial year. rr ~ curr! IrEW~,.. </p>
