PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 28 AUGUST 1991<br />
JOINT HEADS OF GOVERNMENT PRESS STATEMENT<br />
Former New South Wales Premier and current CSIRO Chairman,<br />
Neville Wran, is to lead nationwide seminars on proposals to<br />
create a truly national market Ln Australia. The proposals<br />
were agreed to at the recent Special Premiers' Conference<br />
held in Sydney on 30 July.<br />
At the conference, the Prime Minister, Premiers and Chief<br />
Ministers agreed in principle that the Australian States and<br />
Territories would mutually recognise each other's product<br />
and occupational standards fromn I January 1993.<br />
This will help remove obstacles to interstate trade and the<br />
mobility of labour posed by differences in standards and<br />
regulations from one State or Territory to another and will<br />
enhance the international competitiveness of the Australian<br />
economy. The Prime Minister, Premiers and Chief Ministers announced<br />
Mr Wran's appointment today.<br />
Mr Wran has agreed to address; seminars in each State and<br />
Territory during September on the proposed models for<br />
implementing mutual recognit: Lon. The seminars are part of<br />
an extensive public consultation process to be carried out<br />
on behalf of Heads of Governent. The seminar dates are to<br />
be advised shortly.<br />
Mutual recognition is a majo~ r advance in microeconomic<br />
reform and is expected to have important benefits for both<br />
Australian consumers and industry.<br />
In essence, mutual recognition means that goods which may be<br />
sold legally in the State or Territory where they were<br />
produced may be sold in any other State or Territory.<br />
Similarly with occupations, a person who is registered to<br />
practise his or her profession in one State or Territory<br />
would be entitled to automatic registration in any other<br />
State or Territory.<br />
The Heads of Government in principle agreement on mutual<br />
recognition reflects the fact that the standards in one<br />
State or Territory meet community expectation and ought to<br />
be generally applicable throughout Australia. Uniform<br />
standards and minimum essential requirements will complement<br />
mutual recognition where these are considered essential. ) I 7 </p>
<p>At the July Conference, Heads of Government noted that there<br />
are certain products which may need to be exempted from<br />
mutual recognition because a national market in those<br />
products would not be desirable. Such products may include<br />
firearms, fireworks, gaming and pornographic material.<br />
They also noted that Ministers have been working to develop<br />
national competency standards for occupations to help<br />
resolve differences in registration and licensing<br />
requirements between States and Territories. They agreed<br />
that such standards should be developed for all registered<br />
occupations and professions by the end of 1992.<br />
The models for implementing mutual recognition which were<br />
approved in principle by Heads of Government are set out in<br />
detail in a Discussion Paper on the Mutual Recognition of<br />
Standards and Regulations in Australia. The Discussion<br />
Paper was released for public comment following the July<br />
Conference. Heads of Government have agreed to allow an extension of one<br />
month on the due date for responses to the Discussion Paper.<br />
Submissions should now be forwarded to the Chairman of the<br />
Committee on Regulatory Reform no later than 8 October 1991.<br />
Further copies of the Discussion Paper and details of the<br />
forthcoming seminars are available from The Commonwealth-<br />
State Relations Secretariat in the Department of the Prime<br />
Minister and Cabinet ( tel 06 271 5296; fax 06 271 5540).<br />
