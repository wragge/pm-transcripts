STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE RIGHT HONOURABLE SIR ROBERT MENZIES,<br />
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
ON TUESDAY, 15th SEPTEMBER, 1964<br />
LOSS OF H. M. A. S. " VOYAGER" </p>
<p>LOSS OF H. M. A. S. " VOYAGER"<br />
On August 26, I presented to the House the report of<br />
the Royal Commissioner on the circumstances attending the loss<br />
of HMAS " Voyager". On that occasion I read out the Terms of<br />
Reference which I therefore need not repeat. I also indicated<br />
that the dovernment had taken steps to obtain advice from the<br />
Naval Board through the Minister for the Navy upon the Commissioner's<br />
findings and the implications of those findings. The Naval<br />
Board, presided over by the Minister for the Navy, consists, in<br />
addition of the First Naval Member, Vice-Admiral Harrington,<br />
the Second Naval Member, Rear-Admiral Smith, the Third Naval<br />
Member, Rear-Admiral George, the Fourth Naval Member, Rear-<br />
Admiral Peek, and the Secretary of the Department. I indicated<br />
that the Board had already begun this task, and had in fact<br />
begun when evidence was still being taken. I then said " when the<br />
results are to hand the Government will give prompt consideration<br />
to them and will then put itself in a position to make a further<br />
statement to the House".<br />
In reply to an observation by the Leader of the<br />
Opposition, I made it clear that I did not undertake to present<br />
to Parliament the observations of the Naval Board since that<br />
body, through its Minister, advises the Government. This is<br />
true of all the Service Boards. For the effective discharge of<br />
their responsibilities they must be able to know that their<br />
relationship to the Government is one of great confidence and<br />
indeed secrecy-When the Government after receiving advice<br />
announces a decision or makes a statement of fact or of policy,<br />
it takes the responsibility for what it does.<br />
In the present case, we have been assisted by an<br />
elaborate examination of the matter by the Naval Board. After<br />
careful consideration, we are not prepared to establish what<br />
would be a harmful precedent, by publishing the report of the<br />
Board. Honourable Members will I think agree, particularly<br />
those with Ministerial experience, that if the Service Boards<br />
came to believe that their reports, to their Minister and<br />
through him to the Cabinet, would be made public there could in<br />
all human probability be some change in the nature of the reports.<br />
Human experience shows that where a document is designed for<br />
publication it may very well be written in a somewhat different<br />
way and perhaps be a little less frank than it would be as a<br />
confidential report. </p>
<p>However, what I am about to put to the House has<br />
been greatly assisted, though of course not controlled, by<br />
the views and comments of the Naval Board, a body which I will<br />
hardly need to say is as much concerned by these tragic events<br />
as all the rest of us, and has displayed a marked willingness<br />
already to make changes in the light of the facts elicited by<br />
the Royal Commission. It will be recalled that although the Royal Commissioner<br />
places the primary responsibility for the collision upon " Voyager",<br />
without feeling able to apportion individual blame among its<br />
bridge officers, he did make critical remarks about three of<br />
those on the bridge of " Melbourne".<br />
In the case of Captain Robertson, the Commissioner<br />
said that in his view when " Voyager" turned to port her action<br />
should have created some doubt in Captain Robertson's mind as to<br />
what her intentions were and the moment the movement to port<br />
passed beyond what would have brought her back on course,<br />
Captain Robertson should have made some enquiry or passed some<br />
signal, whether by whistle or otherwise, to " Voyager". He<br />
went on to add " Whether action of this kind would have avoided<br />
the collision I am unable to say, but I feel that the chances<br />
of a collision occurring might have been lessened if some such<br />
action as I have indicated had been taken by Captain Robertson".<br />
In the case of Acting Commander Kelly and Sub-Lieutenant<br />
Bate, both of whom were on the bridge of " Melbourne", the<br />
Commissioner said " the conclusion I reach is that the watch which<br />
was maintained on the bridge of " Melbourne" by the Officer of<br />
the Watch and the Navigating Officer was in the circumstances<br />
inadequate". These observations by the Commissioner were made<br />
in the light of the evidence given by the three officers themselves<br />
and of Captain Robertson's report after the collision.<br />
The question at once arises as to whether charges of<br />
negligence or neglect of duty could or should be laid before<br />
Courts Martial. This question was made the subject of legal<br />
advice, both from Counsel and the Crown Law Department, and<br />
from the Attorney-General. That advice is against Court Martial.<br />
The principal reason for this view is that, as a matter of law,<br />
statements made by any witness in answer to any question before<br />
a Royal Commission are not admissible in evidence against him<br />
in any civil or criminal proceedings, and that this rule,<br />
established by the Royal Commissions Act, should also apply<br />
to proceedings before a Court Martial. </p>
<p>In the result, it became necessary for our legal officers to<br />
consider what evidence, if any, other than the evidence given<br />
to the Royal Commission, could be adduced on a Court Martial.<br />
Their short answer is that the evidence given by these three<br />
officers before the Royal Commission being excluded and<br />
Captain Robertson's report excluded, there would be no evidence<br />
at all available to what might be described as the prosecution.<br />
As this may seem strange to those who are not lawyers, I will<br />
explain it. At a trial by Court Martial, in which the officer<br />
concerned would be in the position of an accused person, the<br />
prosecutor could not tender as part of his case the<br />
transcript of evidence before the Commissioner;<br />
could not call the accused to give evidence for the<br />
prosecution, hoping to convict him out of his<br />
own mouth. For a man is deemed innocent until<br />
he is proved guilty: it is not for him to prove<br />
his innocence. This is one of the basic<br />
principles of the normal criminal law.<br />
Honourable Members will therefore agree that it<br />
would be grossly unfair and indeed completely improper to<br />
institute a Court Martial if competent advice was that not only<br />
would there be no evidence which could establish an offence<br />
beyond reasonable doubt, which was not the standard of proof<br />
which the Commissioner had to apply, but that there was in fact<br />
no material admissible evidence at all. Strictly speaking,<br />
it would, of course, be possible to amend the legal provisions<br />
retrospectively, so as to make the evidence of the officers<br />
concerned, and any report made by any of them, admissible against<br />
them. I am sure that nobody would support such an astonishing<br />
course. I do not propose to elaborate this. None of us<br />
would wish to conduct some form of prosecution against those on<br />
the bridge of " Melbourne" when such a prosecution would fail at<br />
the outset and would therefore achieve no result except the<br />
somewhat inglorious one of creating an unproved slur upon their<br />
names. The Government accepts the advice that has been given<br />
and confidently believes that there will be wide support for<br />
the conclusions I have just stated.<br />
Indeed I think that Honourable Members would agree<br />
that the important questions which arise are not to be answered </p>
<p>by arguments about whether individuals made errors of judgment<br />
or observation. What we must do by all the means in our power<br />
is to ascertain whether in a general way there was or is<br />
something wrong with naval efficiency or in the procedures<br />
followed in the Navy. This, I think, is a legitimate enquiry;<br />
and, as I will indicate later, we propose to take steps to<br />
pursue it. But justice to a very fine Navy requires that a proper<br />
perspective should be established at the outset. In all armed<br />
services, particularly those which must train and operate under<br />
circumstances of special difficulty, there will from time to time<br />
be human errors. This is, of course, true in every aspect of<br />
life. It is specially true of every Air Force, of every Civil<br />
Aviation network, of every Navy. I do not seek to minimise<br />
the tragic nature of the " Voyager" collision, with its appalling<br />
consequence in lives lost. That is why we instituted the most<br />
searching public enquiry in the whole of our Defence history.<br />
But I think I should point out to the House that experience in<br />
other and older Navies supports the view that naval life has its<br />
own dangers and that, in spite of every precaution in selection<br />
and training, accidents will happen. For example, in the<br />
calendar year 1960, the Royal Navy had 17 collisions at sea and<br />
groundings. The United States, whose records are not public,<br />
is known to have had collisions, including one of a similar nature<br />
to the Melbourne-Voyager collision, in which there was a very<br />
much greater loss of life. Every year, around the Australian<br />
coast, there are, in the mercantile marine, ship mishaps.<br />
None of these excuse the error or errors which led to<br />
the " Voyager" loss, nor should we excuse any deficiencies in<br />
training, efficiency, or discipline that can be shown to exist.<br />
But the facts do emphasise that life at sea has its hazards,<br />
and that this is plainly true in the case of the Navy, which<br />
must prepare itself to fight by day or by night in all sorts of<br />
circumstances and weather and whose preparations can be effective<br />
only by practising by day or by night every sort of manoeuvre<br />
which may be needed in war. I therefore invite the House to<br />
look at the Navy as such, and not be led into what might be<br />
described as a campaign against individuals, some of whom indeed<br />
are no longer able to speak for themselves or to explain what<br />
circumstances of emergency or errors of observation or<br />
communication led them into the courses they pursued.<br />
But in the interests of justice'some individual<br />
observations must be made. Some criticism has been directed<br />
against what has been called Captain Robertson's inexperience </p>
<p>in the handling of an aircraft carrier or in tactical command of<br />
an operation involving an aircraft carrier and another vessel,<br />
We have discussed this matter with the Naval Board in<br />
order to ascertain the facts. As Honourable Members will recall,<br />
comments concentrated on three points; that Captain Robertson,<br />
though a very experienced Naval officer, had joined " Melbourne",<br />
his first Carrier Command, only a month before the collision;<br />
that he had just finished three years ashore; and that he had<br />
never had tactical command of an aircraft carrier and another<br />
ship. In fairness to Captain Robertson, it should be stated<br />
that he had in fact been the executive officer and second-incommand<br />
of an aircraft carrier for 16 months, during which he<br />
was, as part of his duty, understudying the captain.<br />
Three years ashore between commands has been common<br />
practice in the R. AoN. and is dictated by the need to give a<br />
number of officers command experience at sea while securing<br />
the great benefit of using recent sea experience in shore<br />
appointments. This has applied in each case of a carrier Captain.<br />
It is interesting to learn that in the United States<br />
Navy, the careers of nine of their better-known Admirals reveal<br />
that the average time they spent in shore duty before assuming<br />
command of a carrier was 3 years and 4 months.<br />
The practice in the Royal Navy is that of carrier<br />
Captains ( as here) have only one carrier command, and that the<br />
average time spent by each ashore before assuming command of his<br />
carrier is 3 years.<br />
Of the general capacity, not only of Captain Robertson<br />
but of Captain Stevens, there cannot be any real doubt. Each<br />
had a splendid record and very considerable naval experience.<br />
The judge found specifically that the ships and their<br />
equipment were in a proper state of preparedness for the exercise.<br />
There were, however, two criticisms made or suggested by<br />
the Commissioner which have attracted some notice.<br />
The first was that it might be advantageous to practice,<br />
by day, exercises which are likely to occur at night during<br />
the initial " touch and go" practice. We have examined the<br />
Naval Board on this point. Their answer as experts is that the </p>
<p>work-up programme was a full one involving many exercises more<br />
complicated than the manoeuvres required on the night of<br />
February 10. The programme stretched over four or five weeks.<br />
Any difficult exercises, for example, replenishment at sea, where<br />
ships sail close together, and " touch and go" landings by<br />
aircraft, were in fact done, first by day. If all the more<br />
routine ship manoeuvres involved in the programme first had to be<br />
practised by day, the work-up period would be so long as to<br />
reduce very considerably the period when ships were available for<br />
operations. This seems to us to be reasonable.<br />
The other suggestion was that the exercise programme on<br />
the 10th February commenced at 7 a. m. and was still continuing<br />
at 8.56 p. m. when the collision took place and that this was a<br />
lengthy period of time. But the whole point of these exercises<br />
is to equip the Navy for operations of war. The Naval Board<br />
believes, and we see no reason to disagree, that if it were accepted<br />
that 12 or 14 hours exercising so reduced the concentration of<br />
of command teams as to render their judgment unsound, the Navy<br />
could not operate effectively in peace or in war.<br />
I referred just now to the findings of the Commissioner<br />
to the effect that the ships and their equipment were in a proper<br />
state of preparedness for the exercise. The Naval Board,<br />
however, considering all the available evidence and findings, has<br />
concluded that the state of preparedness of " Voyager" could not<br />
have been adequate, having regard to some of the detailed matters<br />
dealt with in the Royal Commissioner's Report.<br />
In the view of the Board, the fact that " Voyager" had<br />
just completed a long refit during which she had a large change<br />
aroundof personnel, and that it is not possible now to discover<br />
where the weakness in her organisation lay, does not adequately<br />
explain the state of affairs existing at the time of the collision.<br />
The Naval Board, therefore, is instructing administrative authorities<br />
to carry out an inspection of ships on completion of refit and<br />
before commencing their work-up to ensure that ships' companies<br />
and equipment are at an appropriate level of preparedness. In<br />
addition, reorganisation of the staff of the Flag-Officer<br />
Commanding the Australian Fleet is being made which will enable<br />
increased visits by staff officers to be made to each ship<br />
while working-up, thus enabling an additional check to be made<br />
and remedial action to be taken if necessary.<br />
I will therefore refer to various specific matters<br />
mentioned by the Royal Commissioner. </p>
<p>I think I should recall to Honourable Members that in<br />
the early stages of the Royal Commission, we became accustomed<br />
to somewhat sensational headlines. It is therefore important<br />
to recall that the ultimate findings were on a much more<br />
moderate scale. However, Honourable Members are familiar with<br />
the Report. They will quite probably be anxious to know<br />
what action, if any, has been or is being taken by the Naval<br />
Authorities. As soon as it was discovered that wheel spanners<br />
had been missing from " Voyager's" escape hatches on the night<br />
of the collision, the Naval Board asked its technical branch<br />
to devise, as a matter of urgency, some better means of<br />
ensuring that hatches could always be readily opened. As a<br />
result, a new mechanism has been produced in the Naval<br />
Dockyard and the escape hatches in naval vessels have now been<br />
modified by fitting this improved securing mechanism, which does<br />
not require the use of a wheel spanner. At the same time,<br />
of course, it must be remembered that, like any other opening<br />
device in any vehicle, even this one may fail if badly buckled<br />
in a collision. Although the Royal Commissioner found that at the time<br />
of the collision not all of " Melbourne's" boats were available,<br />
he said that there was no ground for criticising those in charge<br />
of " Melbourne" in that regard. He praised the work of the boats<br />
that engaged in the rescue operation. The findings of the Judge<br />
have, however, not silenced criticism. It is therefore fair<br />
that I should state a considered view.<br />
* Boats in naval ships, unlike life boats of merchant<br />
ships, are not part of survival equipment. Inflatable rubber<br />
rafts are carried in naval ships for this purpose. Naval boats<br />
are carried in ships for three purposes:<br />
to be used as sea boats so that in some emergency,<br />
such as " man overboard" or a ditched aircraft, a<br />
suitable boat can be put into the water quickly.<br />
These boats are fitted with a device which enables<br />
them to be launched and recovered in heavy weather<br />
and with the ship moving. There is always one<br />
crew standing by one of the sea boats so that it<br />
is ready for immediate use in case of emergency,<br />
" Melbourne" carried three motor cutters of this<br />
type. for the transport of men and stores in harbour.<br />
As these boats are required for use in harbour,<br />
their engine and hull maintenance must be done<br />
at sea, except for the one motor cutter which is<br />
required as a sea boat. </p>
<p>8.<br />
for training and recreational purposes.<br />
On the night of the collision, the emergency boat in<br />
" Melbourne" was damaged in the collision butdespite this, was<br />
in the water in a very short time. The boat's rescue work was<br />
done, as the Commissioner found, with great efficiency.<br />
As soon as it became clear from evidence given before<br />
the Royal Commission that men were not familiar with the procedure<br />
for being winched out of the water into helicopters, arrangements<br />
were made by the Naval Board for all personnel already serving<br />
and for those who join in the future to be instructed in this<br />
procedure. There were many publicised complaints about the travel<br />
arrangements made for survivors. The Royal Commissioner dealt<br />
with this quite precisely. He said:<br />
" In the main, survivors who had long distances to<br />
travel to their homes were permitted to travel by air, and others<br />
travelled by train. There were but few complaints from survevors<br />
in this regard, and I do not think any criticism can justly be<br />
directed against those responsible for the arrangements,"<br />
The Naval Board itself, however, looking at the matter<br />
in retrospect, feels that all interstate survivors should have<br />
been sent to their homes by air from the outset, in spite of the<br />
normal rules. Although the Royal Commissioner found that it seemed<br />
unlikely that very many men were lost once they had escaped from<br />
the ship, he did have comments and suggestions to make about<br />
the nature of swimming tests.<br />
The Naval Board promptly initiated a review of the<br />
swimming tests and has sought advice from the Life Saving<br />
Association as a result of which the tests are being varied<br />
to require a man to be able to keep himself afloat for 10 minutes<br />
instead of 3 minutes. Almost every person in the RtA. N. can<br />
swim. The Board thinks it would be undesirable if the small<br />
minority who cannot swim, despite instruction, were prevented<br />
from serving in the R. A. N. We think that this is right.<br />
The existing storage arrangements for life jackets were<br />
criticised by the Royal Commissioner.<br />
A review of the existing practices ( which have been<br />
identical with those in the Royal Navy) was initiated following<br />
the collision. The Royal Australian Navy Life Saving Equipment </p>
<p>Committee has recommended to the Board that life jackets should be<br />
stowed conveniently to the escape routes from ships and not,<br />
as formerly, in a single store room. The Flag-Officer<br />
Commanding the Australian Fleet is currently and urgently<br />
preparing proposals on the re-siting of such stowages. The<br />
task will take a little time, as space is, for obvious reasons,<br />
at a premium in all naval ships and it will be necessary to rearrange<br />
other stowage so that life jackets can be stowed in the<br />
most important places.<br />
During the hearing, it was said by several witnesses<br />
that they did not know how to operate the inflatable life<br />
rafts. This could well have been the case with a number of<br />
those who joined the Navy before these rafts were introduced.<br />
Since their introduction, instructions have been given to all<br />
recruits as they join the Navy as to how to operate the rafts,<br />
and posters, showing the method of doing so, are displayed in<br />
all R. A. N. ships. The Naval Board, however, has taken steps<br />
to improve the position. Live demonstrations are now given on<br />
the workings of the inflatable life rafts and this, together<br />
with other routines, will be practised as early as possible<br />
in the working-up of a ship and at regular intervals thereafter.<br />
I now return to the important general questions which<br />
have exercised the minds of all of us.<br />
The loss of " Voyager" and the report made upon that<br />
loss may have induced some to reach sweeping adverse conclusions<br />
about our Navy. This would in our opinion be grossly unjust and<br />
unwarranted, since, as I have pointed out, unhappy accidents<br />
occur in all navies and should not be hastily used as a reason for<br />
attacking our Navy as a whole. On the other hand, of course, it<br />
would be most unsatisfying to the public mind and to our own<br />
judgment for us to adopt the attitude that everything in the<br />
Royal Australian Navy is perfect and that what happened on the<br />
night of February 10 was just one of those accidents that must<br />
be accepted as the normal price of Admiralty.<br />
I have already said something about the changes made<br />
by the Naval Board in the light of the evidence before, and the<br />
Report of, the Royal Commission.<br />
Before I conclude, I will say, on behalf of the<br />
Government, something about new steps that we think can be taken<br />
with advantage. But we do think that justice requires that I<br />
should set out certain facts which show that whatever improvement<br />
may on examination be found desirable in the overall organisation<br />
of the Navy and its officers, we have every right to be proud </p>
<p>of the Navy for the way in which it has handled the problems<br />
which have come to it in recent years.<br />
It should be remembered that since 1959 a new destroyer<br />
and four new frigates have completed their building in Australian<br />
shipyards and have been manned and commissioned, together with<br />
a number of smaller support ships, We have acquired a flotilla<br />
of six mine-sweepers which have been commissioned and steamed to<br />
Australia, their base support has been provided and magnetic<br />
mine sweeping has been introduced into the R. A. No. Antisubmarine<br />
Wessex helicopters have been introduced and H. M. A. S.<br />
" Melbourne" converted to operate them. HoM. A. S. " Sydney" has<br />
been brought out of reserve and has been converted to a fast<br />
transport. In this role, she has been effectively employed<br />
quite recently. A modernised replenishment tanker has been<br />
brought into service to complete the fleet's mobility. A new<br />
specialised survey ship has been built in Australia and brought<br />
into service, while three frigates have been converted to oceanographic<br />
and survey work, New weapons and techniques have been<br />
introduced, such as the SEACAT anti-aircraft missile and variable<br />
depth SONAR. The first Australian designed naval weapon, the<br />
anti-submarine system IKARA is being developed in conjunction<br />
with the Department of Supply.<br />
In the introduction of all these new units and<br />
techniques, a very considerable training and logistic and<br />
administrative effort has been involved. Work is under way on<br />
ten new ships for the Fleet, three guided missile destroyers in<br />
four Oberon submarines in Great Britain, an Escort Maintenance<br />
Vessel and two new frigates in Australia.<br />
Preparations are well in hand to cope with the greatly<br />
expanded training and maintenance requirements involved in<br />
absorbing these new and sometimes almost incredibly complex<br />
units in the Royal Australian Navy,<br />
All these things have put a great strain upon the<br />
resources of the Navy, because they have not only required steps<br />
to raise the general educational level but have also required<br />
provision for specialised training in the wide range of activities<br />
required. There is a junior recruit entry scheme which has<br />
involved the setting up of training establishments in Western<br />
Australia and Victoria. The Navy has set up an apprentices<br />
training centre ( which is recognised as one of the largest and<br />
most efficient in the country) to meet the demands for tradesmen<br />
volunteers. </p>
<p>11.<br />
Large numbers of selected officers and men and<br />
technicians are receiving training in Great Britain and the<br />
United States. It is, I think, commonly agreed that R. A. N.<br />
personnel who are sent abroad each year to Britain and the<br />
United States are regarded as being well up to the standard of<br />
their counterparts in the British and U. S. Navies. For some<br />
years, at the request of the Government of Malaysia, the R. A. N.<br />
has provided the Commanding Officer of the Royal Malaysian Navy<br />
and seven other officers for that service.<br />
The manpower strength of the Navy has increased from<br />
10,600 in 1960 to 12,870 at present. It is evidence of morale<br />
that the re-engagement rate has risen from about 8 per cent at<br />
the end of the 1950s to over 50 per cent to-day.<br />
Two destroyers or frigates have served continuously<br />
since 1955, on a rotation basis, with the strategic reserve based<br />
on Singapore, and the aircraft carrier, with escort, has served<br />
a tour of duty each year with the reserve. The general standard<br />
of efficiency of these units and their crews has been the subject<br />
of favourable comment by a succession of British naval commanders<br />
to whose command they have been operationally assigned.<br />
A R. A. N. squadron has participated for several years<br />
with distinction in annual multi-national SEATO and Commonwealth<br />
Maritime exercises. On two occasions, the R. A. N. has been<br />
responsible for the planning and command of SEATO exercises, and<br />
with great credit.<br />
I need not elaborate these matters. The mere statement<br />
of them should be sufficient to show that we have a good Navy and<br />
that we ought not to under-estimate its quality and performance.<br />
* In considering whether new practices or procedures<br />
might be adopted in the Royal Australian Navy, it is as well to<br />
remember that our Navy began as the child of the Royal Navy, a<br />
very great Navy with centuries of tradition and achievement<br />
behind it. We have therefore had a natural tendency in<br />
Australia to inherit the practices of the Royal Navy and, to<br />
a considerable extent, vessel design. This, of course, has<br />
advantages; as a relatively young naval power, we cannot<br />
pretend that we have nothing to emulate or to learn. But it<br />
might turn out that it has some disadvantages, since it may<br />
lead us to believe that the problems of the Royal Navy are in<br />
substance identical with those of our own. </p>
<p>We have learned something about this in the case of<br />
the Army where, having regard to our territorial situation,<br />
we have found it necessary to give particular attention to<br />
training soldiers for jungle fighting in tropical areas and<br />
have considered the weapons that we may require in the light of<br />
similar circumstances. In the Air Force, we have had our own problems. The<br />
kind of Air Force that might be required by Great Britain is<br />
not necessarily the same kind of air force that we feel that<br />
we need. To take a quite recent example, any fast bomber we<br />
wanted would need to have a very long range and would need to<br />
have a speed and manoeuvrability that would enable it to foil<br />
attack at a long distance from its base.<br />
The point I am making is that each country must<br />
consider each of its own armed services in the light of its<br />
own particular circumstances.<br />
Much of what I said earlier was somewhat detailed;<br />
and even then there are many minor aspects of the matter to<br />
which it has not seemed necessary to refer.<br />
But, in examining this tragic event, the Government had<br />
and has several duties,<br />
The first was to put in hand with all speed a searching<br />
enquiry into the causes of the collision, This has been done,<br />
withcut fear, favour or affection, by the Royal Commissioner.<br />
We now know as much as we are ever likely to know about what<br />
happened that night, and about the acts or omissions of those<br />
conducting the manoeuvres)<br />
The second is to restrain ourselves from harsh judgments<br />
upon individuals, and in particular upon those on the bridge of<br />
" Voyager", who are lost and gone and cannot speak for themselves<br />
or personally influence our judgment,<br />
Nor, for the reasons I have stated, should we, having<br />
decided that no charge can legally be laid or supported against<br />
Captain Robertson, Commander Kelly, or Sub. Lt. Bate, seek to<br />
condemn them for deficiencies of observation or action which<br />
the Commissioner has found were not the primary ( which I understand<br />
to mean the effective) cause of the collision.<br />
The third, and at this stage the paramount duty, is to<br />
establish and enhance the future efficiency and morale of the<br />
Royal Australian Navy; a military arm vital for our national </p>
<p>13.<br />
security. This is a duty to be performed with understanding and<br />
judgment; its performance not to be impaired by extravagant<br />
attacks, or to be abdicated by an uncritical defence of the<br />
status quo. The statement of this third duty, indeed, brings me<br />
to the nub of the matter. I think it probably right to say<br />
that the people of Australia are not looking for individual<br />
scape-goats. They know that the R. A. N. has a splendid record<br />
in two great wars, and that its international reputation is<br />
high. They have read with a mixture of pride and anguish the<br />
findings of the Royal Commissioner about the efficiency with<br />
which operations after the collision were conducted, the<br />
absence of panic among the men, and the outstanding gallantry of<br />
those to whom the Commissioner has directed attention. They<br />
will, no doubt, have properly concluded that a service which<br />
can train men to this high point of discipline and efficiency<br />
has much in it to be recognised and praised. Clearly, the<br />
general morale is high.<br />
But the Government is well aware of the existence of<br />
a feeling of uneasiness because of some recent incidents, of<br />
which the latest is the " Voyager" disaster. It is not our<br />
practice in Australia to conceal such incidents. Indeed, in<br />
two which involved loss of life, the investigations have been<br />
conducted in public. This is not the normal practice in other<br />
navies. We believe that the uneasiness may arise partly from a<br />
natural failure fully to understand the hazardous nature of<br />
naval training and service even in time of peace, when preparations<br />
must be made for active service in circumstances of great menace<br />
and difficulty. But we also believe that there may be doubts,<br />
not capable of precise definition, as to the effectiveness of the<br />
naval organisation, including communication procedures, and as<br />
to . the suitability of the methods of selection, training and<br />
promotion so far practised.<br />
To this criticism we have most anxiously directed<br />
our attention. For whatever the overall efficiency of the<br />
past, and I have made recognition of it, we must meet the<br />
challenge of the future. We will not be afraid to make<br />
changes where they prove desirable. In particular, we must<br />
not assume that practices followed by other and much greater<br />
navies are necessarily appropriate to our own, with limited<br />
numbers, a much smaller fleet, and peculiar geographical and<br />
strategic circumstances. </p>
<p>14.<br />
Steps will be taken constantly to review procedures in<br />
the light of the special character and circumstances of the<br />
R. A. N. It would be wrong to say that the cause of the " Voyager"<br />
collision was maladministration on the part of the Naval Board, for<br />
proper look-out and navigational moves on individual ships are<br />
matters of individual efficiency and judgment on the part of<br />
those at sea. But it is right to say that much good may result<br />
from re-examination of methods of selection, training, and<br />
promotion, and of constantly improving general efficiency.<br />
How should such review and re-examination be made?<br />
It has been suggested that we should seek the services of a<br />
British or American Naval Officer of suitable rank and experience.<br />
We reject this suggestion. What we are looking for is Australian<br />
answers to Australian questions relating to an Australian service,<br />
operating in its own special circumstances. There are plenty<br />
of Australian Senior Naval Officers of ability, experience,<br />
and integrity, as capable of giving advice as any.<br />
It would, of course, be quite unsatisfactory if<br />
changes in organisation or procedures were conditioned upon the<br />
occurrence of some mishap which directed attention to some defect<br />
in the Service. Our study must be wider and more continuous.<br />
Yet we have noted that in the Air Force there is a Standing<br />
Committee to investigate air accidents; that it goes to the<br />
spot rapidly; that it concerns itself particularly with such<br />
problems as faulty construction or maintenance, defective<br />
communications, and inadequate control. Its reports are a<br />
valuable source of recommendation for improvements, and have<br />
contributed usefully. to the increasing efficiency of the Air<br />
Force. Enquiries are made by experts into naval incidents;<br />
but they are essentially ad hoc, and are made by varying groups<br />
of people. We have decided that there should be a Standing<br />
Naval Committee of Investigation, with as much continuing<br />
membership as the circumstances of the Navy will permit.<br />
But for a general review the Government must and will<br />
accept its proper responsibility. It will, through a Ministerial<br />
Committee presided over by the Minister for the Navy, the Cief of<br />
the I. aval Staff b7ing associated with him, and with the professional<br />
naval advice available to it, ' closely and regularly consider<br />
ways and means of reviewing Naval Organisation procedures and<br />
methods so as to make improvements where these are found to be<br />
desirable. </p>
<p>We believe that under these circumstances the Navy<br />
can go on with its vital service to the nation in co-operation<br />
with the Government and with the moral backing of the Australian<br />
people. I repeat that we have a fine Navy, with a gallant and<br />
devoted company of officers and men. It is the task of all<br />
of us in responsible authority to remove any discoverable<br />
impediments to its full effectiveness. </p>
