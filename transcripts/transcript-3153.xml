SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR, E. G. WHITLAM, 0l. C., AT<br />
THE OPENING OF THE SOCIETY OF ST, VINCENT DE PAULO " OZANAM" HOME OF<br />
PEACE AND CONTENTMENT, CAMPBELL, A. C. T. 14 FEBRUARY 1974<br />
I AM ESPECIALLY PLEASED ON THE DAY AFTER MY RETURN FROM<br />
SOUTH-EAST ASIA TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE LAUNCHING OF A NEW<br />
ENTERPRISE OF THE ST. VINCENT DE PAUL SOCIETY. FOR AMONG THE VERY<br />
WIDE RANGE OF ITS ACTIVITIES, THE SOCIETY HAS INCLUDED TRAINING<br />
PROGRAMS AND MATERIAL ASSISTANCE IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA. UNDOUBTEDLY,<br />
SINCE ITS FOUNDATION BY A GROUP OF STUDENTS 141 YEARS AGO, THE<br />
SOCIETY HAS CARRIED ITS WORK AMONG THE POOR INTO AS MANY AREAS<br />
AS POSSIBLE. THE SOCIETY'S WORK AMONG THE HOMELESSo THE YOUNG,<br />
THE HANDICAPPED AND THE DISADVANTAGED, BOTH IN AUSTRALIA AND<br />
OVERSEAS, TESTIFIES TO THE VIGOUR WITH WHICH THE PRINCIPLES SET<br />
By FREDERICK OZANAM ONE OF THE GREAT CATHOLICS OF THE LAST 2oo<br />
YEARS ARE BEING PURSUED.<br />
THE NAME YOU HAVE CHOSEN FOR YOUR LATEST ENTERPRISE,<br />
A NEW AGED PERSONS HOSTEL1 IS THEREFORE PARTICULARLY APPROPRIATE.<br />
AND YOUR POLICY OF ADMITTING AGED PEOPLE ' TO THIS HOME ON THE BASIS<br />
OF NEED IS IN LINE WITH THE HIGHEST IDEALS OF THE FOUNDER OF THE<br />
SOCIETY. THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS HAPPY TO HAVE BEEN<br />
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ENDEAVOUR. CLEARLY THE 1297,000 WHICH THE<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS PROVIDED UNDER THE AGED PERSONS HOSTELS ACT HAS<br />
BEEN WELL DIRECTED.<br />
ANOTHER SOURCE OF PLEASURE FOR ME IS TO SEE THAT, IN<br />
ESTABLISHING THIS HOSTEL, THE SOCIETY HAS SHOWN A FULL AWARENESS<br />
FOR A MODERN APPROACH TO HOUSING FOR THE AGED. THE BREAKDOWN<br />
OF THE TRADITIONAL THREE-GENERATION FAMILY UNIT THROUGHOUT THE<br />
WESTERN WORLD AND ITS REPLACEMENT BY THE SO-CALLED " 1NUCLEAR FAMILY" I </p>
<p>-2-<br />
HAS CREATED AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM WITH THE CARE OF THE AGED.<br />
FOR TOO LONG THE PROBLEM WAS DEALT WITH BY PROVIDING ONLY ONE<br />
CHOICE THE NURSING HOME FOR AGED PEOPLE WHO DID NOT HAVE<br />
THEIR OWN HOME OR WHO COULD NO LONGER LIVE THERE. THIS FORCED<br />
MANY AGED PEOPLE INTO A STYLE. OF ACCOMMODATION WHICH WAS NOT<br />
APPROPRIATE TO THEIR NEEDS. MIANY OLD PEOPLE WHO WERE FIT AND<br />
WILLING TO PARTICIPATE ACTIVELY IN THE SOCIETY AROUND THEM HAD<br />
TO LIVE IN INSTITUTIONS WHICH WERE INTENDED FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE<br />
LESS PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY CAPABLE.<br />
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CARE<br />
OF THE AGED IN RECENT YEARS HAS BEEN THE GROWING EMPHASIS ON<br />
PROVIDING OTHER CHOICES FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE. THE GOVERNMENT<br />
ACTIVELY SUPPORTS AN APPROACH BASED ON HAVING THREE TYPES OF<br />
ACCOMMODATION PROVIDED FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE WHO NO LONGER CAN STAY<br />
AT HOME. WE WANT TO SEE THESE PEOPLE BE ABLE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN<br />
SELF-CONTAINED UNITS, HOSTEL-TYPE HOMES AND, ONLY WHERE THIS IS<br />
MEDICALLY NECESSARY, NURSING HOMES. THE CREATION OF HOSTEL-TYPE<br />
ACCOMMODATION HERE IN CAMPBELL BY THE ST. VINCENT DE PAUL<br />
SOCIETY FULLY ACCORDS WITH THIS THREE-TIERED APPROACH.<br />
M1UCH REMAINS TO BE DONE IN THIS AREA, EVEN NOW IT HAS<br />
BEEN ESTIMATED THAT ABOUT 25 PER CENT OF PEOPLE CURRENTLY IN<br />
NURSING HOMES SHOULD NOT BE THERE. WE MUST EXPLORE QUICKLY AND<br />
VIGOROUSLY ALL POSSIBLE MEANS OF PROVIDING OTHER CHOICES FOR THE<br />
AGED. THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IN THE LAST YEAR HAS TAKEN<br />
SEVERAL IMPORTANT STEPS TO REVIEW AND REVISE THE APPROACH TO<br />
AGED PERSONS HOUSING. THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED SOCIAL FELFARE<br />
COMMISSION APPOINTED A COMMITTEE TO INQUIRE INTO AGED PERSONS </p>
<p>-3-<br />
HOUSING IN JUNE 1973 AND IT GAVE AN INTERIM REPORT TO THE MINISTER<br />
FOR SOCIAL SECURITY AT THE END OF NOVEMBER, IN KEEPING WITH THE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S POLICY OF MAKING DOCUMENTS OF THIS KIND PUBLIC, THE<br />
INTERIM REPORT WAS PROMPTLY TABLED IN FEDERAL PARLIAMENT, IT MADE<br />
A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS, PARTICULARLY RELATING TO<br />
GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES, I EXPECT THAT CABINET WILL CONSIDER THE<br />
REPORT AND MAKE A DECISION ON THESE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE NEXT<br />
FEW WEEKS, MEANWHILE THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY WILL<br />
CONTINUE AND I WOULD DRAW SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT<br />
ONE OF ITS TERMS OF REFERENCE IS TO INQUIRE INTO ITHE NEED FOR<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO INTRODUCE ANY ALTERNATIVE OR ADDITIONAL<br />
GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS OF ASSISTANCE FOR THE HOUSING AND CARE OF THE<br />
AGED, IN ADDITION TO THIS COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY, THE MINISTER<br />
FOR SOCIAL SECURITY, MYR HAYDEN, EARLY LAST YEAR ASKED A STANDING<br />
COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH AND IEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL<br />
TO INQUIRE INTO AND REPORT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF GERIATRIC CARE<br />
GENERALLY IN AUSTRALIA, THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN MEETING REGULARLY<br />
UNDER THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF DR DAVID DE SOUZA, AN EXPERT IN THE FIELD<br />
OF GERIATRIC CARE, THE COMMITTEE IS EXPECTED TO REPORT TO MR HAYDEN<br />
VERY SOON, ON ANOTHER FRONT, THE MINISTER FOR HOUSING, MR JOHNSON,<br />
HAS ASKED THE STATISTICIAN TO CONDUCT A NATION-WIDE SURVEY OF<br />
AGED PERSONS' HOUSING NEEDS, IN ASKING FOR THE SURVEY MR JOHNSON<br />
DECLARED THAT THE STUDY WAS NECESSARY IF EFFECTIVE ACTION WAS TO<br />
BE TAKEN TO SOLVE THE GRAVE HOUSING PROBLEMS NOW CONFRONTING MANY<br />
AGED PERSONS, ESPECIALLY PENSIONERS, THE SURVEY IS SCHEDULED TO<br />
BEGIN IN DECEMBER THIS YEAR, </p>
<p>THESE INVESTIGATIONS ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT COMMUNITY<br />
ACTIVITY IN THIS AREA IS APPROPRIATE TO THE NEEDS OF OUR SENIOR<br />
CITIZENS. THE GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER, HAS NOT BEEN CONTENT TO DO NOTHING<br />
FRESH WHILE IT AWAITS THE RESULTS OF THE STUDIES, IT HAS TAKEN<br />
ACTION TO MAKE MORE MONEY AVAILABLE FOR AGED PERSONS HOUSING AND<br />
FOR DOMICILIARY CARE FOR THE AGED, IN MARCH LAST YEAR IT ANNOUNCED<br />
THAT PEOPLE CARING FOR SICK AGED RELATIVES IN NEED OF NURSING CARE<br />
IN THEIR OWN HOMES WOULD BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR A 814 A WEEK GOVERNMENT<br />
GRANT. IT HAS ENACTED AN AGED PERSONS HOMES BILL WHICH INCREASED<br />
FROM 810 TO S12 A WEEK THE RATE OF SUBSIDY PAID TO ELIGIBLE<br />
ORGANISATIONS WHICH PROVIDE PERSONAL CARE SERVICES FOR THE AGED<br />
IN HOSTEL ACCOMMODATION,<br />
TWO OTHER GOVERNMENT ACTIONS LAST YEAR WERE DIRECTED<br />
TO THE NEED FOR IMPROVING HOME CARE FACILITIES FOR THE AGED.<br />
THE DELIVERED MEALS SUBSIDY BILL WAS ENACTED TO INCREASE THE BASIC<br />
RATE OF SUBSIDY PAID TO ".' lEALS-ON-' HEELS" SERVICES FROM 15 CENTS<br />
TO 20 CENTS PER MEAL. THEN THE STATES GRANTS ( HOME CARE) BILL WAS<br />
BROUGHT IN TO INFUSE EXTRA FUNDS INTO THE PRESENT HOME CARE<br />
PROGRAM., THE BILL INCREASED THE GOVERNMENT'S GRANTS TO THE STATES<br />
FROM A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR BASIS TO 92 FOR EVERY Ãµ 1 SPENT BY THE<br />
STATES ON HOUSEKEEPER AND HOME HEALTH SERVICES AND SENIOR CITIZEN<br />
CENTRES. IT ALSO INCREASED THE SUBSIDY FOR WELFARE OFFICERS<br />
EMPLOYED FOR SENIOR CITIZEN CENTRES FROM HALF TO TWO-THIRDS OF<br />
THEIR SALARY. </p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT'S AIM WITH ALL OF THESE ACTIONS IS TO<br />
ENSURE THAT ALL AGED PEOPLE THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA CAN LIVE IN<br />
COMFORT AND DIGNITY AND THAT ALL AGED PEOPLE CAN SPEND THEIR<br />
TIME IN AN INTERESTING AND STIMULATING ENVIRONMENT.<br />
TO ACHIEVE THIS AIM WE MUST ENSURE THAT WE ALLOW-J FOR T1HE<br />
UTMOST FLEXIBILITY IN THE CARE OF THE AGED. 1! IE BELIEVE THAT, IF<br />
AT ALL POSSIBLE, AGED PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO LIVE IN THEIR<br />
OWN HOMES AND MUCH OF OUR ACTIVITY WILL BE DIRECTED TOWARDS THIS<br />
END. VIE HOPE THAT THE AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE PLAN WILL PROVIDE A<br />
FRAMEWORK FOR THIS. THiE PLAN, WHICH AIMS TO ASSIST IN THE<br />
DEVELOPMENT AT A REGIONAL LEVEL OF NATIONALLY CO-ORDINATED<br />
WELFARE ACTIVITY, WILL PROVIDE FOR COST SHARING WITH LOCAL<br />
AUTHORITIES AND VOLUNTARY AGENCIES OVER A WIDE RANGE OF WELFARE<br />
SERVICES. HOPE THAT THE PLAN WILL ENABLE GREATER ATTENTION TO<br />
BE PAID TO HOME VISITING AND OTHER DOMICILIARY CARE SO THAT ELDERLY<br />
PEOPLE CAN REMAIN IN THEIR OWN HOM1ES FOR AS LONG AS POSSIRLE.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT IS ALSO EXAMiINING THE POSSIRILITY OF ESTABLISliING<br />
DAY CARE CENTRES TO WHICH AGED PEOPLE WOULD GO FOR M1EDICAL<br />
TREATMENT AND SERVICES, SUCH AS CHIROPODY, WHILE LIVING AT HOME.<br />
THIS CONCEPT HAS THE ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGE THAT IT WOULD OFFER THE<br />
POSSIBILITY OF REGULAR AND WIDE-RANGING SOCIAL CONTACT FOR<br />
ELDERLY PEOPLE. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
WHETHER THE AGED LIVE AT HOME OR IN HOSTELS OR IN NURSING<br />
HOMES, IT IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY OBVIOUS THAT WE MUST DO ALL THAT<br />
WE CAN TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO REMAIN INVOLVED IN THE<br />
COMMUNITY AROUND THEM, THIS NEED IS FREQUENTLY OVERLOOKED AND<br />
A KIND OF GERIATRIC APARTHEID HAS RESULTED. THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES<br />
THAT WE MUST EXPLORE ALL POSSIBILITIES FOR WIDE-RANGING SOCIAL<br />
CONTACT AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT FOR THE AGED. AS AN EXAMPLE, MR HAYDEN<br />
HAS ASKED THE SOCIAL WELFARE COMMISSION TO LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITY<br />
OF SENIOR CITIZEN CENTRES BEING USED AS A BASIS FOR DAY CARE SERVICES.<br />
THIS WOULD ENABLE AGED PEOPLE TO LOOK AFTER CHILDREN WITH WHOM THEY<br />
COULD DEVELOP A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP.<br />
I AM SURE THAT THE SOCIETY OF ST. VINCENT DE PAUL SHARES<br />
ALL OF THESE AIMS AND IDEALS. THROUGHOUT ITS HISTORY IT HAS<br />
EMPHASISED THE NEED FOR PERSONAL CONTACT BETWEEN ITS WORKERS AND<br />
THE PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY ARE INVOLVED.<br />
AGED PERSONS HOUSING AND DOMICILIARY CARE WILL NOT, OF<br />
COURSE, BY THEMSELVES SATISFY OUR AIM OF ENSURING A COMFORTABLE<br />
AND DIGNIFIED LIFE FOR THE AGED. THE GOVERNMENT IS COMMITTED TO<br />
IMPROVING THE LOT OF ELDERLY PEOPLE IN OTHER WAYS, PARTICULARLY<br />
IN FINANCIAL TERMS. ON THE SECOND DAY OF THE FIRST SITTING OF THE<br />
NEWLY ELECTED PARLIAMENT LAST YEAR A BILL WAS INTRODUCED TO INCREASE<br />
PENSIONS BY $ 1.50 A WEEK. PAYMENT OF THE PENSION INCREASE WAS<br />
MADE RETROSPECTIVE TO THE FIRST PAY DAY AFTER THE 1972 ELECTIONS.<br />
THE BUDGET PROVIDED FOR A FURTHER INCREASE OF $ 1.50 A WEEK IN<br />
PENSIONS IN THE SPRING. THESE TWO INCREASES HAVE MEANT THAT WITHIN<br />
A YEAR PENSIONS HAVE RISEN BY 15 PER CENT, WHICH HAS ALLOWED THEM<br />
TO KEEP AHEAD OF INFLATION. </p>
<p>14E HAVE CONSTANTLY RE-AFFIRMED r) IhR INTENTION TO LIFT<br />
PENSIONS To 25 PER CENT OF AVERAGE WEEKLY MALE EARNINGS. IN KEEPING<br />
WITH THIS AIM WE HAVE ALSO REPEATED OUR PLEDGE TO INCREASE PENSIONS<br />
EACH SPRING AND AUTUMN UNTIL THIS LEVEL IS REACHED.<br />
IN ADDITION TO THESE INCREASES, THE GOVERNMENT IS MOVING<br />
TOWARDS THE ABOLITION OF THE MEANS TEST ON AGE PENSIONS. THE FIRST<br />
STEP TOWARDS THIS OBJECTIVE WAS TAKEN IN THE BUDGET WITH THE ABOLITION<br />
OF THE MEANS TEST FOR ALL PEOPLE AGED 75 OR MORE. ANOTHER STEP WILL<br />
BE TAKEN IN THIS YEAR'IS BUDGET.<br />
IN THIS CONTEXT OF LIBERALISATION I WOULD ALSO MENTION<br />
A MEASURE OF PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE TO ELDERLY CITIZENS WHO HAVE<br />
COME To AUSTRALIA FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. THE NATIONAL PARLIAMFNT<br />
ENACTED LAST YEARl A BILL WHICH MAKES AVAILABLE AGE AND SOME OTHER<br />
PENSIONS To AUSTRALIAN PENSIONERS WHO WISH TO LIVE IN ANY OTHEP<br />
COUNTRY. NO LONGER WILL AN AGED PERSON WHO HAS WORKED HARD IN<br />
AUSTRALI. A LOSE THE SOCIAL SERVICE FRUITS OF HIS LABOUR SIMPLY BECAUSE<br />
HE WANTS TO SPEND HIS LAST YEARS IN HIS COUNTRY OF ORIGIN.<br />
IN ALL THAT IT IS DOING, THE GOVERNMENT AIMS TO OVERCOME<br />
THE DISADVANTAGES AND INEQUALITIES THAT TOO MANY AGED PEOPLE HAVE<br />
SUFFERED IN THE PAST IN AUSTRALIA. BELIEVE THAT WITH PROPER<br />
PLANNING AND ADEQUATE SPENDING WE CAN ERADICATE THE WORST OF THE<br />
INEQUALITIES THAT AT PRESENT EXIST. WE BELIEVE THAT, BY CO-OPERATING<br />
WITH VOLUNTARY AGENCIES SUCH AS THE SOCIETY OF ST. VINCENT DE PAUL,<br />
WE CAN ENABLE AGED PEOPLE TO HAVE THE DIGNITY AND COMFORT WHICH IS<br />
THEIR RIGHT. WE APPLAUD ALL THAT YOUR SOCIETY HAS ACHIEVED IN THE PAST<br />
AND WE KNOW4 WE CAN COUNT ON YOUR CO-OPERATION IN THE FUTURE. </p>
