    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased that the Iraqi National Football Team will be playing a soccer match against an Australian representative team at Arena Joondalup in Western Australia on Sunday 16 November, as part of a tour by the Iraqi team.</p>
<p>The Australian Government very much supports this significant tour, and we will be contributing $50,000 towards the staging of the match against an Australian side.</p>
<p>It is intended that the match be held as a practical way of encouraging sporting development and goodwill, and reflecting this it has been named the World Peace Game.</p>
<p>The Western Australian Sports Centre Trust is to be commended for its efforts to organise the World Peace Game and Tour by the Iraqi team.</p>
<p>The Australian representative team for the World Peace Game will consist of current and/or former Australian Institute of Sport players, members of the Western Australian State Team, and will also include former Socceroo  Mr Robbie Slater.</p>
<p>Iraq';s National Football Team is coached by Mr Bernd Stange, the former coach of Perth Glory.  I wish Bernd and his team well for a rewarding and successful visit to Australia.</p>
<p>I urge Australians to support the match on 16 November, and the other matches and events associated with the tour.</p>
