<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, there was some surprise in the audience, you'd</p>
<p>   been searching for a long time for an alternative word to multiculturalism.</p>
<p>   It seems that you weren't able to find one, you used it and....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I have used it on occasion and I'll continue to use</p>
<p>   it. It's what's involved in tolerance and diversity that</p>
<p>   counts rather than a particular word. I notice you have on this</p>
<p>   van an expression that I once used and got into trouble for, One</p>
<p>   Australia. And you've actually now got it on the van.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well, at least it's not One Nation.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No exactly. I know but it's very interesting, isn't it.</p>
<p>   With the passage of time the expressions and words can acquire different</p>
<p>   meanings.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The theme of the conference has been inclusiveness. What's</p>
<p>   your understanding of inclusiveness? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, my understanding of inclusiveness is that everybody should</p>
<p>   feel comfortable and part of the Australian community no matter</p>
<p>   what their ethnicity is, no matter whether they were born in this</p>
<p>   country, as I was, but as many in the audience were doesn't</p>
<p>   really matter. This country is as much theirs as it is mine and</p>
<p>   that people should feel that they have as they work hard the opportunity</p>
<p>   of achieving of what they want to achieve and achieving of what</p>
<p>   they want to achieve for their families. That's what I regard</p>
<p>   as inclusiveness. I don't think it's a set of rigid rules,</p>
<p>   and I don't think it's a sort of politically correct checklist</p>
<p>   of whether you use the right expressions, it's a question of</p>
<p>   how you relate to one another and how you treat each other that</p>
<p>   really matters. I mean, tolerance is something that is an attitude</p>
<p>   of mind and is part of the spirit. It's not a question of whether</p>
<p>   you use the right buzz words or not. I think that is somewhat artificial</p>
<p>   and somewhat peripheral.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Responding to that, Ita Buttrose mentioned, raised, in her keynote</p>
<p>   address that tolerance is something that should be replaced by value</p>
<p>   because tolerance suggests that you're simply putting up with</p>
<p>   migrants. Valuing their contribution is probably more important.</p>
<p>   Would you agree?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I prefer to look at value on an individual basis. I value</p>
<p>   a person because of who he or she might be irrespective of what</p>
<p>   their background is. So I suppose everybody has a different way</p>
<p>   of expressing these things. I think tolerance is a marvellous expression.</p>
<p>   I don't think it's a begrudging expression. I think it's</p>
<p>   a very Australian expression because we are a tolerant people but</p>
<p>   we're also a very proud people and we have every reason to</p>
<p>   be proud. Everybody has a different way of expressing these things.</p>
<p>   I think we should be tolerant and understanding enough of those</p>
<p>   differences. You should never be too prescriptive about the national</p>
<p>   identity, it is always a mistake. It was always a mistake to say</p>
<p>   that the Australian identity represented this and this and this</p>
<p>   in the 1940s and it is now a mistake to say the Australian identity</p>
<p>   represents something else. I think there are a lot of things that</p>
<p>   we all agree on about the Australian identity and there are probably</p>
<p>   a few things that the margin that we disagree on and we shouldn't</p>
<p>   get too obsessive about listing these things, otherwise we spend</p>
<p>   our time with endless naval gazing seminars about what expressions</p>
<p>   we should use and really that's pointless.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On an issue of disagreement there was obvious reaction in the audience</p>
<p>   during your speech to your suggestion that the translator and interpreter</p>
<p>   service should be commercialised, to be run on a commercial basis.</p>
<p>   Is that on a pay as you go type service.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the exact detail of it is still in the process of being worked</p>
<p>   out but the principle is no different from what we've applied</p>
<p>   to other government services. We're not singling it out but</p>
<p>   I defend that, I think it's the right way to go, just as I</p>
<p>   defend the government's decision on the two year waiting period.</p>
<p>   I know many people in the audience don't agree with that decision</p>
<p>   but there are a lot of people in the broader community including</p>
<p>   a lot of people who came to this country as migrants a few years</p>
<p>   ago who agree with it very strongly. But they're the sort of</p>
<p>   things where we're going to disagree. But there is no broad</p>
<p>   disagreement between the government and most of the groups represented</p>
<p>   in the community on major issues but we're going to have differences</p>
<p>   at the margin and we're going to have differences of emphasis</p>
<p>   and people will want me to go further than I will and I'll</p>
<p>   disagree with them and they'll disagree with me and some of</p>
<p>   them will support me and some of them won't. But that's</p>
<p>   Australian democracy.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister thanks for cramming in the van.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you Andrew. I hope it is a great source of further contact</p>
<p>   between SBS and the communities that its reaching and the facilities</p>
<p>   are marvellous and I hope I have the opportunity of talking on your</p>
<p>   programmes in the future.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well we'll certainly invite you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
