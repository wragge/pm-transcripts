<p>Mr Imai, gentlemen.  Thank you very much for your warm words of welcome.  Can I say how great it is to be back in Japan and particularly to be amongst people and leaders of companies that have played a major role in the economic progress and development of Australia over the last 40-50 years.  </p>
<p>The companies represented around this table from Japan have been strong investors and they have been partners in the economic growth of my country since the late 1950s.  And I take the opportunity of recording my gratitude to those companies and my gratitude to Japan, which has been one of the major foreign investors in Australia,  whose markets have consumed large volumes of Australian goods and services, whose economic partnership continues to be at the very top level of the economic relationships that Australia has.  </p>
<p>Economically there is no country which is more important to Australia than Japan.  Japan has been a good friend, a very reliable customer and a true economic partner.  And it is important that the character of that relationship be reaffirmed and where the opportunity presents itself, to be further strengthened.</p>
<p>My visit to Japan allows me to renew friendships with many of you.  It also allows me to meet leaders of your government who are embarked upon major historic reforms of your economy.  To express our understanding and support and our respect for the nature of the challenge that lies ahead.  It's also an opportunity at a business gathering for me to say again how important it is that all of us, at both a government level and also at a business level, resist those around the world who would seek to return to high protectionism and to look inwardly in relation to economic matters.  It is important that all of us argue the benefits that globalisation has brought to the economies of the world and the benefits that globalisation has brought over time to poorer countries.  </p>
<p>We cannot walk away from globalisation.  The challenge for governments is to harness to the advantage of their citizens the benefits of globalisation.  To ensure that the vulnerable are assisted to adjust but not to turn their backs on globalisation.  The responsibility of governments and businesses together is to explain and advocate more vigorously the benefits of globalisation and greater openness in our economic activities.  That is certainly my objective, I know it is the objective of the business community here in Japan, I know it is the objective of the business community in Australia, and I know it is the objective of your government and your Prime Minister.  </p>
<p>Can I say again gentlemen, it is very good indeed to be back with you.  To say again how important our partnership is with Japan and the Japanese business community and I look forward very much to our discussions over lunch.  </p>
<p>Thank you. </p>
