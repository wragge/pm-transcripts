<p> E &amp; O E  -  PROOF ONLY</p>
<p>HOST: Prime Minister, thanks for joining us. Now what do you make of our performance in London?</p>
<p>PM: Good morning Kochie, it's just a delight to be here. There's an incredible atmosphere of anticipation, everyone body's joyful and I'm very proud of our team. I think we've done tremendously well in London and I'm looking forward to saying to every athlete on that plane, well done to you, it's an amazing thing to get to go and compete in the Olympics.</p>
<p>HOST: Have you had a chance to mingle around and chat to some of the family and friends who are there to greet them?</p>
<p>PM: I've had the opportunity to wander through the crowd you can see here and to say hello to a few people, met some tiny little kids who are wearing t-shirts welcoming home Uncle Dan  -  purpose made those t-shirts. It's just a beautiful atmosphere and I'm sure there's going to be lots of hugs and lots of tears and lots of joy.</p>
<p>HOST: All sides of politics have been great supporters of our elite athletes over the years, of course a lot of them focusing on Rio in four years' time. Will that Government support still be there or a little bit more over that four years?</p>
<p>PM: Absolutely Kochie, we're providing record funding now and we'll keep working with our athletes, with our Olympic movement for Rio in 2020  -  2016 is what I should be saying. I've got 2020 on my mind because we've got such a young team, I actually think many of the people we've seen put in good performances in London are going to be there for us, not only in Rio but for a long period of time to come.</p>
<p>Look at young people like Brittany; they are going to be a big part of our sporting future.</p>
<p>HOST: And what will you say to them? I mean there's obviously a few athletes on that plane that need at little, you know, need some nice, kind words and a bit of enthusiasm and a bit of, I guess sort of confidence building.</p>
<p>PM: I'd say to each of them don't forget what a big thing it is to go and represent your nation. However you've performed when you got there, whether you came first or whether you came last, to go to an Olympic Games, to represent your nation, to represent Australia is a special thing. Very few people get to do  -  we'll never get to do it  -  so be proud of that achievement.</p>
<p>HOST: Now we know you're a massive Western Bulldogs fan in the AFL, but what sport did you play when you were younger?</p>
<p>PM: I am a massive Western Bulldogs fan and I'm still grieving from the weekend so you're on a sore topic here! When I was younger I played a little bit of netball and a little bit of hockey but I wasn't very good.</p>
<p>HOST: You know what, you sound like the rest of us, don't worry. There's a pretty elite bunch on that plane. They're certainly above average, aren't they.</p>
<p>It's great to talk to you, I know that you need to get back to official duty, so Prime Minister Julia Gillard thanks very much for your time.</p>
<p>PM: Thank you very much.</p>
