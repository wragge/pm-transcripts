PRIME MINISTER<br />

EXTRACT FROM TRANSCRIPT OF RADI[ O INTERVIEW WITH STEVE RAYMOND OF 2UE<br />
1% M~ r. F r ; 13e, 1! ttc ck -en * a3 0ra I Mo t or s<br />
Hlolden in Par Iii-, e~ ycste-rday. va,-that' a conisidered<br />
-statement or did YOU just happen to blowr your cool' 7<br />
P. M. No. It was thoroughly considered and discussed with the<br />
Minister for Employment and IAdustrial flelations. ' I don't<br />
think it w-as a savagye atakeither. It was just stating<br />
the facts, becauso there haO been a Cfull be~ nch decision<br />
of the Arbitration Comimission hours before, arnd the company<br />
just went against the full bench decision. Nor wre sometimes<br />
critic ise some tradeo unions for n t abiding by decisions<br />
of the Arbitration Commiss-ion, by seeking more or doing<br />
some thing differently and if a gronIt corporation i~ s going<br />
to break the rules set Jown by the Commission, I think it<br />
deserves similar criticism,<br />
QUESTION: There have been some dire threats made overnight about<br />
possible drastic cutbacks on future purchases from Hloldnn<br />
by the Govcrnmont3<br />
P M.<br />
QUESTION:<br />
P. M.<br />
QUESTION:<br />
P N. Well I don't think those threats ivero made by the Government.<br />
They ce'rtainly haven't been made by myself, because if<br />
we have contracts WO hoeei them. But I dlid see some<br />
speculation in the neirspapelri about types, of action.<br />
Would you contemplate action along these lines?'<br />
I prefer that this matter be settfled industrially, by<br />
an acceptance that the rules, of the Arbitration Commission<br />
be abided. 1 by-and I ' czlbevery disappointed if General<br />
Motors floldon kno'.! in( 7 the,( Govornmctnt ' s vididn7 t pay<br />
groater attention tlhe wora. E of the Arb~ tration Commission.<br />
You know, wre used to have a very healthy cnj.') rt in motor<br />
cars and in Jioldens in particul. ar. Now becauzi of inflation<br />
adsomice changed trading circunstanices, they-fii9-themnselves<br />
priced out of export markets which 9' think has been running<br />
fo.-the wrhole industry at 60 or 70 thousand units, Under<br />
those circumstances there is a. responsibility I bel eVe<br />
not only to the company-arnd its sha; reholders but also to<br />
the country in which the corporation happeiiE; to be,. operating.<br />
That needs to be more widely recognised,<br />

by the former n 1, ooe n: cei nlvo -Leso probl~ oems, C 0u 1<br />
I ash you t-o clear the air sir at for . n n ~ t~ n<br />
are you for indexat ion now or would you t1 . ihc : Oose<br />
scrapped? Wlthere have been many misunderstiindi ngsq about whiat.<br />
indexation means.* The common view, a 1 s an<br />
it is the viewr that wrage index) ati on and thc guide izies </p>
<p>-2-<br />
laid down by the Commission meant that every quarter<br />
whatever was in the Consumer Price Index would flow<br />
through into increased wages. The first principle laid<br />
down. by the Arbitration Commission makes it plain that<br />
that is not so, and that it is open to tle parties to<br />
argue not for a percentage increase but for a flat rate<br />
increase or even for no increase The Commission states<br />
that the CPI will be applied unless the parties before<br />
the Commission argue otherwise. It wasn't meant to be<br />
automatic.<br />
QUESTION: But wasn't that the inference you gave leading up to<br />
the election with the knowledge that the CPI was predicted<br />
to turn out at least around<br />
P. M. We said that we wrould support the wage indexation agreement,<br />
but we also have a responsibility to try and establish full<br />
employment and overcome inflation. We are not going to<br />
establish full employment again and we are not going to<br />
overcome inflation unless there is restraint, not only<br />
by corporations but also restraint by wage earners and<br />
trade unions, Many people are coming to realise the<br />
constant-round of wage and price increases really isn't<br />
making anyone better off. After the last 6.4% increase<br />
a large number of companies immediately said " Well, wr<br />
are going to the prices tribunal to get higher prices".<br />
We are sitting on a merry go round and we have to get<br />
off the merry go round,<br />
QUESTION: I am . not an economist but someone who is respected as<br />
much as Professor Matthows says that ta: indexation will<br />
only work if it is fully implemented in the next budget<br />
either all or nothing at allo Could you explain your<br />
strategy in introducing it in stages?<br />
P. M. Well, our strategy is to go as far as we can in the next<br />
budget. But there is a cost the total cost last year<br />
I think would have boon ,1,200 million. If indexation<br />
had been implemented in the last budgec on top of all<br />
the other expenditure by the Commonwealti. Government then<br />
instead of approaching .5,000 million, the oficit would<br />
have been over 06,000 million. There is obviously a<br />
limit to the extent that that process can go orl, So<br />
what we have said is that the extent to which wo can<br />
implement tax indexation in the next budget will depend<br />
on the success wo have in restraining Government expenditure.<br />
Now what we have done so far can be regarded as an initial<br />
step towards cutting out extravagance, but I have made no<br />
bones about the fact that there are going to be harder<br />
decisions ahead of us in our efforts to restrain the<br />
unreasonable growth of Government expondituroo Upon the<br />
success of that will depend upon the extent to which we<br />
can and will introduce tax indexation. W0 certainly will<br />
make a starto<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Fraser, is it true you are considering major amendments<br />
to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act?<br />
r<br />
7 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PM. Some amejdments are being considered,-yes certainly. The<br />
M'inister . or Employment and Industrial Relations will<br />
announce these at the appropriate time but it was in<br />
our policy to introduce secret ballots for the election of<br />
all elected officials of industrial organizations and<br />
that includes employer organisations not just trade unions.<br />
There are some other amendments that vo vill also want to<br />
make.<br />
QUESTION: Along what lines?<br />
P. M Well some of the amendments wi ll be along the lines of<br />
amendments mooted by the previous Labor Government but<br />
which were never introduced, giving the Minister power<br />
to appeal against the decision of single commissioners<br />
to the full bench, eCog, where they felt that was<br />
necessary in the public interest. Those matters will<br />
be unfolded at the proper time by Mr. Street,<br />
