    <content><![CDATA[<p>The names of the Australians killed in the MH17 atrocity a year ago today are etched on this plaque just as they are etched in our hearts.</p>
<p>The plaque is set in soil that one of our police officers brought back from Ukraine.</p>
<p>He knew that the place where MH17 came to rest was sacred and that a piece of it should come back to Australia.</p>
<p>It was a humane and decent thing for him to know and do.</p>
<p>It was a contrast to the savagery that brought down the plane.</p>
<p>So today we remember our dead, we thank those who brought them home.</p>
<p>But most of all, we acknowledge the suffering of the bereaved.</p>
<p>You have had the worst year of your life.</p>
<p>Hardly a moment would go by when you don't think of a parent, a child, a sibling, a friend, present in your thoughts but painfully absent from your life.</p>
<p>Today our nation pauses to acknowledge your tragedy.</p>
<p>May this permanent memorial to your loved ones, close to the memorial to those killed in Bali, be of some comfort.</p>
<p>We won't forget them and we won't abandon you.</p>
