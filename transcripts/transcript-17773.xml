The Prime Minister, Julia Gillard and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Kevin Rudd expressed their shock and deep concern at yesterday's deadly attack on the compound of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Mazar-e-Sharif, Afghanistan.</p>
<p>“We utterly condemn this brutal and senseless attack”, Ms Gillard said.</p>
<p>“The United Nations has been a steadfast friend to the people of Afghanistan”, said Mr Rudd. “The staff of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan are dedicated to building peace and stability in Afghanistan, and better, safer and more prosperous lives for its people.”</p>
<p>“Attacks on these UN workers are deplorable”, Mr Rudd said. “The Australian Government calls on those responsible for this crime to be identified and prosecuted for this grave offence.”</p>
<p>Ms Gillard and Mr Rudd extended their sincere condolences to the families, friends and colleagues of those killed, to the United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, and to the Special Representative of the Secretary General, Staffan di Mistura.</p>
<p>They called on the UN not to allow this outrage to impede the vital work that the UN undertakes in Afghanistan and many other of the world's trouble spots.    </p>
