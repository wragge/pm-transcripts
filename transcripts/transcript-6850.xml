,, USTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 4 MARCH 19B6<br />
The Queen has approved Letters Patent and Regulations<br />
establishing the Australian Police Medal which will form part of<br />
the Australian system of honours and awards.<br />
The Regulations provide for the Medal to be awarded for<br />
distinguished service by a member of an Australian police force.<br />
The awards will be made by the Governor-General on the<br />
recommendation of the Minister responsible for each police force<br />
and will be notified in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette.<br />
The first awards will be announced in The Queen's Birthday<br />
Honours List in June this year.<br />
The medal will carry an entitlement to the use of the post<br />
nominals " APH".<br />
The awards will be limited to an annual allocation to each force<br />
of one award for each thousand, or part of one thousand, serving<br />
members of that force, together with one additional award.<br />
The new award will be placed immediately above the Medal of the<br />
order of Australia in the Australian order of Precedence of<br />
Honours and Awards.<br />
Arrangements are in hand for the manufacture of the insignia of<br />
the award which was designed by Mr Stuart Devlin, CMG, who<br />
designed the insignia for the Order of Australia, the Australian<br />
Bravery Decorations and the Defence Force Service Awards. He<br />
also designed the Australian decimal currency in 1963/ 64. </p>
