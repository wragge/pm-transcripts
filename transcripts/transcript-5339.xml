EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
I<br />
PRIME MINISTER 4&gt;<br />
FOR MEDIA SATURDAY, MAY 3 1980<br />
ADDRESS TO RIVERVIEW COLLEGE<br />
This is a very special year for Riverview and it is a pleasure<br />
for me to be able to share some small part of it with you.<br />
I am grateful for your invitation.<br />
The celebration of a centenary represents a milestone in any life.<br />
For a school, it offers the chance to reflect how a philosphy<br />
in action has stood the test of time. I know that Riverview<br />
has passed this test with flying colours.<br />
The diversity of your scholastic, cultural and sporting<br />
achievements and the contribution made to community services by<br />
bovs who have felt the influence of Riverview, add each year<br />
to the school's impressive history.<br />
There is a temptation, on occasions such as these, to reflect<br />
how an institution's progress has outstripped the expectations<br />
of its founder. And this is true in many cases. But such a<br />
sentiment in relation to Riverview does poor justice to the<br />
vision that Father Dalton had for this school more than 100 years<br />
ago. Nor does it taken into account the men of learning and care<br />
who have so successfully guided Riverview since the day on<br />
February 12, 1880 when the two Moore boys became the school's<br />
first boarders.<br />
At that time, this beautiful venue was a forbidding environment<br />
for anyone, including someone of Father Dalton's indomitable<br />
faith. But there was one area where, unfortunately, even<br />
Father Dalton's faith could not prevail. He came to Sydney to<br />
establish his new school filled with-the spirit of Australian<br />
nationalism. In Melbourne, he had found Australian rules in<br />
triumphant possession of the football field-He recogni-sed it, even<br />
then, as the Australian game. When he came to* Sydney and found Rugby<br />
f lourishing, he dismissed it as apassing phase. But bef ore the decade<br />
was out, the school magazine was forced to admnit, reluctantly, that<br />
" the days of the gane in New South TWales are numbered."<br />
By 1892 innovation and entertainment died and the game was<br />
discarded. But that was a rare failure for Father Dalton.<br />
His undoubted success was the acquisition of such a grand setting<br />
for a school. His diary sums up the reason for buying this site<br />
When he said,<br />
" The most beautiful situation, commanding a really<br />
grand view completely isolated and central to the<br />
parish ( of North Shore)'.<br />
In different ways, these qualities remain. </p>
<p>-2<br />
To them, from the beginning, Father Dalton added his conviction<br />
in the value and necessity of Catholic education. But the triumph<br />
that we celebrate today is the product of a long and often bitter<br />
struggle. While no reasonable person today would dare challenge<br />
the right of church schools to their share of public funds; or<br />
challenge our objective to see that, for the poorer schools# that<br />
share should be increased; that was not always the case.<br />
Everbody knows, that for three quarters of a century, the rights<br />
of church schools, and those who attended them, were ignored.<br />
They,, should not today be taken for granted. The challenge to<br />
freedom in education: to the right of parents to educate their<br />
children as they see fit is still with us. But the kind of<br />
spirit that prevails here today; a spirit born of success in the<br />
face of a struggle, is the kind of spirit that will enable the<br />
cause of schools like this to prevail in the future.<br />
Your motto, " Quantum potes tantun aude",<br />
sums up this spirit that has pervaded the educational philosophy<br />
at work in the halls of this college for 100 years. I have had<br />
the privilege to meet and work with many old Ignatians and their<br />
attitudes to life and personal qualities have always impressed me,<br />
I work closely with three of them now. Mr David Connolly, the<br />
% Iember for Bradfield; Mr Stephen Lusher, the Member for Hume;<br />
and Mr Peter Johnson, the Member for Brisbane all attended<br />
Riverview and have carried with them into Parliament the ideals<br />
and values that derive from their school days here at Riverview.<br />
They will appreciate more than most, how much the physical<br />
environment has been further improved since thei4r leaving.<br />
In recent years, your facilities, particularly for the senior<br />
secondary students, have been expanded and in 1972, 1 was<br />
fortunate to be present with you to officially open these<br />
extensions.<br />
At the beginning of a new century in the life of Riverview,<br />
this magnificent school complex reminds us that the present<br />
stature of the college has not been achieved without selflessness,<br />
sacrifice and hard work.<br />
In the years since the war., not only has education become accepted as a right<br />
but increasingly the view gained respect and support, that<br />
governments were failing if some people were denied government<br />
support for education merely because they placed importance on<br />
the value of religion in education. And it was a Liberal government<br />
in the 60' s that made the move towards a more responsible<br />
government approach to non-government schools.<br />
The support for independent schools was timely. When I was<br />
Minister for Education, in the early 701s, retention rates in<br />
secondary schools were rising rapidly; costs were increasing;<br />
and as a result, the pressure and burden upon independent schools<br />
threatened the very future of many of them.<br />
This was a critical time for education, for some schools and<br />
f or government. I rer ember well the issue. we f aced. It was simply,<br />
whether we wanted a country of diversity to be served by diversity<br />
of education; whether a right existed for those with particular </p>
<p>-3<br />
religious beliefs to establish their own schools; or whether all<br />
education was to be secular and run by the State. I believed<br />
strongly that freedom, independence and choice in education were<br />
essential. The pressure for governments to abandon their neglect of private.<br />
schools had to be met. I do not doubt that great schools like<br />
Riverview would have survived no matter what the circumstances.<br />
But the parish schools placed increasing burdens upon Australian<br />
families to pay for an education based on their commitment. to a<br />
faith.<br />
We should never lose sight of the enormous sacrifice made down<br />
through the years by those who have believed, often against great<br />
odds, in the value and the very existence of religious education.<br />
And let us dismiss now the fallacy that religious education is<br />
synonymous with wealth; that an endorsement of the values of<br />
religious education is an endorsement of the advantages of wealth.<br />
Many Australian families whose incomes are very low make great<br />
sacrifices, are prepared to pursue difficult courses, because<br />
of their faith and their religous beliefs. A centenary offers<br />
us the opportunity to remember and respect the dedication of<br />
these people; parents, old boys and the community at large, who<br />
have entered in different ways into an active service for the<br />
church. For too long their sacrifices were compounded by injustices<br />
created by the denial of government support. The 60' s saw<br />
the beginning of an active programme to restore equality to the<br />
opportunities for education. From initial assistance in support<br />
of building programmes, to the per capita grants and now through<br />
increased support based on a right to education; governments have.<br />
demonstrated their unyielding commitment to a dual system of<br />
education in Australia.<br />
However, as partof the education explosion of the last two<br />
decades, the resource capacity of government schools has increased<br />
dramatically with the result that the gap between non-government<br />
school resources and the average of that available to government<br />
schools continues to be large.<br />
In fact, the resource targe ts set by the Schools Commission have<br />
been so rapidly achieved by government schools that they now<br />
average out, on a 6 point scale, to the second highest point on<br />
the scale.<br />
Whereas 90 per cent of all primary school students and 56 per cent<br />
of all secondary students in the non-government sector attend<br />
schools which are rated, on their resources, as being at the<br />
bottom of the scale; that is amongst the schools which demonstrably<br />
have the greatest resource needs.<br />
To redress this situation, the Government has continued its<br />
funding programme, firmly committed to the principle of edtication<br />
fairness and justice. To do otherwise would be to expect a<br />
widespread private and especially Catholic school system to be<br />
conducted under trying and inferior circumstances. ./ 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
To allow this to happen would be harmful to the vitality and<br />
potential growth of the entire community. However, some old<br />
resentments still remain, causing problems not only for governments<br />
but also for the education system as a whole.<br />
In 1973, one group took the legitimate but extreme step of<br />
bringing the matter of government aid to non-government schools<br />
before the High Court. The very fact that the case arose has<br />
given concern in some quarters. The Government, like all<br />
litigants, is hopeful of winning, but if that doesn't prove<br />
to be so, we will still remain unshaken in our commitment to<br />
our policies. We believe them to be important for Australia,<br />
Australian education and Australian youth.<br />
We know they are vital for the survival of church schools and<br />
independent schools geeal. We will take whatever steps are<br />
ava~ ilable to us, within the law, which enable our policies<br />
to be pursued. if it is -necessary, we will seek a constitutional amendme~ nt to<br />
enable just*. and proper support to be given to religious and independent institutioi<br />
Equality of oppertunity in education should not be denied in<br />
Australia simply because families place as their highest priority<br />
the determination to preserve their religious faith.<br />
And what happens here at Riverview demonstrates that the<br />
Government's commitment to schools like this, has not been mis-, spent<br />
it is a tribute to you, Father Quin your staff and the whole<br />
school family that the spiritual zeal of the early founders has<br />
brought forth a tradition within the school which finds such<br />
productive expression. of-course, it is the fate of schools arnd<br />
schoolmasters perhaps like Parliaments and politicians, to feel<br />
from time to time that effort is in vain; in the case of education,<br />
that long-term success in the education of our youth is but illusory<br />
An article in the " London Times" in 1858 summed up this educational<br />
dilemma when it said that:<br />
" It was an unresolved problem how public education was<br />
ever effective; how those fierce pasasions are ever tamed;<br />
how the licence of unbridled speech is softened into<br />
courtesy; how lawlessness becomes discipline; how false<br />
morality gives place to a manly sense of right, and all of<br />
this within 2 or 3 years..."<br />
In an obvious reference to the spartan public school life of the<br />
day, the artic le concluded by saying:<br />
" Parents may well abstain from looking too closely at<br />
the process and content themselves with the result."<br />
Today, the process and the result; the means and the end; are<br />
both important in education.<br />
Your enrolments indicate that what goes on at schools like<br />
Riverview is being perceived by the community as providing an<br />
adequate response to the demands of a modern, industrial society<br />
and the new educational realities.<br />
Part of this adequate response involves an active interest in,<br />
and a positive contribution by, parents to the education of their </p>
<p>children. There is a tendency sometimes for parents to transfer<br />
their responsibilities to schools and to teachers. Yet the<br />
family will always be the model for a child's learning, And<br />
issues directly affecting children cannot be resolved satisfactorily<br />
without full and proper consultation with parents.<br />
That is why'involvement by parents in the education process,<br />
which affects what is done inside and outside the classroom,<br />
is crucial to a child's transition from adolescence to adulthood.<br />
I know that Riverview has a long and proud tradition of parental<br />
involvement and support, and your parent-school movement has won<br />
approval in the wider Australian education community. Through<br />
this kind of support a strong relationship develops between<br />
what happens in the home and what happens at school.<br />
And this fosters confidence and security in young people. This<br />
is important when young people face the certainty of change And<br />
a future which will often be challengaing'and demanding.<br />
How much more'important then, it is, that education itself, in<br />
the preparation of young people for the future, offers diversity<br />
and choice. That is why there is an important place for an<br />
educational tradition of the kind that is exemplified here.<br />
For centuries, the Jesuit order has demonstrated a successful<br />
capacity for adapting to changing circumstances by providing<br />
a spiritual and moral base for young people and by demonstrating<br />
an act of concern for the higher development of intellectual<br />
attainment.<br />
Young people today are indeed fortunate to enjoy the values,<br />
opportunities and the discipline, provided by this kind of<br />
education. But they mast also seize these opportunities; not<br />
because someone is trying to make them achieve, but rather<br />
because they themselves want to.<br />
The celebration of 100 years is something which rightly evokes<br />
nostalgia and pride when we reflect with * thanks upon the<br />
achievements of the past. But it also provides a stimulus.<br />
to re-dedicate ourselves to the successes of the next 100 years.<br />
If, in this period, boys of Riverview avail themselves of the<br />
opportunities that lie before them, then they face a future in<br />
which they will be truly free; free for work and leisure, for<br />
being something as well as doing something. I know it is the<br />
hope of us all*, that each St. Ignatius boy will learn to sense<br />
the worth and dignity of others; will feel his debt to others,<br />
and will have commitments commitments to causes and concerns<br />
he ha-s thought about and made his own.<br />
We want him too, because he owes something to the world, to be<br />
prepared for a life of service to something beyond himself.<br />
To hope that these aims are fulfilled is not too much.<br />
To the whole Riverview family, I urge that you value your<br />
educational independence; strive to keep St. Ignatius College<br />
in the vanguard of educational achievement. 9./ 6 </p>
<p>6<br />
I thank Father Quin for his invitation to attend these<br />
celebrations. You have more cause for optimism about your<br />
future, than surely confronted Father Dalton 100 years ago.<br />
May the courage, commitment and vision which has brought<br />
Riverview so far since then, continue to motivate and inform<br />
those who now take up the challenge of the next 100 years. </p>
