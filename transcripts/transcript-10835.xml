    <content><![CDATA[<p>
   Today, in Brisbane, I attended a special service of support for individuals</p>
<p> and families suffering through illicit drug use. I was fortified in</p>
<p> my determination to stem the flow of drugs into the country, educate</p>
<p> our young people, and help those whose lives have been ruined by the</p>
<p> cycle of drug dependency and associated crime.</p>
<p>  At the service I was pleased to announce the membership of the new</p>
<p> Australian National Council on Drugs. I was also pleased to announce</p>
<p> the second instalment of my government's "Tough on Drugs"</p>
<p> strategy worth in excess of $100 million over four years. This is</p>
<p> in addition to the $87.5 million I announced in November</p>
<p> 1997.</p>
<p>  I have appointed Major Brian Watters as Chairman of the Australian</p>
<p> National Council on Drugs. Major Brian Watters has 23 years experience</p>
<p> as a Salvation Army Officer, primarily in the areas of drug and alcohol</p>
<p> addiction. He is well placed to provide advice from the front line</p>
<p> in our fight against drugs. The Deputy Chairman is Commissioner Mick</p>
<p> Palmer of the Australian Federal Police. Commissioner Palmer has 30</p>
<p> years of law enforcement experience, and is highly regarded in international</p>
<p> policing circles.</p>
<p>  The new Council will ensure that the expert voice of non-government</p>
<p> organisations and individuals working in the drug field reaches all</p>
<p> levels of government and influences policy.</p>
<p>  The Council will advise on licit and illicit drugs. Its first priority</p>
<p> will be to advise on the development and implementation of the National</p>
<p> Illicit Drug Strategy, including advice on the allocation of the funds</p>
<p> I announced today and last November.</p>
<p>  The Council has broad representation, including from volunteer and</p>
<p> community organisations, law enforcement, education, health and social</p>
<p> welfare interests. The Council members will bring their expertise</p>
<p> and years of experience and commitment to the national effort to combat</p>
<p> drugs.</p>
<p>  This second instalment of more than $100 million announced today builds</p>
<p> on a balanced and integrated approach to reducing the supply of and</p>
<p> demand for illicit drugs and minimising the harm they cause. This</p>
<p> money targets each step in the drug chain from its importation and</p>
<p> distribution, to its consumption. This includes additional funds to</p>
<p> attack organised crime links with large scale heroin trafficking;</p>
<p> new Australian Federal Police mobile strike teams in Perth, Brisbane</p>
<p> and Melbourne; significantly more money for non-government organisation</p>
<p> drug treatment facilities; and a community education and information</p>
<p> campaign.</p>
<p>  Today I have written to Premiers and Chief Ministers informing them</p>
<p> about the new Council and my Government's second instalment on the</p>
<p> Tough on Drugs strategy. I am looking to my State and Territory colleagues</p>
<p> to throw their weight behind this strategy.</p>
<p>  In 1996 there were 526 heroin related deaths in Australia. Eighty</p>
<p> five percent of those deaths involved people who were not in treatment.</p>
<p> Illicit drugs are associated with over 40,000 hospital bed days each</p>
<p> year in Australia and a national turnover in excess of $7 billion</p>
<p> each year.</p>
<p>  Research shows that more than half, and possibly up to 80% of property</p>
<p> offences have some drug involvement. Between 45% and 60% of convicted</p>
<p> offenders committed property crimes to support drug habits. Some 64%</p>
<p> of offenders admitted using drugs (to give them a lift, or courage)</p>
<p> to commit an offence.</p>
<p>  I am determined to confront this social and economic problem. We need</p>
<p> this moral leadership for our children's sake.</p>
