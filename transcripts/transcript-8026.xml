TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH WARWICK BEUTLER, THE WORLD<br />
TODAY, ABC RADIO, 29 MAY 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
BEUTLER: Prime Minister, you've spoken to Don Grimes,<br />
the Australian Ambassador, this morning. What's the<br />
latest information?<br />
PM: Warwick, there is no new information that I can give<br />
you as a result of speaking to the Ambassador. He<br />
confirmed what, in a sense, we already knew and assured<br />
me that all consular assistance has been and will<br />
continue to be provided in this matter. They assisted in<br />
the return of Stephen Melrose' s wife and the companion of<br />
the late Nick Spanos to London, so I assured him that<br />
that should continue to be done. He also assured me that<br />
the Dutch authorities were vigorously investigating the<br />
tragedies and-<br />
BEUTLER: Do they have any leads?<br />
PM: Not that he was able to convey to me, but I do want<br />
to the take the opportunity, Warwick, on your program of,<br />
of conveying of course my deepest sympathy to the<br />
families of Stephen Melrose and Nick Spanos. I believe<br />
that all Australians will condemn in the, with me, in the<br />
strongest possible terms, the, the absolutely cowardly<br />
murders of these two young innocent Australians. The<br />
bloody campaign by the IRA against innocent people<br />
whether they are British citizens or not is, as far as my<br />
Government is concerned, condemned without qualification<br />
and you have the twisted logic used by an IRA supporter<br />
this morning that mistakes happen in war. Well that<br />
logic cuts no ice with me and my Government or, I<br />
believe, with the Australian people.<br />
BEUTLER: Well, you're obviously referring to Seamus<br />
McGerrigan, the President of the group called the<br />
Connolly Society in Australia, who said on AM this<br />
morning that the deaths were the latest in a series of<br />
tragedies and that Australians should focus on the root<br />
cause of the problem which was the British presence in<br />
Northern Ireland. You simply reject that do you?<br />
PM: I reject the proposition that there is any<br />
justification, excuse or explanation in the tragic death </p>
<p>of these two innocent young Australians to be derived<br />
from that sort of twisted logic. There is nothing that<br />
can be said in justification of what's happened, or<br />
explanation That sort of, that sort of twisted logic<br />
will, as I say, cut no ice with anyone in this country.<br />
BEUTLER: But isn't he right to the extent that the<br />
deaths won't stop until there's a solution to the problem<br />
in Northern Ireland?<br />
PM: Warwick, that depends upon whether the IRA is<br />
determined that it is going at will and according to its<br />
discretion to spray bullets around that are going to kill<br />
innocent people. That's a, a decision which they have to<br />
make. BEUTLER: Well, the IRA has apologised for this attack.<br />
Does that satisfy you?<br />
PM: It's a great comfort, as Stephen Melrose's mother<br />
said this morning, it's too late and in that sense it's<br />
meaningless. BEUTLER: What representations will you make or have you<br />
made already to the British Government and the Irish<br />
Government on this matter?<br />
PM: I haven't made any representations to the British or<br />
the Irish Government. The position of my Government in<br />
regards to the situation in Northern Ireland has been<br />
made consistently clear and, may I say, it's in line with<br />
that of the Irish Government which has, I hear from the<br />
media this morning, has been expressed by the, by the<br />
Minister for the Irish Government, they have condemned,<br />
unqualifiably, what's been done and the only way in which<br />
there's going to be a resolution of the, of the<br />
differences in Northern Ireland is by negotiations and<br />
discussions. That's the view of the Irish Government,<br />
it's the view of my Government and there can be no<br />
0 justification, in any way, for what has happened to these<br />
innocent young Australians. And in fact this sort of<br />
warped logic, this is a, a mistake of war, adds insult to<br />
a mortal injury.<br />
BEUTLER: Mr Hawke, thanks very much.<br />
ends </p>
