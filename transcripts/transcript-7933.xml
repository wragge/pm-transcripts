PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, SIR CHARLES GAIRDNER<br />
HOSPITAL, NEDLANDS, PERTH 1 MARCH 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: exploited one of our sporting heroes,<br />
Allan Border, for your own political gain.<br />
PM: No, that is<br />
( CAMERMAN mikes down please. Ask the question<br />
again) PM: Down a bit? Now, are you people complaining about<br />
the microphones? Now, why, this is a free and democratic<br />
They can put their microphones where they like. Now I<br />
insist on their right to put their microphones where they<br />
like. JOURNALIST: quite right that Allan Border and<br />
the Order of Australia has been used for political<br />
purposes? PM: This is an absolute nonsense, the determination of<br />
who gets the Australia award is with the council of the<br />
Order of Australia. They make the decision as they did<br />
in this case and it was announced by the Governor-<br />

everywhere, the Australian community was overjoyed about<br />
their success, there was going to be a reception for them<br />
in Melbourne. The judgement was made that it would be<br />
appropriate if it were acceptable to the council for the<br />
announcement about the Order to Allan Border to be able<br />
to be done then. So the decision was made by the council<br />
and I would regard it as very surprising if the people of<br />
Australia would think it inappropriate that the captain<br />
of that Ashes winning team should not be given that<br />
Order. JOURNALIST: But the fact that it was you yourself who<br />
nominated Allan Border and that the nomination came<br />
before the statutory time limit of five years from his<br />
previous honour?<br />
PM: The decision as I said is made by the council. You<br />
refer to the nomination, but I can make no decision. The<br />
decision can only be made by the council and it was. I </p>
<p>must say I am amused by this confected indignation that<br />
here was Australia wanting to welcome, as it did with<br />
ticker-tape receptions and the dinner in Melbourne, this<br />
victorious Australian team and its captain and that an<br />
award to him is somehow or another, properly made I might<br />
say by the council, now being regarded as inappropriate.<br />
That surprises me.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think the office of Governor-General<br />
has been a bit sensitive on this one?<br />
PM: The office of the Governor-General? I don't know<br />
what's happened in the office of the Governor-General.<br />
JOURNALIST: Should we go back to the days of the imperial<br />
honours when there was no political involvement?<br />
PM: Well, I think Australians appreciate what Labor has<br />
done and that is to get away from the imperial system,<br />
have Australian honours. And I would think Australians<br />
generally would say that if anyone was entitled last year<br />
to get an honour, it was Allan Border, and that the<br />
Australia Council having made that decision it was<br />
appropriate that he should get it at the time he did.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the size of the balance of<br />
payments? PM: I'm glad we are getting our priorities, with Allan<br />
Border now the balance of payments. Yes?<br />
JOURNALIST: $ 1.9 billion, is larger than, I think,<br />
obviously you'd hoped for. How worrying is it? good<br />
news of last month<br />
PM: I don't think it is worrying. It's within the range<br />
of expectations. It's got, of course, that over $ 300<br />
million of Qantas aeroplanes in it. That would bring it<br />
down to just over one and a half billion. The trends of<br />
imports are down which is the way we want it, the trends<br />
of imports are down. It's very interesting to note that<br />
if you look at manufactured exports in the last three<br />
months compared with the same three months period twelve<br />
months ago, manufactured exports up 50 per cent. And<br />
it's also interesting to note, Peter, that there's been a<br />
significant downward revision of earlier figures which<br />
gives us a reasonable chance of bringing in the figure<br />
for 1989/ 90 at the figure we projected at Budget time.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, aren't imports up on a seasonally<br />
adjusted basis?<br />
PM: The I'm talking about the, that's one month. I'm<br />
talking about the trend in the period. And the trend as<br />
has been indicated and accepted by the market is down. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you think the current account<br />
deficit can be brought back to about two and a half per<br />
cent of GDP in three years?<br />
PM: I think it's conceivable and achievable that at the<br />
end of our next term we will be able to get the external<br />
position into a sustainable level.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, does it mean that interest rates<br />
may have to stay higher than you had previously expected?<br />
PM: No, the figures are consistent with the processes<br />
initiated at the beginning of this year. And I don't<br />
think there is any reason to believe otherwise. The<br />
figures are consistent with the slowing down of activity<br />
and it was that slowing down of activity which was the<br />
necessary underpinning of what was happening in the<br />
easing of monetary policy.<br />
JOURNALIST: the decision of the High Court today<br />
disallowing the stamp allowance, or at least, finding it<br />
invalid in law, an embarrassment for the Government?<br />
PM: No, not an embarrassment. But let me just give the<br />
background and then the immediate comment. The<br />
background, of course, was that we thought it appropriate<br />
that members of Parliament should have the opportunity of<br />
communicating regularly with their constituents and this<br />
was on the basis of allowing them to communicate with<br />
each constituent at least once a year. If you look at the<br />
situation overseas in the United States, other countries,<br />
they have a much larger allowance which is, as I say, on<br />
the basis of allowing a representative in the Parliament<br />
to communicate with his constituent, his or her<br />
constituent. And that was the basis of the decision.<br />
Now, let me say that the decision that we took was made<br />
on the best advice available to us from the Attorney-<br />
General. That's the basis upon which you must make a<br />
decision and we made it on that basis. And I would, I<br />
would believe that it was an appropriate decision, it was<br />
certainly one taken in good faith. Whether people have<br />
used amounts in excess of the $ 9000 in question, then I<br />
don't think there would be a large number that would have<br />
done that. If they have I guess they have probably been<br />
on both sides of politics and that situation would have<br />
to be looked at.<br />
JOURNALIST: They won't pay the money back then, Prime<br />
Minister? PM: We are examining the decision. I mean I won't give<br />
you an off the cuff legal decision on what the<br />
implications of that are. Obviously, the decision will<br />
be examined and the right thing will be done, whatever<br />
the right thing is.<br />
JOURNALIST: If necessary, would the Government pay the<br />
money for them? </p>
<p>PM: Well, I repeat, we will look at the decision. I just<br />
don't know what the implications are for instance of<br />
beyond that mid-November point in regard to which the<br />
High Court made its decision. I don't know the<br />
implications of any expenditures after that period.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the Liberals appear to feel they<br />
are onto a winner with the capital gains tax issue. They<br />
have got an ad going to air tonight with Mr Howard in it,<br />
selling their proposal. Do you think this is a problem<br />
for the Government?<br />
PM: No, I'm very very confident that the capital gains<br />
issue will be a massive vote-loser for the Opposition.<br />
One question is very interesting too, on this, I'll come<br />
to the Howard ad in a moment. One question is very<br />
interesting on this. In 1987 Dr Hewson indicated he was<br />
in favour of a capital gains tax. He said he thought all<br />
forms of income should be taxed at approximately the same<br />
rate. He was in favour in 1987 of capital gains. It<br />
would be very interesting to get an explanation from Dr<br />
Hewson as to why he has changed his position. Now, you<br />
talk about Mr Howard being the one who is going to do the<br />
ads. We note from the media today that the Liberal's<br />
advertising is not going to feature Mr Peacock, they are<br />
going to feature other people. Well, that's fascinating,<br />
but perhaps understandable. I wonder whether when they<br />
get Mr Howard in they might sort of do an advertisement<br />
from him on the quality of the leadership of the Liberal<br />
Party. But, fascinating to read today in the paper that<br />
Mr Howard was asked if he believed Mr Peacock deserved to<br />
be Prime Minister and look at this ringing endorsement<br />
that Mr Howard gave when he was asked whether Mr Peacock<br />
deserved to be Prime Minister and I quote Mr Howard on<br />
that subject: " I want the Liberal Party to win. I<br />
believe we deserve to win. He's the leader and in those<br />
circumstances, yes." What a fascinating thorough-going,<br />
ringing endorsement by Mr Howard of Mr Peacock's<br />
leadership. JOURNALIST: Are you disappointed with the outcome of the<br />
Cambodian peace talks?<br />
PM: Well, one, it would have been too much to expect that<br />
the matter was going to be resolved there. But, I think<br />
what you've seen now is a very, very widespread<br />
endorsement of the Australian plan. It's the basis now<br />
for a resolution of the future but of course, you've got<br />
to get the position where the Khmer Rouge in particular<br />
is going to be amenable to this approach. But everyone, I<br />
mean, the ASEAN countries, and the other countries<br />
outside the region who are involved, the U. S. and France<br />
have been unanimous in praising Australia for our<br />
imagination and our initiative. And I only hope that<br />
work will continue to go on now on the basis of the<br />
Australian plan which can lead to a resolution of that. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Do you think the Chinese stance is a problem?<br />
PM: Well, it is very hard to know exactly at this point<br />
where they are. There is some intelligence which would<br />
suggest that they have been trying to exercise a<br />
restraining influence upon the Khmer Rouge and we hope<br />
that that's the case. But this is something of which you<br />
certainly don't despair and I think all Australians<br />
irrespective of their party affiliations should be proud<br />
of the initiative that Australia has taken. It is the<br />
basis and accepted as the basis for the resolution of<br />
this tragedy.<br />
JOURNALIST: The Opposition is saying millions of<br />
Australians are affected by the capital gains tax through<br />
their superannuation.<br />
PM: Well, yes, some of them are saying it and some<br />
aren't. I mean, Mr Peacock of course gave a whole lot of<br />
figures which were inaccurate. I am just trying to find a<br />
reference to Dr Hewson, here we have it. This was on this<br />
point. Asked about the impact of the capital gains tax on<br />
super funds, Dr Hewson replied " I don't know how big an<br />
effect, we haven't got a year's tax data yet, there are<br />
no data, there is no data on which we can rest our case."<br />
I mean out of Dr Hewson's own mouth, they have no data on<br />
which to rest their allegations, and their allegations<br />
are obviously untrue. If you look at today's press you<br />
have a representative of the superannuation industry<br />
saying that the tax is virtually totally offset by the<br />
processes we have allowed to them in regard to dividend<br />
imputation. JOURNALIST: There was a $ 7 billion increase in foreign<br />
debt in the latest figures released today. Are you<br />
worried about that all?<br />
PM: Well no-one is complacent Niki about foreign debt,<br />
no-one is complacent about it. But we believe that the<br />
fundamental policies are in place now. Let me make these<br />
points. The first of course is as far as the<br />
Commonwealth is concerned, we owe no debt. We are net<br />
international creditors. And remember how that's<br />
happened. The other mob put us into debt as a<br />
Commonwealth Government by their incapacity to run the<br />
business of the government of Australia. We've done it<br />
better, we've turned that deficit into surplus and as a<br />
result we owe no debt. Now the second point to make is<br />
that the debt has been predominantly, almost two thirds,<br />
the private sector. As I've said before, that private<br />
sector debt has to be looked at in terms of the other<br />
side of the coin, that that represents in many instances<br />
investment which is going to constitute a significant<br />
future inflow of foreign income. The third point to make<br />
is that we've got the basic policies in place to turn<br />
around the inflow of imports. The trend is downwards.<br />
We will see in the future I believe a continuation of<br />
that reduction in imports and a growth in our export </p>
<p>capacity. So those are the fundamentals. If you had a<br />
situation where the Government had not taken action to<br />
deal with these issues, yes you would be concerned. But<br />
we're aware of the issue and we've taken the action.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you've criticised Mr Peacock over<br />
doorstops. Is it just a coincidence that the day when we<br />
have the balance of payment and the debt figures you're<br />
having a doorstop and not a press conference?<br />
PM: It certainly is a coincidence. I mean have you got<br />
any further questions you'd like to ask on the balance of<br />
payments? I mean has there been any attempt here to have<br />
other than a full press conference? I'm not quite sure<br />
that the difference between me standing behind a podium<br />
and standing here in these very congenial surroundings is<br />
limiting your capacity to ask me questions.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well on the balance of payments Mr Hawke you<br />
were saying earlier you thought that considerable<br />
progress would be made over your next term if you're reelected.<br />
Can you quantify that in any way? Can you give<br />
any target as to what your goal would be?<br />
PM: You've got to I'm not going to put a precise<br />
figure on it now. But you've got to be in a position<br />
where you've stabilised the debt so that you've shown by<br />
what's happening to the level of imports and by your<br />
export capacity that your level of debt is capable of<br />
being serviced without imposing a growing impost upon the<br />
economy. That sort of figure I believe can be, that sort<br />
of position can be I believe achieved by the end of our<br />
next term in government.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you accept that given that three year<br />
timetable we would at some stage have to go into trade<br />
surplus over the next three years?<br />
PM: I would want to look at the exact figures that would<br />
be involved in that project That is possible.<br />
JOURNALIST: The three year target's a lot more<br />
optimistic than the Government's own EPAC forecast.<br />
PM: They've thought by roughly the middle of the decade.<br />
I think I draw a lot of comfort from the very<br />
significant improvement in our area of manufactured<br />
exports. And I think that that study of the Bureau of<br />
Industry Economics yesterday repays a fair bit of study<br />
because they are saying there, the Bureau of Industry<br />
Economics, is saying that what we have seen in the last<br />
seven years is a very significant restructuring of<br />
Australian industry. I mean this is an independent body<br />
saying that what's happened, the price we've paid if you<br />
like, with restraint, has been something that's<br />
worthwhile. In other words you're seeing an Australian<br />
economy which is now very very competitive. The<br />
proportion of our commodities in our total exports is </p>
<p>declining. I think that gives us very good reason to be<br />
confident that if we keep along this path we're going to<br />
be able to very considerably extend the range of our<br />
manufactured exports and also very importantly the range<br />
of our exports of services which have grown enormously in<br />
this period. I think the figure that I recall is that<br />
where manufactured exports have grown in the last four<br />
years by 54% the figure for the growth in export services<br />
is 69.4%. It's a very very significant increase.<br />
JOURNALIST: So you're saying the outlook has in fact<br />
improved since EPAC last did its forecast?<br />
PM: No, I'm saying that the outlook has improved under<br />
this period of government. I would hope that by the end<br />
of our next term of government that we'd all be saying<br />
that the position is very very much stronger than it was.<br />
It may take another year to reach that point of<br />
0 osnt atailsl titchael obsjteacbtiliivtey . e vidBeuntc et, h e isi mtphoartt anast apno inetc onIo mthyi nwke,<br />
are moving substantially in the right direction. The<br />
trend of imports is down. Most importantly the economy<br />
is being restructured to remove that overwhelming<br />
reliance on commodity exports. I mean that's what leaves<br />
you so open to very big fluctuations in commodity prices.<br />
In our period of government you've seen it. I mean<br />
you've had that loss of $ 11 billion of national income<br />
there in ' 85-86 which had its own set of difficulties.<br />
Then you know what happened in this most recent period<br />
where we had the turnaround improvement in the terms of<br />
trade, the surge of export income coming from the<br />
improvement in commodity prices which imposed those<br />
massive increased demand pressures on us. So what we've<br />
got to be working towards and I believe what the Bureau<br />
of Industry Economics statement of yesterday indicates is<br />
happening, is that the structure is changing. We are not<br />
so reliant upon primary commodities. And we will be able<br />
0 tcoh ancgoenst intuhaet toa red o tatkhiantg asp laac er. e sulIt moefa n thwee afruennd'atm enntowal<br />
getting a greater proportion of manufactured exports,<br />
we' re not now getting a massive increase in the exports<br />
of services through chance. It's happening through a<br />
whole range of basic decisions that this Government has<br />
implemented. JOURNALIST: Do you think that the unexpected rise in the<br />
debt figures today will give an added political edge to<br />
the debt summit starting this evening in Melbourne?<br />
PM: I really hadn't thought much about the debt summit.<br />
JOURNALIST: criticised the changes that you<br />
announced yesterday. Do you still believe that you can<br />
sell them to exporters and what do you think of the way<br />
the press conference ended yesterday?<br />
PM: The situation is obviously one, where you change a<br />
scheme as we have in regard to the Export Market </p>
<p>8<br />
Development Grant Scheme which lifts some thresholds,<br />
some people who operated within lower thresholds in the<br />
past are going to be disappointed. That's so obvious it<br />
hardly needs any elaboration. But I firmly believe that<br />
the net increase in expenditure by the governments<br />
involved in taking the two schemes together, what we're<br />
doing in regard to the Export Market Development Scheme<br />
and with our new scheme, that net increase is better<br />
targeted, it's conceptually more sensible<br />
JOURNALIST: What is the net increase Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: I haven't got the figures in front of me. You know,<br />
you've got them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well we don't actually. There were about<br />
four different figures given yesterday.<br />
PM: I am very good at figures. I haven't got those with<br />
me but the fact is there's a net increase I think of<br />
about $ 16 million in the first year. It's that sort of<br />
figure in the first year. Over the years in question it<br />
involves a net increase in outlays. But you'll always,<br />
in that situation where some people have been able to use<br />
an existing scheme, with lower thresholds and make claims<br />
for some sort of expenditures, if they can't do that now<br />
they're going to be upset. But I think the new scheme<br />
which is I think well conceived and well targeted,<br />
together with a continuation of the Export Market<br />
Development Grant Scheme will be in net terms an<br />
improvement for Australia. As to the second part of your<br />
question I've obviously got no comment. I hadn't<br />
forgotten it Niki.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, in 22 pages of documents, 22 pages<br />
in relation to that announcement yesterday, why was it<br />
not clearly said that there was a cut in that scheme?<br />
PM: The proposition that was put that there was a cut<br />
overall in the press conference wasn't right. The<br />
minister was mistaken about there being a net cut. There<br />
wasn't. JOURNALIST: But why didn't the documents say there was<br />
going to be a cut in the existing scheme?<br />
PM: In the Export Market Development Grant Scheme? I<br />
don't know. I don't draw up every word of these<br />
documents. But it was spelt out if you look at the<br />
document it was spelt out that there was an increase in<br />
the threshold and so on. I don't think that there's any<br />
problem about the general position that we're putting,<br />
and that is that importantly we had a new scheme coming<br />
in which was going to be targeted in a more effective<br />
way. I don't feel any problem about that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Don't you think you ought to relaunch it </p>
