PRIME MINISTER 2 MARCH 1990<br />
THE NATIONAL AGEND) A FOR WOMEN MAINTAINING THE MOMENTUM<br />
I take this opporl: unity to reaffirm my Government's deep<br />
commitment to equitlity of opportunity for women.<br />
Today I announce * i range of initiatives to maintain the<br />
momentum of our hLstoric National Agenda for Women.<br />
The Agenda embodi' 2s my Government's commitment to the goals<br />
of economic securtty and independence, equality of<br />
opportunity and freedom from discrimination for all the<br />
women of Australia: young women, women as they contribute to<br />
Australia's econonic and social development and women with<br />
special needs.<br />
Our commitment to women is founded on the belief that the<br />
nation as a whole can only reach its full potential by<br />
ensuring that women half of the population have A SAY,<br />
A CHOICE AND A FAIER GO.<br />
My Government has demonstrated its commitment to Australian<br />
women and their families by developing policies to give new<br />
opportunities in child care, education, employment,<br />
superannuation, income security, housing, health and aged<br />
care. We are proud of the record. There is much more to be done.<br />
Workers with Family RRponsjbAJltig<br />
Today I announce that we will ratify the International<br />
Labour Organisation Convention on Workers with Family<br />
Responsibilities. Following ratification, Australia will be required to report<br />
regularly to the ILO on its progressive implementation to<br />
improve the conditions for workers with family<br />
responsibilities. 809<br />
A<br />
jak </p>
<p>Important are is f or attention will include parental leave,<br />
more flexible working hours, more work related child care,<br />
career paths for part-time workers and the removal of<br />
discriminator,-. practices against workers with family<br />
responsibilities. To support thu! Convention, we will establish within the<br />
Department of Industrial Relations a Work and Family Unit<br />
with an annua'! budget of S200,000. The Unit will work with<br />
employers, employees and unions to improve attitudes and<br />
practices in : he workplace.<br />
Further, we wll1 introduce a community education program<br />
with funding i~ f $ 100,000 per annum to educate workers,<br />
unions and employers about their respective rights and<br />
responsibilit. ies. That campaign will be co-ordinated by the<br />
Office of the Status of Women.<br />
Women's 1{ ealthj<br />
Women have spitcial health needs. We will continue to<br />
expand, improwe and target services in recognition of those<br />
special needs.<br />
Tragically mo). e than 2,300 Australian women die each year<br />
from breast cincer.<br />
We will estab~ iish a National Program for the Early Detection<br />
of Breast Canc~ er in co-operation and consultation with<br />
States and Teriritories and Anti-Cancer Councils. It will be<br />
phased in over five years. This will be done in line with<br />
the final eva. l. uation report and recommendations due in June<br />
1990 to the Australian Health Minister's Advisory Council.<br />
The Program will provide a comprehensive National Early<br />
Detection Program for those women most at risk those<br />
and over and will include screening, assessment and<br />
counselling to ensure early detection and treatment.<br />
Studies indicite that a high quality early detection and<br />
treatment progjram could lead to a reduction in mortality<br />
rates of about 16% saving around 370 lives per year.<br />
A National Early Detection Program is considered the most<br />
effective approach to reducing not only the mortality but<br />
also the personal anguish associated with breast cancer. An<br />
alternative would have been to allow Medicare benefits to<br />
women wanting mammograms without prior diagnosis. Expert<br />
medical and scientific advice, however, is that this would<br />
not ensure a high quality service targeted at those most at<br />
risk. Medicai. e benefits will remain available for<br />
diagnostic mammograms.<br />
We have allocated $ 64 million over the first three years of<br />
the program. The Australian Government will fully fund the<br />
$ 14 million additional cost of the program in year one and<br />
will contribute $ 20 million towards the program in year two<br />
and $ 30 million in year three.<br />
I </p>
<p>DnmeninVilec My Government recogniises its responsibility to encourage<br />
changes in community attitudes which still condone or ignore<br />
domestic violence. To follow on from the current 3 year<br />
National Domestic Violence Education Program I shall<br />
establish a high level Commonwealth/ State Committee on<br />
Violence Against Womien with funding of $ 1.35 million over 3<br />
years. The Committrie will continue the work of changing<br />
community attitudes and take on a policy development,<br />
education, research and co-ordination role as well.<br />
New Ministerial Fnriuu<br />
I propose to establish a new forum to provide formal<br />
ministerial consult; tion on women's issues. This will be<br />
achieved by a twice yearly meeting of a Commonwealth-State<br />
Ministerial Forum ozi the status of women. It will enable<br />
better sharing of iniformation, and co-ordination of<br />
policies, especially on those issues which cross<br />
State/ Commonwealth 1, Territory boundaries.<br />
Additional Fuinding ' oar Women's Projects<br />
I will increase the annual funding for the National Agenda<br />
for Women Grants Program to $ 500,000 an increase of<br />
$ 200,000. Operationzal grants made under the Program<br />
recognise the important role of national women's<br />
I organisations in enhancing the status of women. Project<br />
grants are made to community organisations to undertake<br />
activities which address the action plans in the National<br />
Agenda for Women.<br />
Additional annual fiinding of S50,000 will be provided to the<br />
Office of the Status of Women for administrative support of<br />
the ministerial forum and the Grants Program.<br />
Women Of Non-Englist Sneaking Rarkgrotin<br />
In January 1990 the Minister for Immigration, Local<br />
Government and Ethnic Affairs announced the first of a<br />
series of grants under the Migrant Access Projects Scheme<br />
( MAPS). Many of these will benefit women.<br />
As part of the seconzd round of MAPS I am pleased to announce<br />
grants for three projects targeting women from Non-English<br />
Speaking Background ( NESB) under this existing program:<br />
$ 100,000 over two years for Fairfield Council to assist<br />
newly arrived NESB women to gain better access to<br />
mainstream child care services; r58.1.1 </p>
<p>4.<br />
$ 100,00,) over two years for the Adult Migrant Education<br />
Service of NSW to develop strategies to deliver<br />
service,; to clothing industry outworkers in<br />
particuLar, English language courses containing<br />
informa'ion on occupational health and safety and<br />
employm'int and training services;<br />
$ 50,000 for the Centre Against Sexual Assault,<br />
Melbour~ ie, to assist newly arrived NESB women gain<br />
greater access to family intervention services by<br />
developing information training material for migrant<br />
service-; and setting up a network of professionals.<br />
To further f. icilitate improving the position of NESB women<br />
an additionaL $ 36,000 over two years ($ 9,000 year one,<br />
$ 27,000 ye: tr two) has been allocated to the<br />
Commonwealth/ State Council on Non-English Speaking<br />
Background Wo. men's Issues.<br />
This supplem,. nts my announcement in July 1989 of $ 100,000 pa<br />
for two year:; for the Council provided through the National<br />
Agenda for a Multicultural Australia.<br />
Aboriginal Aid Torres Strait Islander. WosDen<br />
Aboriginal W,) men play a very important leadership role in<br />
their commun.. ties. Lois O'Donoghue's appointment as head of<br />
the Aborigin-il and Torres Strait Islander Commission<br />
exemplifies this.<br />
My Government: will introduce the National Aboriginal and<br />
Torres Strail: Islander Family Support Program.<br />
The program iill have two components:<br />
a grant:; program for family support projects with an<br />
emphasi:; on family violence; and<br />
production and distribution of resource materials.<br />
The Family Support program will be the focus of the<br />
Department of Aboriginal Affairs Women's Initiatives Program<br />
over the next two years at a cost of S700,000 pa.<br />
Young Women<br />
We have helped ensure that two out of every three students<br />
complete year 12 compared to only one out of three in 1982.<br />
However, gir) s' subject choices and experiences in some<br />
subjects can leave them less well equipped than boys to<br />
compete fully in the labour market.<br />
We will fund one of the most extensive reforms of schools<br />
curricula in Australia. In close co-operation with State<br />
and Territory Education Ministers, we will provide $ 3<br />
million over three years to make curricula in our schools<br />
equally relevant to girls and boys. </p>
<p>rnne-11uin<br />
My Government has developed and implemented comprehensive<br />
initiatives for Australian women and their families. They<br />
fit together in a strategy of practical, commonsense reform.<br />
I repeat my personal commitment and the commitment of my<br />
Government to genuine equality of opportunity for women.<br />
Our vision is for an Australia in which women can live their<br />
lives free of the fear of violence, free of discrimination:<br />
an Australia which has removed all those economic and social<br />
barriers which deny the women of Australia the fullest<br />
possible opportunity for choice in their lives and careers. </p>

<p>THE NATIONAL AGENlrt FOR WOMEN MAINTAINING THE MOMENTUM<br />
DETAILED STATEMENT 2 MARCH 1990<br />
This Statement enebles me to reaffirm my personal commitment<br />
that equality of opportunity for women is vital for every<br />
one of us: men, women and children, both as members of<br />
families and individuals.<br />
After coming into Government in 1983 we undertook an active<br />
domestic and intei national role in reviewing policies to<br />
raise the status of women. In February 1988 I launched our<br />
plan of action foi advancing the status of women towards the<br />
year 2000 the Nrtional Agenda for Women. This was the<br />
result of more than 2 years of consultation with some 25,000<br />
women around Australia.<br />
The National Agend! a for Women has set in place a<br />
comprehensive ranaie of policies which aim to give women the<br />
opportunity to coittribute to the future development of our<br />
nation. My Government is c: ommitted to ensuring that its policies and<br />
programs enable w( omen to live with economic security and<br />
independence, fre-idom from discrimination and equality of<br />
opportunity in al. spheres of activity. We are ensuring<br />
that women's need; are taken fully into account in the<br />
development and atministration of Government policies and<br />
programs. Women miust have a say, a choice and a fair go and<br />
they must have th,! se things regardless of their cultures,<br />
language, age or family circumstances.<br />
Australia was the first country in the world to develop a<br />
comprehensive policy document for improving the status of<br />
women. The Natioqal Agenda for Women, and more importantly<br />
the progress that has been made in realising its objectives,<br />
are regarded as a model for the rest of the world.<br />
The Hawke Governmeont has demonstrated its commitment to<br />
Australian women and their families by developing policies<br />
to give new opportunities in child care, housing, health and<br />
aged care. our record is second to none. Some of our<br />
important achievements to date include:<br />
a more than doubling of the number of child care places<br />
from 46,000 in 1983 to 114,000 in December 1989. By<br />
the end of the National Child Care Strategy in 1992 we<br />
will have more than trebled the number of places;<br />
creation of 1.6 million jobs since April 1983, 57% of<br />
which have gone to women. The proportion of women in<br />
the labour force is now over 50% for the first time in<br />
Australia's history; 5r815 </p>
<p>2.<br />
completioni of a full secondary education by girls has<br />
increased rapidly two out of every three girls now<br />
complete year 12;<br />
the introduction of a long term retirement incomes<br />
strategy (: overing increased pensions and improved<br />
access to superannuation;<br />
the histo;-ic restructuring of family payments through<br />
which we will spend $ 3.5 billion this financial year<br />
directly |, enefiting over 3.59 million children through<br />
Family Allowances and, through the Family Allowance<br />
Supplemen:, providing on average $ 50 tax free a week to<br />
over 500,000 families with 1.2 million children;<br />
the introduction of the Jobs, Education and Training<br />
( JET) pro( Iram specifically to assist sole parents gain<br />
employment and education more than 52% of sole<br />
mothers ave now working, up from 38% in 1983;<br />
funding for housing for the most disadvantaged has<br />
dramaticaily increased, including a trebling of rent<br />
assistanc( t;<br />
a $ 43 mil ion Commonwealth/ State program to implement<br />
the Nation-al Women's Health Strategy;<br />
our aged care strategy meets the concerns of elderly<br />
women thrc ugh emphasis on home and community care<br />
services much more suited to their circumstances.<br />
Last week the Treasurer announced a range of further<br />
substantial futdamental reforms covering taxation, social<br />
security, industrial relations, superannuation and labour<br />
market programE,.<br />
These initiati~ es build on our outstanding economic and<br />
social justice record. The Treasurer's announcement of<br />
superannuation changes will significantly assist women whose<br />
previous low membership of schemes has contributed to their<br />
dependence on Ihe age pension. Award based superannuation<br />
is an essentia] method of providing superannuation to the<br />
majority of women.<br />
These and othez reforms undertaken through award<br />
restructuring, occupational health and safety, equal<br />
employment and anti-discrimination legislation have<br />
fundamentally changed the nature of women's participation<br />
in, and contribution to, Australia's development.<br />
We intend to improve on these achievements with initiatives<br />
designed to build on our employment and health strategies.<br />

Workers with Family Res . ibIities<br />
I am pleased to ann,, unce that we will ratify the<br />
International Labou. Organisation Convention on Workers and<br />
Family Responsibili: ies ( see Attachment The aim of the<br />
Convention is to co-imit Governments to making it a<br />
fundamental objecti-' e of policy to enable workers with<br />
family responsibili ies who are employed or who wish to be<br />
employed to do so w thout discrimination.<br />
All States and Terr. tories are finalising their positions on<br />
joining with the Coiinonwealth in ratifying the Convention.<br />
Western Australia, " ictoria, South Australia and Tasmania<br />
have formally agreed. I should note here that Western<br />
Australia was the f!. rst State by 5 years to agree to<br />
ratification.<br />
Many workers have ftmily responsibilities, but since women<br />
have mainly carried those responsibilities, their rapidly<br />
increasing workforc.! participation has moved the issue onto<br />
the labour reform a-lenda for all workers.<br />
Close to 50% of all married women are in the workforce, and<br />
the most significan: growth area in the labour market is<br />
women re-entering aFter having children. Of women in paid<br />
work 49% have depen. lent children. Many others have<br />
responsibility for , geing family members.<br />
The majority of emp'oyees men and women are balancing<br />
their work commitmeits with family responsibilities. The<br />
efficiency of these workers is dependent on new workplace<br />
arrangements and at': itudes which recognise their family<br />
responsibilities.<br />
We believe that suci arrangements and attitudes will reduce<br />
absenteeism and turiover and related costs. Even more<br />
importantly, improv ng the relationship between workers and<br />
the workplace incre. ises incentives for skills acquisition.<br />
ILO 156 is a Convention that calls for staged<br />
implementation, and regular reports of progress towards its<br />
objectives. This mians that by ratifying the Convention,<br />
Australia commits itself to a program of work in support of<br />
workers with family responsibilities.<br />
This Government has already started that work. We have<br />
undertaken legislative reform to address discrimination<br />
against women, discrimination which is often grounded on<br />
family responsibilities.<br />
At present in the public sector, paid maternity leave is<br />
available at the Conmonwealth level and in several States<br />
and Territories. Women in the other States have access to<br />
unpaid maternity leave if they are permanent employees.<br />
Women in the privat: u sector achieved the right to unpaid<br />
maternity leave folLowing a test case successfully mounted<br />
by the Australian Council of Trade Unions ( ACTU) in 1979. [ 7 </p>
<p>The existence of leave for fathers, so that they can share<br />
equally in the ca-re of children, is seen as the next major<br />
step toward improving women's employment opportunities. The<br />
Commonwealth and most State governments are supporting a<br />
parental leave test case currently being mounted by the<br />
ACTU. The case would extend parental leave to the private<br />
sector, and is being heard before a full bench of the<br />
Industrial Relations Commission.<br />
Other measures to assist workers with family<br />
responsibilities include the availability of permanent<br />
part-time work i'i the public sector so that workers can<br />
change to a part -time basis ( with the agreement of their<br />
employers) when !. heir family responsibilities are heaviest,<br />
without losing tVie benefits of permanent employment<br />
( including super innuation). This was pioneered in South<br />
Australia and wa; introduced by the Commonwealth as part of<br />
public service r'bforms in the mid-1980s. Flexible working<br />
hours in the pub . ic sector has been another reform of<br />
benefit to worke s with family responsibilities.<br />
We have also und : rtaken a massive expansion in the<br />
Children's Servi*: es Program.<br />
We have establis and the Jobs, Education and Training Program<br />
for sole parents<br />
But ratification means far more than a series of individual<br />
initiatives, how' ! ver important each of those initiatives may<br />
be on its own.<br />
By ratifying ILO 156 we have put workers with family<br />
responsibilities on the national agenda. We have recognised<br />
in a formal and public way that the long tern interests of<br />
families, worker:; and employers are dependent on improving<br />
the link between workers and workplace.<br />
To support the ra~ tification of the Convention, we will<br />
establish within the Department of Industrial Relations a<br />
Work and Family U'nit with an annual budget of $ 200,000 to<br />
work with employexrs, employees and unions to continue the<br />
process of makinr the necessary shift in attitudes and<br />
practices in the workplace.<br />
We will introduce a community education program with funding<br />
of $ 100,000 per vnnum tos educate workers, unions and<br />
employers about iheir respective rights and<br />
responsibilities. That campaign will be co-ordinated by the<br />
Office of the Stztus of Women.<br />
These measures will identify important next steps necessary<br />
for Australia to meet the commitments laid down in ILO 156.<br />
Further, the National Women's Consultative Council's ILO 156<br />
Conference in Melbourne today is bringing together key women<br />
to discuss the Ccnvention in the Australian context.<br />
i 18 </p>
<p>yWpmon'n Health<br />
Without good health for themselves and their families,<br />
women'sa choices and opportunities are limited. In working<br />
towards enabling Auv; tralian women to have real equality of<br />
opportunity, my Govornment recognises the importance of<br />
enhancing their overall wellbeing.<br />
By establishing and protecting Medicare we are providing the<br />
foundation for ensuring that all Australians have equal<br />
access to good quality health care.<br />
Undeniably, women have special health needs. Women are the<br />
major users of medical and hospital services.*<br />
In 1985 the 700 womon attending the second national<br />
conference on " Womeii's Health in a Changing Society"<br />
resolved that a national women's health policy should be<br />
developed. In November of that year when I announced the<br />
development of the lational Agenda, it included a commitment<br />
to a National Women's Health Policy.<br />
Extensive consultation followed. Australian women<br />
identified the need for a more preventative and holistic<br />
approach to health zis well as a range of specific issues<br />
including the health needs of women as carers, access to<br />
family planning services and alternative arrangements for<br />
childbirth. The policy was endorsed by the Commonwealth and<br />
State Health Ministers in 1989.<br />
The National Women's: Health Program, with funding of $ 43<br />
million, includes a four-year cost-sharing arrangement with<br />
State governments to increase the number of women's<br />
community health centres; to improve education for health<br />
consumers and to improve professional information, education<br />
and training on women's health.<br />
The Commonwealth government is providing financial<br />
incentives to State and Territory governments to reorganise<br />
birthing services and to provide alternatives to specialist<br />
dominated hospital birthing services. States will be<br />
encouraged to provide a range of options, including<br />
midwife-assisted home-birth.<br />
Substantial funding is now provided by the Commonwealth<br />
government to non-government family planning services rum by<br />
the Family Planning Association in all States and<br />
Territories and to the Catholic Social Welfare Commission<br />
for the Natural Family Planning Program. There is a special<br />
emphasis on reaching disadvantaged groups, and for example,<br />
in 1988 funding was approved to survey the family planning<br />
needs of recently arrived Lebanese, Turkish and Vietnamese<br />
women. </p>
<p>Breast cancer is a disease which is killing more than 2,300<br />
women each year. 1; tudies indicate that a high quality early<br />
detection and trea;-ment program could lead to a reduction in<br />
mortality rates of about 16% saving around 370 lives per<br />
year. I am pleased there ( ore ta announce that we intend to<br />
establish a Nationil Program for the Early Detection of<br />
Breast Cancer in co-operation and consultation with States<br />
and Territories. Et will be phased in over five years in<br />
line with the final evaluation report and recommendations<br />
due in June 1990 t3 the Australian Health Minister's<br />
Advisory Council Breast Cancer Screening Evaluation Steering<br />
Committee. Our decision to pioceed with a National Early Detection<br />
Program follows piloting and evaluation over the past three<br />
years of various approaches. The recent preliminary<br />
evaluation report from the Australian Institute of Health<br />
based on the pilol projects has recommended that a national<br />
approach be adopted.<br />
The preliminary rF-port confirms trials which have been<br />
conducted oversea.-and which have led to the introduction of<br />
similar programs in countries such as Britain, France,<br />
Finland, Holland z-nd Sweden.<br />
This initiative will provide for a comprehensive National<br />
Early Detection Piogram for those women most at risk those<br />
aged 40 and over -and will include screening, assessment<br />
and counselling enable early treatment.<br />
The exact scope ol the program and its operational details<br />
will be finalised in consultation with the States and<br />
Territories after receipt of the final evaluation report in<br />
June. We expect that thie current infrastructure related to the<br />
pilot projects wi* l form the basis of the national program.<br />
We have allocated S64 million over the first three years of<br />
the program. The Australian Government will fully fund the<br />
$ 14 million addit:. onal cost of the program in year one and<br />
will contribute V2O million towards the program in year two<br />
and $ 30 million in~ year three. It is intended that the<br />
program will be 50: 50 cost shared with the States after the<br />
first year.<br />
It will also include the Rural Breast Cancer Screening<br />
Program announced last December. Under that initiative the<br />
Commonwealth will provide $ 2.8 million this year to States<br />
for the purchase of mobile units.<br />

A National Early Detection Program is considered the most<br />
effective approach to reducing not only the mortality but<br />
also the personal anguish associated with breast cancer. An<br />
alternative would have been to allow Medicare benefits to<br />
women wanting mamnograms without prior diagnosis. Expert<br />
medical and scientific advice, however, is that this would<br />
not ensure a high quality service targeted at those most at<br />
risk. Medicare be3nef its will remain available for<br />
diagnostic mammog rams.<br />
nnmntin_ Vlnne~<br />
Intrinsically linked with women's overall wellbeing and<br />
their ability to 1: ake advantage of choices and<br />
opportunities, is their physical safety on a day to day<br />
basis, enabling them to live without violence in their<br />
homes. Our three-year Nal: ional Domestic Violence Education Program<br />
which will be completed this year, has made significant<br />
progress in breaking the silence on this all too often<br />
hidden problem. Through the Supported Accommodation<br />
Assistance Prograw we will provide in 1989-90 $ 23.6 million<br />
for 310 refuges anid other services for women and their<br />
children escaping domestic violence.<br />
We recognise, howcver, that these achievements must be<br />
backed up now witli high level co-ordination and consultation<br />
and a program of community education to change attitudes and<br />
behaviour. The research undertaken in the first two years of the<br />
Program demonstrated that almost 50% of Australians know<br />
someone involved In domestic violence; one in five condone<br />
the use of physical force by a man against his female<br />
partner in some circumstances: one in three regard domestic<br />
violence as a private matter. These are appalling<br />
statistics. The Education Program has been very successful in developing<br />
community awareness of domestic violence and has begun the<br />
slow process of achieving attitude and behavioural change.<br />
It has demonstrated both the need for community education<br />
and the potential of a strategy of this kind.<br />
The Program has also underlined the need for a high-level<br />
Committee to address Commonwealth-State issues such as lack<br />
of similarity of legislative measures and police practice.<br />
I am pleased to announce that we will provide funding of<br />
S1.35 million over three years to fund a Commonwealth/ State<br />
Committee on Violence Against Women and further community<br />
education and research.<br />
The Commonwealth-State Committee on Violence Against Women<br />
will: </p>
<p>enable State, Territory and Federal Governments to<br />
share expertise and policy responses on violence<br />
against women<br />
assist the co-ordination and development of policy,<br />
programs and legislation on a national basis<br />
guide and commission research required for effective<br />
policy mahing and to further community awareness<br />
co-ordinate further community education on a national<br />
scale.<br />
This initiative forms part of the National Agenda for Women,<br />
responding to 1he high level of concern over domestic<br />
violence revealed in the national consultations on the<br />
Agenda. New Ministpria Forum<br />
The development of my Government's initiatives on domestic<br />
violence, and indeed on policies which affect women<br />
generally, has been founded on broad-based consultation with<br />
women in the co'mmunity. The National Women's Consultative<br />
Council is our principal mechanism for community<br />
consultation. Australia remains in the forefront internationally in regard<br />
to the govern( nt machinery established to ensure that<br />
status of womeni issues are given full consideration.<br />
We will establish a new forum for formal ministerial<br />
consultation, a twice yearly meeting of a Commonwealth-State<br />
Ministerial Forum on the status of women. It will allow<br />
better sharing of information and co-ordination of policies<br />
especially on t: hose issues which cross State/ Commonwealth<br />
and Territory boundaries.<br />
Such a forum will1 help to fulfil the commitment we set<br />
ourselves under the National Agenda for Women to ensure that<br />
women's needs .' re taken fully into account in the<br />
development and administration of Government policies and<br />
programs. Additional Funding for Women's Proiects<br />
we will also increase the annual funding for the National<br />
Agenda for Wometn Grants Program to S500,000 from the current<br />
level of S300,000. Operational grants made under the<br />
Program recognise the important role of national women's<br />
organisations: project grants are made to community<br />
organisations to undertake activities which address action<br />
plans in the National Agenda.<br />
The Grants Program has proved very successful in funding a<br />
wide range of projects which address the social and economic<br />
position of women. For this year's funding of $ 300,000 over<br />
500 applications have been received.<br />

Additional annual. funding of $ 50,000 will be provided to the<br />
Office of the St; ttus of Women for the administrative support<br />
necessary for th! Ministerial Forum and the Grants Program.<br />
Women from Non-E. glish Speaking Background ( NES)<br />
Representing the interests and needs of Australian women<br />
means recognisinij and acknowledging the special needs of<br />
particular group::.<br />
The National Ageiida for Women recognises the major<br />
contribution mado by women of NESB to society and the<br />
barriers they face to full participation. One of its main<br />
objectives is to promote an environment in which women of<br />
non-English speaking background can enjoy the same status in<br />
Australian society as other Australian women, including an<br />
equal share in oummunity resources and equal access to<br />
programs and services. Areas identified already to achieve<br />
this include con:; ultation, English language learning, and<br />
recognition of overseas qualifications.<br />
Towards this end major initiatives to be funded at a total<br />
cost of $ 58 mill . on over the next 3 years and up to<br />
million in total under the national Agenda for a<br />
Multicultural Au', tralia were launched by me on 26 July 1989.<br />
Key Multicultura! Agenda initiatives of special relevance to<br />
women included:<br />
increased aonual funding of the Adult Migrant Education<br />
Program ( AMEP) geared to the needs of recently arrived<br />
migrant women particularly those seeking work. The<br />
additional resources cover initiatives such as<br />
improvements to the English by correspondence course,<br />
enhancement of the English in the Workplace Program,<br />
and increased child care.<br />
developing Cor SBS television an English at Work series<br />
and expansion of SBS to eight additional centres.<br />
developing new arrangements for recognising overseas<br />
qualifications, including the expansion of bridging<br />
courses. developing iippropriate systems to monitor the<br />
appointment of women, Aboriginal and NESB Australians<br />
and people with disabilities to statutory and other<br />
bodies.<br />
In January 1990 the Minister for Immigration, Local<br />
Government and Ethnic Affairs announced the first of a<br />
series of grants under the Migrant Access Projects Scheme<br />
( MAPS). The objective of MAPS is to meet the priority needs<br />
of migrants, especially recent arrivals and to help them<br />
move from migrant specific services to those generally<br />
available in the community. Women are a priority group for<br />
MAPS. 8 2 3<br />
j </p>
<p>As part of the second round of MAPS I am pleased to announce<br />
under this existing program funding for three MAPS projects<br />
targeting NESS women:<br />
$ 100,000 over two years for Fairfield Council to assist<br />
newly arrived NESB women to gain batter access to<br />
mainstream child care services;<br />
$ 100,000 over two years for the Adult Migrant Education<br />
Services of NSW to develop strategies to deliver<br />
services to clothing industry outworkers: in<br />
particular, English language courses containing<br />
information on occupational health and safety and<br />
employment and training services;<br />
$ 50S, 000 Eor the Centre Against Sexual Assault,<br />
Melbourne, to assist newly arrived NESS women gain<br />
greater access to family intervention services.<br />
To improve further the status of NESE women an additional<br />
$ 36,000 over two years has been allocated to the<br />
Commonwealth/ 3tate Council on Non-English Speaking<br />
Background Womuen's issues.<br />
Abori4ginal and Torresq Stirait T-alander Women<br />
The National Agenda for Women set down as key objectives the<br />
need to addre's further the disadvantages faced by<br />
Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. Both documents pay<br />
particular attention to the needs and cultural traditions of<br />
women, and thq provision of equal access to all Government,<br />
programs as well as special programs. Aboriginal women<br />
identified thair major areas of concern as: health and<br />
housing; excessive alcohol consumption and the linkage with<br />
domestic violeince and disruption of traditional community<br />
life; more effective consultation and participation in<br />
decision-making; and the need for culturally appropriate<br />
information about government services and programs.<br />
My Government will introduce the $ 700,000 National<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Family Support<br />
Program, whichi will have two components:<br />
grants program for family support projects with an<br />
emphasis on family violence projects;<br />
production and distribution of resource materials.<br />
It has become apparent, from consultations with Aboriginal<br />
and Torres Strait Islander women, independently of and also<br />
in conjunction with the National Domestic Violence Education<br />
program, that family violence in Aboriginal Australia is a<br />
serious concern. </p>
<p>11.<br />
The Commonwealth will allocate $ 700,000 from ongoing funds<br />
for each financial year 1990-92 through the Department of<br />
Aboriginal Affairs ( DAA). The Family Support program will<br />
be the focus of DAA's Women's Initiative Program over the<br />
next two years.<br />
Young Wnmpn<br />
Another special concern for my Government is the needs of<br />
young women.<br />
These women perhaps stand to gain the most from the<br />
environment of equality of opportunity, choice and<br />
opportunity we are creating.<br />
Young women in this country now have the right to expect<br />
equality of opportunity.<br />
We have identified their special needs in education through<br />
the National Policy for Girls in Schools which outlines<br />
goals for the Commonwealth, States and independent systems.<br />
We will provide, in close co-operation with State and<br />
Territory Education ministers, S3 million over three years<br />
to make curricula in our schools equally relevant to girls<br />
and boys.<br />
We have helped ensure that two out of every three students<br />
complete year 12 compared to only one out of three in 1982.<br />
At the same time, however, there have remained some<br />
significant differences affecting whether girls can take<br />
full advantage of longer schooling. Their subject choices<br />
and their experience in some subjects have left them less<br />
well equipped to compete fully in the labour market.<br />
During 1989 and 1990, under the banner of the National<br />
Policy for Girls in Schools, the Commonwealth and the States<br />
have been campaigning to get girls to enrol in maths and<br />
science. There have been some remarkable successes. Victoria, for<br />
example, has seen significantly increased interest in maths<br />
after a successful media campaign.<br />
The Girls in Maths and Science Project initiated by my<br />
Government in 1987 has been focusing on developing materials<br />
to support schools in their efforts to improve the<br />
participation of girls in mathematics and science.<br />
It is now time to tackle the second half of the problem<br />
why girls sometimes do less well or find subjects<br />
irrelevant.<br />
One of the fundamental explanations is that curricula in<br />
these subjects, for historical reasons, has tended to<br />
reflect the concerns-and interests of males. r, 82-</p>
<p>Equally there are many subjects which attract few boys or in<br />
which they tend to do less well. Historically these have<br />
tended to reflect the world of girls.<br />
We want our school subjects taught in ways which recognise<br />
that there exists a wide range of different interests and<br />
that a broader choice of options and presentation will allow<br />
these interests to be pursued by larger numbers of students.<br />
Many curricula are still in need of reform appropriate for a<br />
nation embarking on the last decade of the twentieth<br />
century. Without such reform we will continue to waste the<br />
talents of our young and fail to provide for a more equal<br />
society. In working closely with State and Territory Governments on<br />
this projnct it will be our aim to ensure that from now on<br />
gender is irrelevant to how girls and boys choose subjects<br />
and how well they are able to achieve in them.<br />
