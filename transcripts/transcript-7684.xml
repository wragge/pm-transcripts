TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH JOHN HAMILTON, ABC RADIO, PERTH<br />
16 JULY 1989<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
HAMILTON: Today on Hamilton's People my guest is Prime<br />
Minister Bob Hawke. Welcome to the program Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Thank you John.<br />
HAMILTON: You've been Prime Minister now for over six<br />
years, you've won three elections. How do you keep up your<br />
enthusiasm? What makes Hawkey run?<br />
PM: It's a very complex question. No-one, I think, is<br />
capable of analysing themselves completely. But elements<br />
are, one, I made a very brilliant decision as soon as I<br />
could in my life. I got born to parents with strong<br />
constitutions and I seem to have inherited that. I have the<br />
capacity to keep going fairly easily. Secondly, I eat well,<br />
I keep fit. For that I thank Hazel very substantially.<br />
She's got me onto the health kick. I exercise. So<br />
physically and constitutionally I'm very very fortunate.<br />
But then in terms of what drives me and enables me to keep<br />
going, I've just, from a very early age, when I started to<br />
hear really my political consciousness in Perth, I've had a<br />
commitment to trying to make a better Australia, a different<br />
Australia. Some people say doesn't the edge go off after<br />
six years? In a sense the opposite is true. Because you're<br />
able to see the results of many things that were just ideas<br />
before and that's very stimulating.<br />
HAMILTON: Have you changed yourself do you think? Have you<br />
become a more patient person, a more tolerant person?<br />
PM: I think so, yes I think I have. At times you get a bit<br />
frustrated that there are so many road blocks in mind and in<br />
practical affairs. But I think you learn as you go on that<br />
you've got to be accommodating and find your way through<br />
these things rather than a tendency I might have had earlier<br />
in my life to do a bit more and to crash through.<br />
HAMILTON: Let's turn to the domestic scene. What do you<br />
think about the recent public opinion poll which says for<br />
the first time that more Australians were pessimistic about<br />
the country's future than optimistic. In other words really<br />
I think what we're saying is when will we see a change, a<br />
light at the end of the economic tunnel as it were? </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM: I'm not surprised. It tends to be the case that if we<br />
get into a situation, and particularly where we've got very<br />
high interest rates at the moment which are necessary, that<br />
people get depressed. I'm not surprised by that. As to<br />
that part of your question John which talks about the light,<br />
you've got to remember there's a hell of light there now.<br />
You look at the employment figures that have just come out<br />
in this last week. We've created one and a half million new<br />
jobs. We've got a situation in Australia now where people<br />
who want jobs can get them. We've got the unemployment rate<br />
down to six per cent. If you had the same participation<br />
rate now as when we came to office the unemployment rate<br />
would be about two per cent. So that's a hell of a lot of<br />
light. We've created jobs twice as fast as the rest of the<br />
world. Inflation is down from the double digit figures that<br />
we had before and will come down further after this blitz<br />
that will be associated with the increased food prices from<br />
the floods. But certainly it is that some people are<br />
hurting because of the high interest rates. Now that hurts<br />
me, but it's necessary. If we didn't have the high interest<br />
rates now it would be very very much worse for very very<br />
many more people. But in that climate, sure, people express<br />
a certain amount of pessimism. I believe those interest<br />
rates are going to come down but not a day before it is<br />
economically responsible to bring them down.<br />
HAMILTON: Prime Minister Thatcher had a famous response<br />
that there is no alternative. Is that really your response<br />
too to the present situation?<br />
PM: I'm saying there is no economically responsible<br />
alternative. The opposition floats around, makes noises,<br />
but in the end can't promise anything constructively<br />
different. You've got three arms of policy. You've got<br />
your fiscal policy, that's tight. We've reduced the<br />
deficit, created surplus significant. You've got a<br />
tight as possible wages policy. That leaves your monetary<br />
policy. You've got to keep that tight for some time. But<br />
we do that in a way which is going to keep the economy going<br />
but at a less high level of activity because we can't pay<br />
for the level of imports that that measure of activity<br />
brings. HAMILTON: It's just a hard-selling job though isn't it?<br />
PM: Yes you're right John. People don't like tough times,<br />
they don't like to scrape. You've got the job and I've got<br />
the job, Paul Keating and others have got the job to explain<br />
that there is no alternative in these circumstances. unless<br />
you want to be totally irresponsible and say alright we'll<br />
ease off monetary policy. What would happen then? The<br />
international money markets would do the job for you. The<br />
dollar would dive, interest rates would go through the roof<br />
and you'd have a massive recession. No-one wants that<br />
alternative. </p>
<p>HAMILTON: So what's your message of hope for the people who<br />
are really hurting out there. The people out in the<br />
northern suburbs here are really hurting at the moment.<br />
PM: Yes, there are people with high interest rates. My<br />
message is this. If you haven't got jobs you won't have<br />
mortgages. That was the situation we inherited in ' 83 when<br />
this other mob had control of the economy. They brought the<br />
worse recession for 50 years. At the same time we had<br />
double digit unemployment and double digit inflation and<br />
interest rates under them reached 22%. That's the<br />
alternative. With us you've got a situation where with<br />
restraint on wages and very tough budgetary policy we've<br />
created jobs more than twice as fast as the rest of the<br />
world, four times faster than the other mob when they were<br />
in office. So people are in work but at a level of activity<br />
now which is bringing in too many imports. We've got to<br />
lower the level of activity and high interest rates for the<br />
time being are necessary to do that. In the absence of<br />
having those high interest rates then as I say internationl<br />
monetary markets would drive the Australian dollar down,<br />
drive interest rates to levels infinitely beyond what they<br />
are now and throw millions out of work. That's the<br />
alternative. I don't make up the economic world and the<br />
rules of it and Australia is part of a world economic<br />
system. That's what the truth is. We have to have a level<br />
of activity that is sustainable in terms of our capacity to<br />
pay for our imports.<br />
HAMILTON: What do you say to the people who say why don't<br />
we bite the bullet straight away and strike a consumption<br />
tax? PM: The points to make about that are these. We had that<br />
on the agenda and the Australian people said no they didn't<br />
want it, quite clearly. So we had a massive restructuring<br />
of the Australian tax base in the absence of a consumption<br />
tax and in a way in which I might tell you converted a<br />
$ 9.6 billion deficit that we inherited from the Libs into<br />
now a massive surplus. In other words we've been totally<br />
fiscally responsible in terms of increasing the revenue to<br />
Government by doing what they would never do. And-that's<br />
making the rich and the powerful pay where before that was a<br />
matter of choice for them. We've increased the Government<br />
revenue in this way, put ourselves into surplus and to then<br />
suggest another change in the tax system would be disruptive<br />
of a pattern which people have now come to understand<br />
point one. Point two it would very very significantly<br />
increase inflation in a one-off but nevertheless hurtful<br />
way. That's precisely what we don't need at this time.<br />
Thirdly of course if you're going to have a consumption tax<br />
you would have, as we said at the time, a very very<br />
significant safety net arrangement in place which would add<br />
to the welfare provisions. it's appropriate in the<br />
circumstances that I'm talking about to be going down this<br />
path. We have dealt with Australia's fiscal problems, its<br />
budgetary problems and we don't want at this time to be </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PM ( cont): inflicting upon the Australian consumers a<br />
massive dose of further inflation. Let me say that as far<br />
as savings are concerned, essentially savings of the<br />
Australian community have been on the increase in the last<br />
year or so.<br />
HAMILTON: Each program we're going to be asking our guests<br />
to select a piece of music. I asked the Prime minister<br />
today and he said Lonesome Loser by the Little River Band.<br />
Is there any particular significance<br />
PM: There are two. My tastes, basically my preferences in<br />
music are classical. But that would take rather too long to<br />
play. I'm currently into Brahms Number one Symphony but I<br />
think it might take a bit too long. So I then thought well<br />
I'm Catholic in my tastes and I thought of the Little River<br />
Band for this reason I like their music and they were<br />
amongst the leaders of the Australian music industry in<br />
being exporters, helping us in our export drive,<br />
particularly to the United States. So I thought they<br />
deserved recognition. And then I thought, because as you<br />
know I am a soft and charitable I thought of poor old<br />
Andrew HAMILTON: Who just happens to be in Perth at the same time.<br />
PM: Yes, yes he shadows me That's until after the next<br />
election. Then they'll dump him and there'll be a fight<br />
between John Elliott and McLachlan and Fred Chaney. That's<br />
the scenario. So he's going to be a pretty lonesome loser<br />
isn't he.<br />
HAMILTON: So this is a political message as well as a<br />
personal selection?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
HAMILTON: Let's turn to foreign affairs. You've just come<br />
back from an exhaustive and probably exhausting trip abroad.<br />
Let's turn particularly to Eastern Europe. Is there really<br />
a new era emerging for the world do you think? Somebody<br />
asked me the other day " do you reckon Gorbachev is dinkum?"<br />
I think that's a good question. Do you think he's-dinkum?<br />
PM: I know that he's dinkum. I've had the opportunity of<br />
spending three and a half hours with the man. I was very<br />
fortunate when we were in Moscow at the end of ' 87 and it<br />
was suggested we might have 20 minutes. We finished up<br />
having three and a half hours. There is no question at all<br />
that he is dinkum. Are we at an important point in history?<br />
The fact is that we are at a turning point. We're<br />
privileged to be alive at the most significant point in the<br />
nuclear age. For the first time, as I said to a group of<br />
people last night, we're able to look our children in the<br />
eye and without any suggestion of untruth say to them that<br />
there is now a real chance of them growing up in a world<br />
free of the threat of a nuclear holocaust. Because<br />
Gorbachev, and pay Reagan his tribute too, President Reagan </p>
<p>PM ( cont): and Gorbachev have started us off on the path of<br />
eliminating particular classes of nuclear weapons, working<br />
for massive reductions of the strategic weapons, working on<br />
the reduction of conventional forces. That job has been<br />
taken up by my friend George Bush. So at that level of the<br />
super powers those things are happening. of course, within<br />
the Iron Curtain countries, unbelievable changes. I was<br />
there in Hungary just a couple of weeks ago. Unbelievable.<br />
I was sitting down with the four leaders with a sense of<br />
excitement that they had about the fact that they were<br />
preparing for free democratic parliamentary elections. I<br />
got the story from them and then on the Saturday morning sat<br />
down in the Australian Embassy with about 25 representatives<br />
of the opposition, all of whom accepted without question the<br />
integrity and the commitment of the Communist Party<br />
leadership to bring about this change. These leaders said<br />
to me in answer to a series of probing questions that I put<br />
to them, yes we accept that as a result of this process we<br />
could finish up in Opposition. That's exciting.<br />
HAMILTON: But are you frightened that there could be any<br />
setbacks? Look at what happened in China, We were all<br />
optimistic about what was happening in China and all of a<br />
sudden the incredible events unfolded in Beijing.<br />
PM: You've got to understand that what's happening in<br />
Hungary and what's happening in Poland is happening with the<br />
blessing and endorsement of Mr Gorbachev. So you've really<br />
got to ask yourself the question can anything happen in the<br />
Soviet Union? Because there is nothing going to happen<br />
within Hungary and Poland itself to reverse these processes.<br />
HAMILTON: Could anything happen to Gorbachev?<br />
PM: There is some degree of, well, not overwhelming, but<br />
there's some degree of pessimism that I found in talking to<br />
some of the leaders in Europe about his chances and one has<br />
to be honest and say there is no guarantee of his survival.<br />
But I think the realities on which he's operating, that is<br />
that the system is buggered, to coin a phrase. The system<br />
is buggered. In Gorbachev's words the Soviet Union is in a<br />
pre-crisis condition. It can't feed its people, it can't<br />
provide the goods that consumers need. The days of the<br />
command economy were never with us and they certainly are<br />
not now. In a world in which the freedom of movement of<br />
ideas, communication of information and ideas, is the<br />
quintessential element of growth and progress. The command<br />
economy is the antithesis of that. Gorbachev understands<br />
that. All the thinkers in the Soviet Union understand it.<br />
So the system was always ideologically absurd. It remains<br />
ideologically absurd and practically irrelevant. So if<br />
there's change it may be, and this a pessimistic case, that<br />
they can't stand Gorbachev's ruthless directness of mind and<br />
action and that they will want to ameliorate that. But I<br />
don't think that they can reverse the reality. </p>
<p>HAMILTON: Was the system buggered in China?<br />
PM: The system was. Marxist/ Leninist system. The<br />
ideology was always absurd and in an increasingly<br />
sophisticated world, irrelevant and counterproductive. So<br />
that proof remains. That is why even now Deng Xiaoping is<br />
saying we want the economic reform to continue, we want the<br />
opening to the world to continue. But they're frightened of<br />
the political change. The great proof of course is, and I<br />
discussed it at length with my friend Zhao Ziyang who's had<br />
the courage to stand up and keep saying these things. The<br />
great truth that he realised is that inevitably with<br />
economic reform comes political reform. He recognised that<br />
truth. The old and tragic men of China either don't<br />
understand or won't accept that. But that's temporary.<br />
HAMILTON: If the worst comes to the worst in the China<br />
situation would we accept people from Hong Kong? There's a<br />
lot of people asking this at the moment<br />
PM: I refuse to answer that hypothetical question. I say<br />
that we've got nearly a decade, the best part of a decade<br />
before the handover. I am optimistic that the fundamental<br />
realities to which I've referred will mean that the good<br />
sense will come to prevail in China. It's our<br />
responsibility in conjunction with our friends in the rest<br />
of the world to try and ensure that we create the maximum<br />
conditions for that happening. If that does then the truth<br />
will be that China will need a free and entrepeneurial Hong<br />
Kong as much as Hong Kong will need their relationship with<br />
China. That's what we've got to try and work for.<br />
HAMILTON: Just a little closer to home, Papua New Guinea.<br />
Are you concerned by the breakdown in law and order there?<br />
I know we've sent some helicopter supplies there. Will this<br />
escalate and if so do we respond<br />
PM: We are as a nation to be worried about developments<br />
in Papua New Guinea of which the developments in<br />
Bougainville are in a sense the most dramatic illustration.<br />
What we've got to remember is that Papua New Guinea is, more<br />
than almost any other pre-colonial situation, alligned,<br />
drawn on a map around a group of heterogeneous tribal<br />
groups, some 760 different tribal groups, who historically<br />
had no connection<br />
HAMILTON: Cohesion.<br />
PM: and so the great challenge for Papua New Guinea is<br />
that the processes of cohesion, those things which unite,<br />
have to be given a maximum opportunity of flowering and<br />
developing against those forces which are for dissipation.<br />
This is something, as I say, which concerns us all. As a<br />
government we're doing everything we can to assist them<br />
positively and economically. In regard to Bougainville and<br />
the helicopters, I had long and serious discussions with<br />
Rabbie Namilau, the Prime minister, to ensure that the </p>
<p>-7-<br />
PM ( cont): circumstances in which those helicopters could<br />
be used, not with Australian Defence Force people I might<br />
say, they had to organise the crew themselves. But I have<br />
the undertaking in writing that they circumstances not<br />
to be used against civilian people. That they'll be used<br />
purely for the movement of troops'and for the evacuation of<br />
civilians and troops. They will not be armed, they will not<br />
be gun ships. So we have tried to do everything we can to<br />
ensure that while they are given the requirements, which as<br />
a sovereign independent nation they are entitled to, insofar<br />
as our equipment is concerned it will be used in a way which<br />
is totally justifiable.<br />
HAMILTON: Have you heard of any particular concern from<br />
Indonesia?<br />
PM: The Indonesians have a continuing concern about what<br />
happens in Papua New Guinea. But let me say these two<br />
things. one, I think that the Indonesians have been and<br />
will be responsible in terms of their reaction. Secondly, I<br />
think that the relations between Papua New Guinea at the<br />
official level are on a sound and constructive basis. They<br />
both mutually recognise that it is in their interests that<br />
the difficulties on the board will be resolved peacefully<br />
and that they live together amicably and constructively.<br />
HAMILTON: Moving very very close to home. You were at<br />
Balcatta last night mastering a quiz night. I understand<br />
one of the questions was on what part of the body is the<br />
skin the thickest? What's you advice? Which is the<br />
thickest part of the hide for the politician?<br />
PM: Yes, you do have to have a thick hide because it is the<br />
case, and I suppose to a large extent those who have<br />
preceeded me in this generation of politicians have perhaps<br />
brought this about. But politicians aren't the most popular<br />
breed of people. You have a situation, particularly when<br />
you're a politician in Government, you often have to do<br />
things that are a bit tough, that people don't like. I<br />
think that the best defence for yourself as you think about<br />
your position and your niche in life is what do you believe.<br />
Can you look yourself in the mirror at night and in the<br />
morning and look yourself straight in the eye and say I'm<br />
doing the best I can. If you can say that, that's the best<br />
defence. HAMILTON: Actually, my six year old said to me as I left<br />
this morning " what are you going to do today dad?" I said<br />
I'm going to meet the Prime Minister. I said do you know<br />
who he is? He said " he's the boss". I said would you want<br />
to be that boss? He said " I don't know". So what's your<br />
advice to the six year olds of Australia? Should they<br />
aspire to be politicians?<br />
PM: I don't necessarily say aspire to be politicians but I<br />
do plead with them all to think and learn about politics.<br />
Because despite what your dad might say as part of this<br />
funny sort of crazy media we've got what's his name? </p>
<p>HAMILTON: Matthew. Have a word to Matthew.<br />
PM: Matthew, let me say this. Despite this crazy media<br />
we've got of which dad's part, who have got an enormous<br />
responsibility to play and a lot to answer for in terms of<br />
people's priorities and perceptions, I wish they'd analyse<br />
themselves as much as they are so prepared to examine<br />
others, including politicians. And if they did they might<br />
find at times a rather ugly mess. However, having said that<br />
and given that nice gratuitous swipe at the media Matthew,<br />
let me say this to you and all the other six year olds. In<br />
the end politics is not only the most noble, but it's also<br />
the most important part of life. Because politics in the<br />
end is about how we as human beings organise our<br />
relationships to maximise our best opportunities in life,<br />
and particularly not just for the older people but for the<br />
younger people Matthew. There's nothing more important and<br />
more noble than that. How do we best organise our<br />
relationships to give all of ourselves the best<br />
opportunities in life. That's in the end what politics is<br />
about and nothing can be more important than that.<br />
HAMILTON: Prime Minister, thank you very much.<br />
