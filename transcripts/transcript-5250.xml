INTERVIEW WITH NEWSWEEK 31 JANUARY, 1980<br />
( WASHINGTON)<br />
QUESTION: You did cover in the press conference before, but I would<br />
just like to get it on the record about how Australia can<br />
help the U. S. in the event of military action in the Indian<br />
Ocean. Are you making any plans?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Some weeks ago we offered to provide increased patrols and<br />
surveillance in the Indian Ocean. Our navy operates in the<br />
Indian Ocean now. Obviously we do have the capacity to<br />
increase our effort and that will be happening. Our respective<br />
Defence Departments and forces need to consult together about<br />
the best way of integrating in a greater Australian effort.<br />
QUESTION: Do you have any specifics? What sort of things could it involve?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it could involve increased patrolling by ships, a variety<br />
of ships in our own forces, submarines and maritime surveillance.<br />
Now some of our own papers have said there is a decision to send<br />
a carrier task force into the Indian Ocean. W~ ell, you know,<br />
that is only one of the possibilities. Our defence people<br />
haven't put their options to me or to the government yet.<br />
Patrolling, on the sea, air surveillance where our aircraft<br />
have fitted in very well with the United States because they<br />
are basically the same aircraft. Other than that, similar<br />
equipments. These are matters for them to sort out and put<br />
to governments to finally agree.<br />
QUESTION: Well, your armed forces have been plagued like ours was with<br />
budget cuts and to what extent are you prepared to increase<br />
defence spending and is it going to come from the windfall oil<br />
tax levy or are people going to get a tax cut themselves?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We have already announced a review of our strategic position<br />
as a result of Afghanistan and the changing environment that<br />
creates and I expect to have put on my desk from the Defence<br />
Minister shortly after I get back from this visit proposals,<br />
options for a greater defence effort on Australia's part. Some<br />
of those options might be only short term. Others involve<br />
additions to our equipments material and may be long term.<br />
In the order of things it takes some time, obviously to be<br />
delivered. There has been some slightly misleading publicity<br />
in Australia in the last three or four years because every<br />
year we have provided more in real terms for defence. Our<br />
defence effort, year by year has expanded from the base when<br />
we took over government at the end of 1975. But we were<br />
originally a little more optimistic about the rate of recovery<br />
in the economy and had hoped that we could provide for even<br />
greater increase than we did, and this was where the mythology<br />
about budget cuts camne in. Tt was cuts in expectation, not </p>
<p>-2-<br />
cuts in real terms because there was an expansion in real<br />
terms. I believe in the current environment that it is<br />
inevitable that we do more. How much more I can't say.<br />
QUESTION: Where is it going to come from?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, it will have to come from the general revenue available<br />
to the government. We don't predicate one particular source<br />
of revenue for one particular purpose. But we have said in<br />
Australia that any increase in requirement for defence will<br />
have to be given priority on the tax cuts for example.<br />
QUESTION: Are you planning to get involved in an economic and military<br />
consortium for Pakistan?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We have indicated a willingness to provide civil aid and aid<br />
for refugees. That indeed has already been announced. We<br />
are not planning any other activities of note although I expect<br />
that we will be continuing aid requirements, continuing<br />
assistance for refugees. The defence aid we do provide has<br />
really been concentrated in countries much closer to us<br />
Indonesia, Singapore, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand.<br />
QUESTION: There is some -talk that this kind of aid towards Pakistan would<br />
in turn, turn India more toward the Soviets?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well that is a danger and it needs watching. My Foreign Minister<br />
has recently been in India discussing these matters with both<br />
India and Pakistan and clearly each has a concern of the actions<br />
and motives of the other. I think we've all got a role to try<br />
and make sure -that things are seen as they are and a role of<br />
trying to do what can be done to reduce the regional tensions<br />
which might divert all our attention from t%. he main danger which<br />
is the Russian invasion of Afghanistan and the consequences<br />
to detente.<br />
QUESTION: The Australian Wheat Board and Wool Corporation are apparently<br />
predicting that the boycott would be catastrophic to them. How<br />
far are you willing to go in terms of </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We've made decisions to support the United States position<br />
and I don't see that changing. I don't think there is any<br />
real evidence at this point that a boycott is going to be<br />
catastrophic for the grain industry.<br />
QUESTION: Have th ey complained to you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
They are concerned. It's possible. I understand their concern.<br />
As in the United States, many Australian farmers produce grain<br />
and that is their total income. So it's natural, they believe,<br />
that if there is to be an economic sanction it ought to be<br />
fairly shared in terms of its impact on the people, and you<br />
know, that is a view we all have to support. But, by and large,<br />
the Australian people, as I believe, strongly support the<br />
position of the United States, strongly support the position<br />
the Australian Government has taken.<br />
QUESTION: We get from our reporter in Australia that there have been some<br />
charges that your strong anti-Soviet stance is an election year<br />
ploy. Now Carter is also taking those same charges, now I<br />
wonder how you react to them.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I think that is nonsense and I haven't felt the need to<br />
answer them up to this point myself, they are so absurd.<br />
Nearly everyone is very concerned at what the Soviet Union has<br />
done and I have been on record over a long period of being<br />
somewhat sceptical about Soviet actions in -the world. I would<br />
have been delighted if it had been proved entirely and utterly<br />
wrong but unfortunately events in Afghanistan tended to prove<br />
that my fears and concerns were much more right than wrong.<br />
I think what Afghanistan has done is to make it possible for<br />
many people to see the Soviet Union in clear and plain terms,<br />
where before the pursuit of detente sometimes enabled the<br />
Soviet Union to hide its real intentions. The meaning that they<br />
attach to that word was never the meaning that the United States<br />
or we attached to it. They still pursued competition,<br />
exploited opportunity.-You only have to look at what they have<br />
been doing in Africa.-Cubans, Soviets, all the rest, trying to<br />
stir up trouble wherever they could. If they really believe in<br />
detente they would support settlements and peace instead of<br />
supporting revolution. </p>
<p>4-<br />
QUESTION: Do you sense a change in the President here and that Carter,<br />
would you say that he was naive? He made a statement here<br />
that his perception of the Soviets had changed more in the<br />
two to three days after the invasion than it had in the two<br />
or three years he had during detente.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well let me answer that question this way. I think his State<br />
of the Union speech is realistic. I believe it was needed.<br />
I think it was a courageous soeech and one which I hope the<br />
United States people and people in as many independently minded<br />
nations as possible will support because ' I think it is only<br />
the collective determination of the United States and many<br />
others including Australia, thlat will really deter the Soviet<br />
Union from further adventures, and the dangers of a further<br />
Soviet move into Iran the circumstances for that could so<br />
easily be promoted if the Soviets wanted to. The dangers<br />
would then be horrific. If th e world has been facing a<br />
dangerous circumstance over the last few w-. eeks as a result<br />
of the invasion of Afghanistan, we would be half pushed over<br />
the cliff if the Soviet Union goes further. As I interpret it,<br />
the President's speech was sa.. ing that very clearly and very<br />
plainly and that's why my government supports it so strongly<br />
and supports the United StateS position and wants to do what<br />
it can to assist because we believe the United States is right.<br />
Some of our own people some of the critics in Australia -say<br />
why don't you wait until 40 other countries have agreed to<br />
boycott the Olympic Games, until 40 other countries have agreed<br />
to join in this or show their disappr oval of the Soviet Union<br />
in more positive ways. Well if everyone is going to sit back<br />
and wait until everyone else . as moved first, nothing will be<br />
done. The United States will be left relatively isolated. and<br />
alone and I believe this is very much a time when not only<br />
the President of the United States but the United States people<br />
need to feel that other peoples, other countries around the world<br />
feel and know that the United States is right and support what<br />
the President is doing in the name of the United States people.<br />
QUESTION: Is this a different President Carter?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't really think I can pursue that. You can ask the<br />
American Senate that sort of cuestion. T am just speaking<br />
of the President as I find hi~ i today. I think he has always<br />
been a very determined person. I also believe that he is<br />
enormously idealistic and well meaning. And they are good<br />
things in a political leader, they really are. </p>
<p>4<br />
QUESTION:<br />
What do you expect to gain from your visit to London?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Well a perception of the United Kingdom's view. You have<br />
to read the cables but it's never the same thing. You speak to<br />
people and you learn things which can never be put on paper.<br />
I think it is particularly important to get the European view<br />
land-based European France and Germany as well as the United<br />
Kingdom because in the past if events haven't immediately<br />
touched Europe, Europe has tended to say, these events aren't<br />
of great concern. Well, if the Soviet Union starts to get<br />
control over oil suipplies it is European nations who would<br />
feel the damage'and the destruction of that before the United<br />
States and before Australia. Both of which they don't have<br />
enough, but they have reserves of energy of different kinds<br />
which would enable them the United States and ourselves, to<br />
get through some way or another. But a number of countries<br />
in Europe without Middle East oil would be totally destroyed.<br />
And I would have thought they must be aware of it. But I<br />
look forward to hearing from them directly in the course of<br />
the next few days.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister Ohira has been promoting the idea of a Pacific<br />
economic community. What do you think of that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I believe the idea is a good one, but at the moment it is an<br />
idea, it needs to be given some bones, and then the flesh has<br />
got to be put on the bones. We've agreed, if other regional<br />
countries want it, to sponsor a seminar to discuss it at the<br />
Australian National University in Canberra to see what emerges<br />
from that. The idea of closer Pacific cooperation is one that<br />
ought to be pursued and I believe pursued with vigor. But the<br />
difficulties come because of the diversity of the nations in the<br />
Pacific. We have got some industrial nations, and just to stick<br />
to the western Pacific Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Australia, New<br />
Zealand, industrializing countries, Malaysia; Singapore is an<br />
industrial country. But then you've got others with very<br />
different economies, Papua New Guinea, you've got the very small<br />
island states of the Pacific. How do you fit all of these into<br />
some kind of integrated concept? And also it needs emphasizing<br />
that in Prime Minister Ohira's mind the concept would not in any<br />
way impinge upon the strength and viability of the ASEAN group<br />
of nations. There are sentitivities there that need to be<br />
understood. It is a new organization between nations which has<br />
grown in cohesion and strength. Something that you and we<br />
support very strongly and they obviously don't want anything to<br />
impede the growth of that organization. And they wouldn't want<br />
something that might divert attention from it. But that again<br />
is something that would have to be accommodated within the<br />
Pacific community concept. But at the moment,) we have a great<br />
idea, and that's valuable. Whether we can put flesh and bones<br />
on it, well that's the challenge ahead of all of us. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
QUESTION: I want to ask you one last question, a sort of a general<br />
question about what the 1980' s are going to bring for<br />
Australia. Some are predicting an economic boom. Talk a<br />
little about that and foreign investment particularly.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I believe economically we car do better than many. For a<br />
number of reasons. Inflation is too high, but it is lower<br />
than many, it is lower than the OECD average, lower than it<br />
presently is in this country. Our secondary industries which<br />
couldn't sell overseas when we came into office are now<br />
expanding their exports quite rapidly because they are<br />
competitive across a wide range, even some things which are<br />
labour intensive. There is a specialised capacity in<br />
Australia. And they are selling some things in the Asian<br />
markets against Asian competition. So we do have a capacity<br />
to compete, and that's in manufactures. Now it is our<br />
intention to try and keep inflation under that of a number<br />
of our major trading partners. So that's one bull point for<br />
the Australian economy. But then, political stability;<br />
possession of very large mineral reserves, but perhaps more<br />
important, possession of significant energy reserves. We<br />
have a shortage of oil, we are about 70 per cent self sufficient,<br />
but we export vast quantities of coal, natural gas; and are<br />
potentially large exporters oE uranium. Having the energy<br />
resources and mineral reserves in Australia provides a great<br />
opportunity to bring the two together in greater processing<br />
in Australia. Now this is happeningin the aluminum industry,<br />
with four billion dollars being spent on processing, smelting<br />
operations, exp) ansions, right at this moment. I think it is<br />
likely to happen with other minerals because as oil costs rise<br />
there is no prospect that OPEC countries are going to change<br />
their practices. As they rise, shipping costs are going to<br />
get greater and the economics of finishing or exporting our<br />
processed or semi-processed product will probably' be greater<br />
than exporting bulk commodities and the coal to provide the<br />
energy. This does open up options and opportunities for<br />
Australia which aren't present in a number of other countries,<br />
so in short terms the ingredients are an economy wvith a more<br />
favourable inflation rate than in many countries.......<br />
QUESTION: What is it now?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it's 10 per cent. It's too high but oil has had its impact<br />
on us as its had on everyone. But the relatively favourable<br />
economy, a comp) etitive econony.,., then foreign investment policies<br />
and guidelines tvhich encourage foreign investment and couple that<br />
with mineral reserves and energy reserves and the wqhole package<br />
can be put together and undoubtedly make a relatively optimistic<br />
decade for Australia in spite of world wide economic difficulties<br />
of quite an acute kind. </p>
