    <content><![CDATA[<p>TEL 140/ 92<br />The Opposition has decided to bury the Cole Committee's report because it threatcned to<br />destroy the Goods and Services Tax once and for all.<br />Since March, Coalition members havc been ducking legitimate criticism of their. policies<br />by referring all callers to the Cole Committee and promising that their criticism would be<br />considered there.<br />The Committee has, in turn, prepared a damning report which has swollen to 800 pages<br />longer than the original Fightback document.<br />Sir William Cole was told by Dr Hewson a month ago that his . cprt was unacceptable<br />_ politically, and he should clean it up.<br />But even the censored version has proved too hot for Dr Hewson to handle, and he is<br />reneging on his promise to release the report before Christmas. In fact, he will not dare<br />release it before the election.<br />This is a betrayal of all those groups cane farmers, tourist operators, bankers, builders,<br />car manufacturers and others who were fobbcd off with clear promises of consideration<br />and who must now be left with a better idea of what Dr Hewson's word is worth.<br />For their benefit alone, the Opposition should come clean and release the report, no matter<br />how critical it is of Fighiback and the GST.<br />At the insistence of his p. r. minders, Dr I-ewson has been talking this week about<br />" listening" to people; his decision to scuttle the Cole Committee shows there is a lot of<br />talking going on but no real listening.<br />CANBERRA, December 11, 1992 11.
