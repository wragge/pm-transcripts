FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 74/ 1970<br />
CABINET MEETS TO CONSIDER GAZELLE SIT'UATION<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Federal Cabinet met today to consider a series of reports from the<br />
Administrator of Papua and New Guinea.<br />
The reports indicated that the Administrator faced a serious,<br />
potentially dangerous situation on the Gazelle Peninzsula New Britain.<br />
The situation has come about in the following way. The Administration<br />
bought land on the Gazelle Peninsula in order to subdivide it and distribute it<br />
among Tolai and Bainings indigenous people. A section the Tolai, called<br />
Mataungans, had sent squatters onto this land and had stated that they were going<br />
to occupy it and distribute it themselves and that they recognised no title and no<br />
law but their own will.<br />
The Mataungans had made it clear that they would resist any attempt<br />
at removing their illegal squatters and had massed twelve to fifteen hundred persons<br />
on the site to resist by violence any attempted removal.<br />
The persons gathered were armed with spears, bows and arrows,<br />
sling shots, rocks, bottles, bushlknives and axes.<br />
It was clear that if the police carried out their duty and removed those<br />
in illegal occupation of the land there was a strong risk of a major clash, of riot<br />
and of extreme -violence.<br />
After considering these reports, and bearing in mind the expressed<br />
wish of the Administrator's Executive Council and of the Tolai opposed to the<br />
Mataungans, that the law should be enforced, Cabinet decided that it was essential<br />
that law and order should be maintained in the Territory.<br />
Cabinet decided that the Government fully aa. eed with the Administrator<br />
and would fully support the Administrator in carrying out -measures which the<br />
Administrator had advised the Government he felt to be necessary ini the present<br />
circumstances, to remove squatters.<br />
The Administrator has been so informed. It is hoped the leaders of<br />
the Mataungan section of th:-Tolais will not incite their followers to the violence<br />
they have threatened; but if they do so the responsibility for any consequence<br />
will rest upon them alone.<br />
