    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Government has signed the second Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to create a one-stop shop for environmental approvals, this time with the NSW Government.</p>
<p>Following the endorsement of the Queensland Government last month, the Federal Government is on track to sign-on all states and territories within 12 months and fast-track the eradication of red and green tape for environmental approvals.</p>
<p>A one-stop shop will eliminate duplication, deliver more timely approvals and enable Australian businesses to expedite their work. It will mean only one approval is needed, not two.</p>
<p>The NSW and Federal Governments today demonstrated a collective commitment to helping strengthen the NSW economy, reduce costs, boost productivity and create jobs.</p>
<p>The Productivity Commission has found that green tape could delay major projects – such as major oil or gas projects – for up to a year costing business and the economy hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The same strict environmental standards will continue to apply but the one-stop shop for environmental approvals will ensure swifter decisions and more certainty, whilst increasing jobs and investment in NSW.</p>
<p>Within 12 months a bilateral agreement will be reached between the Federal and NSW Governments. The work to achieve this will be undertaken by Environment Ministers.</p>
