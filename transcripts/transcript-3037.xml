Press Statement No. 137<br />
11 October 1973<br />
COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO A NATIONAL<br />
REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION SCHEME<br />
The Prime Minister announced today the<br />
resignation of Professor Patrick Atiyah from the'<br />
Committee of Inquiry into a National Rehabilitation<br />
and Compensation Scheme.<br />
He said Professor Atiyah had felt obliged,<br />
for personal reasons, to return to England earlier<br />
than expected. lie had taken up a post in the<br />
University of Warwick.<br />
The Prime Minister said he regretted that<br />
the Inquiry would be deprived of Professor Atiyah's<br />
knowledge and assistance. However, the Committee<br />
was now well advanced in its work, and for this<br />
reason he had decided, after consultation with the<br />
Chairman, Mr. Justice Woodhouse, that it would not<br />
be practicable to replace Professor Atiyah.<br />
