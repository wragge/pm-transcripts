    <content><![CDATA[<p>With deep regret, I have accepted the resignation of Senator Arthur Sinodinos from the ministry.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Arthur advised me that the ICAC investigation would most likely continue at least until March.</p>
<p>Knowing Arthur as I do, I am confident he will be vindicated.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Government does need an Assistant Treasurer for the preparation of the Budget.</p>
<p>I will announce Arthurâs replacement in the next few days.</p>
<p>He has provided sterling service to the Government and to the Parliament.</p>
<p>I look forward to his future contribution to the Government and, in the meantime, am confident he will continue to be a vigorous advocate for the people of New South Wales.</p>
