PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
NATIONAL STRATEGIES CONFERENCE<br />
SYDNEY 24 NOVEMBER 1994<br />
It's a great pleasure to be here tonight to open this<br />
very important National Strategies Conference.<br />
It is an auspicious curtain raiser for the revamped EPAC,<br />
and I congratulate the organisers, particularly Glen<br />
Withers. I think a couple of comments need to be made at the<br />
start. The first is that this is a conference of ideas: it is by<br />
way of a think tank, a discussion among a very wide range<br />
of Australians about where our opportunities lie, what<br />
our ambitions should be, and what are the best ways to<br />
realise them.<br />
In other words, it is a means of creating some national<br />
strategic ferment. If we create enough of it, new<br />
policies will follow in due course.<br />
The second comment that needs to be made is that the<br />
focus here is not on economics alone.<br />
The focus is on the things we need to do ( and need nct to<br />
do) if we want Australia to remain a very good place to<br />
live a pre-eminent and improving place to live and<br />
work and raise our children.<br />
While the strength and flexibility of the economy is<br />
fundamental to this goal, a strong economy will not by<br />
itself generate a strong society, or a compassionate and<br />
creative one.<br />
If the various aims of this conference can be boiled down<br />
to one, it might be this: how do we balance economic<br />
imperatives with human ones for security and peace of<br />
mind, for a decent environment, for cultural nourishment,<br />
and, particularly in this era of relentless change, for<br />
confidence, hope and belief.<br />
On the one hand, I imagine, this conference will be<br />
examining where change is needed and the best way to<br />
achieve it. </p>
<p>On the other, I should hope you will be looking at ways<br />
to ca; 1 with change.<br />
Perpetual motion is stressful. The new is exciting but<br />
we know it also has an element of shock about it.<br />
This conference will make a contribution to our national<br />
life if it can help us find solutions to these problems<br />
which beset modern life. If it can help us keep moving<br />
at a respectable clip, but with everyone on board and<br />
without too much motion sickness.<br />
In fact, we are doing this better than most. In the past<br />
year, the Australian economy has grown at more than 4 per<br />
cent.<br />
At the same time, we have added to one of the most<br />
sophisticated social security systems in the world a<br />
revolutionary Job Compact and other education and labour<br />
market programs, to extend opportunities to the long term<br />
unemployed and make Australia's safety net more secure.<br />
There is every reason to be positive.<br />
We have an outstandingly favourable conjunction of<br />
circumstances, the best for 30 years economic growth<br />
combined with rapid employment growth, falling<br />
unemployment, low inflation, record profit levels and<br />
continuing high levels of international competitiveness.<br />
The foundations of Australian society are very strong<br />
they have never been stronger I believe and the<br />
opportunities have never been greater.<br />
I know some people have been saying in recent times that<br />
things were better a generation ago.<br />
It is true that unemployment was lower then and there is<br />
no doubt that Australians enjoyed a high standard of<br />
living. But it is also true that the labour force was<br />
much smaller and a smaller percentage of Australians<br />
participated in it.<br />
This is not the time to enter into a debate with the past<br />
and those who continue to prefer it to contemporary<br />
Australia. But some of the nonsense should be shown for what it is.<br />
Real household disposable income is about 50 per cent<br />
higher now than at the end of the 1960s.<br />
And we are surely much richer in the less tangible<br />
things. </p>
<p>In cultural terms so much less provincial, inward<br />
looking and xenophobic. Much more open to the world and<br />
very much more worldly.<br />
This is an infinitely more interesting Australia and<br />
one much more in charge of its destiny.<br />
I hope you bring to this conference a sense of<br />
achievement and optimism which Australians are entitled<br />
to feel.<br />
Not smugness or complacency, because too much remains to<br />
be done and because, in this very competitive world, the<br />
process of change and adjustment never ends.<br />
But we have every reason to feel proud of what we have<br />
done in recent times and confident about what we can do.<br />
And it would be as foolish to leave this sentiment out of<br />
your equations as it would be to leave out that other<br />
great intangible of Australian life I mean a people<br />
who, by tradition, recognise that cohesion, tolerance,<br />
and fairness are the greatest social virtues.<br />
Tie these things to the unprecedented opportunities which<br />
now exist particularly those opportunities in the<br />
region and the conclusion is inescapable.<br />
The starting point of this conference should be that at<br />
this point in Australia's history, things are very much<br />
in our favour.<br />
So what we need and what this conference can help<br />
provide, I hope, are practical, coherent strategies to<br />
consolidate our gains.<br />
It would be inappropriate, of course, to pre-empt any of<br />
your deliberations; but perhaps I should spell out what<br />
are, broadly speaking, the Government's priorities.<br />
First, of course, we need to maintain a competitive<br />
growing economy if we are also to maintain steady<br />
improvements in living standards and lower rates of<br />
unemployment. For this reason we continue to seek greater economic<br />
and political engagement with the region where the<br />
opportunities are greatest the Asia-Pacific. That<br />
is an essential element of Government strategy.<br />
Our physical environment is our greatest natural<br />
asset and a defining force in our national life and<br />
character. It is crucial to any national strategy<br />
that we redouble our efforts to achieve sustainable<br />
development across the continent.<br />
Finding paths to social and economic justice for<br />
groups that have long been disadvantaged has, I </p>
<p>think, been a hallmark of this Government. Because<br />
it makes not just for a fairer society but a more<br />
cohesive, confident and productive one, it remains a<br />
policy priority.<br />
We will also continue to encourage a creative and<br />
cultural environment which enriches all Australians<br />
and fosters ideas and innovation in an era when, as<br />
probably never before, such things determine the<br />
success of individuals and nations.<br />
And because we are always stronger when we are sure<br />
of our identity and we will continue to do those<br />
things which are necessary to encourage a better<br />
understanding of our democratic heritage, a deeper<br />
faith in it and a deeper sense of what it means to<br />
be Australian.<br />
Australia's success self-evidently depends upon the<br />
faith and belief of its young people, and that in<br />
large part depends upon their education and skills<br />
their capacity to create and to seize opportunities.<br />
Education and training are fundamental to the<br />
Government's national strategy, particularly the<br />
development of the TAFE system.<br />
Let me take you briefly through these objectives one by<br />
one. The challenge to economic policy is to sustain the<br />
favourable conditions we now have while reducing<br />
unemployment to the level of around 5 per cent we have<br />
set as a target by the end of the century.<br />
This obviously implies a need both for effective monetary<br />
and fiscal policies and for continuing microeconomic<br />
reform to increase our productive capacity.<br />
We have set out a program to reduce the budget deficit to<br />
around 1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97.<br />
Not only is this one of the most stringent targets set by<br />
any OECD country, it is also being pursued by an economy<br />
which has one of the strongest public sector balance<br />
sheets in the world.<br />
On the monetary side, we have reacted quickly to emerging<br />
trends, and clearly the authorities will continue to<br />
monitor developments closely and take whatever action is<br />
necessary to sustain the recovery.<br />
We have achieved a great deal in the area of<br />
microeconomic reform but the forward agenda remains<br />
prodigious.<br />
We will soon have the report of the National Transport<br />
Planning Task force. </p>
<p>In December, the Broadband Services Expert Group will<br />
deliver its final report, which I will discuss a little<br />
later.<br />
But the central microeconomic game at the moment is<br />
competition policy, including the proposed reforms to the<br />
electricity and gas sectors.<br />
The ball is very much in the States' court. Their case<br />
for so-called compensation is more strident than<br />
reasonable and if they try to drive too hard a bargain<br />
the Commonwealth will simply go it alone.<br />
We will pursue it in the national interest.<br />
As I have said more than once in recent times, the States<br />
are a permanent part of the political culture and their<br />
sovereignty and integrity are not in question.<br />
What is questionable is the constant " States rights"<br />
refrain, as if the federation was created for this<br />
purpose rather than to make an Australian nation.<br />
The rights on microeconomic reform, like every other<br />
issue, pertain to the rights of Australians and the<br />
Commonwealth's responsibility is to protect and advance<br />
those rights.<br />
The Commonwealth's responsibility is to continue the<br />
campaign for a more competitive and productive nation.<br />
Every one of us knows that microeconomic reform is<br />
fundamental to this. It is, therefore, fundamental to<br />
our continuing success in the region and the world.<br />
Last week's APEC leaders meeting in Bogor was a critical<br />
turning point for Australia and the region, and really no<br />
one should be in any doubt about it.<br />
First in Seattle, then in Bogor, we have settled some<br />
fundamental questions about the shape of our region and<br />
the institutions that will serve it into the next<br />
century. APEC makes less likely the division of the post-Cold War<br />
world into three competing blocs. By engaging China,<br />
Japan, the United States and the developing economies of<br />
ASEAN in a multilateral economic framework, it also gives<br />
us greater political and strategic assurance during a<br />
period of very rapid change.<br />
The firm commitment which leaders made in Bogor to free<br />
trade in the region by 2010 for developed countries and<br />
2020 for developing countries, is the best sign we could<br />
have that the dynamic growth which has characterised East<br />
Asia over the past ten years, will continue. </p>
<p>APEC, as I have said recently, did not have to happen.<br />
There were many other alternative futures for the region,<br />
and among them the most likely candidate was drift. All<br />
of them, I am convinced, would have been less happy<br />
outcomes for Australia and for the countries around us.<br />
But APEC is not the only or even the primary, means of<br />
our engagement with the region. Strong, trusting,<br />
bilateral links with our neighbours are essential both<br />
in their own right, and if APEC's ambitions are to be<br />
sustained. In our strong and diversified ties with Japan, our<br />
rapidly deepening relationship with Indonesia, our longstanding<br />
links with China and our growing relations with<br />
Korea, our ties with the region have never been better.<br />
This is a strong foundation on which to build.<br />
Building a bilateral relationship of substance and trust<br />
with Indonesia has been a prime aim of the Keating<br />
Government. Indonesia is our largest, nearest neighbour much of our<br />
future and theirs will be governed by what we are able to<br />
do together.<br />
At the cultural, commercial and strategic level,<br />
Indonesia is the country of the greatest importance to<br />
Australia; hence building that co-operation and<br />
interdependence is central to Australia's long run<br />
interests. The development of APEC will have important consequences<br />
for the way the countries of this region interact, and<br />
therefore for Australian security.<br />
The maintenance of a strong, self-reliant defence<br />
capability is a central requirement. We must be able to<br />
deter and defeat any attack on Australia.<br />
The Government will shortly be tabling its Defence White<br />
Paper which will look at the way the Australian Defence<br />
Force should be shaped over the next fifteen years. The<br />
White Paper will build on the changes we have instituted<br />
over the past decade to ensure that Australia can protect<br />
its security in a rapidly changing external environment.<br />
A critical element in maintaining defence self-reliance<br />
is the role of Australian defence industries, We have<br />
already shown in the construction of the Collins-class<br />
submarines and in our Anzac Frigate Program that<br />
Australia has the technological capacity to match the<br />
best in the world.<br />
We want to build this into a core capacity for defence<br />
procurement, for our own needs and for the region as<br />
well. </p>
<p>Our economic success and, no less, maintaining our<br />
quality of life into the next century depends on<br />
sustainable use of the environment.<br />
We have been blessed with a superb physical environment<br />
and our responsibility to sustain it is total and<br />
inescapable. We owe it to more than ourselves we owe it to future<br />
generations of Australians and just as certainly we owe<br />
it to the world.<br />
This is an enormous challenge.<br />
We need to address the emission of greenhouse gases and<br />
the management of our coasts, the treatment of our<br />
sewerage and the management of our forests, the control<br />
of feral pests and woody weeds.<br />
This evening let me concentrate on just two the<br />
management of our coasts and land management.<br />
The drought has highlighted the destructive effects of<br />
past land management practices.<br />
Our soils have been degraded. Too much of our more<br />
sensitive land has been over-used.<br />
We have not looked after our inland rivers properly.<br />
We could well face a serious problem with blue-green<br />
algae again this year because of the high level of<br />
nutrients we are feeding into the rivers and the lack of<br />
water flow.<br />
These are large problems and ad hoc solutions will not<br />
do. That is why we established the National Strategy for<br />
Ecologically Sustainable Development ESD.<br />
The Strategy embodied the twin goals of economic<br />
development and conservation of the natural ecosystems on<br />
which life depends.<br />
The Strategy is not an end in itself, but a framework<br />
within which governments are expected to work when making<br />
decisions about development.<br />
I know there is a feeling abroad that there has been much<br />
more talk than action on sustainable development but I<br />
believe we are about to see some dramatic signs of<br />
progress. A prime example is in agriculture. </p>
<p>Across the country farmers are adopting a more scientific<br />
and conservationist approach to land and water<br />
management. The prime mover, of course, has been the National<br />
Landcare program.<br />
Landcare has reached a lot of rural Australia but it<br />
should reach all of it.<br />
A general consensus has emerged that the past four or<br />
five years of raising awareness and planning should now<br />
be translated into action.<br />
Together with participants in the Landcare movement, the<br />
Government is now looking at how we can advance the<br />
overall Landcare objective by promoting sustainable<br />
agriculture and better management of natural resources.<br />
Earlier today I announced a new Land Management Task<br />
Force whose aim is to promote and facilitate the adoption<br />
of property management plans by the farming sector.<br />
At present it is estimated that more than 80 per cent of<br />
farmers do not possess a farm plan including information<br />
on soil and land capacity.<br />
We want to draw into the sustainable development effort<br />
all levels of government and elements of the private<br />
sector, especially the banks.<br />
The results will be five years or so in coming, but they<br />
will be real and tangible.<br />
Among them will be better water quality in our rivers, an<br />
end to declining yields and new more marketable products.<br />
Sustainable development bears a direction relationship to<br />
our strategy for regional development, which is to say<br />
that the great deal depends upon the capacity of local<br />
communities and individuals to take responsibility for<br />
their own future.<br />
We see a lot of Australia's future energy and direction<br />
coming from the regions.<br />
This is where real affections and attachments reside. If<br />
we can get the skills, the strategic infrastructure and<br />
appropriate financial instruments to them, regional<br />
Australia will play a dynamic part in our national<br />
development. The development of regional industries should be matched<br />
by the development of regional identity.<br />
Because it encourages both greater variety and greater<br />
protection, it seems to me good sense to associate<br />
products ( particularly food products) with their regional </p>
<p>source good sense for the industries and the regions<br />
and good sense for the national economy.<br />
I think there is little doubt that regions with a<br />
stronger sense of identity and common interest will also<br />
see more readily the need for sustainable development<br />
practices and will more conscientiously adopt them.<br />
Another environmental issue of great consequence is the<br />
Australian coast.<br />
In fact, there is probably no better example of why<br />
national strategies are necessary.<br />
Historically responsibility for the settlement of our<br />
coast has rested with various levels of government and<br />
various levels of administration without any underlying<br />
direction or unifying objectives. The effect of this<br />
lack of vision is now painfully apparent.<br />
The overwhelming beauty of our coast is marred by urban<br />
sprawl, poor planning and pollution.<br />
We have generally lost the balance between conservation<br />
and development. The number and complexity of issues and<br />
interests involved make this a huge task.<br />
The nature of this problem was documented in the Coastal<br />
Zone Inquiry conducted by the Resource Assessment<br />
Commission. The Report set out ways of steering decision<br />
making at all levels of government towards the same<br />
principles and the same goals.<br />
This is not a master plan, more of a map which lays out<br />
our journey.<br />
We need more maps.<br />
We need them in the cities to keep them both highly<br />
liveable and exciting.<br />
The Urban Design Task Force whose Report was delivered by<br />
its convener, by John Mant, earlier this week offers us a<br />
comprehensive map of the future of our cities which<br />
means nothing less of course than the future for the<br />
great majority of Australians.<br />
On the subject of maps, right now we are engaged in<br />
devising and implementing a strategy for the information<br />
highway in Australia.<br />
In the future, information will be the crucial element,<br />
the key resource for Australians.<br />
As I have said before, how well we play the information<br />
game will determine how well we prosper as a nation. </p>
<p>That is why the Report of the Broadband Services Expert<br />
Group is so important. The interim report has already<br />
significantly influenced our thinking.<br />
It has highlighted the importance to Australia's cultural<br />
development of our content providers having maximum<br />
access to the information highway.<br />
My colleague, Michael Lee, earlier today set down some<br />
principles on broadband cable networks which will help to<br />
ensure that we have such a competitive and open system.<br />
These are fundamental principles we will not divide the<br />
country up into regional monopolies for our carriers; we<br />
will ensure that there is non-discriminatory access to<br />
the broadband network; and there will be open access for<br />
Pay TV usage of cable after a period of up to 5 years.<br />
The leeway is to encourage the rollout of the cable by<br />
allowing those concerned to share in the initial revenue.<br />
The interim BSEG report also stressed how well placed we<br />
are to be a major content provider. I am confident that<br />
in the next few years, there will be unparalleled<br />
opportunities for many talented young Australians in this<br />
industry. The initiatives in Creative Nation will help them to get<br />
a start.<br />
To co-ordinate our efforts in this rapidly changing area,<br />
I will be chairing a new Council on Broadband Services.<br />
The Council will provide a focal point for examining new<br />
developments in information technologies or opportunities<br />
for broadband services and it will advise on issues<br />
including the Government's own use of the new<br />
technologies or various regulatory issues.<br />
These things are essential. They are to this moment in<br />
our history what railways and roads were a hundred years<br />
ago. Earlier, I said that social and economic justice for<br />
disadvantaged groups remains one of our priorities.<br />
I think people have heard me talk about the principles<br />
underlying the Native Title Act and the Land Fund for<br />
Aboriginal Australians.<br />
I also think they are familiar with the Government's<br />
programs for the long term unemployed and the principles<br />
underlying them.<br />
It will be enough to repeat that we take the view that<br />
the social and economic reasons for bringing the long<br />
term unemployed back into the mainstream workforce are<br />
compelling. </p>
<p>Compelling because it is both a massive waste of<br />
resources and an invitation to alienation and social<br />
discord to leave them out.<br />
The principle underlying the Government's social strategy<br />
remains for want of a more elegant word inclusion.<br />
Among other things, that means calling on all of our<br />
talents and energy.<br />
It is in that context, among others, that our continuing<br />
commitment to multiculturalism may be viewed.<br />
And the same might be said about Government policies to<br />
promote the equality and interests of women.<br />
Women have been a profound force in the changes of recent<br />
years. They make decisions every day which profoundly<br />
affect the life of the nation. They make them in<br />
families, communities, schools and universities,<br />
factories and offices. They ought to be making them<br />
more of them in parliaments and boardrooms.<br />
Most of you have probably also heard me recite the<br />
Government's record of achievement in this realm as well.<br />
I suspect you are also well versed in the reasons ' why<br />
this year we delivered Creative Nation, the first<br />
thoroughgoing cultural policy in Australia's history.<br />
And I will not again regale you with the obvious reasons<br />
glaringly obvious I would have thought why Australia<br />
should in this last decade of the century substitute an<br />
Australian for a British monarch as our head of state.<br />
Broadly speaking, these things are all related to<br />
encouraging in young Australians a deep faith in their<br />
country belief in its best traditions and its future.<br />
Creative Nation is about enriching the climate in which<br />
they live. The republic is about leaving no room for<br />
ambiguity if we cannot express our faith in Australia<br />
through the ultimate symbol of our nationhood, what<br />
message are we sending to the next generation?<br />
Not, surely, the wholehearted one we ought to.<br />
The symbolic gestures are important. The real ones are<br />
more so.<br />
The most important initiative we have taken for young<br />
Australians in the past three years has been the<br />
extension of technical and further education of the<br />
TAFE system.<br />
In the 1980s we greatly expanded secondary and tertiary<br />
education. We increased secondary retention rates from<br />
around three in ten to eight in ten. </p>
<p>That was a great achievement and we need one of similar<br />
dimensions, perhaps greater dimensions, in vocational<br />
education and training.<br />
The Youth Training Initiative announced in Working Nation<br />
under which fifteen to seventeen year olds will be case<br />
managed into education, training or work is one step<br />
toward that goal.<br />
The creation of the Australian National Training<br />
Authority to drive the expansion of the TAFE system is<br />
another. The Australian Student Traineeship Foundation, a scheme<br />
delivered through regional partnerships between schools<br />
and industry is yet another.<br />
All these initiatives go towards meeting the great<br />
education challenge for Australian in the 90s to bring<br />
vocational education and training up to the level which<br />
our economic and social ambitions demand. Ultimately, it<br />
should be to a level the equal of any in the world.<br />
It is more than economic and social ambition which drives<br />
this, however.<br />
In the end, meeting those ambitions translates into that<br />
same faith in Australia I mentioned in another context.<br />
Reduced to its fundamentals, the strategic aim of the<br />
Government's policies on vocational education is giving<br />
young people a reason to believe in Australia.<br />
It is our most basic responsibility to give them a reason<br />
for believing. And the best way to do that is to give<br />
them the capacity to grasp the opportunities that now<br />
exist. Nothing is so important to the Government as this and<br />
nothing should be more important to this conference.<br />
This conference which I am now very pleased to declare<br />
open. Thank you. </p>
