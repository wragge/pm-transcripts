FOR PRESS * 28 OCTOBER 1976<br />
AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION ITEM NO. H8<br />
THE POWER OF THE SENATE IN RELATION TO. MONEY. BILLS<br />
The motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition in -the<br />
Commonwealth Parliament seeks to remove the Senate'spower<br />
to reject, defer or in any other manner block the<br />
passage of laws appropriating revenue or money, or imposing<br />
taxation. I assume from the fact that this motion is moved, that in fact<br />
past arguments as to whether the Senate had the power<br />
it exercised in November 1975 have now been effectively<br />
abandoned. It ought now to be clearly acknowledged<br />
that the Sbnate has the power and that its use of the power was<br />
fully constitutional.<br />
Both sides of the Federal Parliament have recognised in the<br />
past that the Senate has the power to disallow money bills.<br />
This was actively contended by the then Opposition in 1970<br />
and again by the Opposition in 1974.<br />
In 1975 the power was not only claimed but was demonstrated<br />
and the Senate's action was overwhelmingly endorsed by the<br />
people. Section 1 of the Constitution clearly vests the<br />
legislative power of the Commonwealth in a Federal Parliament<br />
consisting of The Queen, the Senate, * and the House of Representative<br />
Section 53 places certain limitations on the Senate's powers<br />
to introduce and/ or amend money bills, but categorically states<br />
that otherwise the Senate shall have equal power with the House<br />
of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws.<br />
Section 58 requires that a proposed law be passed by both<br />
Houses before it is presented to the Governor General;<br />
There is overwhelming agreement by Australian Constitutional<br />
authorities that the Senate has the legal right to defer or<br />
reject money bills. This has been explicitly stated by Quick<br />
and Garran, -Odgers and others.<br />
It has been claimed by some that the Senate's power to reject<br />
a money bill " has atrophied and become a dead letter", that<br />
there exists some convention that the power not be used.<br />
This would seem to be a nonsense. Every money bill since<br />
Federation has gone to the Senate for consideration by it.<br />
The Senate has voted on each such bill. The power to consider and<br />
vote cannot become atrophied. </p>
<p>How then can one say that the Senate must vote on a<br />
bill but cannot say no, or, for that matter, defer<br />
a decision?<br />
If a Senator seeks to vote against a bill, is his vote<br />
to be rejected? If not, how can the Senate be prevented<br />
from rejecting a bill if that is how the majority of<br />
Senators vote? Clearly, the Senate can also vote to defer<br />
any matter.<br />
It is interesting to note the recent judgement in Victoria<br />
versus the Commonwealth in the Petroleum and Minerals<br />
Authority Act. In this case of the three judges who<br />
commented on the Senate's powers, each clearly indicated<br />
that they were of the view that the Senate could reject any<br />
bills including money bills.<br />
As the Founding Fathers foresaw, it is of course only<br />
proper that the Senate should have power to refuse passage<br />
to any legislation, including money bills. The reasons<br />
will be appreciated by the State delegates to this Convention<br />
but I am sure they will bear with me if I reiterate them.<br />
The money power in the Senate is vital for two main reasons:<br />
1. It is a power which enables the removal of a<br />
disastrous government: and<br />
2. It provides important protection for the four less<br />
populous States against the possibility-that the<br />
taxpayers' money, raised uniformly per capita throughout<br />
Australia, might be heavily concentrated within the two<br />
larger States which have the numbers to dominate the<br />
Lower House.<br />
The Australian Constitution is a Federal constitution devised<br />
by representatives of the States. They insisted that the Senate<br />
as the States' House, have some control over Federal<br />
expenditure. The States reflect an important element of Australian political<br />
and social reality. Australia is to a considerable extent<br />
composed of great regions which are largely reflected in our<br />
State structure. The motion which would curtail the Senate<br />
powers blatantly ignores this Federal reality and is not<br />
in th interests of effective government. The Senate is an<br />
essentia-l element of our system of government and in the<br />
political cohesion of Australia.<br />
One of the Senate's functions is to safeguard the interests<br />
of the States. Another is to act as a house of review with the<br />
responsibility of expressing second opinions in relation to<br />
legislative and other proposals initiated in the House of<br />
Representatives. 3 </p>
<p>3.<br />
The existence of a house of review brings an element<br />
of moderation into government. The Senate plays a major<br />
role in the preservation of our Federal democracy.<br />
The Senate powers are checks and balances against any<br />
concentration of unbridled power in the executive government,<br />
or against any misus-e of power or mismanagement of a government.<br />
The Senate is elected from-the same body of electors as is<br />
the House of Representatives. It is a second democratic<br />
chamber with a particular role in our Federal system of<br />
goverment. With their commitments to-the basic concepts of Parliamentary<br />
government, it would have been inconceivable to the Founding<br />
Fathers that a governmetn might ignore the cardinal Parliamentary<br />
convention that a government unable to pass supply through the<br />
Parliament must go to an election. The blunt fact is<br />
a fact on which Parliamentary supremacy over the executive<br />
has always been founded that a government without money<br />
cannot rule.<br />
Sir Charles Court has suggested that the Constitution should<br />
be strengthened by providing an automatic procedure by<br />
which a failure to obtain supply can be resolved.<br />
The present provisions, while they have proved adequate in the<br />
event, provide great temptations to a government willing to<br />
ignore convention and law.<br />
Sir Charles sees the need for a procedure giving formal<br />
expression in the Constitution of the long standing convention<br />
that a government refused supply must face the people.<br />
We must also consider that fact that it was only fortuitous<br />
in November last that the necessary conditions existed at the time<br />
for a double dissolution pursuant to Section 57.<br />
Sir Charles has submitted that if the Senate refuses supply<br />
to the government and the Prime Minister is thus forced to<br />
seek an electi-on to resolve the issue,, then the Senate should<br />
itself also face the judgement of the people,<br />
that it should not simply be able to force the House of<br />
Representatives alone to face the people.<br />
The provision Sir Charles seeks, would of course, help to ensure<br />
that the Senate will continue to recognise that its power to<br />
refuse supply is a power not to be lightly exercised.<br />
There is great weight in Sir Charles Court's view that if the<br />
annuaA appropriation or supply bills fail to pass within thirty<br />
days, there should be a double dissolution of the Parliament<br />
and an election held and that the Constitution should provide<br />
for this sequence of events.<br />
The Parliament of our country includes the Senate. It is not<br />
without significance that those who seek to restrict the powers<br />
of the Senate are committed in party philosophy to the abolition<br />
of the Senate totally anc' of the states. The Government which I<br />
lead is not. On the contrary, we accept the Federal character<br />
of the Australian Constitution. We accept that the Government<br />
of Australia is the Crown, 1 the Senate and the House of I </p>
<p>4.<br />
Representatives.<br />
We believe that Federalism is, and ought to be,<br />
a living reality in our Governmental structure and that<br />
a Senate vested with the powers it has under the Constitution,<br />
is a vital element in a cohesive Federal system.<br />
The Senate's powers are deliberately grave. They should<br />
be gravely exercised.<br />
The provisions governing their exercise are capable of<br />
improvement. It is in the direction of improvement that<br />
we believe reform should be made.<br />
