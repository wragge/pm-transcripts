    <content><![CDATA[<p>I congratulate the 430 Australians recognised in the Australia Day Honours</p>
<p> List.</p>
<p>The year 2000 is the 25th anniversary of the creation of Australia's</p>
<p> own honours system. Over this quarter of a century a richly diverse group</p>
<p> of Australians, from all walks of life and all corners of the land, have</p>
<p> been honoured.</p>
<p>Since the inception of the Australian honours system in 1975 with the</p>
<p> Order of Australia as its keystone, new awards have been established,</p>
<p> allowing for example, recognition of the Defence Force, police, fire,</p>
<p> ambulance and emergency services, and civilians rendering humanitarian</p>
<p> service overseas.</p>
<p>Today, Australia has a comprehensive honours system.</p>
<p>Our system is inclusive and egalitarian and its independence and freedom</p>
<p> from patronage continue to ensure its wide acceptance. The honours system</p>
<p> has grown in esteem over twenty-five years as it reflects those values</p>
<p> Australians see as important Â good citizenship, selfless service</p>
<p> and bravery.</p>
<p>As we approach the centenary of federation, we can justifiably be proud</p>
<p> of those Australians, past and present, whose efforts in making Australia</p>
<p> the great country it is today, have been recognised by the nation.</p>
