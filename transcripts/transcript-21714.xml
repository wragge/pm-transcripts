    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, do you have any comment to make on the death of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. A few moments ago I telephoned Lady Flo Bjelke-Petersen to extend my personal condolences, that of my wife and our Government.  He made an enormous contribution to Queensland during his Premiership, it  was a period of great economic growth for the State. Successive Coalition and National Party governments in that State left the finances of Queensland in very good condition and the current Government and others enjoy the benefit of that.  He was certainly a very strong political figure and I extend my great condolences to his wife and family.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And by the time of his death the "Joh for PM" push was water under the bridge was it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I don't bear any grudges, there's no point in bearing grudges, life moves on, that's long years ago now and it's not something that I dwell on. I am pleased that the two Coalition parties have been so successfully together governing the nation and I know that's what people want, I know it's what Queenslanders want. I bear Joh no grudges and I sympathise with his family in their loss.</p>
