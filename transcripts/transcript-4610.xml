These measures are in addition to the normal core measures which<br />
are a standard part of the national disaster arrangements agreed to<br />
between the States and the Commonwealth. They have been developed<br />
as a result of experience with the fires in Western Victoria of<br />
1977.<br />
The Prime Minister and Acting Premier indicated that the disaster<br />
organisation had been working well and with great credit to everyone<br />
involved.<br />
They paid a special tribute to the outstanding work of the voluntary<br />
firefighters of the Country Fire Authority, without whose+<br />
efforts the damage, disaster and hardship would have been so much+<br />
greater, </p>
