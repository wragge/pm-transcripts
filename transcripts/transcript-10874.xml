    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister's Supermarket to Asia Council has strongly</p>
<p> endorsed the Government's responsiveness to the current economic</p>
<p> turmoil in Asia at its meeting in Canberra today.</p>
<p>Industry representatives expressed the very strong view that the extent</p>
<p> of Government support was appropriate and that Australia's standing</p>
<p> in the region had benefited significantly from our willingness to</p>
<p> stand by our neighbours in the bad times as well as the good.</p>
<p>Australia is one of only two countries to have participated in all</p>
<p> three IMF rescue packages for Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea.</p>
<p> Australia is helping by providing a currency swap to Thailand and</p>
<p> standby loans for South Korea and Indonesia in the context of IMF</p>
<p> packages for these three countries.</p>
<p>Australia has also agreed to provide insurance cover on the national</p>
<p> interest account for exports to South Korea and Indonesia. This both</p>
<p> supports our own farmers and exporters as well as helping the countries</p>
<p> concerned.</p>
<p>In particular, Australia is playing a very supportive role in helping</p>
<p> Indonesia tackle its economic problems and the social consequences</p>
<p> flowing from them.</p>
<p>The Council also noted that the region was in need of investment to</p>
<p> help it rebuild and restore living standards.</p>
<p>As a strong regional economy, Australia is in a situation to play</p>
<p> a role here. Australia has many companies which are experienced in</p>
<p> dealing with Asia, with the financial strength to play an increasing</p>
<p> role in investing in Asia.</p>
<p>This would be to the mutual benefit of both the Australian companies</p>
<p> and the Asian region.</p>
<p>The Supermarket to Asia Council urged Australian companies to examine</p>
<p> these possibilities carefully with a view to taking a more aggressive</p>
<p> approach in Asia. It is evident that our competitors are already looking</p>
<p> at such opportunities.</p>
