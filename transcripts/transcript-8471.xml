PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME HINSTR, TH% HON P. J. KEATING MO<br />
DOORSTOP MELBOURNE 19 MARCH 1992<br />
E&amp; O PROOF COPY<br />
PM1 Well, z thiNt that it is a very significant victory for<br />
the processes of democracy, for President de Klerk in<br />
particular, a nd we hope now that we will see a<br />
reconvening of CODESA, and that work will proceed to a<br />
new constitution, and I think upon those things<br />
happening, the rest of the world, the Commonwoalth In<br />
particular, -o look further at the sanctions.<br />
J: When do you think those sanctions realistically could be<br />
lifted?<br />
PM: I think as wea get through those processes, when we see a<br />
reconvaning of CODESA, to look at the working parties<br />
work, and to se then what adoptions there are of that<br />
work, I think that is the time. A lot of sanctions of<br />
course, have already been lifted, people to people<br />
sanctions and transport. But in the area of trade and<br />
finance I thLnk we will follow generally the<br />
Commonwealth's pliCy which was to watch what happens<br />
inside South Africa, and look at the movement towards a<br />
new constitution.<br />
J: Have you sent the message to Mr de Ilerk?<br />
PM: I will be youi.<br />
J: What will you be saying?<br />
PM: Well, congratulating him on his important win, that the<br />
referendum result will see which he has been pursuing.<br />
That is for a change and to be able to negotiate on<br />
behalf of the white community, to establish new<br />
constitutional arrangements. we will also be wat | iing<br />
for what is s; aid In South Africa about the events over<br />
the last 24 hours, and what they think from the ANC and<br />
other* about prospects for the future.<br />
0: Mr Keating you have been suggesting we should get away<br />
from the Commonwealth and not be caught by the British<br />
cringe. Why are we waiting for the Coaimonwealth to<br />
move? </p>
<p>2<br />
PM: Wel1 we are not waiting for th6 Commonwealth to move, it<br />
is matter that we have been part of the Commonwealth<br />
policy, an international policy, you can't read<br />
Commonwealth, Feed Britain as you know, for a very long<br />
period in this, Margaret Thatcher was the one not<br />
involved in this, but Australians * played a leading role<br />
in these negotiations and discussions over a<br />
considerable period of time.<br />
J: Senator Evans said he thought sanctionB could be lifted<br />
vary soon.<br />
PM: Well we will see what progress is made, and there is<br />
going to be, I think, a reconvening of C0DESA probably<br />
in early to mid April.<br />
J: Mr Keating Phil Cleary said he probably won't stanld as a<br />
candidate for Will&amp; now, where does that leve the ALP,<br />
and what a. re your chances for succeoe7<br />
PM: Wall our ch'ancp-s of success I think, are good Bi1l<br />
Kardamitais is a person of the community, a people<br />
person, somebody who truly reprsents this place, is<br />
interested in it, and while the going has been tough for<br />
the Labor Party in victoria, we hope we can win, but it<br />
will be decided by a small margin.<br />
3: But you won't have those preferences from Mr Clery..<br />
PM: Mr Cleary is entitled to make his own mind up about<br />
those things, but the Labor Party will campaign on its<br />
policy, whiLch has been to induce a recovery, to come out<br />
of the recession, induce a recovery, create jobs and<br />
emlployment and get Victoria working again. A very large<br />
part of the One Nation stat~ ieet was concentrated in<br />
Viatoria,. that is trying to rebuild the Victorian<br />
infrastructure, provide it with now industries like<br />
transport, like tourism, even though they exist here<br />
now, to develop them properly in Victoria, for ViLctoria<br />
to got its share of those things. And TAFS, we have<br />
just comes out of a TAFE collage, and we will make, as I<br />
said in thea St~ toment, TAFE one of the strong reeds of<br />
Australian education, And a significant proportion of<br />
that $ 750 mililion is going to be spent in Victoria.<br />
J: in airing t; he Delacretat letters hasn't there been a<br />
serious breach of parliamentary tradition?<br />
PM: No. Look the Liberal Party is entirely embarrassed<br />
about this. I mean, overnight apparently, Dr Howsonl end<br />
Mr Kroger had to have a meeting about whether they would<br />
pull their candidate out of the race. And they decided<br />
to laave him in. And I notice that Dr llewson said he is<br />
happy with Mr Kroger's report. That is, he is happy<br />
apparently with Mr Delacretez saying that social<br />
security should be cut by 30 per cent, that pension*<br />
ought to be, out by 30 per cent, that we ought to send<br />
6O/ ZO'd OZO* ON ~ I W: 3 </p>
<p>migrants home. that we shouldn't fund sheltered<br />
workahops for the disabled If they compete with any<br />
business of which their candidate Is involved. You<br />
know, I WRLs quite interested to see Dr Howson say he was<br />
happy with Mr Kroger'su report, and the report, of<br />
course, haid to comprehend the policies which their<br />
candidate has proposed.<br />
J; Some would say that airing the letters was a dirty<br />
trick.<br />
PM: Look, the thing is, I don't know where the letters came<br />
from. I was shown them by a Channel 10 journalist and I<br />
gave a comnunt on the spot. But the f act of the matter<br />
Ls, I canl understand the Liberal Party is embarrassed.<br />
They have got a candidate in the field who wants to cut<br />
social security payments by 30 per cent. Who wants to<br />
cut pensiolns back, who wants to send migrants home, who<br />
wants to cut payments to sheltered workshops.<br />
J: You don't thirik you have breached tradition at all?<br />
PMt: I haven't, no, anyway this is a public debate. I moan,<br />
what is the Liberal Party of raid of They are af raid of<br />
the policies of their candidate. I mean, here they are<br />
now fomenting, going on about privacy. This is a public<br />
debate. It iv a by-election. And they don't want the<br />
public to know that their candidate believes in a 30 per<br />
cent out in social security and sending migrants home.<br />
J: Mr iKeaving-, will you avcept that this by-election is a<br />
mini-referendum on the One Nation versus Fightbacc<br />
packagos?<br />
PM: I don't accept that, no, but a victory for the Liberal<br />
Party here, would certainly make the goods and services<br />
tax at 15 per cent impost on the lives of all<br />
Australians onie step closer. And that is why I think<br />
that the electors of Wills have a heavy responsibility<br />
here to make certain that that impost, that shift in our<br />
lifestyle which the OST would bring is rnot endorsed here<br />
in Wills.<br />
J: Housing finance figures show the big drop in housing<br />
finance approvals today, does that mean we should be<br />
reducing interest rates yet again?<br />
PM; I haven't seen the figure.<br />
J: They are down to 7 per cent, does that surprise you?<br />
PM: Well they move, they were up a month ago as I remember.<br />
They move but you can't take one month's figures on any<br />
Of thace things.<br />
Jt Mr Keating, after your strong statement of racism how do<br />
you feel about the call by Aboriginal leader in Brisbane<br />
today, Bob Weatherall, for a referendum?<br />
-CIA -Ale" AA </p>
<p>PM, I haven't seen it.<br />
3: to establish an Aboriginal nation in Australia....<br />
PMI I Just haven't seen it. We have got those<br />
reconciliation processes in place. I think they ore<br />
good processes. I think Australian'@ are conscientious<br />
about their relations and the tolerance which is part<br />
and parcel in this country in, I think, evidence to<br />
that. I mean, look inside this TAFE college, how many<br />
various people of different ethnic origins are here,<br />
part and parcel of this community. It just speaks for<br />
itself.<br />
J: Mr Keating, what is your reaction to Peter Reith's<br />
comments about Bernie Fraser in front of the<br />
international banking community that he is a political<br />
stuge?<br />
PM: Well I mea: n, this is the sort of irresponsibility of the<br />
Liberal Party trafficks in. One of the great pleasures<br />
of my professional life was working with Bob Johnston,<br />
the former Governor of the Reserve Bank who was<br />
appointed by John Howard. But the Liberals have no<br />
respect for conventions. They want to tear and rip at<br />
people and institutions. Mr Reith was saying a day or<br />
so ago that he wanted to knee cap the public service,<br />
now he wants to be disloyal to Australia and again in<br />
front of a large and significant audience of business<br />
people from South East Asia to say that their central<br />
bank is politically interfered with, which it isn't.<br />
And the Governor rebuked him instantly, apparently.<br />
J: You were the one who was saying the Reserve Bank was in<br />
your pocket?<br />
PM: No, I have said very clearly in the Parliament the<br />
balance between the Government's prerogatives and the<br />
Bank Board's prerogatives and the Reserve Bank Act. The<br />
Bank was supporting the policies of the 0overnauent at<br />
the time.<br />
J: One of your own cupporters, Mr Punch, has recently been<br />
very critical of the public service. Do you endorse<br />
that sort of sentiment?<br />
PM: The public service has served this Government<br />
particularly well as I think It has served most<br />
governments well. And to have someone like Mr Reith<br />
Crudely putting about essentially blatant untruths for<br />
sort of cro ss political purposea, but taking that<br />
crassness ' to a meeting of international bankers in<br />
irresponsible and disloyal to the country.<br />
J: What about Mr Punch's commente?<br />
an, sn'. n~ n'ON ) q: ZT Z6JPW6T: 131 </p>
<p>PM: He didn't talk in those terms. He didn't direct him<br />
remarks about the government.<br />
J: His point wall that the Government last year got captured<br />
by the publigz servie.<br />
PM: Well I don't believe that.<br />
J: It seems Mr Ca4rr has backed Mr Hewson's thoughts on<br />
immigration<br />
PM: I think we will just and it there.<br />
