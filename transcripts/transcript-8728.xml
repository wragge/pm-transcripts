PRIMIE MINISTER<br />
TRANSRIPT OF THE PRIME MIISUKIM'HEON'I1* J KEATING MP,<br />
DOORSTOP, BUNDABERGi 10 NOVEMBER 192<br />
IAOE PROO) F COPY<br />
J. Primc Mini tr, today was to be tho day, iA it to bc today?<br />
P) M: One of you asked earlier if rve got any plans to se Mr Hayden today in Brisbane<br />
no I haven f m goilng to ftY rom here to Western Australia. So those vents will<br />
take care of themselves.<br />
J: Therell be no election this year?<br />
PM: Th is is about Lh laL day you 4; ouhl do ii tbi year.<br />
1: Why not go now, Frinte inister, the pqIl arc gulting better cash day and each day<br />
there are new interest groups jumping al over the OST?<br />
PM: The GST is a Very ugty policy, there's no doubt about that, and I think that people<br />
now rcase ftl what the Ubra maiteted as a plan for Australiais not a plan at<br />
all it's a second-grade tax switch which makes ordinaty people pay ft iax and the<br />
bonefits go basically to hir income groups and to companies. And the other paut<br />
of thcir policy, industrial rlations, is basically to ty to take away from people<br />
thngs which they've put together over a ventuy Without negotiation. So thcre's not<br />
much there for the public with the iboal Party, and I think that's becomin<br />
apparet now. But all ihe gune, Mat can always be better understood and I think<br />
that peoplo are only jusi staning to undmrstand about the GST, and the longcr from<br />
our point of Niew the beter, and the Parliament of course can run to just about the<br />
middle of next year.<br />
3: Thc unerploo) ment figura rcelesed at te cnd of last wcek is not part of your<br />
thoughts on that? </p>

pM-We've had IlI plus numbers eauter in the year and I thik thiat People know tha<br />
therV is now employment Srowth but woi1lbrco growth is bigger them ate nun<br />
people joining the worltforce tha there ame new jobs bein crcaw-d, although we<br />
had 26,000 job stowth lost moth, vWhich was quite wton&amp;. It's going to iakv a<br />
while: to get unemploymecnt down but wo can only do it by getting growth, &amp; W<br />
&amp; pint I want to see the fica impact of the stimultoy spendin we~ Ve dons in the<br />
Budget and the One Nationi package actually bea its fruit in the economy,<br />
J Are you going to wait for unvmployment to drop somu?<br />
F'M: No, it's noi a natur or wailing the Paiiiament rns out in the middle of ncxt yar<br />
anyway, so it's not waiting for the rest of us. But agAhn, the longer the stirmulus has<br />
to work thu bottr<br />
J: So youl have more time to nako tiic coalition hurt over GST?<br />
PM: I think the longer it goe people betner understand the limitations. What have the<br />
Mberals got? They'v got a second quality tax switch from income to expenditure<br />
with a lot of peoplo getting hurt on the way Lhrou6jh, and thcyVe got a savage<br />
industrial relations policy which knock benefits off people. This is not the way<br />
Australia iihould go, it should go cooperatively, it should go with buuinvn and its<br />
workforec working together, as we're vA4in now under these enterprise agreements<br />
r* Mh across the country. That's the wisy to go. The American people have just<br />
voted 180 million of theM for the same sont of policy a policy of inclusion, a<br />
policy of keeping a country together, not splittiog it up and creatinig ufld-r-1Jasmm.<br />
So therefore, I thin the m~ ore that becomes ajpprent the better for us.<br />
3: With the polls going your way and the eroding of that support group of Hcwson<br />
and the Coalition, did you &amp; Mvto day any thought at all for an election this yea,<br />
and how sotiousky wo it*? I<br />
PM: Thcre's so much in thu public debate that of course thes thkng-got thought about.<br />
But again, in tis system the Prime Minster has the option of deding the<br />
termination of the Parliament, and thorethre If*$ something that one should in ti<br />
job kc-ep under notice. But my view is that the greater opportunity the ecnomy is<br />
given to grow the better, and the longer people get a rchance to size up the Liberal<br />
Party's, whai I t* i are, indequate policies the better for us.<br />
1: You'vospvken to as uane growem'exoitlivc in lbuuudabrg this mnorning. aniy good<br />
now'. Qt announoerncnts for tho supr industry?<br />
PM: I found it very intcrcstig and thcrc is always, again, the valuc of discusion and<br />
cooperation. Trying to govern by preom relasc from, Parliament House like the<br />
Liberal Party is now doing in Vietra or Mr Howard and Dr Hewson would do in<br />
Canberra, ih not the way to go. You do learn things by Ltg to people, you do<br />
get a better perspectivo. Now rm much better informed about this industry and </p>

what worries peoplo than I was two huw ago. An you k~ now, Brian Counzco is<br />
heading up a task force to rport to the Gowmrnent about the sugar industry. I<br />
didn't tink that one could just r~ eivo that without having ionie feel of the indwtzy<br />
mywscW So rye bwn very grateful for the opportunity. For those cawa-growcn<br />
who havv come along this morning, apprciatd their point of view, and the<br />
fact that theyVc put ft luidly, And 11nnotionally, just put it in a very dispassionat<br />
way which~ I think Is very uatW.<br />
1; Docs that mean the Taskorce Repo. 9 will got a favourable hcaring?<br />
PM: It mcanx at leaat whecnever Drian Loves it to uw, i going to mean more, well be<br />
able to decipher a lot of the things in it that I'm sure otherwise would<br />
straight over our shouldcr. It's given me a fbel of the industry, Ne hadl aswoiAtion.<br />
with some rural industies and Nov always kept a feel of tho land and tho<br />
winaytidz; nffal Industry, but this hima givion mc a Cood opportunity with sugar.<br />
3. Wero yout ablo to givc thorm any indiration on what you'll be doing in as far' as<br />
-tariff. go?<br />
PM: No, Weause I think that shoulid proport be left for consideration of the report by<br />
the Govrnent. But ther's no doubt that the industry doesi we tariffs as<br />
important, not just for defiecting imports but also In a dufacto price support for<br />
sales in the doniest Industry. At 1his stage7 it probably means more ini that sense<br />
than the ddeflcton of imnpots.<br />
WlNs 4 au cane-gxowcr xpwi sorn sort of decision on this mnatter?<br />
PM: Brian is going to rcport quit son hopefully before Cluisrnjas.<br />
3: Sa before the next election?<br />
PM%. Certainly.<br />
3: u. t ono other mAticr, rrinic Mirtister., any weddig wish or message for Timi<br />
Fischer today?<br />
PM: I10" n Tim planned his wedding around what he thought were election dates. I<br />
wish him the besbt. Ive met his fiancee and she's a very nicc Pesn I hope they<br />
have a vwy happy arariage.<br />
1: So I gucss he can go away and enijoy hiis honeyrrioun then?<br />
PM: Yes, I don't wish him well politically, but I do wish him well personally, he's a vay<br />
nice chap.<br />
ends </p>
