PRESENTATION OF PRESIDENTIAL UNITCITATION<br />
TO THE SI-XTH BATTALION, RAR<br />
TOWNSVILLE, QLD. 18 AUGUST 1968<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mvr. John Gorton<br />
The award which I have just presented on behalf of the<br />
President of the United States, and the streamer which I have just attached<br />
to the colours as a result of that award, is one which is not lightly given,<br />
and one which is rarely given outside the Armed Services of the United States<br />
itself. it has perhaps a special significance, something different<br />
from the awards which we in the tradition of the British and Australian<br />
armies give for service in the field, for it is an award not to an individual<br />
for some specific act of bravery, but to a team, to a unit, who together<br />
supporting each other in full comradeship, won the right to obtain the<br />
award. You have heard the words of the citation itself, and I.<br />
want you to form in your minds, those of you who were not there and 1 know<br />
that a number to whom I speak were there I want you to form in your<br />
minds the pictures that lie behind the words. The picture of a Company in<br />
the green gloom of a rubber plantation in Viet Nam, with tropic rain pouring<br />
down, curtaining the distance, causing discomfort to the individual, turning<br />
the ground underfoot into mud and into morass. And to imagine that<br />
Company pushing out from the ruins of a derelict village called Long Tan,<br />
and suddenly in those circumstances being attacked and engaged without<br />
warning with a storm of small arms, machine gun and mortar fire.<br />
To those who thus launched this attack on the company,<br />
with its platoons dispersed, it must have seemed as if the stage was set for<br />
another classical exposition of guerrilla warfare as written by the enemy's<br />
General Giap. For here was a small force by itself, able to be engaged with<br />
overwhelming battalion strength by the enemy, and encircled on three sides<br />
already, front and both flanks, shortly to be completely encircled from the<br />
rear as well. So it must have seemed that here again was a situation where<br />
one small force would be engaged by overwhelming enemy forces properly<br />
entrenched, properly prepared, and that that small force would be overrun,<br />
decimated and destroyed. But it did not turn out that way. Instead was a coolness w'Mch<br />
must reflect the greatest credit on the unit, on the training the unit received,<br />
and on the characters of those more than half of whom were National<br />
Servicemen who made up the unit. The attack was received, the perimeter<br />
was formied; thle attaclk1 was repulsed and repulsed until finally as other<br />
companies camne to the assistance of Company, and as such succour as<br />
could be given from the glowering skies was dropped from helicopters,<br />
finally the enemy withdrew, with over 200 dead, plus over 500 wounded.<br />
This in itself is a significant engagement, but over and above that, I think<br />
it has this significance. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
It adds to the rich fabric of tradition of the Australian<br />
Army which can look back over the years to those engagements in the First<br />
and Second World War, and in Korea ( where indeed another Presidential<br />
Unit Citation was wn by Australians). Such initiative, such courage, such<br />
coolness,' such steadfastness contributes to a tradition which, should the<br />
time come, will sustain the Army of the future in all its parts because that<br />
is what traditions built by armed forces do.<br />
It would be presumptuous of me, I think, to congratulate<br />
those men in Company now. Some of them were not in Company then,<br />
but they can wear this Presidential Citation while they serve in the Company.<br />
Those who were in Company on that day will be able to wear this proud<br />
insignia as long as they serve in the Army and wherever they serve.<br />
i merely wish to express, speaking I believe for the<br />
Australian nation, the admiration that we have for what then was done, And<br />
the belief we have that what was done will, should need recur, be repeated.<br />
It is my deep conviction that this addition to the annals of Australian arms<br />
will keep thenm furbished, bright and keen in the years ahead of this nation.<br />
And that is of great significance, for until the millennium arrives, we mpust<br />
rely, in the ultimate, on those men and women of Australia, coming from<br />
civilian pursuits, trained by those who give their lives to the Army, ready<br />
when necessary to defend this country.<br />
That is all I wish to say to you, concluding with thanlks<br />
from Australians for what you have done. </p>
