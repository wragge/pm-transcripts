4) AUSTRALIAL<br />
PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 245<br />
2 May 1974<br />
EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN<br />
The Australian Government warmly applauds the decision of the<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to bring the minimum wage for<br />
women under Federal awards up to the level of that determined for men.<br />
This is a significant step forward in the application of the<br />
principle of economic remuneration for work of equal value to the award<br />
wage structure of this country.<br />
The Labor Government has consistently supported the adoption of<br />
this basic human rights principle. This is an indication of the Labor<br />
Government's consistent support for wage justice for women. It supported<br />
the principle of equal pay for work of equal value when it sought<br />
successfully to re-open the National Wage and Equal Pay Cases immediately<br />
on coming to office in December 1972.<br />
It applied the principle immediately to its own female employees<br />
rather than phasing it in over two and a half years as allowed by the<br />
Commission in that case.<br />
It amended the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to delete the<br />
discriminatory reference to a minimum wage for adult males.<br />
It strongly supported the ACTU application for an equal minimum<br />
wage for women.<br />
Today's decision by the Commission is a further significant step<br />
to the Government's goal of ratifying the International Labor Organisation-A<br />
Equal Pay Convention ( No. 100) of 1951. There is now full compliance with<br />
the requirements of the Convention in those areas where the Australian<br />
Government can take action.<br />
Three States Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania have<br />
agreed to ratification, and consultation is continuing as a matter of<br />
urgency with the other three States to obtain their agreement to<br />
ratification without delay. Convention No. 100 is the only I. L. O.<br />
human rights convention which Australia has yet to ratify, and the<br />
Australian Government is treating its early ratification as a matter of<br />
top priority to confirm at the international level Australian acceptance<br />
of basic human rights for women.<br />
CANBERRA. A. C. T.<br />
BACKGROUND: The Prime Minister is expected to make a fuller comment<br />
on the wage decision later today. </p>
