New health services are just around the corner for the Redcliffe community as the construction of the new, purpose-built Redcliffe GP Super Clinic continues ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Minister for Health and Ageing Nicola Roxon today visited the Redcliff site to inspect progress, with construction on the third storey of the five-storey now underway.</p>
<p>When operational next year, the clinic will make it easier for Redcliffe locals to see and contact a doctor when they need to, a key commitment of the Gillard Labor Government's health reform agenda.</p>
<p>The clinic will bring together GPs, practice nurses, specialists and allied health professionals including a dietician, diabetes educator, physiotherapist, pharmacist, dentist and psychologist.</p>
<p>It will provide preventive and chronic disease management services addressing local health needs including diabetes, respiratory and heart diseases and mental health issues.</p>
<p>The Australian Government committed $5 million in funding in 2007 to the Redcliffe project.</p>
<p>A further $5 million was promised in the 2010 election to provide outreach services for aged care and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and specialist chronic disease clinics.</p>
<p>The government has provided $275 million over five years from 2007 to establish 36 GP Super Clinics around the nation.</p>
<p>8 of these are now open, including 2 in Queensland at Strathpine and Ipswich.</p>
<p>Construction has started at 16 sites, while services are being delivered prior to or during the construction at a further 8 sites nationwide.</p>
<p>In 2010, the Government committed an additional $370.2 million for a further 28 GP Super Clinics and upgrades to around 425 general practices, primary care and community health services, and Aboriginal Medical Services.</p>
