INDOIESIA/ vIALAYSIA RELATI ONS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, The Rt. Hon. Harold. Holt, M. P1<br />
The Australian Government warmly welcomes the hopeful<br />
signs of a favourable outcome of the talks between the<br />
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister, Tun Razak, and the Indonesian<br />
Foreign Minister, Mr. Adamr Malik,<br />
The talks were held in an atmosphere of genuine<br />
goodwill and friendship which offers the prospect of an end<br />
to confrontation. The Government has taken a close and<br />
informed interest in developments leading up to the meeting<br />
in Bangkok and is encouraged in the hope that peaceful<br />
relat ions will be fully restored between the two countries,<br />
The Government also welcomes, as another step in<br />
the establishment of friendly and co-operative regional<br />
relationships, the announcement of the Government of the<br />
Philippines that full diplomatic relations between Malaysia<br />
and the Philippines are about to be resumed. These are<br />
constructive developments.<br />
Cabinet yesterday reviewed these matters and, also,<br />
noted that Indonesia has initiated discussions with creditor<br />
countries on the problems of accumulatod extornal debts and<br />
economic rehabilitation, Australia itself, of course, is not<br />
a creditor of Indonesia. Ministers reaffirmed Australia's<br />
readiness to play a constructive part in assisting Indonesia<br />
with its economic problems. We considered that it was now<br />
timely for interested countries and institutions to discuss<br />
together and with Indonesia what might be done, In the<br />
meantime, we decided to give instructions to relevant<br />
Departments to develop projects which Australia could<br />
usefully undertake within the framework of our Colombo Plan<br />
aid. programmie.<br />
