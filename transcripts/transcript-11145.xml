    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE................................................................................................</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, the Treasurer and I have called this press conference</p>
<p> to announce that the Government and the Australian Democrats have</p>
<p> concluded an agreement which will secure the passage of the Government's</p>
<p> historic reforms to change and modernise and improve Australia's taxation</p>
<p> system. This is a truly historic moment in the economic modernisation</p>
<p> of Australia. We will have, after the passage of the legislation,</p>
<p> a new tax system for a new century.</p>
<p>The agreement follows lengthy discussions between the Treasurer and</p>
<p> myself on behalf of the Government and Senator Meg Lees and Senator</p>
<p> Andrew Murray on behalf of the Australian Democrats and at various</p>
<p> stages my colleagues, John Anderson and Robert Hill, were also involved.</p>
<p>All major elements of the original plan remain. The principal changes</p>
<p> are the exclusion of basic food and the restructuring of proposals</p>
<p> concerning diesel fuel in response to some strongly put views by the</p>
<p> Australian Democrats on environmental issues.</p>
<p>The full measure of the income tax cuts for middle Australia contained</p>
<p> in the original plan have been preserved. That means that 80 per cent</p>
<p> of Australian taxpayers will after the 1st of July next</p>
<p> year pay a marginal rate of income tax of no higher than 30 per cent.</p>
<p> It will represent a massive injection of incentive into middle Australia.</p>
<p> It will reward the hardworking backbone of the Australian nation which</p>
<p> represents those families in particular.</p>
<p>The family benefits have been maintained in full. The special savings</p>
<p> bonus for self-funded retirees will now be available to self-funded</p>
<p> retirees from the age of 55. The compensation arrangements under the</p>
<p> original plan have been strengthened. The generational reform of the</p>
<p> Commonwealth/State financial accord remains. The States will, as promised,</p>
<p> receive the full revenue from the GST. There has been some rescheduling</p>
<p> and deferral of a number of the indirect taxes. But the abolition,</p>
<p> of course, of the wholesale sales tax will go ahead and the deferral</p>
<p> will be in relation to the bank account debits tax, a small deferral</p>
<p> of six months in relation to the financial institutions duty, the</p>
<p> abolition of stamp duty on share transactions and bed taxes will go</p>
<p> ahead as announced in the ANTS package.</p>
<p>It was in this room on the 13th of August 1997 that I announced</p>
<p> that the Government would commence the reform process for the Australian</p>
<p> taxation system. And now and almost two years later that process is</p>
<p> in reach of finalisation. I set out then in August of 1997 five principles.</p>
<p> Every one of those principles has been met. There has been no increase</p>
<p> in the overall tax burden, there have been significant income tax</p>
<p> cuts particularly for Australians raising children. We have introduced</p>
<p> a broad-based indirect tax to replace the wholesales sales tax and</p>
<p> other indirect taxes. There has been very appropriate compensation</p>
<p> for those deserving of special consideration and there has been a</p>
<p> truly historic reform of Commonwealth/State financial relations.</p>
<p>I express an undisguised pleasure at today's outcome. It has been</p>
<p> a very long process. We have been able to achieve, I believe, 85 to</p>
<p> 90 per cent of the plan that was endorsed by the Australian people.</p>
<p> It was inevitable after the indication from Senator Harradine that</p>
<p> some adjustment would be needed. I believe nonetheless and the Government</p>
<p> believes very strongly that there are enormous benefits for the Australian</p>
<p> community as a result of the agreement that has been concluded today.</p>
<p>I would like to record my appreciation of the role adopted by the</p>
<p> Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Meg Lees. At all stages</p>
<p> I have found her forthright, honest, candid, adopting a sensible no</p>
<p> nonsense approach to the discussions, recognising differences where</p>
<p> they exist but seeking common ground where that has been possible</p>
<p> to achieve. And I do particularly want to record my appreciation for</p>
<p> the very constructive attitude that she has adopted.</p>
<p>I also want to record my particular appreciation, not only over the</p>
<p> past week but also over the last two years of the role played by the</p>
<p> Treasurer who is with me tonight. He has been a source of constant</p>
<p> support. He has displayed a great skill and mastery of the detail</p>
<p> of what after all has been the biggest and most complex economic reform</p>
<p> that any government has embraced for many decades.</p>
<p>I would also take the opportunity of recording my appreciation to</p>
<p> Arthur Sinodinos, my Chief of Staff who has played an invaluable role</p>
<p> over the last week in particular in liaison with the Australian Democrats;</p>
<p> Michael L'Estrange the head of the Cabinet Office and from my own</p>
<p> Department, Ian Watt and Patricia Scott. And I know that the Treasurer</p>
<p> will want to say something about the Treasury taskforce at the head</p>
<p> of his Department.</p>
<p>But it is a great breakthrough for Australia. The Australian Democrats</p>
<p> over the last week have displayed a commitment to the national interest.</p>
<p> And that is in stark contrast to the official opposition and that</p>
<p> is the Australian Labor Party who's vituperative negativity has confirmed</p>
<p> their continuing irrelevance from major policy debate in this country.</p>
<p> They stand condemned for that. I thank the Australian Democrats for</p>
<p> putting the national interests ahead of partisan political point scoring</p>
<p> and I believe that the Australian people will pay them true respect</p>
<p> and true regard.</p>
<p>But above all, this is a great outcome for middle Australia. They</p>
<p> have a big tax cut, they have a new tax system, they have a generational</p>
<p> change in Commonwealth/State financial relations and more importantly</p>
<p> they're facing the capacity of the political process to deliver enduring</p>
<p> outcomes across occasionally political divides has been restored in</p>
<p> a quite dramatic way.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, does the Senate need reforming so this doesn't happen</p>
<p> again?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, look, I don't have Senate reform on my mind.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will you bring the Parliament back early next week?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The understanding between us, which will be revealed in all the documentation</p>
<p> we'll make available, the understanding is that the Democrats</p>
<p> will support passage of the legislation by the 30th of</p>
<p> June. And that was the understanding at the beginning of the discussions,</p>
<p> and I should say that the measures you will see indicate a very strong</p>
<p> investment and commitment to environmental issues, which I believe</p>
<p> will receive very wide support in the Australian community. And there</p>
<p> has been a proper regard paid in the discussions that we've had</p>
<p> for the concerns of the Australian Democrats about elements of the</p>
<p> original package. But we have agreed that we will pass it by the 30th</p>
<p> of June.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is the compensation...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well given everything it's excellent. You have a look at it.</p>
<p> It's a world beater.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What does this mean for the budget forecasts? Will these be changed</p>
<p> by the package?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well obviously the budget is about next year. This doesn't start</p>
<p> until the 1st of July the following year. Peter may want</p>
<p> to something.</p>
<p>TREASURER:</p>
<p>In relation to that the budget for 1999-2000, which is the budget</p>
<p> we brought down two weeks ago, is essentially unchanged. The cost</p>
<p> of the measures, and the offsets will have some affect on the budget</p>
<p> position in the following year, 2000-2001. But it's imminently</p>
<p> affordable. It is of the order of the package which was put together</p>
<p> for Senator Harradine. And it is consistent with our strategy to keep</p>
<p> delivering surplus budgets while the Australian economy grows, and</p>
<p> to retire and reduce debt.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you and the Treasurer have previously said it wasn't</p>
<p> possible to remove from the tax. Why wasn't it possible before</p>
<p> and it's possible now?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well our preference always was to have the original package, and everything</p>
<p> I've said, and the Treasurer has said in relation to that is</p>
<p> entirely consistent with that position. But that became impossible</p>
<p> of achievement two weeks ago.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How are you going to fix the compliance nightmare...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there will be consultations with those involved, in applying</p>
<p> the tax on some of their items and not on others. There obviously</p>
<p> will be challenges in that area and we'll be consulting on that.</p>
<p> But in the end with these things you have to make a judgement. Is</p>
<p> it in the national interest to walk away because you don't get</p>
<p> 100%, or is it in the national interest to strive and persevere and</p>
<p> try and get 85-90%? Now the answer to that is overwhelmingly obvious.</p>
<p> And that is to do what we tried to do and we succeeded in doing, and</p>
<p> succeeded against the expectations of our political opponents who</p>
<p> are now marooned in their irrelevance.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is very pro environmental, and importantly it preserves benefits</p>
<p> for the bush contained in the last package. And in one area, namely</p>
<p> the extension of the concessional excise rate for off road purposes</p>
<p> to rail, it actually enhances the benefits for the bush.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So is it a better outcome than your original plan?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there are in environmental respects, the outcome is better. Obviously</p>
<p> in relation to the total uniformity of the application of the GST</p>
<p> you know our preference. I mean, we're not pretending that we</p>
<p> didn't have a preference for the former plan, we did. And that's</p>
<p> the one we won the election on and that's the one we would have</p>
<p> liked to have put through but we found out two weeks ago that we couldn't</p>
<p> do that and then we decided to talk to the Australian Democrats. And</p>
<p> that was the correct sequence in which to handle things.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is the outcome better, Prime Minister, on fairness in terms of the</p>
<p> original design of the compensation measures and relying heavily on</p>
<p> indirect taxes?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They were both fair, both fair.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is this fairer?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you can make a judgement about that, Paul. I certainly believe</p>
<p> if you have a package where your tax breaks for middle Australia and</p>
<p> low-income earners are preserved and you've enhanced the compensation,</p>
<p> I don't think anybody could argue that fairness has been neglected.</p>
<p> I think it's a very  I mean, the original package was fair</p>
<p> but this is super fair.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will you need to call the Premiers together now to discuss it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, you don't need a Premiers' Conference. I mean, I will</p>
<p> get in touch with the Premiers and there are a few, you know, changes</p>
<p>  their funding arrangements remain in tact. They still get the</p>
<p> same deal. I mean, they will love it because it will give them a growth</p>
<p> tax. And the sensible welfare people will love it too because this</p>
<p> Government has provided a long-term lifeline for the funding of welfare</p>
<p> in Australia and it's giving a growth tax to the States. No other</p>
<p> government has achieved that. And Premiers of both political persuasions</p>
<p> have been screaming for that for decades.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, given that you said the tax cuts will remain in their</p>
<p> entirety, how are you going to pay for removing food?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I said that those under 50,000, there's been a shaving</p>
<p> in relation to the 47 cent rate, instead of coming in at 75,000 will</p>
<p> come in at 60 and the 40 cent rate at 50 will go to 42 but everything</p>
<p> under 50 remains completely in tact. I think you ought to have a look</p>
<p> at the document. You'll see it all set out there.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you prepared to go through this sort of agony for every other</p>
<p> piece of your reform programme - industrial relations, sale of Telstra</p>
<p> - between now and the next election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Tonight is not agony. It's sweet political enjoyment of the most</p>
<p> exotic kind.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Would you [inaudible] thermometer?</p>
<p>TREASURER:</p>
<p>Look, the truth of the matter is that there'll be more complexity</p>
<p> in operating a GST which has exemption for some foods. And as we say</p>
<p> in our package, that will require additional costs. We think for the</p>
<p> Tax Office that will require about an extra $60 million a year. That</p>
<p> is one of the consequences of having a less comprehensive base so</p>
<p> we'll need more people to enforce it. But we still have time</p>
<p> to, respecting the principles that we've agreed to, to make sure</p>
<p> that the legislation is as simple as possible. We'll be trying</p>
<p> to draw clear lines of delineation in doing that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will you be setting [inaudible] with thermometers?</p>
<p>TREASURER:</p>
<p>Oh, I think they can probably use their fingers, you know, much less</p>
<p> scientific than thermometers.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, basic food, can you give a commitment or are you prepared</p>
<p> to say it's off the agenda permanently?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, this is it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Has anything else exempted from the GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, there's a few of those panadols and so forth.</p>
<p>TREASURER:</p>
<p>And there's some minor ones in relation to health, in relation</p>
<p> to what's on the S2 list but other than that the base is more</p>
<p> or less in tact.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible] how closely does that stick to the Irish model that the</p>
<p> Democrats put up?</p>
<p>TREASURER:</p>
<p>Reasonably closely.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Reasonably closely. I'm not saying it's a, it's not</p>
<p> a northern Irish model.</p>
<p>TREASURER:</p>
<p>Can I just interrupt there. The Prime Minister did advert earlier</p>
<p> and I would like to add my personal thanks to the Prime Minister for</p>
<p> the work he and his staff have done, to Senator Lees and Senator Murray</p>
<p> for their co-operation and particularly to my own staff, Phil Gaetjens</p>
<p> who headed-up the tax unit and the Treasury people, Greg Smith and</p>
<p> his team who've done a terrific job and they really have worked</p>
<p> incredibly hard. And the truth of the matter is, as the Prime Minister</p>
<p> says, 85 per cent of the biggest tax reform in Australia's history</p>
<p> is worth it and it sure beats zero per cent. And we come out of this</p>
<p> with tax reform which has eluded previous governments. We don't</p>
<p> come out with everything we wanted or everything we put to the Australian</p>
<p> people but 85 per cent of Australia's biggest tax reform ever</p>
<p> is something that I think we can all say was worth it for our country.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Costello, do you have a new-found respect for the Democrats economically?</p>
<p>TREASURER:</p>
<p>Look, I have a respect for the way in which they have sat down and</p>
<p> brought their minds to bear on this and I think done something important</p>
<p> for our country. And I just contrast that with the Labor Party. What</p>
<p> is the Labor Party's view on this? The Labor Party's view</p>
<p> on this is, let them fix the tax system and then we Labor will try</p>
<p> and take advantage of it. And the thing about the Democrats, where</p>
<p> they stand miles in front, the Australian Democrats, is they were</p>
<p> part of making it happen. They didn't want to just come along</p>
<p> and gratuitously fall into the benefits. They were prepared to be</p>
<p> part of making it happen and I pay tribute to them for doing that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, is there a mechanism to lock in the food exemption</p>
<p> for all time?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>This is it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, when did you decide that exempting food would be a fair</p>
<p> price to pay for...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>When did I decide? Well, I had hoped, Denis, until two weeks ago that</p>
<p> I could have got the original package. Now, when Brian Harradine said</p>
<p> that he could not I then set about talking to the Australian Democrats.</p>
<p> I mean, we did canvass with them whether they would be agreeable to</p>
<p> have a lower rate for food. That was one of the items. And they made</p>
<p> it clear that they wouldn't. I mean, I knew once we entered the</p>
<p> negotiation, like any negotiation, there had to be some give and take</p>
<p> on both sides. There had to be an acceptance on their part of the</p>
<p> centrality to our thinking and our goals of tax relief for middle</p>
<p> Australia. Equally, we knew how strongly they felt about basic food</p>
<p> and about a number of the environmental aspects of the package. And</p>
<p> it was an honourably brokered compromise and it delivered, as Peter</p>
<p> said, 85 to 90 per cent of what we set out to do. And given some of</p>
<p> the vagaries of the Australian parliamentary and electoral process,</p>
<p> in an area as complex and difficult and an area that has defeated</p>
<p> government after government on both sides of Australian politics for</p>
<p> the last 25 years, it's an extraordinary outcome. I mean, Ken</p>
<p> Asprey started the process in 1975 when he delivered his report to</p>
<p> the Fraser Government. That was just a year after I came into Parliament.</p>
<p> And at long last we have within grasp an historic reform of Australia's</p>
<p> taxation system. Now, it was worth toiling for, it was worth working</p>
<p> for. It wouldn't have been possible without the constructive</p>
<p> national interest approach of the Australian Democrats. It wouldn't</p>
<p> have been possible without all the effort and sweat of my colleague,</p>
<p> the Treasurer, and all of us over the last couple of years. But you</p>
<p> are in government to do good things for the country. You are in government</p>
<p> to make reforms to improve. Once you lose the zeal and the drive to</p>
<p> do that, and that applies both in opposition as in government, you</p>
<p> become an irrelevance and that has a message for the Australian Labor</p>
<p> Party. They are nowhere in this debate. What do they believe in? What</p>
<p> do they stand for? They just tried to drag things down, frustrate</p>
<p> and impede and destroy. And they're not an alternative government.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what assurance can you give regional Australian, Prime</p>
<p> Minister, that they won't be worse off under this version of</p>
<p> the package than they would have been under the original?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, they will be better off.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, have a look at it, Karen. I mean, to start with, the rail thing</p>
<p> is  well, you'll get it as soon as it's over </p>
<p> exactly, your deadline's much easier  the extension of</p>
<p> the off-road for rail is, for example, is something that wasn't</p>
<p> in the original package. Now, I think that's about it. I think</p>
<p> Senator Lees wants to have a talk to you. Thank you very, very much</p>
