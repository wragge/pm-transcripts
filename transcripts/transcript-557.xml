give as your impressions of bowtls ass in<br />
with your Oovumnt's peloy of growtk and<br />
prespority?<br />
S Veil IW've seem a little set as os as I<br />
al&amp; have like to have sem. I are of<br />

And what I libe about It is that at a tiwbefn<br />
peat stability ha been avUvved at so cheap<br />
In the eonsoe prios Iaiz for eighteeemn th,<br />
a sonsLdersbl degree of mmetary stabiity In<br />
Australla the produetion and export of seal<br />
and of irsa and steel don here have rises<br />
alInt fabdIOUle&amp; a. This 4amestrates somethiag<br />
that I as aftrquetly eig that stability is<br />
the 6endition of v t and not the onew of<br />
povth. In other wts a that stablity is<br />
not eta patisa but S is the sendition an whisb<br />
