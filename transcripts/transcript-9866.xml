TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
ADDRESS TO AN EMPLOYER BREAKFAST, CANTERBURYBANKSTOWN<br />
RUGBY LEAGUE FOOTBALL CLUB, BELMORE, SYDNEY,<br />
4 DECEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Thanks very much Peter ( Moore), I am delighted to be here with my fellow<br />
patron Kevin Stewart and my parliamentary colleagues Leo McLeay and<br />
Daryl Melham and Janice Crosic and with so many other people who are<br />
dedicated to this task, those associated with Canterbury-Bankstown Rugby<br />
League Football Club, Brendan Priest ( Deputy Secretary of DEET) who is<br />
with us today, Dave ( Rowland) and Shelly ( Taylor-Smith) who have just<br />
spoken and ladies and gentlemen. I am delighted to be here with Peter and<br />
George ( Paciullo) as Chairs of the Southern Sydney and South West Sydney<br />
Area Consultative Committees to be on this occasion asking some of you to<br />
be part of this very substantial endeavour which we are all undertaking.<br />
To see what we are doing in some sort of context let me just paint a little bit of<br />
scenery for you and say that 10 years ago only three young people in<br />
completed secondary school, Whatever hopes we have for this being a<br />
clever country or a intelligent country or what have you, obviously if seven<br />
out of 10 are not reaching secondary school standard, they can't obviously<br />
reach tertiary standard and other vocational standards. In that 10 years we<br />
have had a great revolution in Australian education. This year eight in 10 will<br />
have completed secondary school. So, we have gone from three in 10 to<br />
eight in 10. Ten years ago 40 per cent of young people then streamed<br />
themselves into university and we still have 40 per cent streaming<br />
themselves through, but you can imagine the increase in numbers required to<br />
stream 40 per cent of three in to compared to 40 per cent of eight in<br />
As a consequence, we have now added 60 per cent of places, more in fact in<br />
1983-84 we were at 360,000 university places and we are now at 610,000<br />
places. It has been a huge addition to the stock. So, we have got 40 per<br />
cent being trained in a tertiary way, but then the problem is with the other<br />
per cent and a lot of that 60 per cent was simply cascading into nothing.<br />
Dave said earlier, when you find that people turn up with a saw and a<br />
4 bU u e OU </p>
<p>2<br />
hammer and say they are carpenters, they were many people broadly<br />
untrained. As a country we are not going to make the grade with low paid<br />
jobs, with low paid labour. This is a relatively low labour cost country, but we<br />
are going to make it doing innovative and clever things. We are going to<br />
make it adding value, producing innovative products, getting into those export<br />
markets. It is not our job to be competing with mass low labour cost countries<br />
and yet that is the way we were set up in the post-war years, in the days of<br />
tariffs, the days of protection, the days of neglect of the education system.<br />
We in the Labor Party think one thing. That education is the great bridger,<br />
the great bridging thing through the social stratas, the great bridge to<br />
opportunity, the great liberator. It gives people a chance to break into all<br />
sorts of fields and all sorts of incomes and all sorts of opportunities and, of<br />
course, all sorts of excitement in their lives. So, education and training has<br />
been the focus of much of what we have been trying to do. Not long after I<br />
became Prime Minister we said in the One Nation statement, we put $ 1 billion<br />
into TAFE and set up a National Training Authority for the first time ever the<br />
Australian National Training Authority, ANTA to run a national TAFE<br />
system. We have now put $ 1.25 billion into TAFE. What are trying to do is<br />
to build vocational education beside the universities so when that 60 per cent<br />
cascade out of school Year 12 but don't go to university, they cascade into<br />
a competent vocational education system and they get certificates and they<br />
get accreditation across the country and we get the standing of TAFE up.<br />
That is what is basically on. But, you will still find quite a lot of young people,<br />
particularly in the past, who have left school at 15 or 16 and are untrained<br />
and have never had the opportunities to stay on to Year 12 or those who are<br />
on the way to staying on, but find they can't make it and drop out. In Working<br />
Nation which we did in 1994, what we have sought to do there is to pick up<br />
those people who are untrained or who are part of the long term unemployed.<br />
It is our aim in Working Nation not to let any young person under 18 drop out<br />
of the system. If they drop out, we either get them back in school or back into<br />
training with a job subsidy so that at least we get them back in the system<br />
and we don't let them drift by the wayside.<br />
So, the various programs we are building up are focussed on those things,<br />
such as the Youth Training Initiative which comes to mind and where we are<br />
now starting, as Dave suggested earlier, to take young people in Years 11<br />
and 12 and give them some out of school, on the job work experience and to<br />
give them some training in Years 11 and 12 for TAFE courses so that they<br />
pick up credits while at school for the TAFE course that they will then<br />
undertake. In other words, we start streaming them before they leave school.<br />
And so we overcome that problem that Dave Rowland mentioned, that they<br />
leave school and find they haven't got a job and they don't know what to do.<br />
In other words, we start focussing them while they are in Years 11 and 12.<br />
That Is the sort of broader educational and training picture. The labour<br />
market is a different thing again. The labour market is very much like a pool.<br />
You have people coming into It, staying in it for a while and then coming out<br />
of it into a job. But, the time in the pool very much reflects the state of the<br />

labour market and those who are untrained find that they are in the pool and<br />
they gradually drop out of sight and people are no longer interested in them.<br />
Yet the demands of the labour market are not so great as to be able to take<br />
them from the depths of the pool, they will just take up the ones who have<br />
come in at the beginning. So, the school leavers each year, women joining<br />
the labour market, migrants, they come into the pool and very quickly go out<br />
and get a job. But, the ones that have been in there longer in societies like<br />
Australia are, in the main, forgotten because there is not enough sucking<br />
power, if you like, in the labour market to take the new entrants plus the long<br />
term unemployed.<br />
What Working Nation is principally about, through the Job Compact, is to<br />
make sure that the ones who go out, that there is a high proportion of the<br />
long term unemployed in there. In other words, it is not just the ones who<br />
have been unemployed two or three weeks who come in and then go out, but<br />
the ones who have been long term unemployed, 18 months or two years or<br />
so. This is where we came up with this novel idea called the Job Compact.<br />
We actually case manage people, so we have one person who gets to know<br />
or 30 people, get to know what they did at school, what their personality is<br />
like, what their family situation is like, what accredited training they have had,<br />
what work experience they have had and what they might to. And, we give<br />
that case manager also a Jobstart subsidy in the main and then we say to<br />
that person we will case manage you and find you a job and we will subsidise<br />
that job with your employer, but you must take the job, you cannot knock the<br />
job back. In other words, there is a compact here that operates.<br />
Well, the success of the program to date is that we have reduced long term<br />
unemployment by 25 per cent In the last 18 months and that is an almighty<br />
change in a country like this because in the 1980s when we had massive<br />
employment growth, I think, the long term unemployed went down by<br />
something like eight or nine per cent over the whole period. Because once<br />
you are out, you stay out. The system just takes the new people up and that<br />
is the end of it. Now, part of the case management approach, developing a<br />
private market in case management and employment services which we are<br />
doing and finding jobs which we then subsidise, we are also trying to find<br />
traineeships and Jobstart places for longer term unemployed people and<br />
particularly for young people.<br />
This is where the Area Consultative Committees come in and where business<br />
comes in. We can't do this without the business community. This can only<br />
be done if the society as the country itself decides that it is not acceptable to<br />
have a stock of people young or not so young sitting around the labour<br />
market not in jobs, mouldering away, all their aspirations being dashed, their<br />
self esteem being dashed and this is a great problem. When people have<br />
gone for jobs and been knocked back, gone again and been knocked back,<br />
gone again and been knocked back, they think there is something wrong with<br />
them. Their esteem goes down and after a while they don't apply, they are<br />
psychologically out of it and that is why the work experience is so important.<br />
Again, the points you can see with those three young men who came on the<br />
stage earlier. Their experience is up and their confidence is up and they 01 P. 12/ 14 </p>

have done some things. I thi'nk Dave * Rowland mentioned the high retention<br />
rates. It is not when we stop the subsidy, the job stops. When we stop the<br />
subsidy, most stay in work. We have a very high success rate with the<br />
people who stay in work.<br />
What I think this breakfast is about, the reason we have got the Bullfrog on<br />
the job here and others is basically to bring people in and people have got<br />
experience. People like George who have been in public life and now in local<br />

interest in this' and it is not just you doing something, but you will get<br />
something in return. You will get a better trained person, you will get<br />
tremendous loyalty from them and you will end up with a better community<br />
around you, you will end up with a more fully employed community and a<br />
happier one, I think the story that Dave Rowland mentioned also of training<br />
on the job, the Government has also through our training policy, not simply<br />
trying to build a vocational educational system in TAFE, but we also want a<br />
private training market. So, when there is a big job or a big business and<br />
employers are short of skills we will subsidise the building of a specialist<br />
training facility in that plant or on that site and people with go through it. I<br />
think Dave said 170 people have been through his.<br />
We are doing this all around the country so we don't simply want a public<br />
sector monolith in TAFE, but we also want a private training market out there<br />
to train people on the job. So, let's say you are a small employer, it is the<br />
TAFE training that will matter or maybe some training on the job. If you are a<br />
larger employer, we could help you with a training facility and through DEET<br />
the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the CES we<br />
are able to pull people up under the case management system. If they have<br />
been unemployed 12 months or more we know about them, we know what<br />
they can do, we can give them a training place and the job start with you and<br />
we can give you the subsidy to get them up there and you will find there is a<br />
whole new source of employment open to you that wasn't opened to you in<br />
the past.<br />
In the end, we will be a better society, a happier one and a fairer one. Shelly<br />
talked about being Aussies and it is great to be an Aussie, well one of the<br />
great things about being an Aussie is the egalitarian sense of the country<br />
the sense of fairness and equality and fair play and it is a very equal country<br />
but will become less equal if a slice of the community are not in work. The<br />
way you keep that social cohesion is to give people a job opportunity and to<br />
give them a chance and to bring them up and to care about them.<br />
We set up Working Nation to say we care. We won't let people fall out of the<br />
system and stay at the bottom of that pool of unemployed people forgotten,<br />
but rather we will make sure they get their chance to get up into the stream<br />
again and back into the labour market. The difference will be a lot of harder<br />
hearted societies where they say, as the Republicans now say in the United<br />
States if you haven't got a job bad luck, bad luck, you are not going to get any<br />
unemployment benefits perpetually either. Or in a lot of other countries in<br />
Western Europe, well, they'll deal with young people on the streets, they'll<br />
TEL </p>
<p>ends EL z4 be C. U: HrOJu . uU, r i44/ 1-<br />
deal with crime, they'll deal -with all th'e attendant p. r oblems which come from<br />
that sort of approach, but in this country we have made a different choice. In<br />
1993 when we were returned to office we were returned on a program of<br />
getting the country back to work. We have 650,000 job growth since the<br />
election 1993. Our target was 500.000, we reached that in two years. Last<br />
year we had the biggest fall in unemployment in our history and even though<br />
we have got unemployment around 8.5 per cent, it is still too high. With<br />
Working Nation we have got a chance of getting it down. In the 1 980s when<br />
we had that huge employment growth, we could never get below 6.5 per cent<br />
and the reason was we never had a Working Nation program there and we<br />
never had people like you there to actually tap into it and go through the<br />
veneer into those long term unemployed people. So, when the labour market<br />
was really running flat chat we were starting to complement it by skills<br />
formation through migration. We were not getting into the long term<br />
unemployed. That is what Working Nation now allows us to do and, of<br />
course, the whole education system is producing a product which we didn't<br />
have in the 1980s.<br />
So, altogether whether it be the Government's employment programs or just<br />
the raw employment growth from the growth in the economy and that is the<br />
central thing, that raw demand for employment. But then who gets the jobs?<br />
And we know that they are going to go to school leavers, to women, to<br />
migrants, but they must also go to the longer term unemployed and that Is<br />
what this breakfast is about. It is about going out there, helping those<br />
people. It is about asking you people in business to think about it, not to do it<br />
out of some sense of ultrulsm, but in the sense that it is more efficient, we will<br />
have a more efficient labour market if those under utilised resources are not<br />
under utilised and you will end up with a better workforce yourself and you<br />
will live In a better society from the one you would otherwise live in.<br />
That is what we are doing and that is why we are here. So, let me again, take<br />
the chance of saying thank you to George and Peter, to the Area Chairs, and<br />
to congratulate you again on that target f * getting over 3000 training jobs by<br />
Christmas. We are already at 3400 as George told us. And that the training<br />
pays program gives us the opportunity to do those things and to reach out In<br />
a real way to those people who are feeling the despair and hopelessness of<br />
unemployment. When, in fact, we can do the compassionate and the efficient<br />
thing together, by picking them up, taking an interest in them, giving them a<br />
job and getting a better employee and a better business. So, that is what it is<br />
all about and I particularly thank our sports men and women for joining us<br />
today, Shelly and our own Terry Lamb and all of the other people who have<br />
come along, Mal ( Meninga) who is with us now, for coming today because<br />
you people are important models for people in their hope because when they<br />
are unemployed they look at you and they see, through your own dedication<br />
arnd energy, what you can do for yourself and it is always a reminder. So, to<br />
see you in this context is very nice indeed. Anyway, thank you all very much<br />
for coming. </p>
<p>TEL 6<br />
There is no reason why these strong employment rates can't stay up and if<br />
they stay up we have got to pull the longterm unemployed into it. We just<br />
can't take the new entrants the school leavers, women joining the workforce,<br />
or rejoining it, or migrants and just let the longterm unemployed people<br />
languish in the longterm pool of unemployment.<br />
So that is why your Area Consultative Committees matter. That is why the<br />
link to business matters because if we can't get you interested and to know<br />
that you do end up as this chap this morning was telling us about his<br />
construction company that Is getting a good class of trained people coming<br />
from longterm unemployed people. He is training them himself and then he<br />
knows that he has got tremendous loyalty from them in the firm and they are<br />
going on.<br />
Now I know in these sorts of ventures people say oh well, you know, there is<br />
a bit altruism required here. But it is not altruism. There is a bit of<br />
good-spiritedness about it. There is a bit of compassion about it. But there is<br />
also a lot of efficiency about it and good sense because, obviously, we will<br />
never make the sort of growth rates we can and enjoy the sort of incomes we<br />
expect if a large part of the country's resources are either under employed, or<br />
unemployed. So we are doing something for all of us if we get the longterm unemployed<br />
back to work and we are doing something particularly for them and we are<br />
making our society more cohesive.<br />
Now the other day, my Tory opponents jumped all over me for talking about<br />
the rates of deaths in California amongst young people. And I read this<br />
chilling statistic in, I think it was, lime magazine saying that in California<br />
more young people die of gun shot wounds than die of car accidents and that<br />
is pretty frightening. The main reason for that is because under these crazy<br />
American laws, they let people carry guns around. But it is also part of the<br />
social malaise of unemployment and disillusionment and rejection. It is all<br />
out there and we don't want to see any of that cancer coming into the<br />
Australian society. I mean some of that malaise has been there with the<br />
longterm unemployed and as a society we have got to get in and do<br />
something about it.<br />
Now Working Nation is the most valiant attempt ever been made in this<br />
country to deal with it and, as far as we know, while other countries similar<br />
countries are into labour market programs, none of them have quite got the<br />
Innovation of Working Nation, we don't think, and we think we are a real show<br />
of building on that 25 per cent reduction in longterm unemployment since it<br />
was introduced and getting that down and making a very big difference into<br />
the way Australia functions and the fact that people can share in it.<br />
Now the Government has taken a very big interest in regional Australia<br />
because now in some of the regions they are growing much faster than the<br />
capital cities. A lot of the employment opportunities are in some of the<br />
TEL Dec .95 0 j1 NO. JJ0i F .08/ 1: </p>
<p>i EL 7<br />
regions. We are trying to get regio'hal leadership, we are trying to give<br />
regions focus and, at the same time, we are trying, in that, to get a focus on<br />
longterm unemployment which is prone to be more difficult in the regions than<br />
in the cities. And we are very pleased that so many of you are from the<br />
regions of Australia and you have seen yourself committed and interested<br />
enough to be in it with us, to do something about it. Because the whole thing<br />
about One Nation is that we think of ourselves as one nation when we are all<br />
pulling together and it is not just programs for the capital cities, but for the<br />
provincial cities and the towns and the regions around the country as well.<br />
So I would like to take this opportunity of thanking you for your interest in<br />
work and training and I think we all know that when we give these people<br />
training and work experience, even with a job subsidy, when the job subsidy<br />
finishes the retention rates we are getting are so encouraging that people are<br />
staying in the jobs and going on.<br />
So we may well be able to fill those jobs which the labour market is requiring<br />
us to fill with employment growth. The main thing is we fill them by taking a<br />
good share of the longterm unemployed up into them as well. So we have<br />
some real fairness operating in the system and we have the sort of country<br />
that we have always believed Australia should be.<br />
Anyway thank you very much for coming along today. Simon and I are<br />
delighted with the progress of it. Simon has done a great job with Working<br />
Nation, as Minister. He has got a great Secretary in Derek Volker and a<br />
great team in DEET. We are absolutely delighted with it and pleased as<br />
punch you can be involved with us.<br />
