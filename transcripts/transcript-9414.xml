    <content><![CDATA[<p>K<br />.4<br />PRIME MINISTER<br />"* PLEASE CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY"*<br />SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS ASSOCIATION<br />SYDNEY, FRIDAY 11 NOVEMBER 1994<br />I am a well known enthusiast for APEC but when I first started talking about it,<br />it wasn't an acronym which sprang readily to the lips of most Australians.<br />But things are changing. I was very pleased recently to come across the first<br />reference to APEC I had seen in an Australian newspaper cartoon.<br />Once the cartoonists get hold of something you can be pretty sure it is sailing<br />down the mainstream of public consciousness.</p>
<p><br />I am glad that is happening, because it is where APEC deserves to be.<br />It has always seemed to me to be the right idea for Australia, the right idea for<br />the region and the right idea for the world at large.</p>
<p><br />It is the right idea for Australia because it defines a region which is critical to<br />us. It includes the economies to which we sell 75 per cent of all we export,<br />and our key bilateral relationships on both sides of the Pacific.</p>
<p><br />It is the right idea for the region because it encompasses its most important<br />trade and economic links. It helps lock in United States economic and<br />commercial interest in the region which in turn helps to ensure US strategic<br />engagement. It provides a framework to help contain or manage competition<br />between China, Japan and the United States. And it gives the smaller<br />countries a greater say in the nature and shape of regional trading<br />arrangements. It is the right idea for the world because it links both sides of the Pacific in a<br />co-operative endeavour and helps to prevent the division of the post-Cold<br />War world into three competing blocs.<br />And it is the right idea because it is not intended to be, and will not become, a<br />capital " C"-type Community which closes itself against the world, but a small<br />11c" community of common interests, seeking prosperity with its international<br />partners through trade liberalisation rather than closed barriers and<br />subsidies.</p>
<p>One of APEC's great advantages, which we are seeing fully in play in<br />President Soeharto's proposals for Bogor, is that it spans not only both sides<br />of the Pacific but the full spectrum of the world's economies from the most<br />industrialised and developed countries, through the dynamic Asian tigers, to<br />developing economies like Indonesia.<br />So when APEC talks about trade and economic issues, when it frames its<br />actions, it has to take into account the full complexity of eighteen economies,<br />all looking for growth and liberalisation but at different stages of development.<br />That is important, because it is the way the global economy is going. Cooperation<br />across different levels of development is the way we will have to<br />address these trade and economic issues in future. In this sense, APEC is a<br />template. On Sunday, I will be leaving for Jakarta to attend the second informal meeting<br />of APEC leaders. As I said recently, it promises to be the most significant<br />meeting to have been held in Southeast Asia since the Bandung meeting<br />established the Non-Aligned Movement in 1955.<br />When I first suggested, less than three years ago, that APEC leaders should<br />get together to discuss the challenges facing the region, I hoped in this way<br />to give the organisation some political horsepower and help it deliver some<br />real benefits to business.<br />I must say I am well and truly pleased to be attending the second such<br />meeting in November 1994. That it is happening is a reflection of the real<br />benefit regional economies have seen in the APEC process.<br />The meeting at Bogor will include the leaders of eighteen economies<br />representing half the world's production and nearly half its trade. And they<br />are growing fast.<br />By 2000 these same economies will account for almost 60 per cent of world<br />GDP and 55 per cent of world trade.<br />By 2020, seven of them China, the United States, Japan, Indonesia,<br />Thailand, Chinese Taipei and Korea will be among the world's ten largest<br />economies. So what happens in APEC can have a long-lasting impact on how the world<br />operates into the next century.<br />As in Seattle, this will be an informal meeting. Ministers and officials are<br />meeting over the next few days to sort out APEC's formal work program. A lot<br />of valuable work will be done there.<br />But the leaders, when they get together on Tuesday under President<br />Soeharto's chairmanship, will have no formal agenda, no set texts. We will<br />be alone in a room for several hours, without advisers, talking about our own</p>
<p>economic problems and opportunities and what we can do collectively about<br />them. No wonder the beads of sweat are breaking out on the brows of bureaucrats<br />all around the region.<br />This is an unusual model for an international gathering, and as we showed<br />last year in Seattle, it can deliver creative results.<br />We will be coming to Bogor with a real sense that APEC is beginning to<br />coalesce. In the year since Seattle a lot of progress has been made on the initiatives we<br />set in train then.<br />Most of the recent press coverage of APEC has focussed on the trade<br />liberalisation debate. This is understandable. It is a large and important<br />issue. But it is also important not to forget the progress being made in<br />cleaning out the region's trade arteries by removing administrative<br />impediments to the flow of goods and services the trade facilitation agenda.<br />This is important to business and will become more important as tariff levels<br />decline. Differences in standards can add between five and ten per cent to<br />the cost of entering a particular market.<br />So it is good to see the work on standards going well. We are now moving<br />into the stage of negotiating Mutual Recognition Agreements between APEC<br />economies. An APEC network of these agreements will mean that any product tested<br />once will be accepted as having been tested everywhere. And standards<br />throughout the APEC economies will be progressively harmonised with<br />international standards<br />We have also made good progress on a set of APEC investment principles.<br />Investment is an urgent issue for the APEC economies. Foreign investment<br />has been one of the driving forces behind APEC's growth.<br />But if that growth is to continue, it is critical that foreign investment to and<br />within APEC keeps flowing. For example, over the next decade East Asia will<br />require an estimated US$ 1.7 trillion for investment in infrastructure alone.<br />Much of that will have to come from foreign investment.<br />At the same time, we will be seeing intense competition for investment funds<br />from Eastern Europe and other economies outside APEC.<br />So there is a growing appreciation that to keep investment coming, the APEC<br />economies need more open and transparent investment regimes. The<br />reforms which Indonesia introduced in July reflect this recognition.</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to announce at Bogor a set of non-binding APEC<br />investment principles. That will enable us to take forward the dialogue within<br />APEC about how we can improve our investment regimes.<br />It is also worth noting that the first meeting of APEC Finance Ministers was<br />held earlier this year. As the Asia-Pacific becomes the world's new centre of<br />economic gravity the economic dialogue instituted at this meeting will be<br />increasingly important.<br />APEC is also building people-to-people links. We decided at Seattle to<br />establish a network of APEC study centres throughout the region.<br />I am happy to announce that we have decided to establish the Australian<br />study centre in a joint operation between the University of New South Wales<br />and Monash University in Melbourne.<br />These two universities not only have a high standard of academic research<br />on APEC-related issues but they will be pursuing some innovative ideas for<br />educating Australians about APEC for example, through Monash's<br />experience with the Open Learning scheme.<br />APEC's progress in these and other areas, such as small and medium<br />enterprises, has been useful and welcome.<br />But I have been convinced of the need to lift the APEC debate to a higher<br />level. If we are to maintain the region's remarkable growth rates we need to<br />tackle the task of bringing down tariffs and non-tariff barriers for goods and<br />services. President Soeharto shares this view. He has suggested that APEC set at the<br />Bogor meeting a far-reaching objective of free trade in APEC by a specific<br />date and on a GATT-consistent basis.<br />I have spoken with President Soeharto several times during the year and I<br />know how committed he is to achieving this goal. He knows from Indonesia's<br />experience just what the benefits of liberalisation can be.<br />I told him recently that my support for him on this is total and unqualified.<br />Because this is a remarkable development.<br />Past pressure for trade liberalisation has come from the industrialised<br />countries. They have set the agenda. They have put the pressure on.<br />Now, for the first time, a developing country has said we should commit<br />ourselves to a free trade outcome. It is vital that we respond positively to this<br />challenge. Over the next few days something like a sense of awe would not be<br />inappropriate such is the boldness of what is being proposed.</p>
<p>This is no simple task to get down all barriers to goods and services in the<br />region by a defined date.<br />It is an extraordinarily difficult thing for most Governments to contemplate.<br />The benefits of freer trade are clear but they are spread throughout our<br />economies. The impact on special interest groups and protected sectors<br />offers immediate pain. This is a problem we were very familiar with in<br />Australia as we cut our own levels of protection.<br />So as Bogor has got closer, and the scale of the proposals has become<br />clearer, it is little wonder that around the region a slight clearing of the throat<br />has turned into the odd nervous cough and then, in a few cases, into<br />significant breathing difficulties.<br />I have been in touch with leaders from most APEC economies over the past<br />few months and I hope we will get the commitment we are looking for at<br />Bogor, but I am certainly not taking it for granted.<br />For Australia, the important thing is to get the process going. The end-date<br />matters less, so long as it is not too distant. Because, as we have seen in<br />Australia, once the decision is made, business will begin to incorporate it into<br />its planning, and things will begin to move.<br />No one is expecting fine detail out of the meeting in Bogor.<br />Even if we reach agreement on a free trade outcome, some very important<br />questions will remain: What form will the liberalisation take? What coverage<br />will it have? Will it extend to all GATT members under an MFN arrangement<br />or will it be preferential?<br />I don't underestimate the importance of these questions or the difficulties in<br />filling in the gaps. Some long and arduous talking lies ahead.<br />But getting the political commitment by leaders is the immediate requirement.<br />That decision would set the region's economic agenda for the next twenty<br />years. None of what APEC is doing should be seen as a threat to the global system.<br />I have said all along that anything APEC does should be GATT-consistent<br />and equally importantly that it should contribute to global trade<br />liberalisation.<br />We understand fully that the growth of the Asia-Pacific economies has been<br />underpinned by the open multilateral trading system, which itself has turned<br />largely on the United States's willingness to lead the world in trade<br />liberalisation. Now it is the Asia-Pacific's turn to lead the way. This is where the growth is.<br />And despite strong liberalising moves, protection remains high in many East<br />Asian economies, offering them great scope to benefit from liberalisation.</p>
<p>Our ultimate objective, and our best interest, lies in global free trade.<br />But there is no enthusiasm now for a new global and comprehensive round.<br />We have to look for other strategies, and APEC is the best we've got.<br />APEC trade liberalisation will lock in an outward-looking sense of regionalism<br />and will reinforce global trade liberalisation.<br />An APEC-wide approach would bolster the economic gains we would get from<br />unilateral trade liberalisation, and it would reduce the political costs<br />because governments will be able to point to new opportunities opened up by<br />trade liberalisation elsewhere in the region.<br />The benefits of APEC trade liberalisation for Australia and the region would<br />be enormous. Economic modelling tends to understate the gains because it<br />does not capture the full effects on competitiveness and productivity.<br />But initial Australian modelling work shows that, while APEC members do well<br />out of the Uruguay Round, they would do even better if APEC was to<br />embrace full free trade. The annual gain to APEC aggregate national income<br />from the Round is around $ 112 billion by 2002 when the Round effects have<br />flowed through fully. But this rises to $ 366 billion by 2010 if APEC free trade<br />is achieved by then.<br />Under APEC free trade, Australia's real output would rise by an estimated 3.8<br />per cent and real national income by 1.2 per cent or $ 6.8 billion annually<br />This would more than double the projected real income gains for Australia<br />from the Uruguay Round.<br />The scale of APEC's advantages to Australia is something which, not<br />surprisingly, few Australians have yet appreciated.<br />But already three-quarters of our exports go to APEC, and 31 per cent of<br />these are manufactured exports. Over the next two years, increased exports<br />to APEC members are expected to create 70,000 new jobs in Australia.<br />For Australian business, APEC trade liberalisation is good news, because<br />Australia is already so far down the path towards free trade.<br />We have eliminated quotas and, by 2000, average trade weighted tariffs will<br />have fallen to 2.9 per cent. Motor vehicle and textiles, clothing and footwear<br />tariffs will be the only stand-outs.<br />Clearly, going further would be in our interests if other APEC economies also<br />liberalised. When and at what rate we did so would be a matter for<br />discussion after Bogor.<br />Australia's agricultural and minerals exports would flourish in open regional<br />markets. But our manufactures and service industries would also be well-</p>
<p>7<br />placed to take advantage of the opportunities that would open up. The<br />decade of trade liberalisation has made them much more competitive. Our<br />exports of elaborately transformed manufactures to APEC have been growing<br />at 18 per cent a year since 1988-89.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p>The future trade and economic agenda will be the core of our discussions at<br />Bogor. But the meeting has other less obvious advantages<br />It facilitates contacts between leaders which would otherwise be difficult to<br />arrange -either for political reasons, as we saw in Seattle last year when<br />President Jiang Zemin met President Clinton, or for geographic reasons.<br />For example, in Sydney tomorrow I will meet President Frei of Chile on his<br />way to Jakarta. After the meeting President Kim Young Sam of Korea will<br />visit Australia.</p>
<p>And at the meeting itself a lot of bilateral work will be done. I will be having<br />separate meetings with President Soeharto, President Jiang Zemin. President<br />Clinton, President Ramos, Prime Minister Chretien, Prime Minister Chuan<br />and Prime Minister Bolger.<br />I will have opportunities to talk informally to the others as well.<br />And this sort of thing is multiplied eighteen different ways.<br />Ease of communications between political leaders is important and the<br />dynamics of international relations within the Asia-Pacific have, in my view.<br />been changed fundamentally by APEC. The leaders meetings offer<br />opportunities for contact which can cut through problems and resolve<br />uncertainties. And, as we are seeing with the visits here of President Frei<br />and President Kim, they can facilitate contacts between our business people.<br />So I don't doubt that this will be two and a half days well spent.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p>Today, of course, is Remembrance Day.</p>
<p>There is something appropriate about the fact that I am talking to you about<br />the future of the Asia-Pacific on the 11 th of November, when we remember<br />the sacrifice of those Australians, and the countless millions from other<br />nations, who fought and died in the wars which shaped this century and<br />which, for better and worse, shaped Australia's history.<br />What comes next the legacy of peace, security and prosperity, we owe to<br />our past will in no small way be formed by what happens in Bogor over the<br />next few days.<br />ends</p>
