EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COMMISSION<br />
SYDNEY 31 JANUARY 1986<br />
MY COLLEAGUE THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL, THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF NEW<br />
SOUTH WALES, COMMISSION MEMBERS AND MEMBERS OF ADVISORY<br />
COMMITTEES, THE CANADIAN HIGH COMMISSIONER MR SCHREYER,<br />
DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.<br />
IT IS WITH PLEASURE THAT I JOIN YOU FOR THE OPENING OF THE<br />
CONSTITUTIONAL COMMISSION. THE COMMISSION IS UNIQUE IN<br />
AUSTRALIA'S HISTORY OF CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM AND BRINGS WITH<br />
ITS ESTABLISHMENT NEW HOPE FOR THE RENEWAL OF OUR<br />
CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK.<br />
THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM, OF COURSE, IS THAT CONSTITUTIONAL<br />
REFORM IN AUSTRALIA IS TOO HARD. THE CONSTITUTION LAYS DOWN<br />
AN ONEROUS PROCEDURE FOR ITS AMENDMENT: AFTER PASSING<br />
THROUGH PARLIAMENT A PROPOSAL MUST OBTAIN A MAJORITY OF<br />
VOTES THROUGHOUT THE NATION AND A MAJORITY OF VOTES IN A<br />
MAJORITY OF STATES. EXPERIENCE WITH ATTEMPTED AMENDMENTS<br />
SINCE FEDERATION HAS BEEN LESS THAN HEARTENING. THERE IS A<br />
LONG HISTORY OF FAILED REFERENDUMS, WITH ONLY 8 OUT OF 38<br />
PROPOSALS BEING SUCCESSFUL. THIS IS AN 80% FAILURE RATE.<br />
OUR OWN RELATIVELY RECENT EXPERIENCE WITH REFERENDUMS FALLS<br />
INTO THE SAME PATTERN. FOR MANY OF US IN GOVERNMENT IT WAS<br />
AN OCCASION TO BE REMINDED OF THE FRUSTRATION AND<br />
DISAPPOINTMENT WHICH HAS BEEN THE LOT OF THOSE WHO HAVE HAD<br />
AN EXTENDED INVOLVEMENT IN THE AREA OF CONSTITUTIONAL<br />
REFORM. LIKE THEM, WE HAVE HAD TO STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN<br />
ENTHUSIASM AND VISION FOR THE PROSPECTS OF CONSTITUTIONAL<br />
CHANGE. MANY COMMENTATORS, I FEEL SURE, IMAGINED THAT IT<br />
WOULD BE A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE THIS<br />
GOVERNMENT AGAIN VENTURED INTO . THE AREA OF CONSTITUTIONAL<br />
REVIEW. </p>
<p>2.<br />
THE FACT THAT THIS HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE IS DUE IN NO SMALL<br />
PART TO THE VISION OF THE PRESENT ATTORNEY-GENERAL, AND AS A<br />
RESULT WE ARE TODAY MARKING THE COMMENCEMENT OF A BODY WHICH<br />
GIVES NEW HOPE FOR THE SENSIBLE REVISION OF OUR<br />
CONSTITUTION.<br />
NO DOUBT SOME OBSERVERS WILL THINK THAT THERE IS A TOUCH OF<br />
THE HEROIC ABOUT THIS COMMISSION'S TASK. BUT, WHATEVER THE<br />
EVENTUAL RESULTS OF THIS COMMISSION'S ENDEAVOURS,' I AM<br />
CONVINCED THAT IT IS NOT-' TILTING AT WINDMILLS'. THE TASK<br />
FACING THE COMMISSION, THOUGH DAUNTING, IS ROOTED IN<br />
REALITY. IN THEFIRST PLACE IT IS MY VIEW THAT CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE<br />
IS ACHIEVABLE. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE EXTREMELY MODEST<br />
ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE PREVIOUS 85 YEARS CAN BE CONSIDERED AN<br />
ACCURATE REFLECTION OF THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY'S CAPACITY<br />
FOR CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM. OUR RECORD OF UNSUCCESSFUL<br />
REFERENDUMS DOES NOT MEAN THAT AUSTRALIANS ARE INCAPABLE OF<br />
ACHIEVING FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE BUT, RATHER, THAT SUCH CHANGES<br />
MUST BE CLEARLY EXPLAINED TO THE PEOPLE AND MUST ALSO BE<br />
DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION WITH THE PEOPLE.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNIZES THE REALITY THAT AUSTRALIANS NEED<br />
TO BE LEAD TO CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM NOT PUSHED.<br />
THE'GOVERNMENT ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT AUSTRALIANS WILL NOT<br />
SUPPORT CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM IF THEY SUSPECT THAT SUCH<br />
PROPOSALS ARE BEING ADVANCED FOR PARTISAN POLITICAL<br />
PURPOSES.<br />
THE COMMISSION REPRESENTS A NEW APPROACH TO REFORM , OF THE<br />
CONSTITUTION.' IN CONTRAST TO SOME PREVIOUS-EFFORTS IT IS A<br />
VERY PRACTICAL UNDERTAKING'WHICH WILL GO OUTSIDE THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH AND STATE PARLIAMENTS TO MAKE USE OF THE<br />
TALENTS AND RESOURCES OF LEADING AUSTRALIANS FROM MANY<br />
FIELDS. THE WIDE RANGE OF COMMUNITY INTERESTS AND TALENT<br />
THAT IS REPRESENTED IN THE COMMISSION AND ITS ADVISORY<br />
COMMITTEES SHOULD ENSURE THAT PROPOSALS ARE EXAMINED FROM A<br />
VARIETY OF PERSPECTIVES THAT ARE OF CONCERN TO AUSTRALIANS.<br />
IT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S HOPE THAT THE COMMISSION AND ITS<br />
COMMITTEES WILL OPERATE WITH-THE MAXIMUM DEGREE OF<br />
INFORMALITY AND IN A WAY THAT MAXIMIZES PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT<br />
AND INTEREST IN POSSIBLE ALTERATIONS TO THE CONSTITUTION.<br />
IN THIS WAY THE EFFORTS OF THIS GROUP OF ACTIVE AND<br />
ARTICULATE AUSTRALIANS MAY SERVE TO DEMYSTIFY THE<br />
CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESSES AND ENCOURAGE THOUGHTFUL<br />
CONSIDERATION BY ORDINARY AUSTRALIANS OF THE SHAPE OF OUR<br />
CONSTITUTION. THIS WOULD CLEAR THE WAY FOR THE BUILDING OF<br />
THE KIND OF CONSENSUS THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY THAT IS<br />
NECESSARY IF SUCCESS IS TO BE ACHIEVED.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONSCIOUSLY SOUGHT TO SET UP THE<br />
COMMISSION AND ADVISORY COMMITTEES ON A NON-PARTISAN BASIS<br />
AND IS HOPEFUL THAT THIS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE FOSTERING OF<br />
AN AGREED VIEW AMONG THOSE IN AUSTRALIAN POLITICS WHO GIVE<br />
LEADERSHIP ON SUCH MATTERS TO THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE. </p>
<p>AS A GOVERNMENT WE SEEK REFORM WHICH IS REAL, DURABLE AND<br />
ACHIEVABLE WITHOUT BEING PARTISAN. AND AS GOVERNMENT WE<br />
WILL SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF THE COMMISSION TO BRING ABOUT<br />
THIS OUTCOME.<br />
QUITE APART FROM CONSIDERATIONS OF ACHIEVABILITY, THERE IS<br />
ALSO THE WORTH OF THE EXERCISE IN ITSELF. THE PRESENT<br />
GOVERNOR-GENERAL WHEN ADDRESSING HIS FIRST SESSION, OF THE<br />
CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION IN ADELAIDE QUOTED THE GREAT<br />
AMERICAN PATRIOT AND DEMOCRAT THOMAS JEFFERSON AND I SHALL<br />
QUOTE THE SAME WORDS:<br />
" SOME MEN LOOK AT CONSTITUTIONS WITH SANCTIMONIOUS<br />
REVERENCE, AND DEEM THEM LIKE THE ARK OF THE COVENANT,<br />
TOO SACRED TO BE TOUCHED. THEY ASCRIBE TO THE MEN-OF<br />
THE PRECEDING AGE A WISDOM MORE THAN HUMAN, AND SUPPOSE<br />
WHAT THEY DID TO BE BEYOND AMENDMENT LAWS AND<br />
INSTITUTIONS MUST GO HAND IN HAND WITH THE PROGRESS OF<br />
THE HUMAN MIND WE MIGHT AS WELL REQUIRE A MAN TO<br />
WEAR THE COAT THAT FITTED HIM AS A BOY, AS CIVILIZED<br />
SOCIETY TO REMAIN EVER UNDER THE REGIME OF THEIR<br />
ANCESTORS."<br />
WE OWE IT TO OURSELVES AND TO FUTURE AUSTRALIANS TO DO OUR<br />
VERY BEST TO ENSURE THAT OUT CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK IS<br />
EFFECTIVE AND WELL ADAPTED TO MODERN NEEDS AND<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES. TO DO OTHERWISE MAY CONSIGN US TO WEARING<br />
THAT ' BOY'S COAT' AND MAKING DO WITH A RIGIDITY IN OUR<br />
GOVERNING INSTITUTIONS WHICH HOLDS BACK'OUR DEVELOPMENT AS A<br />
NATION. WE MUST PERSEVERE AT THE TASK OF CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM. TO<br />
TAKE AN EXAMPL. E WHICH WILL BE FAMILIAR TO OUR GUEST THE<br />
CANADIAN HIGH COMMISSIONER WHO IS A FORMER<br />
GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF CANADA I THINK IT IS TRUE TO SAY THAT<br />
UNTIL RECENTLY THERE WAS SIMPLY NO FORMULA IN THE CANADIAN<br />
CONSTITUTION FOR AMENDING'THAT CONSTITUTION. IT IS NOW WELL<br />
KNOWN, HOWEVER, THAT THE CANADIANS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SOLVE<br />
THAT PROBLEM VERY SUCCESSFULLY AND WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE A<br />
FUNDAMENTAL REVISION OF THEIR CONSTITUTION IN 1982.<br />
OTHER GOVERNMENTS BEFORE THIS ONE HAVE TAKEN MEASURES TO<br />
EXAMINE, IN A COMPREHENSIVE WAY, POSSIBLE REFORMS. THERE<br />
WAS A ROYAL COMMISSION ON THE CONSTITUTION IN 1929, A<br />
CONFERENCE OF COMMONWEALTH AND STATE MINISTERS IN 1942, A<br />
JOINT PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE ON CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW IN<br />
1959 AND WE HAVE JUST SEEN TWELVE YEARS OF OPERATION OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION. NOW MY GOVERNMENT<br />
WISHES TO EXPLORE, THROUGH THE COMMISSION, WHAT CHANGES MAY<br />
BE DESIRABLE FOR THE FUTURE GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
I SHOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK ALL OF YOU<br />
HERE TODAY WHO WILL BE PARTICIPATING IN THE COMMISSION AND<br />
ITS ADVISORY COMMITTEES FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE<br />
IN A TASK OF THIS MAGNITUDE. IT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S FIRM<br />
BELIEF THAT YOU ALL HAVE A GREAT DEAL TO CONTRIBUTE AND THAT<br />
THIS WORK IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO THE FUTURE OF OUR<br />
NATION. I NOW HAVE PLEASURE IN DECLARING THE CONSTITUTIONAL<br />
COMMISSION OPEN. </p>
