PRIME MINISTER<br />
JUITnSSBY THE PRIME MINISTER, MALCOLM' FRASER<br />
TrO THF, PERTH CHIAMBER OF COMbiERCE<br />
MAONDAY, 7 DECLM13ER, 1981<br />
It is a pleasure to once ag~ ain visit Weatern Australia, and a<br />
particular pleasuire to have this opportunity to address nmenbeys<br />
and quests oft tlie Perth Chamber of Comerce.<br />
The Chamber was founded over ninety yearg ago so it has e~ xiated<br />
for longer than the Commonwealthi itself, and this is a force ft).<br />
reminder of what a young nation Axiotalia is, and of our enormoms<br />
progress in achievement as 14 nation for % qe a. 3. know that<br />
Australia is one of the best countries in the world.<br />
It is through) the activities of organisationq suob as this<br />
Cham~ ber that the values that have made Australia what it is havio:<br />
bceen promoted and preserved = valuies that place their emrphasis on<br />
individcual initiative, private eriterpyise anid economic freedomn,<br />
The fact that promotion of these values corresponds to the<br />
commercial interests of the Chamber's merabers in no sense detracts<br />
from their support. for them, for as Adam Smith pointecl out over<br />
two hundred years ago, the competitive pursutit of private<br />
initerests inoreases thle well-being of society as a whble.<br />
Western Australians have a history of strenuous support for*-<br />
econoimic development and growith, arId the economic policie, Jpureuikt<br />
by the Commonwveilth Governmenit over the l~ ast six yearrs havle been<br />
designred tQ create the conditiona in wbich sustainable growth<br />
is possible.<br />
Toni. ght I want to examine the whole question of grovith in oar<br />
economy: Its importance to us as a nation; the conditions unlder<br />
which growth can be secured; the achievements wve have made in<br />
restoring growth in the last few years; the difficulties we face~<br />
In rnaintansir n that achieveplent; arid the strategy we need to<br />
keop going abead,<br />
Growth is an objective we all swpport, that we must all iuontlnua<br />
to strive for, not simply for its owtn sake but for the sake of the<br />
risiiiq re-a3 inc-omes and improvewntf iii 3iving standards it ca;-<br />
bring for ourselves and for our cbildren, and for the salke of the<br />
Capacity it creates for help to be given to less fortunate and<br />
qeuinel1t-y njeedy people. Sustained growth will niot occur just<br />
becakise we wanL t Yt takes the rich pIice frmqvrxeiS.<br />
policies that create the opportunity, and the * incenti ve Ifor<br />
private eiiterprise to play the, leading xole in the economy.-13ut<br />
it also takes a corruritrnent from people to work for the rewards that<br />
are available, and an understandinqi that all PAustraliants, not Just<br />
the powerful. or the militnnt, are entitled to jshar). e in those rewards.<br />
2. </p>
<p>It% the last two years in particular, growth hae been tistore4<br />
to the Australian economy. Indeed, in comparison with the rest<br />
of the world, the Australian economy has performed remarkably<br />
well. While the major OECD) economies are expected to have total<br />
growth of about 2% over the two calendar years6 1980 and 1981,<br />
the Australian economy i% expected to grow by about<br />
Moreover, while the Eur~ opean Economic Community has seen<br />
unemployment rise from an average of in 1980 to Over<br />
in August 1981, Australia's usiemployment rate for the: Iast<br />
12 mtonthsi has been lower oil a month-on-month banis than in the<br />
pxevious-four years, anid over 300t000 new jobs have been~ created<br />
in the last two years; and although inflationary pressures have<br />
been declining overseas, Australia's inflation rate remains beloyw<br />
the OBC[) average,<br />
The main-foundation" for our recent* outstaidiuig-performance--ies<br />
in the renewed confidence of businessmen to inivest in all seotors<br />
of the economy. For while real.* private * investment in most otherc<br />
industrial countries is flat or declining, real private businesia<br />
i'nvestmnt in Australia rose by over 21%. in 1980/ 81 the Btronqest<br />
growth in threa decades it should rise by a further 10-1516<br />
in real terms this year. Ahd ainae much of that investment will<br />
only begin to bear fruit in future years we are not only growin; y<br />
faster than other industrial. c-ountries today, we are also laying<br />
the basis that shoii. d enable us to coittinuw to do so.<br />
if Australia has doi-e compartively wlWestern Australia has done<br />
even better. Ovar the last two years, employment has Increased in<br />
this State by an average of 3% per aimnum, leadingj to a significant<br />
fall in the unemployment rate from 7.3% to 5.6t, The aubstantiiil<br />
level' of p lannied investment in the future should see this reduced<br />
further/ for of the $ 35.5 billion of investment identified by<br />
the Department of Industry and Corrtlerce survey as being Jn the<br />
connitted or final feasibility stages, iqesterfl Australia accoxinted<br />
for $ 11.5 billion over 32% of the total. I: t i( 4 little wonder<br />
that -there has ' been a' siqnif icant'net migrationf f rom-the-astern<br />
States to Western Australia in recent years.<br />
', 4hije the grovith that wee are now experiencing in~ Abstralia is shcAred<br />
throughout-all* sectors -of the economy, the -development of our<br />
abundanit resources especially our oil and non-oil energy<br />
resourcog is the m~ ajor driving forca. Despite the possibility<br />
of Tnore stable energy pricer, in tbe next. few, years, the sharp<br />
iiicrease in world~ energy prices5 oveT the~ t 1.970' s haE; stimrulated<br />
an irrevertible drive towards substitutioni of alternative energ<br />
sources, and Australia is a major beneficiary of that trend,<br />
Indeed, Australia now has a role asa one of the few Significant<br />
energy suppliers to an' energy hkingry World, a role which will b-e of<br />
great value to the world economy, and to ourselves. Moreoever,<br />
bacause of the availability of abutidant and relatively cheap energy<br />
In Australia, we have a comparative advantage In the esta) lismimt<br />
or expansion of en ergy-in tens ive industries. iHany of the projeot6<br />
already under way have a Moentu Of their own that will see<br />

<p>9-3<br />
Conditions in the world economy* pose a threat to Australia's<br />
economy especially to future investment prospects, The longer<br />
wor~ d recovery is delaye4, the more marginal planned projects<br />
become anid there are signs that rcecovery is going to be delayedl<br />
somne time yet. The U. S. econlomy which in effect represents one<br />
third of the industrial world now appears likely to have littUle<br />
or no grow'th for several quarters to come, The major European<br />
economies are likewise showing only marginal growrth at best.<br />
While the British economy appears to be finally showing aome<br />
recovery, Germany is still in recession aind unemployment is<br />
continingxw to rise sharply in most European~ countries,<br />
The 2result of the continued recession overseas will be continu d<br />
depression in commodity prices and a halt to the already igesrablo<br />
growth in world trade. Indeed, the GATT has suggested that the<br />
volume of trade will actually decline in 1981 from the laval of<br />
1980 ana Astralia's current account deficit is already show~. ing<br />
signis of these influences having an effect. While there are signs<br />
that gjovernments in North America and Europe with the notabl. e<br />
exception of France are at last restraining money supply grovith<br />
and seeking to reduce Budget deficits in a more realistic endeavour<br />
to Jconxtrol-inf lation'And' r~.' stoire private sector confidence, Austra3iats<br />
experience clearly illustrates that it takzes time for even the<br />
right policies to produce results.<br />
While Australia cannot totally insulate itself from unfavourablie<br />
wor. 10-w3. de -influences/ we can meet the challenges that they pose,<br />
arid )' eep going ahead. in order to do so, it is important that 6we<br />
have the right policies in place to retain businessm~ en's confidence<br />
in outr long-term strength but it is alrao important that all<br />
Axistralians understana ' that by their actions, and by their<br />
attitude~ s, hang our growith prospects in the years to come. of<br />
central importance to those prospects Is our ability to Improve<br />
our initernational. competitiveness by improving otir productivity<br />
and by restikaining the growth of our labol. ir costs. Australia's<br />
produotivity jrowtti in the 1960' s-ana 1970' s' wafs only half th'e-<br />
OnCD averAge, and as a result our: eal income grOVIth has lagge6<br />
behind thAt of maiiy European counitries.<br />
There are many things we need to do to improve our national<br />
producti~. ity, and strengthen our growith potential. We need to<br />
maiiita-in the stable environment which this Goverrnment has<br />
established in which private investment, emabodying newi technology<br />
can flourish; and we need to contiiixi to encourage investment<br />
from overseas, with the new ski~ lls -managerial and technical that<br />
it brings. We need to eliminate imperfectinis-iin ou r apprientic~ irh3p<br />
anld train) ing systems, which are not piroviding skilled Workers in<br />
the niumbers we require althougjh I ama pleased to learn that a<br />
record number of apprentices were in training at June 1981, we! need<br />
to shift resources. into the prodtiction of things that Australia does<br />
be s t; and we need to increase competition in the Australian econouny<br />
in all fields, and elininate rotriotive practices bY unions at-li<br />
businesses, Moreover, we need niot onl. y to conti-nue to restrain the<br />
size of the Government sector, but also to improve its performance.<br />
In paxrtioular, piiblic enterprises must be run on efficieFnt and<br />
cormeoial lines, subjecL to compelltive. pressures wherever pos; sible.<br />

The Commonwealth Government has created a policy environmvnt in<br />
which these objectives can be pursued. Wec have w~ ade a nkimber of<br />
decisions which are leading to crda and ph -L-eucinsi<br />
protection levels for a wide rangje of products. W~ e have sougtqt<br />
to imlprove the efficiency of Alistralia'S capita. trar) ets, and<br />
are Presentl. y considerinq the many recomendations of the Campkel.<br />
Cowiittee. We have ta}; en steps to return to the Private sector<br />

Opportunities for priviate sector competition, and we are soon,. to<br />
establish an inquiry into the wage fi&gt;,. ation systemi.<br />
The Government is awsare that change can be disraptive if it is<br />
too dramatic. We wanit gradual and3 predictab. 1le Change, afterl. fxul).<br />
