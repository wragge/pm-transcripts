SPEECH IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES BY<br />
THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON. RoG. MENZIES<br />
ON NO-CONFIDENCE MOTION TOTH MARCH. ~ 3960<br />
MR. MENZIES: I am indebted to the House for 0. lowing me to speak<br />
for a period of 30 minutes. It really is not long enough.<br />
MR. CURTIN: It is too long,<br />
MR. MENZIES: No, it is not. I felt that a period of 30 minutes<br />
was not long enough for the Lead3r of the Opposition ( Mr. Calwell)<br />
and I myself would have liked a little more time. I want to<br />
say first, Mr. Speaker, that the Goverrnment, oddly enough, will<br />
vote against what is in effect the no confidence motion. That,<br />
ofcourse, will surprise honourable members opposite!<br />
Secondly I wish to say something, quite briefly and I<br />
suppose not comprehensively about the points that were taken by<br />
the new Leader of the Opposition in attack on the Government.<br />
I should like to chide him a little gently, if I may, about one<br />
or two statements he made in the course of his speech. He said,<br />
for example, that there was not one. wo. d in any Governmrent<br />
statement about the impact of inflation on ordinary people wage<br />
earners or those on fixed incomes. Having said that, the honourable<br />
gentleman went on to pay me an ill deserved compliment of a<br />
theoretical kind about the speech I delivered to the Institute<br />
of Management conference in Helbourne to which, as I did not<br />
realise, he had listened, Irarnjng from it but not, I regret to<br />
say, acquiring wisdom from it. If he hod . li'ened to that<br />
speech as closcly as I should have hoped he wrould, he would have<br />
known that we have made a feature of this matter bec-use in that<br />
very statement of mine in the Mielbourne Twcn Hall I said, if I<br />
may quote my om -rords I knc it is n ill bus ness<br />
' But the fact is that one of the great obstacles to counter<br />
inflationary action is that there are . iany pr-ople who think<br />
a bit of inflation is a very good thing. Such a view pays<br />
little heed to the position of those on fi' Ad incomes and no<br />
heed whatever to the continuing and growing need to finance<br />
by public borrowings at fir. d r: ates of interest a great programme<br />
of public works the completion of which is absolutely<br />
vital to transporc and wat.: r. and power and housing and<br />
schools and universities, to the ex-pansion of inCustry and<br />
commerce, ana the maintenance of employment.<br />
Theh, Sir, the honourable gentleman, when making his maiden<br />
speech as Leader of the Opposition which we all appreci. ated,<br />
said-de believe that the country is prosperous'<br />
Indeed it is, It is prosperous for the overwhelming<br />
majority of the people of Australia. If one had time one could<br />
demonstrate that by showing how the ordinary standard of living<br />
has risen. But I was glad to near the honourabl. e member admit<br />
that the country was prcoerous a rather unpleasant admission<br />
for an Opposition Leader to have to make. But he made it like a<br />
man. Ho: wever, it was a notable reversal of form for one who has<br />
been busy prophesying disaster and mass unemployment for the<br />
last ten years and urging people not to save, Even he must know<br />
that saving is one of the prime means of defeating inflation.<br />
He has been saying, " Do not save your money; spend it, There<br />
is disaster coming and there will be mass unemployment."<br />
One of the iany things I like about distinguished<br />
friend is that he is devoted to prophecy but over a period of<br />
ten years his prophecies have never turned out to be right, So<br />
this time he got away from prophecy and unertoolk to analyse the<br />
present state of affairs in which there is a distinct upward rise<br />
of costs and prices He said that this was a profit not<br />
prophet inflation. In order to osta bish that there was a </p>
<p>profit inflation he quoted another authority as saying that the<br />
total profits of Australian companies other than mining companies<br />
last year was œ 130,900,000. Because of that œ 130,000,000 in<br />
the total national income of Australia he said that all these<br />
things were explained.<br />
The honourable member spoke about wages, too. Has he<br />
realised that under the last two decisions of the Commonwealth<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Commission I do not discuss them<br />
the annual addition to the wages bill has been œ 165,000,000.<br />
That is an addition over and above what has existed before. Even<br />
that annual addition exceeds the total company profit by<br />
œ 35,000,000. That may give a lot of intelligent and toughtful<br />
people something to think about, My honourable friend seems to<br />
think that that portion of company profit which he regards as<br />
being excessive I do not know whether it is 10 per cent.,<br />
per cent., or 30 percent has brought about the present inflation<br />
while all the other obvious factors in the situation have<br />
not affected it at all. That is a very remarkable state of<br />
affairs. I shall accept the honourable member's view purely for<br />
the sake of argument even though, between ourselves, I think it<br />
is nonsense. Let us suppose for the sake of argument that there<br />
is a profit inflation and that profits are being made by companies<br />
every one of which employs thousands of good Australian<br />
people. 4Jhat does the honourable gentleman propose to do about<br />
it? Our supposition lends itself to a supplementary question,<br />
and it is this: Does the honourable member regard inflation as<br />
a theoretical or future problem or an immediate problem? As I<br />
suppose he would agree that it is an immediate problem, I ask:<br />
What does the honourable member irho, thank heaven, has made this<br />
the issue propose to do about it? First of all indeed, I<br />
thought at one stage it was last of all he proposes an amendment<br />
of the Constitution and then to decide how to use any new<br />
powers that the people may vote for. Sir, I have had a long<br />
experience of attempts to amend the Constitution. I would not<br />
dream of speaking of them in that confident way, particularly if<br />
I were saying to the people, " You give me charge and I will<br />
settle inflation. I will change the Constitution.<br />
Mr. Bryaht: Put value back into the œ 1.<br />
MR. MENZIES: Dear me! If you would put a bit more value into<br />
the that you get the would be worth more. That is all<br />
I have to say to you.<br />
Mr. Bryant: That is a pretty bright remark.<br />
MR. MENZIES: It is. Brighter than any remark I have ever heard<br />
you make in this House. But I am not to be led off by these<br />
matters. The time ticks on.<br />
The Loader of the Opposition is going to amend the<br />
Constitution. Really! The honourable member has enough experience<br />
of politics to know that you do not just say today: " We<br />
will amend the Constitution", and get it amended tomorrow. I<br />
can remember sweating my way around this country many years ago<br />
23 years ago asking the people of Australia to vote to give<br />
power over civil aviation to the Commonwealth of Australia. They<br />
voted, Therefore, if the honourable gentleman is saying<br />
to people who are properly pressed by the weight of inflation,<br />
" You leave it to me. I will alter the Constitution", they may<br />
have a somewhat sceptical mind about it. But that is his first<br />
step: . Ie rill amend the Constitution! As a solution for n<br />
immediate problem of inflation I have never heard anything more<br />
futile. In the second place, the honourable gentleman does not<br />
say on behalf of his party that he would not intervene before </p>
<p>the Arbitration Commission, because it has been made clear for<br />
years by his predecessor :. nd himself that it would. To do what?<br />
To support further immediate wage. increases so as to increase<br />
the volume of demand and, if I may add it, turnover, and, if I<br />
may add it, profit. That is the one short run remedy that he<br />
presents. The long run one quite theoretical at this stage is<br />
to amend the Constitution. That takes an a;. ful lot of doing.<br />
I am not saying that it might not be done in due course, but it<br />
takes an eaful lot of doing and involves a lot of time. In the<br />
meantime, the short run proposal is to increase the volume of<br />
money in circulation in order to ristrain inflation!<br />
Mr. Courtenay: You should get Sir Frank Richardson.<br />
iMRl. M ENZIES: Did you refuse your increase? Stand up and be<br />
counted! Did you refuse your increase? Of course not! There<br />
is nothing I despise more than a fellow who wants to cash in on<br />
a popular clamour, but takes the money ' ile the money is going.<br />
So re need not pay any attention to you.<br />
The third proposal of the Opposition is to increase<br />
government expenditure both in respect of private citizens and<br />
of State governments. Ie are not paying the State governments<br />
enough! Last year when a new arrangement had been made with<br />
the State governments and a bill was brought in to give effect<br />
to it, every member of the Opposition voted for it. But there<br />
is a by-election coming and so they say now, " Oh, this is<br />
wiicked. The State governments are not getting enough." So, as<br />
a counter to inflation, the Opposition proposes that more money<br />
should be provided for the State governments and for private<br />
citizens! Of course, all that means, once again, is that Opposition<br />
members and I should like to have heard their views on<br />
this matter either accept deficit finance in the middle of<br />
inflation, when clearly there could be nothing more damaging, or<br />
thuy propose, . ithout saying so, to raise taxes in order to<br />
avoid a d-ficit. It would be very interusting to know whether<br />
the Leader of the Opposition was proposing the outlines of a<br />
counter-inflationary budget in which he rould substantially increase<br />
expenditure and jack up revenue by further taxes on the<br />
citizen. oell, -he has not told us. But the alternative to all<br />
this greatly increased expendituro as a counter-inflationary<br />
measure, mark you! the alternative to increasing taxes to raise<br />
the wind is to leon heavily on central bank credit; to make what<br />
the Opposition would call a more vigorous use of central bank<br />
credit, thereby increasing the supply of money, but not, of<br />
course, the supply of goods and services.<br />
Sir, for a Labour Opposition much enriched by the<br />
presence of a new Loader, and a nie deputy . ader whom I complimont<br />
on his appointment to be seriously making an issue of inflation,<br />
and at the , ame time producing a body of ideas which<br />
would only pour ptrol on the fire of inflation, is one of the<br />
most pathetic things in political history.<br />
So far, I h.: ve stated what I believe to be the Opposition's<br />
counter-inflationary policy if it is to be called onein<br />
positive terms. But there are negative terms which we all<br />
ought to remember. The first of them is that there is to be no<br />
borrowing of capital from overseas. I hope that will not be dernd.<br />
Mr. Pollard: It was never said.<br />
Mji. MENZIES: No, Reggie I am sorry, Mr. Speaker I should<br />
refer to the honourable member for Lalor.<br />
MR. Pollard: It was not said by the Leader of the Opposition. </p>
<p>4.<br />
MR. MENZIES: I am very interested to hear you say that because<br />
I made a few notes on what the honourable member for Melbourne<br />
the Leader of the Opposition whom you loyally serve today, said<br />
in 1955 in this very House. He said<br />
As a party-<br />
I suppose that means, " As a party"<br />
we do not believe in overseas borrowing. oJe have a very<br />
strong objection to borrowing at all from overseas.<br />
Mr. Pollard: Hear, hoar!<br />
MiiR. MENZIES: My old friend, the honourable member for Lalor,<br />
can make the best that he can of that. That is the view unless<br />
it has been changed in the last fortnight. Labour would not<br />
borrow from overseas! That might be a little awkward because this<br />
country is chronically short of capital in its present amazing<br />
state of d: velopment, lo cannot, at present, generate all the<br />
capital we require for public w. rorks, for the needs of private<br />
enterprise, and for the employment of all our people.<br />
So, the first thing that the Opposition says unless<br />
the policy is now to be cancelled is " WJe do not believe in<br />
overseas borrowing. / e are entirely opposed to it." All right!<br />
That means that that avenue is closed. Do honourable members<br />
opposite believe that we can get sufficient capital for development,<br />
capital for employment, capital to reduce the excessive<br />
demands inside Australia which so easily produce inflation, unless<br />
we enrich ourselves by an inflow of capital from other<br />
countries? What is their view on that? So far as I ha: ve been<br />
able to understand the Leader of the Opposition said nothing<br />
about it, but I heard his predecessor speak about it a great<br />
deal the Opposition is severely critical of foreign investment<br />
in Australia. Foreign investors are bad people. They squeeze<br />
out Australians. They have regard only to their own interest.<br />
They make profits. Is this the policy of the Labour Party? If<br />
so, it is a policy that ought to be expressed quite plainly in<br />
Dandenong, in Goolong, and in Broadmeadows, to refer only to my<br />
own State. Suppose Labour did succeed in deterring foreign investment,<br />
would it have made a contribution to defeating inflation<br />
or would it have poured petrol on the fire of inflation?<br />
These things are worth remembering. I wonder whether honourable<br />
gentlemen opposite, when they find themselves addressing people<br />
who, by the thousands, are employed in Australia as a result of<br />
developmental industrial capital, will say to them, " You ought<br />
not to be employed by these peoples; you ought to be out of a<br />
job. It is much better that you should be out of a job than that<br />
we should allow money from overseas to come into Australia."<br />
Time marches on, and I pass to the next point I want to<br />
make. My honourable friend, talking about the increased costs<br />
produced by recent events, has said that the Government is not<br />
asking business interests to absorb some of these costs, but if<br />
big business is so prosperous, it should be able to debit some of<br />
the wage increases against its profits. I was sorry when I heard<br />
the honourable member say that, because he had done me the groat<br />
honour of going to the Melbourne Town Hall to hear me make a long<br />
and considered statement on these very matters. I merely recall<br />
to his mind what I said. I shall quote it to honourable members:<br />
' The employer who simply passes on wago increases into higher<br />
prices is contributing to the inflationary spiral, rendering<br />
inevitable the next wage increase, and cost increase, and<br />
r ice increase. Vast numbers of ordinary citizens will suffer<br />
in the process, the export industries will be penalised, </p>
<p>U and the national finances will be disorganized, The task of<br />
the employer, rho is for this purpose the manager, is thorofore<br />
to meet each upward movement of labour costs first, by<br />
absorbing it as far as possible, not regarding the current<br />
rate of profit as sacrosanct, rnd second ( or should it be<br />
first) so improving the efficiency of his operations as to<br />
reduce, or at least stabilise, his unit cost of production.;<br />
I quote those words in order to demonstrate that this has been<br />
by no means overlooked.<br />
As I an now left with ei. ght and a half minutes Ithink<br />
I should perhaps say something about our own policy in case it<br />
becomes overlooked. I will pass over all the proposals that have<br />
been made by Labour leaders or by a Labour leader ovie the last<br />
seven or eight years. In overy political campaign and in every<br />
policy speech we have heard of more millions, more hundreds of<br />
millions and more promises, all adding to purchasing power, and<br />
not one of them having any relation to production. I pass over<br />
that. As counter-inflationary measures they were, of course,<br />
quite pathetic. But, Sir, we the Government have done something<br />
that the Opposition has not done. , Jo have had a gcod deal of<br />
experionce about this matteo. In 1951 in the Budaet of that year,<br />
when the wool boom following on the Korean war had led to the<br />
most tremendous inflationary pressure, we introduced a Budget<br />
which was violently assailed by the Opposition. This Budget was<br />
designed to draw down the total purchasing power so that the demand<br />
in the country would not outstrip the supply. Honourable<br />
members opposite had a wonderful time. They took us to pieces and<br />
they had great supporters. The gallup poll showed us right down<br />
at carpet level. But in--th 1954 ulection we won, and we won in<br />
1954 because the action we had tak-en against inflation had produced<br />
results. We may have won because the honourable sentleman<br />
who is incerjccting was one of the candidates. Of cours., we won<br />
in 1954 because the people saw that stability was being achiuved<br />
by this Government. The people are not such fools as members of<br />
the Opposition appear to them.<br />
I shall tho:: efore rehearse quite briefly what action we<br />
are taking. We have had to deal with booms by budgeting for a<br />
surplus and have been hated in the process. JWe have had to deal<br />
with minor recessions by budgeting for a deficit and whatever we<br />
have done on these matters has been rong, but in the net result<br />
as the Leader of the Opposition himself admits, this country is<br />
in a state of prosperity that it has never boen in before. Our<br />
inflationary measures I mention them very briefly devoting about<br />
seconds to each are these: Je are going to avoid deficit<br />
finance because deficit finance adds to the supply of money ahead<br />
of the supply of goods or services. Deficit finance is proper in<br />
a period of recession. Budgeting for a surplus, as in 1951, is a<br />
propr counter-inflation action. Doesthe honourable Leader of the<br />
Opposition agree with not budgeting for a deficit? He has not<br />
said so. He does not believe it. Being an honest man he could<br />
not honestly say so because the promises that will pour out from<br />
the Opposition in the next few woees would make balanced budget<br />
impossible. Therefore au are for avoiding deficit finance. The<br />
Opposition is for h-ving it.<br />
In the second plac. we support a central bank policy of<br />
restraining the growth of excessive liquidity at a time of inflation.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition said on behalf of his party<br />
though I should doubt that he slid it on be'ialf of himself that<br />
that is not right. His motto is more and more and more liquidity<br />
and more nd more central bank credit. That is crazy and I say<br />
that on behalf of the ordinary people of this country who suffer<br />
from inflation. In the third place we have said plainly that we are<br />
going to do what we can to resist, not paying increases as such, </p>
<p>6.<br />
but to resist increases in the pay cheque of the country which<br />
are not matched by increased productivity. This is the whole<br />
basis of truth in this matter. If you pay more than there is<br />
production then you hAv.:, of cours2, inflation and rising prices.<br />
If you pay less than you have production, then you have a period<br />
of depression and recession. The honourable gentleman says,<br />
" Forget about productivity." Indeed, he did not say a word about<br />
it not a word. Nor did his great predecessor over nine or ten<br />
years say a word about productivity. He said, " Support the increases<br />
whatever the result may be."<br />
Finally we say le us move as quickly as possible towards<br />
the removal of import licensing and thus towards in increase<br />
in the total supply of goods. . Jhatever nonsense may be<br />
talked about profit inflation, the truth is that by and large,<br />
over a period a month, a year or five years-inflation reprosunts<br />
an over-supply of money as compared with the supply of<br />
goods and services. Ther. fore, Sir, wre have stepped towards the<br />
removal of import licensing. Before I finish, having said that<br />
the Labour Party is opposed to this, let me remind those of the<br />
other side who have some memory that when, in 1952 we introduced<br />
the modern edition of import licensing quiLe soverely<br />
S owe were assailed from the Opposition for doing so. Dr. Evatt,<br />
who was then Leader of the Opposition and who is now happ. ly<br />
placed in another jurisdiction, said, " 1ec look forward to the<br />
time when this system can be removed and when there will be substituted<br />
for it a proper system of tariff duties so that the<br />
trade of the country may run free". 3ut, today, the Opposition<br />
is scratching about for a new look. However, it is ve:. y hard to<br />
de -elop a new look in three or four days. So it has now discovered<br />
that the removal of import licensing is a wicked thing,<br />
although it thought, only a few years ago, that the imposition<br />
of this kind of licensing was a piece of villainy.<br />
I sum up, Sir, by saying that the Australian Labour<br />
Party, having decided, as it has done, o make inflation the<br />
issue, has absolutely no remedies to off. r, except, first, an<br />
attempt, some day, somewhere, in respect of some matter, to induce<br />
the people to alter the Australian Constitution, and,<br />
secondly, further taxes I think they were vaguely hinted at<br />
on che profits of companies.<br />
Mr. Speaker: Ordoi T'he Rt. Hon. gent?:.**:: ans time has expired.<br />
SiMR. MENZIES: Thank you, Sir. That was exactly where I wanted<br />
to end. </p>
