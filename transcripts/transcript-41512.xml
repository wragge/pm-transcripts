    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations will strengthen our cooperation to fight terrorism in our region and keep our people safe.</p>
<p>The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Cooperation to Counter International Terrorism  signed today is an historic agreement that reflects and enhances our commitment to confront violent extremism and counter terrorism financing.</p>
<p>It intensifies our annual engagement with ASEAN and enshrines practical measures to deepen dialogue across our governments, security agencies and law enforcement institutions.</p>
<p>ASEAN nations have a strong record of working together to confront violent extremism and defeat terrorist organisations. In recent years the threat posed by returning foreign fighters and ISIL-linked extremists has grown. It makes today’s cooperation all the more important.</p>
<p>The MoU is supported by a suite of programmes, including technical and regulatory assistance to develop best practice counter-terrorism legislation, and regional dialogues and workshops on topics such as electronic evidence, financial intelligence, and countering online radicalisation.</p>
<p>The signing of the MoU demonstrates our joint resolve to stand together against those who seek to divide our communities and our nations.</p>
