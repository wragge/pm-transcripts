PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 6 September 1985<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke, today announced details of the<br />
Australian Bicentennial Exhibition, a major project being funded<br />
uhder the Commonwealth Government's National Bicentennial Program<br />
and organised by the Australian Bicentennial Authority.<br />
The Federal Government will contribute $ 19m towards the Exhibition<br />
while the Australian company, BHP, will provide additional<br />
sponsorship of $ 6m.<br />
Mr Hawke said it was fitting that BHP, Australia's largest<br />
company, should choose to support the largest exhibition ever to<br />
tour Australia.<br />
The company's substantial contribution is a mark of its confidence<br />
in our nation and will provide a stimulus for further private<br />
sector involvement in the celebrations.<br />
The Australian Bicentennial Exhibition will be an exciting,<br />
innovative project for all Australians to enjoy and will be a<br />
focus in making our Bicentennial celebrations an unprecedented<br />
success.<br />
The Exhibition will tour all States, the Northern Territory and<br />
the ACT visiting more than fifty cities and towns over a 19 month<br />
period beginning in mid 1987.<br />
It is expected to attract at least four million visitors arid<br />
television coverage will take it to a much wider audience.<br />
The mobile venue for the Exhibition has beepi designed by the<br />
Australian architectural firm, Daryl Jackson Pty Ltd, with the<br />
Commonwealth Department of Hovsing and Construction acting as<br />
project manager for the design and construction phases.<br />
Daryl Jackson's competition-w. inning proposals envisage<br />
approximately twenty purpose-built pantechnicons travelling as a<br />
giant road train to transport the Exhibition around the country. </p>
<p>2.<br />
The content of the Exhibition is being designed around the<br />
Bicentennial theme, ' Living Together', and will explore<br />
Australia's past, present and future.<br />
Drawing on a range of sophisticated technology, the displays will<br />
cover such diverse areas as cartography, mining, immigration,<br />
science, agriculture, environmental issues, cultural activities,<br />
leisure, and the law.<br />
Active community involvement will be encouraged as an important<br />
element of this imaginative Bicentennial project which promises to<br />
be lively, informative and entertaining.<br />
