TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
SPEECH TO THE AUSTRALIAN QUALITY AWARDS<br />
DARLING HARBOUR, SYDNEY'<br />
EE Thank you very much David. To Bob Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, Barry<br />
Murphy, ladies-and gentlemen.<br />
The last time that I made a speech in this convention centre was at the dinner to<br />
welcome home Australia's victorious Atlanta Olympic Games team and that was a very<br />
euphoric night and -it was a -night that was full of proper adulation for a group of men<br />
and women who had done remarkable things in the name of Australia. And it's very<br />
appropriate that the next address should also be in honour of a group of men and<br />
women who are also doing equally remarkable things for Australia. We are never<br />
reluctant, and properly so, and it's always part of our national character to do honour<br />
and pay homage to our sports men and women who achieve so much on the sporting<br />
and playing fields of the world. We're very proud of them and they give us a great<br />
deal of inspiration and a great deal of encouragement.<br />
We ought to be equally proud and we should pay equal homage to those men and<br />
women who achieve excellence in business and the way in which the Australian Quality<br />
Awards have grown in status over the years, the way in which a gathering of over<br />
4000 people, I understand, involved right across the nation tonight in this exercise is an<br />
indication of how much store all Australians are now placing on the need for our<br />
nation to succeed in the international competitive race.<br />
Quality is all about lifing performance. It's all about lifting competitiveness, and<br />
lifting performance and lifting competitiveness is all about Australia's international<br />
future. You've all been told before but it has to be said again and again. We live in a<br />
fiercely competitive global economy. Nobody owes Australia a living. The fact that<br />
we live cheek by jowl to the fastest growing and most exciting economic region, the<br />
Asian Pacific region, means that we have a remarkable opportunity, that we can't take<br />
our future for granted, that we have to claw our future for ourselves, we have to<br />

compete, we have to be efficient, we have to be smart and wve have to produce high<br />
quality products. What I think the Australian Quality Awards do is to focus the minds<br />
of everybody, not just men and women in business but also men and women in<br />
governments, focus the minds of all of us on lifting our gamne and lifting our<br />
performance. As I flick through the citations of the various recipients tonight, one of the common<br />
threads that came through very strongly to me was the importance of relations between<br />
the owner and the proprietor of the business and the employees of that business, and<br />
the great focus in so many of the awards, not only on customer satisfaction and good<br />
customer relations but also on good human relations inside the firm. And I still believe<br />
it may in the eyes of some be regarded as an old fashioned value but I think it's an<br />
enduring and important value, that the most important resource that any firm has is its<br />
employees, its people, and if the relations between those who run the business, and if<br />
you can get the relationship right, if you can involve every last person in your firml or<br />
your enterprise or your government agency or your business, in the future if you can<br />
forge a common vision, if you can have a common purpose at the workplace level,<br />
then I think you've got more than half of the battle won. And we've come a long way<br />
in that department over the last few years and everybody has played a part, and I<br />
acknowledge, quite frankly despite the differences I may occasionally have on policy<br />
issues, I acknowledge the contribution that has been made in that area by many leaders<br />
of the trade union movement in Australia because I think increasingly, we're all seeing<br />
that we have to work and fight together for a common purpose and if you can have<br />
that common purpose inculcated at the firm level, then I believe that more than half the<br />
battle has been won.<br />
And that of course is the philosophy that lies very much behind the Government's<br />
recent changes to workplace relations. They are not about fighting long distant and<br />
best forgotten battles. They are about imbuing a sense of common endeavour and<br />
common enterprise at the workplace level because that really is the wave of the future.<br />
The next millennium is going to see dramatic changes in the Australian workplace. We<br />
are going to see proportionately more Australians employed by smaller firms. We arc<br />
going to see the communications explosion absolutely change the face of the way in<br />
wvhich work is conducted, We are going to see more people working from home. We<br />
are going to see more people working in decentralised locations. We are going to see<br />
people more and more sensitive to the shifls of economies in different parts of the<br />
world. We are going to have people more conscious that job availability will be a<br />
global thing rather than a national or a regional thing. And there's going to be an even<br />
greater pressure in the future on high quality and high performance and I want on<br />
behalf of the Government, I want to thank everybody that has been associated with tile<br />
Australian Quality Awards. I want to thank the assessors, I want to thank the<br />
participants but collectively, I want to thank everybody who is committed to building a<br />
more competitive and a more enlightened business future for Australia.<br />
I think more than at any other time in our history, we are conscious that we have to<br />
make our way on our own. We will win and we will succeed if we are the world's<br />
best, and if we're not the world's best in many areas then we are not going to have the<br />
future that all of us want for ourselves. But I am filled with optimism and confidence<br />
about the future. Just as I take a very positive view about the balance sheet of 2 </p>
<p>Fax from Australia's history to date, I also take a very positive view about Australia's future<br />
prospects and sitting and listening tonight to the performance of big and small firms,<br />
public sector as well as private sector bodies and agencies all over Australia, you can't<br />
be other than filled with a great sense of optimism and hope.<br />
So on behalf of the Government, I congratulate Barry Murphy and his committee. I<br />
congratulate those who devised the Australian Quality Awards. 1 thank them for the<br />
great contribution that they are making to Australia winning the international<br />
competitive race.<br />
Thank you. 13/ 11/ 96 12: 08 Pg: 3 </p>
