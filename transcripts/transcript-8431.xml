TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, BANCKSTOWN COLLEGE OF TAFE, MARCH 2 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Mr Keating, ACOSS has described part of your<br />
tax/ economic statement as unf air and dangerous. Does<br />
that concern you?<br />
PM: Well I didn't hear ACOSS barracking for the low paid..<br />
When I became the Treasurer the low paid were on a taxc<br />
rate of 30 per cent, we cut them to 20 per cent over<br />
those Eight years, introduced the Family Allowance<br />
Supplement ' which never came from ACOSS. There are<br />
bigger constituencies than ACOSS worrying about the low<br />
paid. In the main the organisation which has most<br />
represented the low paid in this country is the ACTU,<br />
which it still does well and with great concern.<br />
J: Will you ignore ACOSS?<br />
PM: No, ACOSS is entitled to its view but it's only a view.<br />
But thiLs area is the area I am interested in<br />
technical and further education. And it's good to be<br />
back at this school, I actually went to school here.<br />
This is the area of education, beyond school, closest<br />
to the community and it's the area which the<br />
Commonwealth is going to take over, it's the area which<br />
we are going to make again a strong part of the<br />
education system by Commonwealth funding. All of the<br />
courses which we saw here today, literacy, computers,<br />
computer literacy, fitting and turning, carpentry, all<br />
of those things are things which are important to the<br />
community, important for basic jobs skills, important<br />
for getting a chance to work and making Australia a<br />
more capable country. And my colleague John Hewson<br />
says, it's not affordable, we shouldn't be doing this.<br />
This building right behind, you the Commonwealth has<br />
just completed, $ 14 million. We will be doing more<br />
TAFE technical and further education capital and<br />
recurrent spending as a result of the One Nation<br />
package. </p>
<p>-2<br />
J: But are you spending enough money on TAFE?<br />
PM: Well, we are going to spend more than has ever been<br />
spent. That is we are going to lift it up as we lifted<br />
universities up. But Dr Hewson says that it's unfunded<br />
and unaf fordable, so he wouldn't be spending any money<br />
on TAFE. He says it was irresponsible and extravagant:<br />
to spend money on the TAFE system, to spend money on<br />
Australian kids and adults who want to lift their<br />
skills, give themselves opportunities in the workforce<br />
and make Australia a more capable country, not just a<br />
more clever country, but a more capable country. And<br />
it is in places like this that people have got to know<br />
what Dr Hewson's sterile policies are about. It's not<br />
about helping these people. His education policy if<br />
your par: ents can afford $ 13,000 you can go to a private<br />
universi: Lty, but if they can't afford that and you can't<br />
get into university well you are on your own. There is<br />
no TAFE college for you, there's no computer course,<br />
there's no literacy, there's none of these other 1200<br />
courses which are available in TAFE which help people<br />
find their way into the workforce and make Australia<br />
better. I<br />
J: Is you coming here today part of your remodelling your<br />
image?<br />
PM: It's not a matter of remodelling my image. I've been<br />
coming here since I was a kid. I went to school here.<br />
You have got to get better questions son, you've got to<br />
chop those silly things out. The thing is, it's only<br />
the Labor Party that's ever been interested in these<br />
things, in trying to bring people up who don't have a<br />
lot of opportunities, to give them something extra and<br />
valuable. And that's what TAFE's about.<br />
J: Mr Keating, how do you feel about Britain's response to<br />
your republican push and your war history?<br />
PM: I wasn't talking about republicanism. My views on all<br />
this are well known.<br />
J: Mr Keating, are you happy with the way the Statement<br />
has been received so far?<br />
PM: Exceptionally well received by the business community,<br />
exceptionally well received, I think, by the community<br />
in general. Because it is a plan for Australia, it's a<br />
plan for the next four years, it's about rebuilding the<br />
basic infrastructure, the rail system, the electricity<br />
system, giving Australia a different airline system, a<br />
competitive airline policy, letting industries like<br />
tourism flourish, about rebuilding the TAFE sector to<br />
give students, children and adults alike, a better<br />
opportunity in life. It's about all those basic things<br />
thfat are not going to be done by taxing your Weet-Bix.<br />
I mean the GST on your Kellogs is not going to build<br />
that TAFE ,' college, it'Is not going to rebuild the </p>
<p>-33-<br />
Brisbane-Sydney-Melbourne-Adelaide-Perth railway line,<br />
it's not going to change the ports, it's not going to<br />
change the way in which the airline system works. You<br />
can't get that sort of vision and change from a sterile<br />
policy which taxes your Weet-Bix and your shirts.<br />
ends. </p>
