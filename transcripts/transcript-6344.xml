PRIME MINISTER<br />
For Media 15 March 1984<br />
The Prime Minister today held discussions with the<br />
South Australian Premier, Mr BannOn, and the Northern<br />
Territory Chief Ministcr, Mr Everingham, on the-proposed<br />
Alice Springs-Darwin railway link.<br />
In particular, Mr Hawko discussed with Mr Bannon and<br />
Mr Everingham the Federal Government's consideration of the<br />
defence implications of the proposed rail link.<br />
Hle advised them that the Minister for Defence, Mr Scholes, had<br />
recommended thatt<br />
" A decision now to divert defence expenditure from<br />
projects having priority in terms of endorsed planning<br />
critcria to the proposed infrastructurework would,<br />
other factors remaining constant, reduce the level of<br />
defence preparedness we could otherwise achieve".<br />
Mr Hawke told Mr Bannon and Mr Everingham that the Government<br />
had accepted the findflings of the Hill Report on Transport Services<br />
in the Northern Territory.<br />
A central recommendation of the report was that: " Evon by<br />
adopting an optimistic view of future growth in the Northern<br />
Territory, the Inquiry found that investment in the railway<br />
between Alice Springs and Darwin cannot be justified and<br />
would constitute a ma-ijor misallocation of the nation's<br />
resources". Mr Hawke also advised Mr Bannon and Mr Everingham that the Bureau<br />
of Transport Economics had endorsed the appropriateness of the<br />
methodology used in the Hfill Report.<br />
Mr Bannon indicated that in view o-f Ele Fe-eral Government's<br />
decision South Australia would noU, be approaching the<br />
Commonwealth on alternative, compensatory projects<br />
including upgrading of the Stuart Highway.<br />
In view of Mr Everingham's earlier repudiation of the necessity<br />
of upgrading the Stuart Highway,--th_-Norhern Territory<br />
Government is now free, following the joint feasibility study<br />
announced last July with Queensland, to take up with the<br />
Queensland Premier construction of the railway line to link<br />
Mt Isa with Darwin and Alice Springs. </p>
