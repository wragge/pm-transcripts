I am pleased to announce that the Administrator of the Government of the Commonwealth Professor Marie Bashir AC CVO has today appointed Mr Richard Maude to the position of Director-General, Office of National Assessments, for a period of 5 years from 13 May 2013.</p>
<p>Mr Maude will replace Mr Allan Gyngell AO, the current Director-General, who is retiring after a distinguished career in the Australian Public Service and as the founding Executive Director of the Lowy Institute for International Policy.</p>
<p>Mr Maude is currently the Senior Advisor, International in the Office of the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>He is a senior executive of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with an extensive background in national security and foreign policy. Mr Maude has served overseas in Malaysia, Singapore and the United States, where he was ONA's Liaison Officer in Washington.</p>
<p>The position of Director-General was publicly advertised in January 2013.  The appointment of Mr Maude follows an open, merit-based selection process. </p>
<p>I take this opportunity to acknowledge Mr Gyngell's distinguished public service career and his significant contribution as Director-General, and to wish him well in his retirement. </p>
