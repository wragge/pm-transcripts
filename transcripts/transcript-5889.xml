EMBARGO: 5: 00PM<br />

PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, AUGUST 15 1982<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
A groundswell of opinion is building up throughout the community<br />
that Australians need to work together in the face of world<br />
recession which is now hitting Australia hard. Industry and<br />
trade unions as well as governments are recognising that the<br />
path of co-operation and moderation is the best way to achieve<br />
our common objectives as a nation, the best way to help insulate<br />
all Australians from the impact of world recession, and the<br />
best way to be ready to take advantage of world economic<br />
recovery when it finally comes.<br />
The growing recognition that we need to co-operate and work<br />
together as one people is a hopeful development indeed. It.<br />
provides a foundation for increasing moderation in wage demands,<br />
for restoring Australia's ability to compete in overseas markets,<br />
for improving our reputation as a reliable supplier, and it will<br />
help in the continuing fight against inflation.<br />
The signs of a greater willingness to work together can be seen<br />
in several areas. There has been a substantial fall in the<br />
number of working days lost through strikes and industrial<br />
disputes. In the three months to May 1981, 640,000 days were<br />
lost in industrial disputes; in the three months to May of<br />
this year, 380,000 working days were lost-a fall of about<br />
forty per cent against last year.<br />
Another recent sign of willingness to work together is the<br />
co-operation between unions, management and governments, based<br />
on the Crawford Report to make shipping flow more smoothly<br />
through our ports. Governments, both State and Federal, have<br />
also been getting together with the coal industry to find<br />
ways out of the very great difficulties which have plagued<br />
this major export industry-and which were at the same time<br />
jeopardising vital future contracts, particularly in Asia,<br />
because supply has been too unreliable.<br />
The recent meeting between the CAI, the ACTU and the Commonwealth<br />
to analyse our economic problems and to see to what extent there<br />
is a common understanding about them, is a further important<br />
example of how we have begun to work together. At that meeting,<br />
all parties agreed that Australia was facing serious economic<br />
problems, and with varying emphasis, there was; agreement that<br />
there is a link between excessive wage increases and a loss<br />
of jobs. </p>
<p>2<br />
In the last few days, the Government has accepted salary<br />
recommendations well below the current inflation rate for<br />
Parliamentarians and senior public servants, and, I have been<br />
pleased to note that the Academic Salaries Tribunal has also<br />
recommended a salary increase substantially below the rate<br />
of inflation. An important example to the community has been<br />
set by these actions and I have written to a number of companies,<br />
to State Premiers and to the ACTU and the CAI explaining<br />
the importance of these decisions. Several notable companies<br />
have announced a freeze or very small salary increases, and<br />
a number of leading figures in the trade union movement<br />
including the President and the Secretary of the ACTU have<br />
both spoken out strongly in support of wage moderation. Mr Dolan,<br />
the President of the ACTU, was reported last week as saying<br />
that more people would have to accept less pay to keep their jobs.<br />
These are examples of Australians recognising that we have<br />
to work together and that if we act in this way rather than<br />
pursuing sectional interests in a selfish and shortsighted<br />
way, then we will be able to work our way through the present<br />
difficulties and continue to build the kind of economic strength<br />
and prosperity that we all want for Australia.<br />
