PRE. MIERS<br />
I would .1i e to clarify certain pres3 reports this morning.<br />
The Premr-iersl Conference on 15 April will not be<br />
discus. inc7 t-he relative shares of Corm. noaalth revenue<br />
that go to the_ Sta# tes.<br />

All th e Premiers ac owledged at Pr: miers' Col): Zrences<br />
in July and Oc tobcri of 1977 thcat their circumstances<br />
had changed very signifi. ant3y since these relaltivi ties<br />
were eatablished.<br />
There would be no point in discussing thesermatters uriti).<br />
we receive the report from the CronethGrants Co~ mssion<br />
in June.<br />
What we will be discussing, amongst oither izattc-rs, on<br />
April is the actual sharc of onowelhrovenues that<br />
should go to the States in total. ThSs of course is of<br />
great interest to the Comnonwealth because it affects the<br />
Conunonweolth's budget.,~./ 17 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The other issue, of the CraritB Cornmission Report, i's of much<br />
greater relevance to the States, It does not affect the<br />
Commnonwath budget. It does affect the breakup of Comxoweal~ th<br />
-pxovided revenue between the States.<br />
Somel reportvg this mnorningj show i-nordinate confusion between<br />
these two issues.<br />
One nflewspaplr also said in a headliine this niorning that I<br />
had put a D2lap to the Queensland Premier for a '" rcsources<br />
boom levy scheme", 2 put no such proposal to the Premier.<br />
V1That I did svyesterday at my join-t inew8 conference with<br />
the QueensiThnd1 Prernie. r! is that all governmentg should be as<br />
restra~. , Ai their own expenditure as possible.<br />
It is t'tri: enterprise be givien room to grow<br />
and t! 7. a 211 ofeg; oevsecr nment viust bell in achieving this<br />
obj ec ti<br />
it ~ tn ha hl m~~ re-trwirt in the Corimonwealth<br />
r-ector d eCraaed between, Llune 1) 75 and June 1980, the States<br />
and their auLhorit'lZs added 95,600 workers to their payrolls.<br />
The Colwnonealth's spending. on goods and service s now<br />
uses a smaller proportion of the nation's total resources<br />
than it did 10 years ago while spending by the States and<br />
local authoritics on goods and services has increased<br />
substantially. The States and local-authorities are expected to require abri-ost.<br />
$ 1,400 million rore for borrowing in 1980-81 thann in<br />
1975-76, </p>
<p>3<br />
On borroA. ing1i the CoronweaLth has decreased its<br />
reqquirerftert while the States have increased their<br />
-requirements. The point'to be made at the Pre-iers' Conference is that<br />
restraint is required by all goavernmentL.<br />
The StALtes which spend more than 50% of e. l the dollars<br />
that are sient by governments, shouldf also show restrainL<br />
in their spending ie the general objactive of tax cuts. is to<br />
be achiev d.<br />
In that cbjective of reducing tax, 1 kn\ ow that the Quee: sland<br />
Premier is in agreement with mne.<br />
I would h' that he would also agrea u. ith me on the need<br />
for C: C7~ u C re-raint. 1<br />
