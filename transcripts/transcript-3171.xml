I THE PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFFRFTJCF:<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
TUESDAY 26 FEBRUARY 1974<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.* There are a<br />
couple of things that I can announce to you because the telegrams<br />
to the Premiers concerned will have been-. received by now.<br />
Today Cabinet considered the Universities Commission's Report<br />
on the Victorian Governent's proposal for a multi-campus university at<br />
Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo. We decided that we ' were'not prepared to<br />
support the Victorian Government's proposal, but we will establish a<br />
university at Geelong. The Geelong University will incorporate the<br />
. theaxti sting College of Advanced Education and the Teachers College in<br />
city. This is in line with the proposal by the Universities<br />
Commission in its report to the Government. I advised the Premier<br />
of Victoria of our decision and I suggested to him that in Ballarat<br />
and Bendigo the existing College of Advanced Education and the Teachers<br />
College in each city should be merged to form a major College of<br />
Advanced Education in each city. With respect to the provision of<br />
opportunities to university study in Ballarat and Bendigo, I believe<br />
that this could be met by the establishment of regional study centres<br />
in association with such institutions as may be recommended by the<br />
committee for an open university. Mr. Beazley, the Minister for<br />
Education, will be providing further details of the Government's<br />
decision. The report of the Universities Commission on the multi-campus<br />
Cnuiversity at Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo and its recommendations<br />
for Geelony) were sent to Mr. Hamer a few days ago.<br />
Also, I have told the Premier of New South Wales that we shall<br />
be happy for blue Pole6 to be displayed in the art galleries of New<br />
South Wales. It will arrive in Australia at the end of March and it<br />
. Soouugthht to be available for exhibition there in the Art Gallery of New<br />
Wales, to coincide with the opening there of the exhibition of<br />
recent American art. The Government of New South Wales would, of course,<br />
be responsible for indemnifying us against any damage to the painting<br />
during the time it is on exhibition and in the custody of the Art<br />
Gallery of New South Wales. Provided this poses no problem, details of<br />
the exhibition of the painting and security arrangements can be kept<br />
to be settled between the Director of that gallery Mr. Laverty, and the<br />
Director of the Australian National Gallery, Mr. Mollison. Afterwards,<br />
we would be willing to have Blue Poles exhibited in Melbourne and<br />
Adelaide which have air-conditioned galleries. Are there any questions?<br />
F QUESTION: Was it your wish, Sir, that Mr. Charles Perkins should<br />
not be charged under the Public Service Act?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Whether it is my wish iz relevant because the Head<br />
of the Department in which Perkins serves, the Department of Aboriginal<br />
Affairs, Mr. Dexter, tlic3 Secretar~ y of the Department, has the<br />
jurisdiction and, in some circumstances, the duty to charge Mr. Perkins<br />
or some other person, any other person in his Department, who he believes<br />
has contravened the provisions of the Public Service Act. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Now that is something which is the statutory function of the Permanent<br />
Head of the Department. Neither the Minister nor the Cabinet can direct<br />
a Permanent Head as to the discharge of his duties in this respect.<br />
If the Permanent Head believes that a charge should be made against an<br />
employee of his department he suspends that employee, he reports the<br />
suspension to the Public Service Board and the Public Service Board<br />
can then appoint a Board of Inquiry to try the matter. That Board<br />
makes findings which then go to the Governor-General who acts on the<br />
advice of the Government at that stage in implementing or rejecting.<br />
or varying any recommendation finding that the Board of Inquiry makes.<br />
I have a copy of the charge against Mr. Perkins. I could say that if I<br />
was a Permanent Head I would not have laid the charge. The charge is<br />
that Mr. Perkins was guilty of improper conduct in criticising certain<br />
political parties represented in the Parliament.* I don't know what<br />
evidence Mr. Dexter, the Permanent Head, would have of the nature of<br />
Mr. Perkins criticism other than the evidence that all of us have<br />
reading the newspapers. All that I can say for myself is that no<br />
leader or in fact member of any of the political parties criticised<br />
mine has been among them has complained to me or to anybody in my<br />
Shearing of those criticisms. In particular, I gather, the basis of the<br />
Vimproper conduct in Mr. Dexter's view, I assume this, I have not discussed<br />
this with Mr. Dexter directly or indirectly. The basis of his view is<br />
that Mr. Perkins was guilty of improper conduct in criticising the Liberal<br />
and Country Parties. If I was a Permanent Head I would wait for the<br />
leader or some persons acting on behalf of those parties to complain of<br />
the criticism and to state the nature of the evidence that he would<br />
give or call. If a Leader of a political party made such a complaint<br />
and was willing to give or call evidence in support of the complaint<br />
-then I can well understand that a Permanent Head would suspend the<br />
pea-son. After all, the Act says Section 56 that any person can<br />
cha; 3: ge a Public Servant any person and that would include Sir<br />
Chctrles Court or anybody else who may feel himself aggrieved but<br />
whose own manner of political comment on other political parties might<br />
well have inspired Mr. Perkins.<br />
QUESTION: Would you say Sir, that the implementation of the Labor<br />
Party's Aboriginal policy has been a disaster?<br />
SP RIME MINISTER: No, but it has been suggested by my colleague, I<br />
Wgather, that that is the headline that members of the National Press<br />
Club might like to use.<br />
QUESTION: How would you describe it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: , It is making progress in a very difficult field.<br />
We have the first Australian Government in office now which has ever<br />
tried to do anything directly in the Aboriginal field. It is the first<br />
Australian Government which has tried to exercise the Constitutional<br />
powers which were conferred on the Parliament by the overwhelming<br />
vote of the people at the referendum in 1967.<br />
QUESTION: Both Sir Charles Court and Senator Withers have complained<br />
about mr. Perkins statement in Perth there was a press statement issued<br />
by Senator Withers.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: In that case Sir Charles Court could write to me and<br />
Senator Withers could. Senator Withers has on many matters concerning<br />
his own perks, at least he could about the people. I do want make the<br />
point that any person can charge a Public Servant, any person, including<br />
Senator Withers or Sir Charles Court. ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
if, furthermore, Senator Withers or Sir Charles Court were to state the<br />
nature of the evidence that he would give or call, I would think it would<br />
be a reasonable proper thing for the departmental head concerned to<br />
suspend the Public Servant concerned.<br />
QUESTION: Senator Cavanagh has been under frequent attack ever since,<br />
for Aboriginals that he is supposed to be helping<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Who he is helping.<br />
QUESTION: ever since you appointed him to the position. I wonder<br />
whether you think that any other Minister would also . be under attack,<br />
and if you don't think that, do you think that your appointment was a<br />
mistake? PRIME MINISTER: I think that anybody who holds this portfolio will be<br />
subject to attack; it goes with the job. I believe-Senator Cavanagh<br />
is doing a very good job, he has my complete support.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, is Section 56 of the Public Service Act one<br />
which you wquld repeal if the Freedom of Information Act ever gets off<br />
the ground? Do you feel yourself, that is is not in accordance with<br />
the policy of your Government that Public Servants should be prohibited<br />
from speaking out when complaints are made against them by private<br />
citizens, politicians or anybody else in this sort of area?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Freedom of Information Bill will be introduced by us,<br />
There is a very great deal of legislation, as you know, to which we are<br />
committed. ' We are committed to this legislation. Already I can say,<br />
it is clear that there will be more Bills introduced this year than last<br />
year. Section 56 and similar cognate sections of the Public Service Act<br />
are being reviewed by the Public Service Board in consultation with the<br />
various Public Service unions. I have thought for a long time, and I<br />
still think, that Section 56 is too vague. I think that like so many<br />
of the provisions of the Commonwealth Criminal Law, for instance, the<br />
amendments of the Crimes Act in 1960it is aimed to be A deterrent,<br />
it's so vague that it's not a proper law. The Public Servants don't<br />
know where they stand, in fact I suppose it could be said that the<br />
Sections and the previous one, Section 55, are so wide that I wouldn't<br />
* be at all surprised if a Board of Inquiry were to find the charge not<br />
proven and I would be surprised if the Governor-General would be advised<br />
by the Government to implement any adverse finding against a Public<br />
Servant charged. I don't know what the evidence is, but if the evidence<br />
which is to be brought against Mr. Perkins consists of no more than his<br />
remarks about and reposts to Sir Charles Court I would regard it. as<br />
fantastic for an adverse finding to be made by any Board of Inquiry<br />
appointed by the Public Service Board.<br />
QUESTION: Despite everything that you have said tonight, have you taken<br />
any steps whatsoever in the last twenty-four hours to influence a NO<br />
decision on the Perkins affair?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, no. I told you I have not spoken directly or<br />
indirectly to the Permanent Head. I have-also told you that the<br />
Permanent Head -has jurisdiction and maybe the duty under the Act to<br />
lay charges to make suspensions. / 14 </p>
<p>-4<br />
QUESTION: What about the Minister, did you discuss that particular<br />
point with him?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. He takes the same attitude, the last time I spoke to<br />
him which was some weeks ago on this matter. It is the Permanent Head<br />
who . suspends, the Minister can charge but the minister has not charged.<br />
No other Minister has charged, no political leader has charged, any<br />
of them, or in fact, any person that's what the Act says, any<br />
person can make a charge.<br />
QUESTION: But the Minister told us at lunch time that he had spoken to<br />
you about this this'morning, and that whether your attitude was right or<br />
wrong, as he said, he thought it would be wrong-of him to reveal it<br />
because it might influence what he insists on referring to as the trial<br />
of Mr. Perkins. Have you any comment on that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. As I have said, I haven't heard what was said<br />
so I am not going to comment.<br />
* QUESTION: But you did speak to him about this this morning?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I take the attitude, and he knows I take the attitude<br />
that it's the Permanent Head's job. Now look, can I be clearer than that?<br />
QUESTION: Did you speak to Senator Cavanagh about this this morning?<br />
PRIME MINIST * ER: I spoke to him about this ritatter in general terms,<br />
but not about any charge.<br />
QUESTION: What view did you express then to him?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You don't expect me to talk about conversations of this<br />
character, do you. We have conversations sometimes, and I don't reveal<br />
them. QUESTION: In view of what happened tonight?<br />
SPRIME MINISTER: My own attitude is pretty clear from what I have said,<br />
WI would have thought. If I was Permanent Head you know what I would be<br />
doing, but the fact is, this is the Permanent Head's job and it is not<br />
my right to influence him. I don't come into it unless there is a<br />
recommendation by a Board of Inquiry to the Governor-General. Then<br />
if the only evidence that comes up is what I have seen hitherto in<br />
the papers, you've got a fair indication of what my attitude would be.<br />
QUESTION: Did you seek to make known your views to Mr. Dexter through<br />
a senior Public Servant?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. Gentlemen, I have already stated that I have not<br />
been in touch with Mr. Dexter directly or indir;-ctly. Now I don't have<br />
to answer each of you individually and repeat that.<br />
QUESTION: Was the Perkins matter raised in Cabinet?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. not at all. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Do you support Mr. Perkins comments which have now lead to<br />
this charge?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I regret that Mr. Perkins speaks as strongly as he does.<br />
But I do understand the situation that nobody in Mr. Perkins position,<br />
the most important position that an Aboriginal Australian has had for<br />
nearly two centuries could be expected to remain silent on subjects about<br />
which he must know, to have views, and experience and responsibilities.<br />
I make allowance for the fact that he has respQnsibilities in an area<br />
where there have been very great wrongs and shortcomings and his own<br />
effectiveness in doing his job is reduced if he is mute, when other people<br />
speak or who are reported as speaking on some of these matters where he<br />
is involved.<br />
QUESTION: In view of what you have said, will you be taking any steps<br />
to make your views known directly to a Board of Inquiry other than as it<br />
may be reported in the Press Conference here today?.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The only think that I-would think that I could have<br />
anything to do with the Board of Inquiry is whether legal representation<br />
is to be made available for the person charged, obviously I think it<br />
should be.<br />
QUESTION: On a point that Mungo raised, on the Freedom of Information<br />
Act, Mr. Perkins has drawn a distinction between Public Servants speaking<br />
on issues involving social change and issues of defence and foreign<br />
policy. Do you accept that there is a distinction and that Public<br />
Servants ought to be able to speak on questions involving social issues?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: In general terms I accept that. Mind you, in answering<br />
your question, I don't want to endorse your summary of what Mr. Perkins<br />
may have said. I haven't got in front of me a report, let alone all the<br />
reports, , of what he said on this subject. I think that there must be<br />
limitations on what a First or Second Division Public Servant says about<br />
matters of policy where he is or could be involved himself. But I would<br />
regard it as quite wrong and quite apart from that, quite futile to<br />
silence Public Servants in respect of matters where they don't have an<br />
0official responsibility themselves. Everybody knows that Public Servants<br />
have political views; it would be extraordinary if they were the only<br />
political muters in the community.<br />
QUESTION: In view of your comments about what you wouldn't have done if<br />
you had been Mr. Dexter, do you have confidence in Mr. Dexter's<br />
administration as Permanent Head of the Department, and do you plan<br />
to keep him on as Permanent Head of the Department?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I know of no moves I, myself, wouldn't contemplate<br />
any move to transfer Mr. Dexter elsewhere. I believe Mr. Dexter is<br />
a dedicated person. I agree with what Senator Cpvanagh, his Minister,<br />
said about him.<br />
QUESTION: Could you tell me whether the Government has received<br />
applications from the Allwest and the BHP organisations waiving the<br />
exchange control requirements, and if you have, could you tell me what<br />
state they are at at the moment? Do you expect the Government to hand<br />
down a decision before the West Australian elections? </p>
<p>-6<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The parties to the Aliwest project sent submissions<br />
on the 11th of this month, they were received in the Department on<br />
the 14th of this month, and there was a submission before Cabinet<br />
today and before the Economic Committee of Cabinet yesterday concerning<br />
those applications. We have referred it to the Inter-departmental<br />
Committee on Foreign Takeovers for examination and report to the<br />
Cabinet by 14 March. The Minister for the Environment and Conservation<br />
has been requested to report to the Cabinet by the same date on the<br />
environmental aspects of the proposal and the Minister for Urban and<br />
Regional Development has been requested to report to the Cabinet by<br />
14 March also, on the implications of the proposal for the Bunbury Collie<br />
region. I would therefore expect that Cabinet could consider the matter<br />
on Monday 18 March, but couldn't consider it before.<br />
QUESTION: Could I ask you about the BHP Jumbo Plant any proposal from<br />
them? PRIME MINISTER: Yes, BHP wrote to the Minister for Secondary Industry<br />
SMr. Enderby, or maybe to his Department, I think on 7 February. But in<br />
Vall events, it was not until this month. We decided in the Economic<br />
Committee yesterday and in Cabinet today the form of the reply to the<br />
letter. Mr. Enderby, Mr. Crean and I are settling it. I hope we do<br />
it today but otherwise I expect we would do it tomorrow.<br />
QUESTION: From what you have just said the Department of the<br />
Environment and Conservation is to report on the environmental aspect<br />
of the Allwest program by 14 March. Do you think that a period of<br />
16 days is adequate for a full environmental study of the consequences<br />
for the introduction of the scheme, and what will you do if the<br />
Department says that it can't give you such a report in that time?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There has already been, I am told the Premier of<br />
West Australia Mr. Tonkin has emphasised to me that there has already<br />
been an environmental impact statement by the State Authority concerned<br />
and the West Australian Government, Mr. Tonkin's Government, has had<br />
experience in other development projects of this nature other<br />
bauxite and alumina projects. Nevertheless, we feel that as an<br />
SAustralian Government which can, in due course, have responsibilities<br />
Wto grant export licences, we must also check the environmental aspects<br />
ourselves. From that fact it might be appropriate to mention to you<br />
that I have written to the Premiers sometime ago, I haven't had any<br />
replies, I think, on two general matters in the environmental field.<br />
The Lake Pedder situation shows that the Australian Government can be held<br />
responsible for public works, government works, carried out with furnds<br />
raised by the Australian Government pursuent to decisions of the Loan<br />
Council. Accordingly, I have suggested to the Premiers that the<br />
Australian Government and the State Government concerned should have a<br />
joint environmental survey of any Government work, loan program, which<br />
might have environmental aspects. In that case we know, all of us on the<br />
Loan Council know in advance what the implicati6ns will be. There can<br />
not be the allegations later on that the people have had second thoughts<br />
or that they come in too late. The other thing concerns private<br />
developmental projects which may have an export factor. My Government<br />
has taken tne attitude that we must consider environmental owner-ship,<br />
foreign ownership, industrial aspects of projects from which exports<br />
will flow. It can be said, and it has been said, that when we want to<br />
be satisfied on those aspects it's somewhat late in the day, -he projects<br />
are under way. So, therefore, I have suggestedi to all the Premiers<br />
that in respect to those private projects for which they are asked to<br />
give their permission, exploration, exploitation, then we would also<br />
join in an environmental impact statement with them. Then, everybody<br />
knows from not only the State Governments which has some responsibilities, </p>
<p>-7<br />
but from the Australian Government which has the export responsibility,<br />
at least, whether the project will meet acceptable criteria.<br />
QUESTION: Is the question of the continuation of subsidies on nitrogenous<br />
fertiliser and superphosphate now both before the Industries<br />
Assistance Commission. Have you asked the Commission to expedite the<br />
inquiry into this. Is it feasible for these subsidies to be selective<br />
in their application for farmers or small farmers, or farmers in certain<br />
areas to receive this superphosphate bounty but not large pastoral<br />
companies? PRIME MINISTER: On thie last one I would think that the approach that<br />
would be preferable and might be constitutional, I doubt if the other<br />
one distinguishing between big and small farmers would be constitutional,<br />
but the one which would be more likely to be constitutional and which<br />
would also be a more rational one, I think, would be to choose between<br />
particular industries which use some substance for which a bounty is<br />
sought. The Government has considered the question of the superphosphate<br />
Sfertilizers bounty; it has not considered the question of the nitrogenous<br />
Vfertilizer bounty. The Industries Assistance Commission has before it'a<br />
reference concerning nitrogenous fertilizers from the people who make<br />
them. They are seeking a tariff against nitrogenous fertilizers which<br />
are imported. The question of referring the overall question of an<br />
overall bounty on superphosphate fertilizers was considered but we were<br />
assured by the AIC that it would be impossible for them to make a<br />
report this year. In those circumstances the Cabinet decided not to<br />
recommend that the present Act, which expires at the end of this calendar<br />
year, be renewed.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, you stated in your announcement of 15 February<br />
that you were giving primary producers plenty of time to make adjustments.<br />
When can we expect a decision on the nitrogenous bounty?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know. I think it is a few months.<br />
QUESTION: The Hungarian public has been watching with great interest<br />
how rapidly you began to implement. Australia's new independent foreign<br />
policy. What do you regard as the major achievement in this area?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: My Government has emphasised the responsibility tha ' t it<br />
has to develop direct relations with all countries in its region the<br />
East Asian and South-East Asian, South Pacific and Indian Ocean area<br />
irrespective of ideology. We want to have normal relations with all the<br />
Governments in this region. Accordingly, we have also wanted to have<br />
direct relations, not merely relations which are subsidiary to those<br />
arranged on either side of the north Atlantic. I was told you might ask<br />
some questions, but I didn't realise it would be quite as wide, but<br />
perhaps I might take this opportunity to say that late last year,<br />
following negotiations in Budapest, between Hungarian officials and<br />
Australian officials, a text for a revised and updated Trade Agreement<br />
with Hungary has been agreed on at official level, and this followed<br />
Hungary's recent accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.<br />
So I can give this as an illustration to where an opportunity arises f or<br />
us to have new relations or augmented relations with some countries we<br />
swiftly take that opportunity.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, last week you intervened in the Northern<br />
Territory Legislative Council and sought the postponement of consideration<br />
of legislation related to mining in national parks in the Northern<br />
Territory. I understand you had discussions on this matter. Could<br />
you tell me the outcome of the discussions? ./ 8 </p>
<p>8<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The relevant Ministers are discussing this question.<br />
The Minister for the Northern Territory, the Minister for Minerals and<br />
Energy, and the Minister for the Environment and Conservation. </p>
