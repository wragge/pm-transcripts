PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON PAUL KEATING MP, PRIME MINISTER,<br />
ADDRESS TO ) PARLIAMENTARY DINNER<br />
JANUARY 2 19391<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Twenty years ago when I was first introduced to you by<br />
Alexis Johnson I could not have forseen that I would have<br />
the honour of receiving you as President of the United<br />
States, and that the honour would be compounded by welcoming<br />
your wife.<br />
Your visit to Australia is a manifestation of a friendship<br />
between our two'countries and underlines the importance you<br />
attach to Australia as an Asian Pacific country.<br />
There is, of course, much that binds our friendship a<br />
common culture; a common language is another reason.<br />
Churchill, of course, said that the United States and the<br />
United Kingdom were two nations divided by a common<br />
language.<br />
Marshall Green, a former distinguished US Ambassador<br />
maintained t: hat much the same could be said of Australia and<br />
the United States, and I think there is a lot in that.<br />
Indeed we have different spelling for different words, and<br />
of course di~ fferent accents. One of our great long-standing<br />
Parliamentarians, a person by the name of Fred Daly, used to<br />
tell the story of a visit he made to Alabama just after<br />
World War Ill.<br />
In those days, of course, calls were put through by operator<br />
and an international call was a very big deal indeed. He<br />
wanted to call his wife in Sydney personally. He told the<br />
operator he wanted Mrs Daly and a certain number. And she<br />
said " certainly Sir, Mrs Dily". He said, " no, Daly". She<br />
said, " yes Sir, Dily". He said, " no Daley, She<br />
said, " yes Sir, " No, no", said Fred, A as<br />
in Alabama". I After a brief pause she came back politely,<br />
but quite firmly, and said, " ain't no i in Alabama, Sir". </p>
<p>An Australian friend of mine living in Washington escaped<br />
from the Beltway for a weekend in West Virginia where he had<br />
a conversation with the Park Ranger about bears and about<br />
deers. The Ranger, curious about the funny way my friend<br />
talked, said, " where's you from?". And my friend said,<br />
" Washington". And the Ranger nodded and said, " Knowed you<br />
had an accent".<br />
There are a lot of similarities, Mr President, a lot of<br />
similarities. The phone book is one. Our directory is like<br />
yours. The Canberra phone book is only about this thick.<br />
But there's a column of Bushes, there's a solid set of<br />
numbers there for the Bush Fire Brigade, but there's no<br />
mention of Pennsylvania Avenue. There are some Scowcrofts<br />
and Keatings. But, of course, there's a couple of columns<br />
of Lees, and a few of Kims, and a few Italian, German and<br />
Dutch names, also Jewish and Muslim names. Our societies<br />
have both come to include many different cultures, but they<br />
started in the same place.<br />
We were both called upon to choose, in the words of one of<br />
our poets Henry Lawson " between the old dead tree of the<br />
countries we came from and the young tree green of our new<br />
countries". We both received what your poet, Robert Frost,<br />
called " the gift outright", the continent, or in your case a<br />
pretty good share of it.<br />
We were given it. And as Robert Frost wrote, " at first we<br />
were still England's colonials. In time we gave ourselves<br />
to our new countries and the people and the land have now<br />
become one.<br />
These diffe: cences of languages to one side, you have flown<br />
14 000 miles to see us. American leaders have had a tough<br />
time in our part of the world, but they are rarely<br />
discouraged. Lyndon Johnston was attacked by flying in the United States<br />
Airforce in the Pacific, John Kennedy's torpedo boat was<br />
sunk in the Solomon Islands, Richard Nixon was a naval<br />
officer in fighting around Bouganville, and you, Mr<br />
President, flew fifty eight missions in the Pacific War and<br />
was shot down once. But you came back. And I can assure<br />
you I breath a sigh of relief when Airforce One touched down<br />
safely on New Years Eve.<br />
You arrived in 1991 just over fifty years to the day when<br />
our wartime Prime Minister, John Curtin, published his<br />
appeal to the United States after Pearl Harbour. He said,<br />
" I make it quite clear", he declared, " that Australia looks<br />
to America free of any pangs as to our traditional links or<br />
kinship with the United Kingdom. </p>
<p>It was a bi~ g change. Though Australian and American ties<br />
have a much longer history. And you yourself referred to<br />
the Bicentennary of the first ship visit today from the<br />
Philadelphia. Prime Minister John Curtin's 27 December 1941 appeal for US<br />
support in the Pacific war built on a history of economic<br />
and cultural ties, but it began a much closer, strategic tie<br />
which was consolidated by ANZUS, signed as a treaty on 1<br />
September 1951, which underlines our commitment to joint<br />
facilities. Since John Curtin's appeal, we have since fought together in<br />
three conflicts, most recently in Desert Storm, making five<br />
military engagements together in all, and without including<br />
the silent war the cold war over the end of which you so<br />
nobly presided.<br />
Mr President, this visit, through the Asia-Pacific was the<br />
first in a long time for an American President through a<br />
region of peace. We can now take stock and plan the future.<br />
I've learnt quite a deal on this visit, both about the<br />
President and about his policies.<br />
We have an American President, a dominant Western Leader, I<br />
believe who cares about the world. A leader who not only<br />
cares about the world and America's role in it, but knows<br />
about it. A leader who, having triumphed over the West's<br />
opponents, now wants to make the world a bigger and better<br />
place for everybody.<br />
This world -was last like it was in 1914, as we now see the<br />
old Russian States rejoining the world economy, as we see<br />
Central Europe, India, China, and the countries of South<br />
America, provides a new opportunity to shape up the world's<br />
trading system. And as Bretton-Woods provided that great<br />
historical opportunity for the economic system post-1945, a<br />
new opportunity exists for the world trading system post-<br />
1992, not just for now but for the next century.<br />
In the end it was the economic superiority of the West that<br />
defeated Soviet Communism, not military superiority. And it<br />
is that economic superiority that has to be expanded and<br />
buttressed. Only in this way can it be a bigger and better<br />
place for everybody.<br />
The vehicle for' this is trade, and the vehicle for that is<br />
GATT, and the key to GATT is Uruguay, and the key to Uruguay<br />
is agriculture.<br />
An open trading system is the way to go, which I think is<br />
what we all wish.<br />
I </p>
<p>We also, Mr President, took comfort from your words today.<br />
You said we know that our security is inextricably linked to<br />
stability across the Pacific and we will not put that<br />
security and stability at risk.<br />
We want the US straddling an open system in both oceans for<br />
the benefit of all. That means we need GATT and we need an<br />
US economic involvement in the Pacific.<br />
Much of the policy between our two countries has been<br />
likened to a fan with spokes, with the hub of the fan in<br />
California and the spokes going to the treaties of Korea,<br />
Japan and Australia. We'd like to put some fabric on that<br />
treaty to make the weave tighter for a lot of bilateral<br />
conversations between the countries, conversations which are<br />
conversations between non-Americans which, in such an<br />
arrangement, a country like Australia has independence while<br />
keeping and strengthening bilateral links with the United<br />
States. Mr President, on behalf of all Australians, thank you for<br />
coming to Australia. Thank you for accepting the<br />
responsibilities of global leadership. And we wish you well<br />
for the balance of your journey and the greater task ahead.<br />
With those words it now gives me great pleasure to call on<br />
another good friend of the United States, the Leader of the<br />
Opposition. </p>
