STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J1 KEATING NP<br />
MEETING WITH PREMIERS AND CHIEF MINISTERS<br />
I am writing to the Premiers and Chief Ministers proposing<br />
that they meet on it May in Canberra to advance a range of<br />
measures for imptouving national economic and structural<br />
efficiency, including measures announced in my recent<br />
Statement, " One Nation", and other issues of concern to the<br />
States. It is important for the nation as a whole that the States<br />
and the Commonwealth work co-operatively on the matters that<br />
are of concern to them and join forces to advance the reform<br />
agenda. I very much welcome the indication from all Premiers and<br />
Chief Ministers of their willingness to work co-operatively<br />
with the Commonwealth to progress urgent reforms,<br />
particularly in the areas of training, transport and<br />
electricity, that were given prominence in the " One Nation"<br />
Statement.<br />
Premiers and Chief Ministers will be advised of arrangementt<br />
for the annual financial Premiers' Conference in the near<br />
future.-<br />
CANBERRA 29 March 1992 </p>
