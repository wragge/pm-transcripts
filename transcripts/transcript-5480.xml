FOR MEDIA THURSDAY NOVEMBER 6 1980<br />
REVIEW OF THE FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNM-. ENT<br />
AND OF PUBLIC SERVICE STAFFING LEVELS<br />
It has been the Government's continuing aim since 1975 to<br />
mainta'in strict control over the size of the public sector and<br />
of the Public Service.<br />
The Government remains committed to the principle that growth<br />
in the private sector, not expansion of the public sector, is<br />
the right course if permanent reductions in unemployment and<br />
increases in prosperity and wealth for the community as a whole<br />
are to be achieved.<br />
The imposition of limits on the staffing of Public Service<br />
departments and authorities has been an important weapon in<br />
restraining the growth of Government. Since we came to office<br />
effective staff ceilings have been imposed and the number of<br />
Commonwealth employees in areas subject to staff ceilinpgs has<br />
been reduced by over 10,000.<br />
At the same time, where there are areas of genuine need we have<br />
increased staffing to provide the necessary services. Thus<br />
some 65 new regional offices for the Department of Social Security<br />
have been opened in the last five years, and staffing in : hat<br />
Department has increased by 3,000.<br />
Similarly, the Commonwealth Employment Service, since the<br />
Norgard Ieport was accepted by the Government, has considerably<br />
expanded the services it provides to those seeking work for<br />
example, the Special Youth Employment Training Program and<br />
the School to Work Transition Program. Staffing has increased<br />
by about 1,000 in the past five years.<br />
There are also areas of Government activity which are commercial<br />
by nature, or akin to commercial for example, the Postal and<br />
Telecommunications Commissions, and the Government Defence<br />
factories. The Postal and Telecommunications Commissions have<br />
experienced large increases in demand in recent years. They have<br />
for the most part kept pace with this growLh" by increased efj: icienc-,.<br />
But their business is expanding so strongly that in 1979-80 staffigC:<br />
levels in Australia Post and Telecom increased by nearly<br />
1,500 and that upward trend is continuing. 1/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Also, because of our increased defence effort, employment<br />
in the Government Defence factories is currently rising<br />
and this trend is expected to continue. Again, this reflects<br />
a necessary demand which must be met either by increased<br />
production in Australia or overseas.<br />
Thus our record of an overall, net reduction of more than<br />
10,000 in total public service staffing has been achieved<br />
even after making necessary increases in some areas so that<br />
appropriate services can be provided to the public. Those who<br />
analyse changes in Commonwealth staffing levels need to bear<br />
that in mind.<br />
The Government's; achieveme~ t in reducing the total of staffing7<br />
even while increasing staffing in some areas to meet commercial<br />
demands and to provide better services, also needs to be compared<br />
with the record of the previous Government where the number of<br />
Commonwealth Government employees increased by 52,000 from<br />
June 1972 to June 1975.<br />
Associated with the announcement on Sunday of a reduced Ministry<br />
and fewer departments, the Government's policy of strict controls<br />
on staffing levels in Commonwealth employment will continue.<br />
The Government is reviewing the provisional staff ceilings set<br />
for departments for 30 June 1981; that review will also identify<br />
the staff savings to be ac'hieved through the departmental<br />
rationalisation. The Government will maintain strict restraint on administrative<br />
costs in 1980-81. Departments and authorities will again be<br />
required to live within the Budget allocation provided to theM.<br />
Controlling the size of the public sector is not just a matte.-<br />
of restraining growth in staff numbers and administrative costf;.<br />
It is also, and most importantly, a matter of re-examining thE:<br />
functions of governiment. This is particularly timely at the<br />
beginning of a new term of office.<br />
The Government has accordingly established a Committee of Senior<br />
Ministers to review the functions of all Commonwealth departments<br />
and other associated agencies.<br />
The review will recommend to the Government which functions mi: ght<br />
be reduced, eliminated, or altered so as to achieve a more<br />
efficient and economical administration of continuing<br />
Commonwealth responsibilities. The review will also examine areas<br />
where Commonwealth activities overlap the States or unnecessa: dly<br />
intrude on the private ector. </p>
<p>w3<br />
The review is a useful further step in the Government's<br />
continuing commitinanrit to resLt-i-n the-size of the public sector,<br />
and Cor" ronwealth outlays in particular, as part of the<br />
Gove rnme nt's8 overall economic strategy, which was endorsed<br />
at the recent Federal elections, There is also a need to avoid<br />
intrusion into ar~ as of ac~ iIit. ycapable of being performed<br />
efficiently by the private sector.<br />
t-sa -time, the Commonwealth will be ensuring that the<br />
less well-off ii) the community are protected, that activities<br />
are concentrated on areas of greatest need, and that the cquality<br />
is mz' 4ntained of those services which are prop vZXXIpL'rovic. lgd;. by<br />

and Commerce, Phillip Lrch, also inc= ius the-11iTit7ter f'OTPrimary<br />
