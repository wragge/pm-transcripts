JOINT NATIONAL OFFICIALS CONFERENCE OF THE<br />
NATIONAL UNION OF WORKERS AND THE<br />
TRANSPORT WORKERS UNION<br />
PENRITH 5 JULY 1991<br />

Friends, This is an important conference, marking as it does a<br />
landmark event in the development of the Australian national<br />
economy. It is of course a milestone in the history of the National<br />
Union of Workers and the Transport Workers Union a<br />
tremendous achievement by two major unions to rationalise<br />
their structures in order to improve the level of services<br />
they provide to their members.<br />
More than that, this conference, and this union<br />
amalgamation, provide proof further proof of the<br />
positive and constructive way the trade union movement as a<br />
whole is involved in the central task facing this nation in<br />
the 1990s: rebuilding the national economy.<br />
And as such you are advancing the interests not only of your<br />
own members ibut of the broader Australian community.<br />
My friends,<br />
As you know, the Australian Labor Party this year celebrates<br />
its centenary.<br />
In 1891, one hundred years ago, the trade union movement<br />
founded the Australian Labor Party in order to secure<br />
through the ballot box the enduring improvements in living<br />
standards that industrial action alone could not secure.<br />
In 1991, one hundred years later, the trade union movement<br />
is still working to improve the welfare of the ordinary<br />
working man and woman and has done so, for the past eight<br />
years, in the closest partnership with the Federal Labor<br />
Government. </p>
<p>As one who has led, first the industrial and now the<br />
parliamentary wings of the labour movement, I take enormous<br />
pride in the sustained and effective nature of that<br />
partnership. It is a partnership best expressed in the Accord between the<br />
trade union movement and the Labor Party.<br />
Since 1983, the Accord has provided the framework for an<br />
effective wages policy based on the twin agreements first,<br />
by the trade union movement, not to exercise its power to<br />
maximise nominal wage increases and second, by the<br />
Government, to deliver reciprocal improvements in the social<br />
wage. For more than eight years, both sides of the Accord have<br />
honoured their commitment.<br />
And we do so still.<br />
Despite the temporary difficulties following the recent<br />
National Wage decision, the trade unions remain totally<br />
committed to that central principle of the Accord the<br />
setting and meeting of targets for the national aggregate<br />
wages outcome and, through that principle the task of<br />
transforming Australia into an internationally effective<br />
economy. That is a fact of crucial significance at this time.<br />
Because Australia now is beginning to emerge from the pain<br />
and hardship of the recession:<br />
in the past 18 months we have brought down<br />
interest rates by seven and a half percentage<br />
points: housing finance approvals and building approvals<br />
are recovering;<br />
the Westpac/ Melbourne Institute Survey shows<br />
consumer confidence is at a two year high and<br />
inflation expectations at a record low;<br />
the June quarter CAI-Westpac survey shows<br />
manufacturers' expectations for the next six<br />
months improving significantly; and<br />
the OECD are forecasting a recovery in the world<br />
economy beginning in the current half year. And<br />
the OECD have endorsed our assessment that the<br />
Australian economy will also begin to recover in<br />
the current half year.<br />
So the first signs of renewed activity and confidence are<br />
starting to emerge.<br />
And the important point is this. </p>
<p>This is not a mere cyclical recovery.<br />
Because of the Accord, this is a recovery that unambiguously<br />
repays pain. with gain.<br />
Emerging from this recession in 1991, Australia has low<br />
inflation in its grasp. The inflation level is at 4.9 per<br />
cent now below the OECD average, and with further falls in<br />
prospect. And the balance of payments has improved substantially.<br />
Figures released this morning show that in May the current<br />
account deficit was just $ 857 million the lowest figure in<br />
three years. And the deficit so far this financial year is<br />
per cent lower than a year earlier.<br />
This improvement is largely due to a massive turnaround in<br />
the trade balance or put simply, exports minus imports<br />
from a deficit of $ 3.6 billion to a surplus of $ 1.7 billion.<br />
Imports are; down by 3.7% associated with the downturn but,<br />
more importantly, exports have continued to grow very<br />
strongly despite the world recession and the collapse in<br />
rural commodity prices. Exports are 8% higher than a year<br />
earlier and, importantly, manufacturing exports have been<br />
the star performer up 24% over a year ago.<br />
This is compelling evidence of the fundamental<br />
transformation of the Australian economy which is taking<br />
place right now The economy is diversifying. The<br />
manufacturing sector is adding to our traditional strengths<br />
in mining and agriculture.<br />
Only under Labor can Australia make this a permanent gain.<br />
Because it is only under Labor that an effective low<br />
inflation wages policy can be pursued.<br />
That is why we can speak with confidence of the period<br />
ahead, the period of economic recovery. Thanks to the<br />
Accord, it will be<br />
a. recovery which will see the resumption of secure<br />
employment growth;<br />
a. recovery in which the competitiveness of<br />
Australia's manufacturing industry will continue<br />
to increase<br />
a recovery in which we will see further<br />
improvements in productivity, through effective<br />
micro-economic reform<br />
a recovery in which Australian workers will<br />
continue to gain access to improved<br />
superannuation; and </p>
<p>a recovery in which award restructuring and union<br />
amalgamation will continue to create better jobs,<br />
better training and better remuneration.<br />
My friends,<br />
That is the broad context which I want you to understand<br />
the framework in which your conference this weekend assumes<br />
its full significance.<br />
The Accord, for all its tremendous significance for the<br />
achievements of the past eight years, will remain a vital<br />
instrument of reform for the future.<br />
Award restructuring and union amalgamation are particularly<br />
important elements of that future reform process.<br />
Together, they are essential to breaking down the<br />
inefficiencies we have inherited from the rigid structures<br />
of our craft based union past structures that cannot serve<br />
us well in a modern economy, because they limit our capacity<br />
for building competitive industries, for securing long term<br />
benefits in workers' pay and conditions, and for ensuring<br />
lasting improvements in living standards.<br />
Through award restructuring, outdated systems are being<br />
transformed into modern structures that reflect the skills<br />
of workers and, through training, that enhance those skills<br />
and make them more relevant to a technologically advanced<br />
and competitive economy.<br />
Through union amalgamation, we are building unions that are<br />
more responsive to changing needs, better equipped for<br />
consultation and negotiation, and less susceptible to the<br />
debilitating disease of demarcation disputes.<br />
Through the cooperation and commitment shown by the unions<br />
represented here today the NUW, the TWU, the Federated<br />
Millers' and Manufacturing Grocers' Employees Association<br />
and the Federated Cold Storage and Meat Preserving Employees<br />
Union you will assist the food processing industry and the<br />
transport industry improve their efficiency and productivity<br />
again, for the benef it of the economy as a whole.<br />
So you are genuinely engaged in a reform task of fundamental<br />
importance both to your members and to the broader<br />
community. I want you to know that you have the unqualified support of<br />
the Federal Government in your amalgamation.<br />
Through legislative changes and through financial support to<br />
the trade union movement, we are actively promoting union<br />
amalgamation as an integral part of our overall task of<br />
economic reform. </p>
<p>In all this, we remained convinced that the only effective<br />
path of economic competitiveness lies through winning the<br />
informed cooperation of the trade union movement not, as<br />
our political opponents would, through regressing to the<br />
days of senseless confrontation and ceaseless union-bashing.<br />
Our agenda depends on securing the support of the union<br />
movement, through the processes of consultation and<br />
cooperation embodied in the Accord.<br />
Throughout the life of this Government the trade union<br />
movement has delivered that support consistently and<br />
farsightedly. In opening this Conference, I express my gratitude to you<br />
for that contribution, and I express the confident hope that<br />
through the amalgamation of your unions your efforts will<br />
grow in effectiveness, to the benefit of Australia's working<br />
men and women. </p>
