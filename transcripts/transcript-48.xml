P. M. 2/ 1959<br />
FOR PRESS: MOVEMENT OF DEFENCE AND SERVICE DEPARTMENTS TO CANBERRA<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister<br />
The first stage in the movement of the Defence and<br />
Service Departments to Canberra had been completed with quite remarkable<br />
efficiency, the Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, said to-day.<br />
" A movement of this nature cannot help but be accompanied<br />
by a legion of problems", Mr. Menzies said.<br />
" Apart from the purely physical problems of housing the<br />
individuals concerned and providing working space and facilities, there<br />
a the necessity for avoiding any disruption in the work of the<br />
Departments. " That this has been achieved in all aspects with a<br />
9inimum of disturbance and complaints is a matter for congratulation for<br />
all those who took part in the move.<br />
" I have received a report from the Minister for the<br />
Interior ( Mr. Freeth) showing just how successfully the move was carried<br />
out. I attach a copy."<br />
CANBERRA, A. C. T.<br />
17th February, 1959. </p>
