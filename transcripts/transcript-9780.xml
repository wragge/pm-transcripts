TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH DEREK GUILLE, ABC REGIONAL RADIO,<br />
OCTOBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
DG: Mr Keating, welcome to the program.<br />
PM: Thank you Derek.<br />
DG: How important are the regional electorates going to be in the next<br />
federal election?<br />
PM: Well, as important certainly as any other electorate in the country and<br />
what is important, I think though, is that now with the emphasis that the<br />
Government has put on regional development and regional -policy in<br />
the Working Nation statement is thiatf regions think that fihey are gifing<br />
a look in,, perhaps for the first time in a long time and they will be<br />
seeing what the major parties have to say both about and for regions.<br />
DG: Certainly, indeed earlier on this progiram earlier this week, Barry Jones<br />
was suggesting that Queensland regional seats were a potential<br />
problem for the ALP.<br />
PM: Just normal public polling in the newspapers suggest that some of our<br />
support in regional Queensland has diminished, but the Government is<br />
the only party which is out there arguing for a larger role for regions. It<br />
is true now that many of the regions in Australia are enjoying more<br />
growth and more prosperity than the capital cities and the regions<br />
which are well lead, where the community groups, the businesses<br />
community, the trade unions, local government, community groups are<br />
coming together and setting goals, they are finding more local<br />
investment, more employment and they are doing better. We have<br />
encouraged this process.<br />
We did a study with McKinsey and Company about two years ago and<br />
what the study found was tat te regions which were well lead were<br />
the regions which kicked along. So, we-are supporting that and we are </p>
<p>supporting them in many other ways. I went to regional Queensland in<br />
the drought and you might remember last November we made a very<br />
big policy change, we suspended the farm assets test for drought<br />
affected farmers. You see, farmers of course, have assets but they<br />
didn't have income, but undeF-the assets test they couldn't receive<br />
income support. We have now got 11,000 farm families picking up<br />
that income support which is putting a floor under many of these<br />
regions. Can I just say about states like Queensland and Western<br />
Australia much of what the Government has done over the last decade<br />
in taking the tariff monkey off the back of Australia really meant taking<br />
the tariff monkey off Queensland and Western Australia. So, the<br />
reason Queensland is growing faster than the national average and<br />
the reason Western Australia is growing faster than the national<br />
average is because national economic policy under this Labor<br />
Government supported those two states and put far more adjustment<br />
pressure on Victoria and New South Wales.<br />
That adjustment pressure is making the Victorian and New South<br />
Wales economies now modern. We are getting out of the old rust<br />
bucket industries and into new ones, but in doing it we have taken that<br />
cost off the big primary exporting states of Western Australian and<br />
Queensland. So, we deserve to do well in the regional areas for that reason.<br />
DG: You were in South Australia earlier this week visiting properties there<br />
and looking at Landcare issues, can you tell us about that visit and the<br />
projects that you saw.<br />
PM: As part of the general debate about the environment, I take the view<br />
that we have been very fortunate to have this great bequest of this<br />
vast continent to a relatively small population and that we have to care<br />
-for and nurture the environment. We are doing this now with the<br />
forests, but we have to also do it with soil and land degradation, to<br />
deal with the quality of the land. What we are seeking to do is to look<br />
at regional precinct approaches to Landcare and whole of farm<br />
management. We have got a very large Landcare movement now,<br />
about a third of farmers are actually in Landcare, but what we have to<br />
do is to look at each farm and manage each property. So, instead of<br />
just looking at a property and saying right, we will cut it into four and<br />
we will put wheat in four paddocks and we'll do this over two or three<br />
years, some soils will simply not grow wheat, some won't grow other<br />
crops. Other places are unsuitable for grazing. Land which is<br />
overgrazed ends up being a dust bowl and blows away, we are losing<br />
top soil. So what we are saying, is let's blend Landcare and whole of<br />
farm management, farm management planning, so that we can see in<br />
which way, right to each farm, how we can preserve the landscape and<br />
make it better and through the Rural Adjustment Scheme, actually help<br />
some farmers get off the land and ' peihfaps'the farmer next door pick<br />
up their property to have a more viable unit. </p>
<p>In some places this will need to happen, in other places not, but there<br />
is no doubt that water quality, salinity, land quality are a part of the big<br />
picture of the environment and we have got to tackle those hard<br />
problems.<br />
DG: Similarly the logging debate is a part of the big picture too and that<br />
seems to me a sort of a flash point at the moment which I don't think<br />
anybody really wanted, but is there still potential for compromise?<br />
PM: Yes, what the Government is attempting to do is what no other western<br />
government, I think, in the world is trying to do. We have set a<br />
benchmark for establishing representative reserve systems for<br />
Australian forests. Instead of just wood chippers and forest people<br />
tearing trees out willy-nilly across the country, what we are saying is<br />
let's establish a system of representative reserves so all of the<br />
important species of trees are represented in an adequate way. That<br />
way we know we are protected in the long run against indiscriminate<br />
logging or other practices. The benchmark we have set is 15 per cent<br />
of the cover which existed prior to European settlement in 1788. No<br />
other OECD or western government has set such a high benchmark.<br />
Most countries, say the United States, are looking at seven to eight per<br />
cent of the cover which existed before settlement. We are looking at<br />
per cent. But to get that cover and to develop these regional forest<br />
agreements, to have representative reserve systems, it takes two or<br />
three years to define, measure and sort these areas so that a Regional<br />
Forest Agreement can be made between the Commonwealth, the<br />
States, the forest industries and the environment movement if you like.<br />
So, what we are doing now, we have laid on the table plans for a three<br />
week discussion, draft plans, draft proposals for what we can Deferred<br />
Forest Areas. These are areas we will put away until we can do the<br />
Regional Forest Agreements, until we can assess how we get a<br />
representatie reserve ytm<br />
In this three week process where we put the plans on the table, you<br />
are going to get all the pushing and shoving from the various interest<br />
groups, but what the Government is seeking to do is what no<br />
Australian government has ever done before.<br />
DG: But how worried are you that the environmentalists are using their<br />
support as a sort of blackmail to try to get a better deal?<br />
PM: They have got to be careful they don't over do it because this is an end<br />
game being played now. This is not just an annual scuffle over<br />
woodchip licences and certain coups small coups, you know, one<br />
hundred metres square. What you are talking about here is the<br />
cataloguing and the inventories of Australia's forests for the long term.<br />
So, if some people in the environment movement exaggerate it, over<br />
play-thir hand, wipe themselves out of the process, they are selling </p>
<p>down the drain the interests of every consciencious Australian who<br />
believes in our environment. They are selling down the tube the<br />
interests of all those young people out there, all those Australians who<br />
believe that we should keep a pristine reserve system of forests and a<br />
government can do no more than try to take this on. Understand this<br />
Derek, the Commonwealth is not a logging authority, the<br />
Commonwealth doesn't have forests the States have the forests. So,<br />
we are now working with the States who have signed up under this<br />
policy. It will never be perfection, but we are trying to get as near to it<br />
as we can in a really good system the likes of which we could have<br />
only dreamt of ten years ago.<br />
There was a bit of macho behaviour, apparently, in an officials meeting<br />
a couple of days ago where a couple of people said look, we are the<br />
enemy and if you don't line up we are going to wipe you characters<br />
out. Well, there is a lot of, I think, interested Australians saying we'll,<br />
this is not mature behaviour, what we want here this is now serious.<br />
There is no way a coalition government would ever do this, there is no<br />
way John Howard would ever be in this. There is no way the Liberal<br />
Party would ever lock up great lumps of the forests in representative<br />
reserve systems. So, they are playing for keeps, a lot of these people<br />
in the environment movement now and they have got to know that. So,<br />
if they take the view that they can, as they put it, knock us over even<br />
though they say this fellow apparently said John Howard wouldn't<br />
give us a quarter of this. What are they saying, we would like to see<br />
the forests decimated to poke a Labor minister in the eye or are they<br />
really putting the interest in the environment first because the<br />
Government is. We can't do more than we are doing now, we are<br />
trying to corral the States into a decent debate and lock up these<br />
areas so they can't go to woodchips or can't go to indiscriminate<br />
logging.<br />
DG: Prime Minister, another issue that i-s a bit of national importance even<br />
though some might think it is a Sydney issue, but Sydney is the<br />
gateway to Australia for many of our international tourists and for those<br />
of us travelling overseas. The Sydney airport is almost a running sore<br />
isn't it?<br />
PM: You are quite right in describing it like that, it is the gateway to<br />
Australia. Since the Government deregulated the airline system,<br />
airfares have fallen by 25 per cent and what that has donie is increase<br />
traffic by 63 per cent. There is 63 per cent more people flying today<br />
than two years ago because a whole new market has been opened up<br />
for low income and middle income people because of the cheaper<br />
fares. We have just got the third runway into Sydney in the nick of<br />
time to pick up that capacity. What John Howard is saying is he wants<br />
to run the cross wind runway again. In other words, you would have<br />
planes coming down intersecting across two other down wind runways<br />
and, of course, it would be inherently unsafe and to make it even<br />
vaguely safe one would have to cW the capacity of Sydney back by </p>
<p>per cent. This would choke up the whole of the east coast traffic grid<br />
and choke up international passage into Australia.<br />
But the point is more than simply about that. John Howard is saying to<br />
the community look, this government had done not a bad job, but they<br />
can't take it any further. They can't crack the hard nuts of the ports<br />
and the wharves and the labour market, leave it to me, I'll wear the hair<br />
shirt and I'll hop into all these unions and I'll hop into the waterfront et<br />
cetera. Because he said micro economic reform is what we really<br />
need. You say well, hang on John, the third runway at Sydney is the<br />
biggest micro economic reform in infrastructure of Australian aviation,<br />
the first bit of pressure in your own seat of Bennelong and what do you<br />
do? You want to cut it back. So, are you to be believed? That you<br />
would be the tough guy that actually hops into the wharves and the<br />
parts, but you never did when you were in government. That you<br />
would fix the labour market and fix it for go and when I say fix it I mean<br />
really fix it by cutting wages, but, you weren't able to reform the labour<br />
market when you were in office.<br />
These are the issues which, I think, are revealed in this airport debate.<br />
It is not just about the capacity of Sydney airport. It is about the<br />
incapacity of Howard to do hard things.<br />
DG: Is it also about the way Sydney is a bottleneck as well, that regional<br />
people getting access to the airport and regions of Australia getting<br />
access to international visitors because of what happens as soon as<br />
people leave the airport.<br />
PM: I made this point at the Labor Party Conference last weekend. A lot of<br />
people will have to hub in NSW and the regions if Mr Howard were to<br />
have his way. For instance, you would find people in northern NSW<br />
couldn't fly in an eight or ten or fifteen seater aircraft to Sydney. They<br />
would have to hub in Newcastle. That will add another hour to their<br />
trip and cost them another hundred dollars. People in western NSW<br />
would have to hub at Dubbo. In southern NSW at Canberra. So, they<br />
couldn't get that direct access. So, they'll get into a wider bodied<br />
aircraft and it will then take them into Mascot. It will add an hour to<br />
their travel, it takes them now roughly an hour, it will be roughly a two<br />
hour trip and it will cost another hundred dollars.<br />
That is unfair, I think, when we now have this capacity and you don't<br />
have to be an aviation expert to know that if you have got two aircraft<br />
running in parallel, they are inherently safer than something crossing<br />
another and crossing two. In the old days we crossed one and even<br />
that we were hostage to a major accident, but crossing two is<br />
impossible.<br />
DG: You have a great reputation as a fighter in political campaigns, the<br />
polls are indicating that the level of support for the ALP from the blue<br />
collar workers isn't there any more, does that worry you or is this.. </p>
<p>PM: It is basically a nonsense. The Bulletin had a poll this week saying<br />
blue collar support is down on 1983 1983 is twelve years ago. The<br />
whole country has changed since 1983. A lot of industries we had<br />
then old rust bucket industries thankfully have gone and we have<br />
got tertiary and service industries now. You can't make the<br />
comparisons for 12 years ago and then they said that we have lost a<br />
quarter of the difference between what we have now and what we had<br />
then, not a quarter of them, but a quarter of the difference. And you<br />
say well, let me get this right, we have lost a quarter of the difference<br />
of a blue collar category of people in industries that today are totally<br />
different to then and yet the Labor Party at the last national elections<br />
picked up its primary vote from 39 per cent to 45 per cent. In other<br />
words the primary vote where they put a number one beside you<br />
went from 39 per cent in 1990 to 45 per cent in 1993. So, let the votes<br />
speak for themselves rather than some shonky poll by some magazine<br />
editor that wants to create a splash. The other thing is, the public are<br />
quite smart about the polls. They see this as a way of needling the<br />
government, you know, how are you going to vote in the next election?<br />
Oh they say, well look, I think I might vote for the Coalition. And then if<br />
you ask them who do you expect to win the election? Oh, I think, the<br />
Labor Party will win the election. It is a bit like a by-election, it is a<br />
chance of having a shot at the government. What the last election<br />
revealed and the one before that is that it is really only close to the<br />
election that people make their mind up and that's why there is a very<br />
large undecided vote sitting there. There is only one poll that matters<br />
and it's a truism.<br />
DG: It is a truism, we'll be watching for that one. You've been involved in<br />
the O'r ange Agribusiness Conference, I think relatively recently, that<br />
was last month, can the govdfrrment do more to ensure that we get<br />
more of our produce and our products into Asia despite things like<br />
EEP and those sorts of impediments that might be there.<br />
PM: I was very heartened by that conference, there were 300 people from<br />
agribusinesses in Australia. The ethnic business ' awards which were<br />
broadcast on SBS last night, I was giving this presentation and you<br />
could see there people for instance growing lettuce. They know that<br />
there is a quality issue here, that they have to get the lettuce to the<br />
markets quickly and this chap who won the award, I think, was flying<br />
tonnes of lettuce out on aircraft a week. What this conference in<br />
Orange was about was how we make that linkage. Instead of farmers<br />
just being price takers for wheat or wool or any other commodity we<br />
actually develop the downstream processing of these materials, of<br />
these foodstuffs and not just that, we take them into the market place.<br />
So, seeing someone like Reg Claires from Woolworths which is<br />
Australia's largest food retailer, his fresh food strategies work very well<br />
for them, taking them into Asia, saying let us see if we can organise<br />
the banks, Woolworths, the big retailers, organise the farm groups to<br />
produce food that we can manage in volume of high quality and sell it </p>
<p>in shelves we control, is a very encouraging development in Australian<br />
agriculture and it is why I attended that conference and why we are<br />
supporting these sorts of policies. In the next week I'm going to be<br />
having another meeting of major interest groups around this very same<br />
subject.<br />
DG: So, that business of there being a partnership between government<br />
and business to be aggressive marketers of what we have got and we<br />
have to constantly prove to the market place that we can continue to<br />
provide though don't we?<br />
PM: Yes, but understand this point about price taking, if you are just<br />
producing wheat if you sell into a world market you take the price the<br />
market gives you, that is all you can take. But, if you are selling to an<br />
Australian flour miller or an Australian producer of noodles or<br />
something and then they are selling them through Woolworths into<br />
Asia you have got a completely different situation on your hands. That<br />
is what we are really looking for.<br />
DG: And negotiations on APEC free trade going on, will this have an impact<br />
on our ability to get more tae it sato<br />
PM: APEC is the biggest diplomatic initiative Australia has ever had and we<br />
have been principally responsible for threading together the largest<br />
free trade area in the world. We are still developing it by threading the<br />
pacific rim countries together. The next meeting is in November which<br />
I will be attending in Osaka. You might remember the historic<br />
declaration which we had at Bogor in Indonesia. Australia has never<br />
been part of a big table like this, never had a seat at a big table like<br />
this. We have always been an island continent, we are not part of the<br />
United States of America, we are not part of the states of Europe, we<br />
have got no natural market so this government has thought how can<br />
we do this? We have done it through the GAiTr, by seven years of<br />
negotiation there to get a better deal in tr~ de -in the World Trade<br />
Organisation, but it is not a regional area of open free trade and that is<br />
what APEC is. This is another point and can I just say John Howard,<br />
my opponent, he doesn't understand any of this. When the Leader of<br />
Vietnam cam here about six weeks ago he wouldn't even meet him.<br />
Do Muoi went back to meet the US Secretary of State in Vietnam two<br />
days later. The week he came to Australia was the week that Vietnam<br />
became a full member of the A$ EA N the Association of S'o uth East<br />
Asian Nations. The Liberal Party has no concept of the need to<br />
deveW6i'Xustralia's bilateral and multilateral trading links and this is all<br />
about what our children do. What sort of lives our children will lead.<br />
What sort of opportunities they will have in 10 years from now and<br />
years is not long. In five or ten years from now the face of Australia's<br />
trading opportunities in Asia will have completely changed. And I am<br />
happy to say because of this government. </p>
<p>8<br />
DG: Just finally Prime Minister, at the moment the ALP holds more regional<br />
seats than the National Party, would you be doing a great deal to<br />
retain that and in conjunction with that many of those seats are very<br />
marginal, 5000 either way would have seen 10 seats change hands,<br />
will the next election be just as close?<br />
PM: I think it will be, but the government has done a great deal about<br />
regional Australia. Firstly, we are the only government that has ever<br />
changed income support measures for the farm sector in this way in a<br />
drought. We are now using the opportunity of the drought, the<br />
problems of the drought to say let's not have this happen again, let's<br />
try to drought proof farms both with the farm savings bond so that<br />
people can save for the rainy day or the non-rainy day as the case<br />
may be or put fodder and water storage on their properties. Let's do<br />
those things, but let's get down to whole of farm management as we<br />
have never done before. Let's try to manage farms properly so that we<br />
have got sustainable agriculture and we are not just burning the<br />
ground up, burning away our heritage. Then let's think about farms in<br />
a regional precinct basis and on top of that then let's think smartly<br />
about how we market it. I don't think any other Australian government<br />
has ever done these things and that's why I think we will get a good<br />
response from the agricultural region and the provincial cities. We<br />
have got infrastructure bonds there to support capital developments in<br />
provincial cities which we have not had before. We've given support<br />
to regional economic development organisations, our consciousness<br />
about the regions is higher than it has ever been.<br />
DG: Still a close election?<br />
PM: They are always close.<br />
DG: They are always close. When will it be?<br />
PM: It will be when the government believes that the Parliament has run its<br />
full course. We are basically at the end of the Parliament now, but<br />
technically it is March next year.<br />
DO: Thank you for your time.<br />
PM: Thank you Derek.<br />
ends </p>
