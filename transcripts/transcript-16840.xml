    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister and the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Penny Wong, today called for nominations for the inaugural Prime Minister's Water Wise Award.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister's Water Wise Award aims to encourage and recognise significant savings in water efficiency by the commercial and industrial sector.</p>
<p>Projects will need to demonstrate notable recent water savings, and a reduction of water use in comparison to other similar facilities.</p>
<p>Eligible water savings can be achieved through a variety of means including metering and monitoring; installing water efficient devices; and implementing innovative technologies that reduce water use.</p>
<p>Delivering on a 2007 election commitment, the award is open to all commercial and industrial water users and will recognise water efficiency excellence for large water users.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government is committed to helping all Australians prepare for a future with less water due to climate change.</p>
<p>In securing Australia's future water supplies, the commercial and industrial sector has an important role to play.</p>
<p>Typically this sector consumes about 15 to 20 per cent of Australia's potable water. Greater water efficiency in this sector helps relieve the pressure on fresh water supplies in urban and regional areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are productivity gains and net economic benefits to be made from using less water, as well as environmental benefits.</p>
<p>Applications close 5pm AEST on 30 November 2009 and the winner will be announced at the 2010 Australian Water Association Awards Dinner in March.</p>
