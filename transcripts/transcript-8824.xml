PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
HEALTH UNDER HEWSON BYE BYE BULK BILLING<br />
Under Dr Hewson's health policy its bye, bye bulk billing.<br />
Thirteen million Australians who now have access to bulk billing will lose it under<br />
Dr Hewson.<br />
That is, their right to visit a doctor and pay nothing goes out the window.<br />
Under Dr Hewson it will be cash up-front at the AMA rate. That's S32 per visit.<br />
Dr Hewson will hand control of our medical system over to the doctors. Doctors will set<br />
their own prices and make health care a privilege instead of a right.<br />
Dr Hewson's health policy was written by the doctors, for the doctors.<br />
The greedy doctors in this country have scored a trifecta Dr Hewson, Dr Woods,<br />
Dr Shepherd.<br />
The AMA would be the faceless men of a Hewson Government.<br />
Dr Hewson says he won't work with any union in Australia except the doctor's union.<br />
The doctors' union has written Coalition health policy and in the process awarded<br />
themselves a massive pay increase.<br />
Bruce Shepherd is Australia's most threatening union boss under Dr Hewson he will<br />
have won foi--s--members a billion dollar bonanza.<br />
It's hard to believe an extra billion dollars for doctors alone.<br />

<p>This is fairness Hewson-style doctors driving BMWs can sec their own fees, charge<br />
what they like. while wage earners are forced onto lower wages through individual. work<br />
contracts. S3 an hour for Australia's youth S3 a minute for doctors.<br />
Doctors are told they can charge what they' can get away with while workers are told to<br />
sign on the dotted line, or get the sack.<br />
By' their own admission Dr Hewson's health policy is " music to the ears' of doctors.<br />
( Leading AMA spokesman following Dr Hewson's address to theAA conference.)<br />
Think about this if you're a young person on Dr HcIwson's S3 an hour wage you'd only<br />
earn S114 a week, If you get crook and visit the doctor it'd cost you $ 32, almost a third of<br />
a week's pay. Even after collecting a rebate thc gap would be $ 14, more than 10 per cent<br />
of your week's pay. On top of that you'd be paying 15 per cent on your transport. 15 per<br />
cent on your clothes. 15 per cent on your takeaway food, and 15 per cent on just about<br />
everything else you use or buy.<br />
If you're a Shift worker it's the same story'. You'll have to sien an individual work<br />
contract, your penalty rates are taken away, your wage will be cut dramatically. You pay<br />
the 15 per cent GST on every'thing and you'll still have to pay the $ 32 up front.<br />
If Dr Hewson doesn't get you on the swing, he'll get you on the roundabout. Everyvwhere<br />
you turn, you'll be paying more.<br />
Every time you put your hand in your pocket. Dr Hewson's hand will be there too.<br />
