TRANSCRIPT OF COMM'ENTS, ELECTORATE OF MAKIN, 4 DECEMBER 1986<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: What do you think about the takeover by Mr Murdoch of the<br />
Herald and Weekly Times?<br />
rl, Very interesting.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why?<br />
PM: I would think by any criterion you would apply, it is an<br />
interesting one. It is going to mean some very significant changes.<br />
Mr Murdoch was courteous enough to come and see me immediately after he<br />
had lodged his offer. And he did me the courtesy of informing me of<br />
the lodging of the offer and indicated, of course, that he would abide<br />
by all requirements of the law as it stood1 or as it would stand.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are those laws strong enough now in view of the takeover?<br />
PM: I think the laws are appropriate.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you concerned that one media magnate can own so much<br />
in Australia?<br />
PM: Let me say this,. first of all. I am fascinated by the bleats that<br />
are coming from the Fairfax Group. I find it fascinating that this<br />
) oup which owns large numbers of newspapers all around the country say<br />
isn't it terrible that someone owns a lot of newspapers. What they<br />
really mean is isn't it terrible that someone may own more than us.<br />
What we are concerned in the proposals that we are putting to the<br />
Parliament is about cross-media domination in regions and if the<br />
proposals that we have are passed it will mean that, importantly, in no<br />
area will one person or organisation be able to have a monopoly of<br />
television, radio and print. And I think that is what is appropriate.<br />
JOURNALIST: But will you have to review your laws in view of this<br />
takeover bid?<br />
PM: I don't see that we will have to review our laws.<br />
JOURNA LIST: So you are happy with it?<br />
PM: It is not a question ot me being happy or not happy. The people<br />
of this country and certainly most of the conservative political forces<br />
have b een arguing, as I understand it for a very long period, the<br />
merits of the market place,-the forces of competition. I think that is<br />
what we are seeing, isn't it?<br />
