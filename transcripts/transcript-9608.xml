TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JOHN STANLEY, RADIO 2UE, 1 JUNE 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JS: Mr Keating good afternoon.<br />
PM: How are you John?<br />
JS: I am very well. Has John Howard been a hard target for you given that<br />
he hasn't given you much to hit at?<br />
PM: Well I said the other day I thought, rather well, that there can be no<br />
honesty or credibility in politics without policies. I mean how can<br />
anybody go around saying I am honest and credible if they are too<br />
cunning or too devious to say what they stand for. As John Howard,<br />
wanting to be Prime Minister of Australia, says he is trying to say<br />
" I am not going to show that Prime Minister my policies". What he is<br />
really saying is " I won't show the Australian community my policies". So<br />
it is not me he is being tricky with. He is tricky with the whole Australian<br />
community.<br />
JS: And yet he is saying that he will outline those policies in the course of an<br />
election campaign and he says he is going to give his broad philosophy<br />
which I think people do know that, don't they?<br />
PM: Well, I mean, his broad philosophy he has only ever had three<br />
outlooks, three political philosophies since he has been here. That is<br />
cutting the wages of people under $ 30,000. What he calls true labour<br />
market deregulation, meaning no award safety net. Letting them fall just<br />
as theyfall 1in America and other countries. The other thing is throwing<br />
top-end benefits to families on very high incomes. And the third thing is<br />
a They're his three things since he has been in politics for twenty<br />
years.<br />
JS: Well can I just take those three things up? The first of those is lowering<br />
wages. He would argue that the true believers, the people who support<br />
Labor, have seen real wages fall under your Government. </p>
<p>PM: That is completely untrue, completely untrue. The best measure of<br />
average living standards in Australia is the measure we call real<br />
household-dTsposable'income and the reason it is the best measure is<br />
because it includes wdg-e salaries, supplements, pensions, social<br />
security benefits, it is also after tax and it is per person. And between<br />
1983 and 1995, that is the twelve years the Government has been in<br />
office, real household disposable income increased by 40 per cent. Now<br />
there wouldn't be another country comparable to Australia with numbers<br />
such as that. I notice today that Peter CostelIlo was running on any radio<br />
station that would take him. He was saying that incomes had fallen and<br />
he said that, I will quote him, " we are as poor, in fact, Australians,<br />
comparable to people overseas, are now as poor as they have ever<br />
been". Well that is just a straight lie and let me just expose the point this<br />
way. If we look at the per person change in real disposable income,<br />
household income, it was 19.8 per cent per year, over the period 1983-<br />
When the Coalition was in office, the best they could do was 2.1 per<br />
cent. So we have been doing in every year that which the Coalition was<br />
able only to do in seven years.<br />
JS: But what people who might be on middle to low incomes who hear all of<br />
these figures say well look I am not 40 per ient better off, I don't feel<br />
better off, I feel like I have gone backwards? What is the problem with<br />
them because you talk to them all the time?<br />
PM: Well you might but the fact of the matter is we have got now very low<br />
inflation, you have had wage adjustments through the period.<br />
Remember this, John Howard has opposed every wage increase since<br />
1983. 1 mean it is just a disgrace for the Liberals to be up there you<br />
see their advertising agency has given them this word ' battler'. And this<br />
is the people who were opposed to every wage adjustment since 1983.<br />
In fact, Peter Costello went into the 1986 National Wage Case arguing<br />
for a reduction in all award rates to $ 25 below the lowest award rate then<br />
applying. You know that they wanted to abolish bulk-billing for the<br />
lowest income people who go to doctors who don't charge them. They<br />
want to put a GST of 15 per cent on their backs for everything. You<br />
know they wanted to kick people off the dole after nine months in their<br />
last election policy. And they are still telling us they want to cut $ 10,000<br />
million from outlays and that will, of course, come out of payments to<br />
families, transfer payments, payments to the aged, to pensions,<br />
payments to schools and they are out there of all people, the Dollar<br />
Sweets man, Costello, talking about battlers.<br />
JS: And yet when they say I mean these are their policies which they say<br />
were rejected at the polls and, therefore, they are not going to proceed<br />
with them. I mean what is the difference when saying that, John<br />
Howard, he wants to put a 15 per cent consumption tax on? Couldn't<br />
that be equally said that you want to put a12 112 per ent one on? You<br />
had your option C. </p>
<p>PM: Yes, but we had over-compensation. We assumed that these people at<br />
the time, low income people, were dis-savers. You know what that<br />
means? That is not only were they spending all of their income, but they<br />
were also spending extra income given them by relatives, or by debt<br />
which they had, or by savings. When the consumption tax came out<br />
from Dr Hewson, Mr Howard and his friends, they had these people on<br />
the most modest income, with savings ratios of somewhere between<br />
and 40 per cent from memory. I mean they never save. Do you<br />
understand the point? In other words, they were saying " the impact of<br />
this tax will be only modest on you because it is only hitting the part of<br />
your income you have got for these savings'. The truth is, under our<br />
arrangements in the 80s, we had massive over-compensation to make<br />
sure that the lowest income people were most protected. These<br />
characters, when they are putting a 15 per cent, right on their backs, at<br />
the same time as they are knocking off bulk-billing.<br />
JS: But that is why they lost the election. They are saying now that they<br />
won't knock off bulk-billing, they won't bring in a consumption tax and, in<br />
the end, isn't it you trying to dredge up their baggage from the past, to<br />
match your baggage? People want to hear what you stand for now, not<br />
what they stood for in the past.<br />
PM: What do you mean people want to hear what we stand for now? What<br />
we stand for now is a 15 per cent superannuation scheme in the Budget.<br />
I mean that is what we stand for. We stand for a person on average<br />
weekly earnings, picking up a lump sum of $ 460,000 at the end of their<br />
working life. Hear what John Howard said about it, he'd cap it he said in<br />
his reply to the Budget two weeks ago. I mean we stand for access and<br />
equity in health through Medicare. Access and equity in education. Do<br />
you know that only three kids in ten completed secondary school in<br />
1983? That is now eight in ten. We have now added 60 per cent of<br />
places to university. I mean, do you know that we have supported every<br />
wage increase and we have now got, again, a safety net sitting under<br />
the system that John Howard is opposed to?<br />
JS: Sure.<br />
PM: So on what basis is he going around talking about battlers, other than on<br />
the basis of complete hypocrisy.<br />
JS: Well what I am saying to you though I mean the opinion polls and I<br />
mean you say you don't believe the opinion polls, but they are across<br />
the board.<br />
PM: No, I say, not that I don't believe them, that journalists don't understand<br />
them, that is what I say.<br />
JS: Well could you expand on that then because I mean they do seem<br />
PM: Well because let me say in the last election, if you look at all the polls,<br />
the Government would have lost the election and the Government was </p>
<p>certain by the second last week of the campaign that they had the<br />
election won.<br />
JS: Well but with the poll ' s on the last day though of the last election, the<br />
polls on the day before, suggested that you were going to go very close<br />
to winning.<br />
PM: On the last day. But our view was we had the election basically, we<br />
thought, won a couple of weeks before the polls and at the start we<br />
thought we had a chance of winning it. Whereas the commentators and<br />
the polls gave us not a snowball's chance in hell.<br />
JS: So the polls now don't reflect what is going to happen in the future?<br />
Nobody is changing their mind?<br />
PM: Well what happens is if you go and say to people I mean a lot of<br />
members of the public have worked it out and they say they there might<br />
be an election at some time in the next 12 months. Who would you vote<br />
for, the Coalition or the Labor Party? And they say " well look there is a<br />
way of sending the Government a message here". In other words, they<br />
put a little needle into the Government always. Whereas in by-elections,<br />
or whether it is in polls, they always underestimate and undferstatethe<br />
results. And, of course, the other thing, a lot of these polls are taken by<br />
telephones, which distort the result as well.<br />
JS: Isn't there also an argument that the people have decided twelve or<br />
thirteen years they want anyone but Paul Keating? That last time there<br />
was a GST factor entered into it and if John Howard runs on basically a<br />
very bland policy mix, he will get in?<br />
PM: Well I think you are dead wrong about that, John. That is the simple<br />
stuff that you might think. But look at yesterday's National Accounts.<br />
Right on target under the Government's policies. A sustainable<br />
3.7 per cent growth in GDP. In other words, not only have we done the<br />
principal thing we said at the last election to get the economy growing<br />
again, we have created 630,000 jobs, we've got the economy on a<br />
sustainable rate. As The Financial Review said today, putting into doubt<br />
completely Mr Howard's cynical line about five minutes of sunshine.<br />
JS: But the people who pay interest rates. I mean mortgages, for instance,<br />
most of them don't read The Financial Review.<br />
PM: No. But, I'll tell you what, anyone who has got a memory will know that it<br />
was 22 per cent under John Howard.<br />
JS: Yes, but they also know that they have taken three hits of increases in<br />
interest rates in recent times.<br />
PM: But off very low levels, John. They were 4 1/ 2 per cent. The cash rate<br />
at the Reserve Bank, at the bottom of the system, was 4 1/ 2 per cent. </p>
<p>You have still got housing rates now at 10 per cent, or under<br />
per cent.<br />
JS: Yes, but it is still a couple of per cent higher than it was say twelve<br />
months ago.<br />
PM: But we were then coming back into strong growth. You can't expect<br />
rates to be, now, in the face of 6 and 5 and 4 per cent economic growth,<br />
what they were when it was 2 per cent.<br />
JS: Yes, but I am simply saying that people who twelve months ago had a<br />
higher disposable income, given that they were paying less in their<br />
mortgage payments, are going to say well things are not better for me<br />
today, than they were twelve months ago.<br />
PM: Whoa, whoa. In 1993 we gave people a huge fall in interest rates for<br />
housing a huge fall. And a huge increase in disposable income and,<br />
because of the wage arrangements and low inflation you know we<br />
had inflation running at 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent we have had<br />
wage settlements running at around 4 per cent. People have had a<br />
real increase in disposable income, from wages, and from disposable<br />
income and lower interest rates. Let's not get away from the facts.<br />
And that's why, I think many people understand, that in fact this is<br />
happening. Why would somebody take John Howard, who had a<br />
double digit inflation rate, a double digit unemployment rate, the<br />
biggest Government spending in the history of 1the Cbfifri6ihwealth,<br />
and where we had one-fifth of the employment growth in his years that<br />
we have had under these years do you know we have had nearly<br />
2 million jobs created since 1983?<br />
JS: But that's....<br />
PM: Just a second when I became Treasurer in 1983, there was a<br />
workforce of 6 million. Today, it's just on 8 million it's just over<br />
8 million. In the period of 7 years, they had one-fifth of the<br />
employment growth under John Howard, that we had under this<br />
Government.<br />
JS: That's right. That may be right, but that was...<br />
PM: It is right.<br />
JS: But that was in the 70s and the early<br />
PM: No up to now. Up to now. We have had 1.9 million jobs since 1983.<br />
JS: But are you going to rely on the election campaign on continuing to<br />
talk about John Howard's record?<br />
PM; No. I'm talking about ours. That is, a good Budget a strong Budget<br />
the Budget back into surplus strong employment growth 400,000 in </p>
<p>the last year, 630,000 since the election I'm talking about the only<br />
national savings scheme that the country has ever had, 15 per cent<br />
contributions on behalf of everybody to occupational superannuation,<br />
so that from here on, every generation of Australians will not have to<br />
worry about their retirement income. That's what I am talking about<br />
I'm talking about real progress.<br />
JS: I guess what I'm talking about is in terms of the election is perceptions,<br />
and there is a perception there in the community that people no longer<br />
believe you they have heard you talk about bringing home the bacon,<br />
they have heard....<br />
PM: Hang on a minute we have had 13 or 14 quarters of economic growth<br />
do you realise that? We have had about 13 or 14 quarters of<br />
economic growth, and we have just had another one. Don't believe<br />
me believe the record. Surely you are not trying to insinuate this<br />
discussion conveyed to your listeners that there isn't a growth<br />
economy out there?<br />
JS: No. But what I'm saying is that there are people, and there is a<br />
significant proportion of people, who no longer believe you that no<br />
longer believe assurances. I mean, you may say that, but they will say<br />
" oh, we have heard that before we have heard that things are going<br />
to improve before"?<br />
PM: They have though they did improve. Let me just take this go back...<br />
JS: So why is this<br />
PM: You put the question let me just get the answer. Go back to 1983<br />
we have had growth every year, bar 18 months. And the 18 month<br />
period was in 1991-92. From 1983 to 1995 now and the Treasury is<br />
saying for the next 3 years to 1988 that is, for 15 years under the<br />
Labor Government, you are going to have growth strong growth bar<br />
18 months: 2 million jobs, enormous increase in the national income. I<br />
mean, when we have said these things, they have happened.<br />
JS: So why is there that perception, and why are you so far behind in the<br />
polls?<br />
PM: Because.. . well, this time in the last parliament, we were 20 percentage<br />
points behind in the polls this time we are about what? 5 per cent or<br />
6 per cent?<br />
JS: A bit more than that isn't it I thought it was more like 8 per cent?<br />
PM; No. I don't think so been on average about 6 per cent something<br />
like that. Look, are they going to task John Howard, who had no ideas<br />
as Treasurer? [ He was] a complete failure as Treasurer, didn't open<br />
up the foreign exchange markets, didn't float the dollar, didn't<br />
deregulate the economy, didn't lower tariffs, didn't deal with micro-</p>
<p>economic change, didn't touch education, didn't have a decent health<br />
scheme are they really going to go back to that? Someone from the<br />
1970s who believes in the policies of the 1 950s?<br />
JS: So he is not entitled to have changed, to have learnt<br />
PM: But he hasn't.<br />
JS: We don't know what policies he is going to be putting forward, though,<br />
do we?<br />
PM: But you can hear him every day in the house the questions, the<br />
intonations. Here he was yesterday, on Monday, up supporting this<br />
character in Western Australia who is trying to lock these people out of<br />
the Western Australian waterfront. John Howard never learns. This is<br />
a country now with the lowest level of industrial disputes that probably<br />
we have ever had. Did you know that in yesterday's National<br />
Accounts, average weekly earnings was 2.2 per cent growth for the<br />
year, and on the statisticians survey basis, they are running at around<br />
4 per cent. So, somewhere between 2.5 per cent and 4 per cent. Yet,<br />
these people want to adopt American style policies did you hear what<br />
the American Labour Secretary said? I thought it was very instructive,<br />
and I will just read it to you: this is the labour market system that John<br />
Howard wants, and has spent all these years talking about he said<br />
this Robert Reich, US Secretary of Labour: " We in the United States<br />
are proud of our record in creating jobs", he said, " but not of the<br />
continuing decline in medium wages. While we know lead advanced<br />
countries in growth and productivity, and have lowered inflation, the<br />
average hourly compensation of American workers trails 10 foreign<br />
economies, and this average masks a more disturbing reality. While<br />
inequality is growing in every advanced country, the distribution of<br />
income and wealth in the United States has become most unequal of<br />
all". He goes on to say this, " In contrast, the European Ministers<br />
complained of very low employment growth, high rates of<br />
unemployment, and high levels of long-term unemployment", he said,<br />
" the choice between America's low unemployment with falling real<br />
wages, and Europe's high real wages and high unemployment is a<br />
diabolical trade-off'. Now, John, we have got the right mix right down<br />
the middle. High employment growth, and decent wages growth,<br />
because we have got award underpinning's in our enterprise<br />
bargaining system the very thing that John Howard wants to take<br />
away.<br />
JS: So, if the situation is so good, and the polls aren't looking bad for you,<br />
could you win an election today?<br />
PM: I have never spoken about an election.<br />
JS: No. I'm just asking. I'm just asking you </p>
<p>PM: Why should I give an answer to it? I have always taken the view that<br />
these elections are too hard to win without giving away time, and the<br />
public want value from the Parliaments and from the government.<br />
They have asked . what was the Government's principle<br />
commitment in the last election? To restore the economy to growth,<br />
and to deal with unemployment. Our target was 500,000 jobs in<br />
3 years we got to the 500,000 in 2 years, we are now at 630,000, and<br />
what yesterday's National Accounts show is that we have got a<br />
sustainable economy. So, John Howard's line about 5 minutes of<br />
sunshine is just a cynical, advertising agency lie.<br />
JS: So really, there is no justification to have an election before next year,<br />
is there?<br />
PM: In this system, the Prime Minister has the option of going to the polls<br />
at a time of his or her choosing, and that is obviously a prerogative<br />
that I will maintain.<br />
JS: But unless something extraordinary happens, from what you have just<br />
said that you are going to give value for the mandate you have got<br />
there is really no justification to go before next year, is there?<br />
PM: The full Parliament so-called comes about when the House of<br />
Representatives and half Senate can go to an election, so it is then a<br />
matter of choosing by the Prime Minister of the day.<br />
JS: But in terms of giving 3 years value, you would have to call next year,<br />
wouldn't you?<br />
PM: Value is when the 2 come back into the cycle, and they come into the<br />
cycle sometime later this year.<br />
JS: Yeah.<br />
PM: But the key point is has the Government kept complete fidelity with<br />
its commitment to get growth and employment back into this economy,<br />
and has it produced a sustainable growth economy? And the answer<br />
is yes, and yes.<br />
JS: Well, let me just ask you one final question then on another one I<br />
know you normally wouldn't answer on interest rates can you see<br />
them falling later this year?<br />
PM: John, one thing I always think about you is that you can ask a good<br />
and sensible question recitation of questions about interest rates<br />
don't do any of us any good.<br />
JS: Okay.<br />
PM: The thing is, let's get the conditions right. What are the conditions?<br />
Basically, underlying inflation. Yesterday, we had the statisticians </p>
<p>National Accounts for the economy, and for the year to the last<br />
quarter, the broadest measure of inflation, and non-farm product<br />
deflator, was 1.4 per cent, and the private consumption deflator the<br />
measure of private consumption inflation was 2.2 per cent. That's<br />
the best answer I can give you.<br />
JS: Okay. And you agree with The Financial Review we are going to<br />
have a soft landing?<br />
PM: Well, 3.7 per cent means that we have got the sustainbability which<br />
John Howard said was going to disappear with 5 minutes of sunshine.<br />
I mean, there ought to be a lesson in this for Howard don't take you<br />
lines from an advertising agency.<br />
JS: So how much sunshine are we going to have, then?<br />
PM: You have had 14 quarters now. And the Treasury says you have got<br />
36 quarters coming up?<br />
JS: 36 quarters?<br />
PM: Sorry 12 more quarters coming up.<br />
JS: So, 12 more quarters of economic sunshine coming up?<br />
PM: They say the Treasury's best estimate is that we will have<br />
3.7 per cent and 4 per cent growth in that order over the next<br />
3 years, that was in the Budget forecast.<br />
JS: Prime Minister, we are out of time. Thank you.<br />
PM: Thank you very much indeed.<br />
