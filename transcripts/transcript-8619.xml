TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P 3 KEATING, MP<br />
PRE-RECORDED INTERVIEW WITH ALAN JONES, RADIO 2UE<br />
18 AUGUST 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
AJ: Prime Minister welcome.<br />
PM: Thank you very much Alan.<br />
AJ: Prime Minister, first thing I must just say is<br />
congratulations on the presentation. This certainly<br />
is the best presented set of Budget papers that we<br />
have had. Something has changed has it?<br />
PM: Well we try and improve them over the years, but I<br />
think we have made a quantum leap in the<br />
documentation this time, what are otherwise quite<br />
complex concepts and numbers are presented simply in<br />
graphic ways which I hope will just make, again, the<br />
continuing improvement in the literacy of<br />
Australians and economic policy.<br />
AJ: Yes well people are frightened by the Budget papers,<br />
but I can just say to our listeners if you are<br />
interested in reading it, it is intelligible. Can I<br />
just take the first point then, it did seem to me<br />
that when you and Mr Dawkins opened up and said the<br />
Budget was about jobs, jobs, jobs, that it was a<br />
focus on 11 per cent of Australians, rather then the<br />
89 per cent out there who are working.<br />
PM: Well it's basically about getting employment and GDP<br />
going again and as you know we have just had the<br />
growth numbers from the national account for the<br />
year, they have showed us 1.6 per cent, now that's<br />
good, we are growing but we need to grow faster.<br />
This Budget is about lifting the speed of our<br />
growth, and that affects all Australians not just<br />
that 11 per cent. </p>
<p>AJ: No, but I mean business out there really feels<br />
constrained doesn't it? It doesn't feel any room<br />
yet to manoeuvre, to employ, your wanting jobs. It<br />
really is the most productive sector if we can get<br />
it going. How has this Budget relieved some of the<br />
burden from business?<br />
PM: Well I think they are being relieved in a number of<br />
ways, Alan. One is the low interest rates. Two,<br />
the profit share as you -wilsle e in the Budget<br />
papers is quite high, as high really as the 1960s.<br />
We have got the big tax changes which came through<br />
in One Nation, a very fast depreciation rates for<br />
new investment, and we have got in the Budget itself<br />
an outcome on wages which is really very, very<br />
supportive of more activity.<br />
AJ: But not a word here, you mention in the One Nation<br />
$ 8.6 billion in tax cuts, where are they?<br />
( PM: The tax cuts are here, they are repeated.<br />
AJ: But are you going ahead with that?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
AJ: Is it affordable?<br />
PM: Yes it is affordable, and it should be because<br />
basically, I mean we say here we shall introduce our<br />
announced personal tax cuts, income tax cuts. But<br />
they start in a couple of years from now.<br />
AJ: So you will go to an election without them?<br />
PM: Well they were never to be delivered this year.<br />
AJ: So you can't be tested on that?<br />
PM: No, no. But we have delivered lot's of tax cuts<br />
since 1983 and all of our promises have all been<br />
kept.<br />
AJ: But is it an election statement when you say we aim<br />
to have zero unemployment which is totally<br />
unrealistic internationally as well as here, when a<br />
growth rate of 3 per cent is really just going to<br />
mop up the school leavers, isn't it at best?<br />
PM: No, we are saying unemployment in this year will be<br />
around 10 per cent. We are not trying to pretend to<br />
be otherwise, but we think it is the right thing to<br />
do in a country like this to keep a focus on<br />
employment. In the ' 80s we achieved so much with<br />
employment, and we have largely kept those jobs. We<br />
started with a workforce of 6 million in ' 83 and we<br />
have still got today a workforce of 7.5 million,<br />
that's a quarter bigger. So, but keeping that focus </p>
<p>on employment as an objective I think is important,<br />
and we should keep it.<br />
AJ: Righto. What a lot of the people listening to you<br />
now don't understand is the $ 742 million has been<br />
allocated here f or training for the unemployed, yet<br />
in the same Budget papers just the Commonwealth<br />
alone has provided $ 2.7 billion for schools, $ 4.2<br />
billion for higher education, $ 900 million for<br />
vocational training, total $ 8.4 billion. Now we are<br />
providing this money for education, is the education<br />
system failing when we find that a whole heap of<br />
people are untrained for the workforce?<br />
PM: No it is not failing, Alan.<br />
AJ: It's double expenditure isn't it?<br />
PM: No, a lot of that is paying for the growth and<br />
participation which we have been able to secure. In<br />
1983 only three kids in ten completed secondary<br />
school, that's now over seven in ten and is now<br />
rising to nine in ten. And then of course, there is<br />
no point in them completing secondary school if a<br />
large proportion are not then streamed into<br />
university, so we have paid for all those extra<br />
places. So, a lot of that expenditure of growth<br />
money taking Australian participation education to<br />
the levels it should have always been but fell back.<br />
We are now well up and above that OECD level, and<br />
that's where a lot of that growth money is going.<br />
AJ: See, people worry about the expenditure don't they?<br />
$ 109 billion, $ 109 thousand million out there,<br />
almost 1/ 3 of it on welfare. Now, are we becoming a<br />
dependent rather then independent society? For<br />
example, you say you are pitching towards out of<br />
work teenagers, but a child now seventeen, or a<br />
young person of seventeen, can leave home because.<br />
they don't like the discipline of the family and get<br />
$ 255.30 a fortnight because they call themselves<br />
homeless. Four of them can go into one home and be<br />
on $ 1,100 untaxed a fortnight. That's more dough<br />
then you can get working. How can we create<br />
incentives to get them into the workforce when it is<br />
so attractive to be unemployed?<br />
PM: Well we created the incentive of keeping them in<br />
school and study, and that's why we extended Austudy<br />
which is the same set of rates as the Job Search<br />
allowance and paid that to university students and<br />
we have now extended into years 11 and 12 for people<br />
at school. And that has had the effect of lifting<br />
participation in school.<br />
AJ: But for the people who don't want to work, and there<br />
are people out there, is the welfare too attractive? </p>
<p>PM: No, no.<br />
AJ: $ 255.30 a fortnight.<br />
PM: Yes, but you have got to be over 18 to get that. I<br />
don't think anyone over 18 is going to say that at<br />
those rates, which are just sustenance rates, that<br />
anyone would want to stay there.<br />
AJ: Well can I just come back to business, because I<br />
mean that is the concern, you have seen, and the<br />
Prime Minister is right beside me so I can show him<br />
rather than talk about it, but that is the tax,<br />
that's the Hewson adjustment that he says he is<br />
going to make, to taxes on business, you are going<br />
to abolish the wholesale sales tax, abolish the pay<br />
roll tax. How politically do you compete with that,<br />
with business when he is saying he will relieve a<br />
burden of $ 20 billion? Independently what burden is<br />
he going to add by the GST, let's just take that<br />
issue there, how do you compete politically with<br />
that?<br />
PM: Look, the income tax in this country is only S50 odd<br />
billion, John Hewson wants to put a $ 30 billion<br />
goods and services tax on the whole Australian<br />
community. I mean it is a monstrous level of<br />
taxation.<br />
AJ: But he is going to take a lot off?<br />
PM: And that is all going to be spent on taki ng away<br />
pay-roll tax and cutting the excise on petrol. So,<br />
if you say to Australians well this is the deal, you<br />
will have 15 per cent on all of your clothing and<br />
your food, and the deal for you is that by and large<br />
the business community would benefit from a<br />
reduction in pay-roll tax and you get lower and<br />
cheaper petrol in a country which already has cheap<br />
petrol. And I think most Australians say that is a<br />
rotten deal.<br />
AJ: But see you move around the business community so<br />
you know this. You have now got the superannuation<br />
guarantee levy, the training levy, pay-roll tax, you<br />
have got a whole range of taxes there, they are the<br />
sector that you have got to get going haven't you?<br />
You have got to get investment in business moving.<br />
PM: Well, Alan, the profit share in these accounts which<br />
in these Budget papers, which you said were graphic<br />
illustration, I am just trying to find the profit<br />
share measure. It's as high as the 1960s. As soon<br />
as there is any voltdme in production it is going to<br />
spring back to higher levels in the 1960s. With<br />
interest rates, bill rates at 5.75. </p>
<p>AJ: Are business getting that though? We have been<br />
through that before.<br />
PM: Yes, some are.<br />
AJ: You see, business are not getting it. What have you<br />
said to the bank about seeing<br />
PM: Bills plus The fact is, if we say to the<br />
business community you have got a competitive<br />
dollar, you have got a competitive exchange rate<br />
mechanism in place, you have got a bill rate of<br />
3/ 4 per cent, you have got lower prime rates, you<br />
have got higher profit share.<br />
AJ: Is the exchange rate competitive yet?<br />
PM: Let me just say all these things. If the business<br />
community says in the face of all that, well I don't<br />
know whether that is enough, you have got to say<br />
well what is enough? I mean what is enough, if a<br />
high profit share, low interest rates, low<br />
inflation, good wage outcomes, good exchange rate<br />
what is enough?<br />
AJ: Well they will tell you though that they are under<br />
pressure. For example, you keep saying here, which<br />
is true, that I think manufactured exports have<br />
doubled, which is an excellent result. But we will<br />
never ever be able to replace the contribution that<br />
the rural sector makes.<br />
PM: No, but we don't want to, we just want to add to it.<br />
AJ: They are in an awful mess aren't they at the moment?<br />
I mean NSW 75 per cent, 75 per cent of them are<br />
drought stricken. There are 70 farmers in one count<br />
of mine, $ 30 million they will never be able to<br />
repay it. Now in a Budget of $ 109 billion, isn't<br />
there room for a greater assistance to the rural<br />
sector?<br />
PM: -We have got funding for drought in there, drought<br />
relief.<br />
AJ: Marginal.<br />
PM: We have got the rural adjustment scheme fundin,<br />
RAS. -Which we also topped up in One Nation as well<br />
as now. I mean the point is Governments can't take<br />
account of the seasons. Look, agriculture has made<br />
a great contribution to Australia. The trouble is<br />
we relied upon it too much. The good thing now is<br />
we now have manufactured exports growing like topsy.<br />
AJ: But you will never be able to replace the<br />
contribution that rural sector makes to our wealth<br />
will you? It has got to be sustained. </p>
<p>PM: It has got to be complemented, Alan. See, what<br />
happened in the ' 60s and ' 70s is that the great post<br />
war trade in goods and services past Australia by.<br />
We were still growing wheat and wool and digging up<br />
minerals. Good as that is, it wasn't enough.<br />
AJ: No.<br />
PM: And you can't employ people in capital cities or in<br />
provincial cities, say get a job in the back of<br />
Queensland or Western Australia, you have got to<br />
have the jobs in town.<br />
AJ: But when rural Australia is strong, Australia is<br />
strong isn't it? That is still true.<br />
PM: Yes that is true.<br />
AJ: It is not strong at the moment.<br />
PM: No, but that is because in a way, in prices the<br />
wheat markets were polluted by European and American<br />
subsidies. The wool industry shot its own toes of f.<br />
AJ: And they were crippled by interest rates.<br />
PM: Yes, but that is gone now for quite a while.<br />
AJ: But it hasn't gone they have still got the debt.<br />
PM: Well some have.<br />
AJ: A lot Paul, a lot.<br />
PM: Alan a large proportion of Australian farms have no<br />
debt.<br />
AJ: What have you said to the banks, I don't agree with<br />
that, but what have you said to the banks though<br />
about passing on any number of reductions in<br />
interest rates that have been generated from the<br />
Reserve Bank, which the business community are not<br />
getting?<br />
PM: Well they have passed on a lot. But I am not going<br />
to be here defending banks. They have passed on a<br />
lot, but they have stuck to too much.<br />
AJ: Yes.<br />
PM: And that is they should have passed on<br />
AJ: To recover some of their debt.<br />
PM: Recover some of their losses from the ' 80s. I mean<br />
they have lent willy nilly, they have suffered<br />
losses. </p>
<p>AJ: And we are all still paying for it.<br />
PM: And made others pay for it.<br />
AJ: And it has effected our economic well being hasn't<br />
it?<br />
PM: It has. We have now seen it come with housing.<br />
Housing rates are now 10 per cent or below, and they<br />
were 17 per cent, so there is a big pass on there.<br />
The prime rates have come down so there is a<br />
substantial pass on there. But the fact is, it is<br />
for the marginal person, who is on a farm, who is a<br />
small business person, is being charged 12 or 13,<br />
14. It is too much. And they should come down<br />
further.<br />
AJ: Right. Have you said that to them?<br />
PM: I have said it and so has Bernie Fraser.<br />
AJ: Just in terms of paying for this, any sleight of<br />
hand here?<br />
PM: No, no.<br />
AJ: Big dividend from the Reserve Bank, $ 2.6 billion.<br />
PM: Alan, You must of have been in the lock-up with the<br />
pointy heads.<br />
AJ: No, I just know which pages to go to.<br />
PM: Look, what happens, these things go up and down.<br />
AJ: $ 650 million up?<br />
PM: Reserve Bank profits go up when they sell the<br />
currency down.<br />
AJ: $ 650 million.<br />
PM: Yes, but it was $ 2.5 billion a couple of years ago,<br />
then it dropped to $ 900 million, then I think it<br />
dropped to $ 400, now it is up again by a billion.<br />
That is just the on's and off's of the Budget.<br />
AJ: -And your asset sales, are you going to get that<br />
though from Qantas and the Commonwealth<br />
Labourites, Australian Airlines $ 1.6 billion, are<br />
you going to get that?<br />
PM: I think so. Well I mean we have this funny debate,<br />
people say you should sell the airlines so they<br />
operate efficiently, and when you put them into the<br />
Budget to sell them they say you shouldn't include<br />
the receipts in the Budget. Look, it is a tight </p>
<p>clean set of numbers, and we started with a starting<br />
point deficit of $ 13.5 billion and we have produced<br />
a Budget of $ 13.4. In other words, most of the new<br />
spending in here is largely paid for by savings<br />
methods.<br />
AJ: Do you thinkc you are hamstrung though by certain<br />
ideological limitations? For example, I know that<br />
John Dawkins has talked about us being a clever and<br />
smart country, everyone has talked about that. But<br />
I have mentioned to you before if your son does not<br />
get the marks that are needed to enter university,<br />
he can't pay to go there. How long can we shut<br />
000 people out of universities, although I noticed<br />
tonight a welcome initiative in relation to open<br />
universities, and studying from television and so<br />
on?<br />
PM: Can I just tell you what that's about Alan. Open<br />
universities means that people who never got into<br />
university, couldn't get the pass mark, but who want<br />
to study away from university and then have a couple<br />
of successful years at that can stream themselves<br />
back into the campus complement on the university.<br />
AJ: It's the only way they can educate university<br />
students in India for example, or the United States<br />
of America.<br />
PM: That is away from the university and, of course, the<br />
way we've got modems available to send back, you<br />
know essays from computers and television and<br />
generally, videos and the rest. It is possible now<br />
to run an education system like that, away from the<br />
actual campus.<br />
AJ: But why should a Chinese student be able to pay to<br />
go to an Australian university and not your son?<br />
Why can't Paul Keating pay to send his son to<br />
university when in fact a Chinese parent can?<br />
PM: Well, I take the view that most kids have a right to<br />
an university edupatio-' regardless of the parents<br />
income. That's the view that John Hewson doesn't<br />
take.<br />
AJ: Right.<br />
PM: I say a kid from a working<br />
AJ: We're not giving them that.<br />
PM: Yes we are.<br />
AJ: No, 50,000 get locked out every year.<br />
PM: Yes but look there's half a million kids today<br />
in tertiary </p>
<p>AJ: More than ever. But shouldn't you be able to say i<br />
you wanted to sell the family car and forgo a<br />
holiday that you can do that and send you kid at<br />
cost to university. For example in your own<br />
electorate we've got that SRA training authority<br />
with that most magnificent assistance apprenticeship<br />
scheme which could be fully facilitated. Now there<br />
are many places there that can't be used, why<br />
shouldn't parents be able to say well look, it<br />
trains them in the best possible skills at Chullora<br />
I'll pay to have my kid go in there.<br />
PM: Look, there's a certain amount of places that are<br />
available for fee paying if you like clients, some<br />
of the universities can now lift their income<br />
independently of the government payments by getting<br />
full-fee paying students. Getting some of those<br />
services sold around South-east Asia is a good thing<br />
for us to be doing. But what we've done is lifted<br />
by 50 per cent the number of places in tertiary<br />
education. We've created the equivalent of twelve<br />
universities since 1986, that's 120,000 extra places<br />
in universities. And the other thing is in<br />
technical and further education Alan, in that great<br />
milestone change of a couple of weeks ago, we are<br />
now with an agreement between the Commonwealth and<br />
the States going to build for the first time a<br />
vocational education system of substance to sit<br />
beside the universities so all those kids that may<br />
not get the university pass mark, but who want a<br />
good diploma or vocational education can get it.<br />
And that's going to matter to those hundreds and<br />
thousands of kids, particularly from working class<br />
areas who mightn't get into university because many<br />
hundreds and thousands will, but those who don't<br />
will now be able to go into a system of substance<br />
and status that just now doesn't exist.<br />
AJ: Alright, one other thing on money in the Budget<br />
papers which upsets people out there, and I don't<br />
think people are as racist as they are accused of<br />
when they make this kind of criticism, but the total<br />
allocation and I've only had a quick chance to tally<br />
it up for Aborigines again, 240,000 Aborigines, over<br />
$ 1 billion. That's a lot of money, that's just the<br />
Commonwealth, now there's a whole range of state<br />
programs as well. Can you understand how people<br />
really get a little upset when there is not money<br />
for other things, but there's an awful amount of<br />
dough for 240,000 every year?<br />
PM: Oh yes, but it's for largely dispossesed people<br />
who've basically had the butt end of what society<br />
can hand out to themi and pull them up to give them<br />
an education and housing and support.<br />
AJ: Do you think they're getting it? </p>
<p>PM: Well..<br />
AJ: Or is it going to a white bureaucracy who is<br />
administer it?<br />
PM: No, well it's now being administered by the<br />
Aboriginal community, A&amp; TSIC is a program, a<br />
Commission where the Commonwealth's funding. You<br />
realise we don't have a Department of Aboriginal<br />
Affairs.<br />
AJ: No, I found it in Prime Minister and everywhere<br />
else.<br />
PM: It doesn't exist you see. The money is paid..<br />
AJ: You hide those figures somewhere where we can't find<br />
them.<br />
PM: No, we pay it straight to ATSIC. We pay it straight<br />
to the Commission, there's the Aboriginal and Torres<br />
Strait Islander Commission and indigenous people run<br />
that.<br />
AJ: But if it is successful, shouldn't each year there<br />
by progressively lesser need? If it was successful,<br />
progressively there should be less need, therefore<br />
less money. We just seem to each year be requiring<br />
more and more money.<br />
PM: But I mean, I don't think when you say successful I<br />
mean, at what threshold level? I mean these are<br />
remote communities often, they've had tremendous<br />
health problems, housing problems. No, I think it<br />
is money well spent and I don't thing we're spending<br />
we've tried to spend as much as we can and we've<br />
increased that by about $ 500 million three months<br />
ago which will be spent over the next four or five<br />
years.<br />
AJ: Just finally, a lot of money for consumption here as<br />
opposed to production in the Budget and there's an<br />
election coming up<br />
PM: Well I'll tell you what there is money in for and<br />
that's for health. I think this is going to be a<br />
very important issue in the election. We've put in<br />
billion, nearly $ 250 million a year for<br />
six years for greater access of public patients to<br />
public hospitals, so elderly people<br />
AJ: I wish we could debate that on another day.<br />
PM: who might have an elective thing like a hip<br />
replacement, they'll be able to get in there and<br />
they won't now be j umped in the queue by a private<br />
patient and I think getting that public hospital </p>
<p>system working properly with full access to doctors<br />
gives a real choice between Medicare and the thing<br />
that Dr Hewson has which is go and pay for yourself<br />
regardless of means.<br />
AJ: Come back to the election, when will there be an<br />
election?<br />
PM: Well when the Parliament runs it course. I think<br />
from our point of view, the longer the Parliament<br />
goes the economies fortunes I think, are on the turn<br />
and for us I don't thing there's any value in short<br />
changing the public..<br />
AJ: You'll go the distance?<br />
PM: This is my intention at this stage, we'll go the<br />
distance yes.<br />
AJ: one final thing which has nothing to do with the<br />
Budget, Mr Kenny, there's outrage out there that a<br />
bloke who could have served for Australia in the war<br />
can be finding himself in the courts defending his<br />
right to certain<br />
PM: Well I think if you live here for 40 years and<br />
you've been part of this community notwithstanding<br />
the fact that technically he didn't have a passport<br />
and the rest that that should be fair enough.<br />
AJ: But see you're a tough guy and that's your<br />
reputation. Why wouldn't you say listen this is<br />
nonsense, will we get this thing out of the courts,<br />
a country that I'm Prime Minister of, no bloke of 68<br />
is going to be put through this.<br />
PM: No, well that's fine. But you see what happened the<br />
Parliament decided about four or five years ago that<br />
there shall be no ministerial discretion in these<br />
matters. There's an Act of Parliament stands<br />
between me and me saying that, that's why. But this<br />
matter is before the AAT, the Administrative Appeals<br />
Tribunal and given the fact that this fellow looks<br />
as though he's got a pretty good case, he's probably<br />
got every chance of getting out.<br />
AJ: So you're confident he's not going to be booted out?<br />
PM:--Well I should hope not. -I mean I think anyone<br />
that's been..<br />
AJ: You wouldn't want that in a country you were running<br />
surely?<br />
PM: I would not, not someone's who's been here for that<br />
long. </p>
