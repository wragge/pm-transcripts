FIFTH COMMONWEALTH EDUCATION CONFERENCE<br />
CANBERRA, ACT 3 FEBRUARY 1971<br />
2n~ ing LA : S bthfe~ Prnim Miite, Mr. L h~ rton<br />
Your Excellencies, Honourable Ministers, Mr Secretary-General, Ladies and<br />
Gentlemen It is an honour for me to be opening this Conference and to be welcoming<br />
to Canberra so many distinguished educators from so many parts of the world.<br />
On behalf of the Australian Government, I extend a warm welcome to our<br />
overseas guests and to our owfl State Ministers and leading educators from within<br />
Australia. This is the first time a Commonwealth Education Conference has been held<br />
in Australia and there will be stimulation and benefit for mainy of us in what you discuss.<br />
I am sure that a sound basis of co-operation already exists among all those present.<br />
In many ways, this F ifth Commonwealth Education Conference is a more<br />
accurate reflection of the benefits of the Commonwealth of Nations than the recent<br />
Heads of Government Meeting in Singapore. It is the co-operation that takes place on<br />
the practical level in education and in countless other fields that gives this unique<br />
free association of nations its durability and its strength.<br />
It is not realistic to expect thirty-one diverse nations to be able to reach<br />
a consensus of opinion on highly controversial political issues, nor is it realistic<br />
to assume that if they do reach a consensus it in any way affects those who are not<br />
part of that consensus. But 1. would further say that unanimous viewpoints and attitudes<br />
are not necessary for a successful Commonwealth reiationship.<br />
Unftortunately, though understandably, it is the periodic Heads of Government<br />
Meeting and the inevitable political stresses and strains that attract most publicity.<br />
To many people these summit gatherings are the Commonvwealth. Well, they are<br />
certainly important and I suppose they represent the ultimate in the Commonwealth's<br />
political activities. But it is the many practical strands running beneath the surface that form<br />
the basic fabric of the Commonwealth. And that is why I am particularly glad to be<br />
here, because this Conference, less than two weeks after Singapore, helps to put the<br />
whole concept of the Commonwealth in perspective.<br />
It is in the field of education among others that a great deal has been done<br />
which has been of mutual advantage for Commonwealth members. And this Conference<br />
is a tangible demonstration that the Commonwealth of Nations does work, that it is<br />
of practical value, and that when we get together, our meetings aren't always political,<br />
but are often designed to come to grips with issues of common concern, such as the<br />
education of our various peoples. </p>
<p>After all, so much of the future of all our countries depends on education.<br />
When we remember that one in every four people in the world today lives in a<br />
Commonwealth country, it comes home with dramatic force, I think, that the<br />
Commonwealth of Nations as a free assembly can do much for the common good by<br />
such exchanges of views and experiences at practical levels as will take place here<br />
during this Conference.<br />
In that particular field of education, the Commonwealth has a really<br />
worthwhile role to play. It is an activity which goes on year in and year out, important<br />
to all our welfare as individual countries, and to the Commonwealth itself, concerned<br />
as it is with democracy and liberty.<br />
And liberty is more than the freedom of the market-place. Liberty of<br />
the mind is perhaps ultimately the key to our survival. And to allow liberty of the<br />
mind to have a full flowering is the-task, the ideal of the educator in all countries,<br />
for education is the great liberator, and from properly educated minds flows<br />
understanding which is the basis of co-operation and progress in so many other<br />
fitelds. We I4ave our problems in Australia, as you have yours. There is in this<br />
country, an endless pressure on our education systems. More of our people are<br />
wanting more education, and more are wanting higher education, and more of our<br />
young people are staying at school longer. In fact, the number staying on beyond<br />
the compulsory age has doubled in the last decade.<br />
There is a ceaseless demand for more teachers, and for teachers w~ ho are<br />
said to require much higher qualifications are said to require. And on top of it all,<br />
there is a questioning of old methods, and a searchin-g for new ones, as our society<br />
at all its levels recognises great changes resulting from technological progress and<br />
from different attitudes of mind, particularly among the younger generation different<br />
attitudes of mind, different desires as to what will provide a good life, a questioning<br />
of whe ther purely material things are as important as perhaps they were thought<br />
by past generations. So no longer are the old methods and the old standards good enough. The<br />
times are too demanding. The challenge is real. We are constantly endeavouring<br />
to match needs to resources which I note is your theme at this Conference but, at<br />
any rate in Australia, we also have to bear in mind the need to match resources to<br />
needs and this may not be quite so easy or lead to quite so quick a progress as we<br />
would like. But we have made a lot of progress in expanding our education systems<br />
in Australia. Under our Federal system, the prime responsibility for educations ic<br />
with State Governments, but the Commonwealth Government is deeply involved,<br />
directly and indirectly. And I have considerable first-hand knowledge of this<br />
involvement for I was the first Minister for Education and Science in the Commonwealth. o / 3 </p>
<p>We are spending on education more than fIive times as much per head of<br />
population as we were spending a decade ago. It has gone up from $ 4-2 per head of<br />
population to $ 25 per head of population.... a much bigger population.<br />
This year, just over four per cent of total Federal Government expenditure<br />
is specifically for education, while on top of that, the Australian States are now<br />
committing about one-third of their total revenues and loan expenditure to this field.<br />
They have more than doubled their expenditure per head of population in the last<br />
decade. So while there are always newspaper headlines which tell us there is<br />
a " Crisis in Education", we are, I believe, making progress. We don't measure<br />
progress simply by the increased amount of money. It is how, where and why it is<br />
spent that matters. And here the need for flexibility is, I think, of very great<br />
importance. None of us can freeze old systems of education in a world in a ferment<br />
of change. So here in my country, we are seeking new ways of co-operation with<br />
Australian States. With them we are looking at the standards of the curriculum in<br />
our schools, to see where jointly we can do things better. Wie have looked, and hellped,<br />
in science education and in technical education, and in the building of teacher colleges,<br />
in such things as the teaching of Asian languages, and in other fields. This is goixng<br />
on all the time. It is not goi:-g on as quickly as educators would like probably not<br />
nearly as quickly. It is perhaps not going on nearly as quicly as the population would<br />
like, but it is going on, and improvements are made year by year.<br />
At the tertiary level, we now have here colleges of advanced education as an<br />
alternative to universities not as institutions which provide a lesser brand of<br />
education, but as institutions which are alternatives in that they provide a slightly<br />
different approach to studies in tertiary fields. They are geared more directly to<br />
the specific needs of industry and commerce, and I think they will prove to be a most<br />
signicant development in tertiary education in Australia in this decade.<br />
And for ourselves, -we have in our Budget this year to assist in<br />
Commonwealth educational co-operation, a sum of some $ 890, 000.<br />
Now, Sir, I think I have said quite enough. You will no doubt hear much<br />
more of these matters from the experts here as your Conference proceeds. And<br />
so all that remains for me to do is to wish good luck and success to the Conference<br />
and to declare it open. </p>
