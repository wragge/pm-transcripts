AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL OF RETAILERS' DINNER AT<br />
HOTEL CANBERRA CANBERRA, A. CT.<br />
ON 1 8' H JULY. 19<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon, RoGMonies<br />
Sir, I would like to say, first of all, thank you<br />
on behalf of my wife. She has been out of action for the<br />
last two or three months, but she did hope to be here tonight,<br />
and then, by the inscrutable wisdom of Providence, she<br />
developed one of those sniffly, wheezy colds, in which she<br />
found herself intolerable company for herself and for other<br />
people. And so she decided, entirely in you. r interests, not<br />
to come and whistle out germs on you, But when I go back<br />
home, as I do occasionally ( Laughter) and tell her what you<br />
said about her, and what other people approved of about her,<br />
I'm perfectly certain that within twentyfour hours, she will<br />
be saying to me, " Why didn't you insist on me going?" ( Laughter)<br />
Because really you have spoken, I was going to say generously,<br />
but I would prefer to say justly, about her and I will have<br />
great pleasure in telling her what was said about her tonight<br />
and how you received it,<br />
I would also like to say, Sir, that apropos of young<br />
Johnson, who has a genius so great that he ought to be working<br />
for the Government, ( Laughter) ( Make a note of that, will you,<br />
Hazel) ( Laughter) I liked in particular, the second-last<br />
verse ( Laughter) There are no press here, so I don't need to<br />
embarrass my partner and colleague, Jack McEwen, but he has<br />
been referred to, as you may know, as " Black Jack" and I<br />
occasionally address him as " Black" and, occasionally, when<br />
I am in c highbrow mood, I address him as " Lo Noir" ( Laughter)<br />
That's only when I don't want the other Country Party Minister<br />
to know what I'm talking about. ( Laughter) And I love this<br />
verse " We've asked the swarthy, crony Jack." Now John,<br />
you must admit this is the best description of you that has<br />
ever been put on the swarthy crony Jack", And'Hal"<br />
now, really, if everybody would start lo call Harold " Hal",<br />
we'd win the next election. ( Laughter) ( Applause) John, you<br />
and I must start this fashion Hal who's gi'en us<br />
mony a crack" ( Laughter) and theni rather dirtily, ( Laughter)<br />
rather offensively, ho adds, which yersel' ye're nae<br />
sae slack." ( Laughter) And I plead guilty, at once, to that.<br />
And then he says, " A fearsome trio". Well, up to that point,<br />
you might almost think you were reading the Sydney " Sun"<br />
( Laughter) or the Sydney " Mirror" ( Laughter) or other humorous,<br />
juvenile publications. ( Laughter) And then in brackets,<br />
young Johnson says bowing in the direction of the balance<br />
sheet, ( Laughter) "( But in a profit race I'd back Hosts Tam<br />
and Theo)" Now this, I think, is the most superb verse written<br />
in lowland Scots since Burns himself, ( Laughter) All that<br />
stuff about " Wad the Puir, the Giftie gie us" it's very good.<br />
My father used to recommend it to me in vain for a long time.<br />
I mean the moral he used to recommend. But this fellow,<br />
Johnson, has in that one verse, concentrated the whole fury,<br />
and the whole glory, of Australian politics and the profit<br />
and loss account, ( Laughter) of the Retailers' Association,<br />
Now, the other thing I want to say to you is that<br />
you may be surprised to know that two such contentious fellows<br />
as John McEwen and I are hero tonight, Well, I will explain<br />
it to you. I must begin on Monday. On Monday, I was in<br />
Sydney and on ionday night I went to a Dinner to celebrate the<br />
So00C oo/ 2 </p>
<p>Fiftieth Anniversary of what was called, in the plural,<br />
" The Commonwealth Banks" and it wasn'c a very happy night,<br />
I received a moderate reception, modified rapture ( Laughter).<br />
Under great pressure, I thought of one or two bright remarks<br />
that they laughed at. But really, on the whole the Government<br />
wasn't too good on Monday night ( Laughter) and we came<br />
back here, and yesterday morning, afternoon and night were<br />
discussing the Budget. Oh, I'm so glad there are no Press<br />
here tonight because if I even mention the Budget, with the<br />
press here, somebody, looking at the left eyebrow or the<br />
right, would say, " The Prime Minister gave a broad hint"<br />
( Laughter) You know what I mean about this or this or<br />
this the poor old fellow hadn't thought of.<br />
And therefore I'm lucky because yesterday, morning<br />
afternoon and night, we discussed the Budget or aspects of<br />
it; today, morning and afternoon, and when we were finishing<br />
up at six o'clock this afternoon, the Treasurer, who is not<br />
unconscious ( Laughter) of what people say about him, though<br />
they could say it with much greater force about me, but some<br />
old inhibition makes them say, " Well, the old fellow, you<br />
know but, anyhow, he said, " I think we ought to sit<br />
tonight" and, obviously, we should. And so we made a little<br />
arrangement under which my swarthy friend and I came out to<br />
tea, having a pair, so to speak, and tonight, they're working<br />
on , omothing or other; well, I hope for the best and so does<br />
he. And in the morning no doubt it will come out all right.<br />
And tomorrow morning tomorrow afternoon, tomorrow night, we'll<br />
be at it again, and by midnight tomorrow night, we will all<br />
look at each other in the anteroom and say, " Well I wonder<br />
what the retailers will say about this. ( Laughter3 I wonder<br />
what the manufacturers will say about it." To which I will<br />
probably add in my well-known cynical mood, " I wonder what<br />
we will say about it when we read it". ( Laughter) And,<br />
anyhow, that's the way it goes.<br />
I must make the apologies tonight, Sir, for my<br />
colleagues, most of whom would much sooner have been here<br />
tonight than whacking out arguments on the Commonwealth Works<br />
and Services Programme. Isn't that what they're on tonight?<br />
Yes. Overall is here tonight Well, that's cowardly on<br />
his part because if he were there, they would chop his vote<br />
down by a million, ( Laughter) That's the kind of thing that's<br />
going on, All I want to say I don't want to say anything<br />
about the Budget except one thing perhaps. We've had the<br />
great advantage, Tom ( Pettigrew), of hearing you and other<br />
people on the state of the economy, I even heard two or<br />
three people say that this was a year in which the Government<br />
might take its courage in both hands and Budget for a deficit.<br />
If you'll allow me to say so I'm not addressing your wives<br />
who are much more sensible I'm addressing the rest of you<br />
" Could anything be more funny?" We are not facing a problem<br />
this year of whether we ought to budget for a deficit or<br />
not; we are facing the problem of how much it ought to be<br />
( Laughter) and this is not all that easy. I don't think<br />
anybody could ever accuse me of ignoring the views of what<br />
I night loosely call the ordinary man, the man in the street,<br />
the man who runs a business, I've never been one of those<br />
people who pretend that he can run a great business better<br />
than the people who run it. It has never occurred to me.<br />
But my business happens to be the business of the nation and<br />
on this, after many many years, I think I might modestly<br />
claim to have serve an apprenticeshipo ( Hear, hear). </p>
<p>The business of the nation. And this is not only<br />
social and international but it is financialo It is all<br />
these things. And all I want to say to you is, I have no<br />
hidebound rules in my mind, I haven't been given orders by<br />
anybody, but I have an acute sense of responsibility, not<br />
only to my own country in 1962, but to my own country in<br />
1963 and 1964 and 1965, ( Hear, hear) Because the job of<br />
the politician is to say, " How many votes can you win next<br />
week", I've had it; I've no interest tc. serve on this<br />
matter. When they throw me out, they will throw me out.<br />
I won't mind Buit the job of the statesman is to say, " What<br />
is happening to my country and to the world not next week<br />
but next year and the year after and in ten years' time?"<br />
( Hear, hear) ( Applause)<br />
We in Australia are not responsible for the future<br />
shape of the world. No, but we have some influence over<br />
it. It's a great mistake to think that the great countries<br />
of the world go by the headlines. They do not go by the<br />
headlines any more than I do, but they are influenced by<br />
people from the great countries in the world, and we happen<br />
to represent one of the great countries. Don't think that<br />
I am suffering from any form of illusion that 102 million.<br />
people count as much in the world as 200 million. I do not.<br />
But I'd like to tell you that in this very year of grace my<br />
distinguished colleague, what's he called " swarthy crony<br />
Jack" he and I have both been in London, in Europe, in the<br />
United States of America, and I will undertake to say that<br />
between us, we have put ideas into people's minds ( hear, hear)<br />
which they didn't have before we went, ( Applause), And in<br />
that sense, we in Australia exercise an influence.<br />
But for ourselves, in Australia, our prime responsibility,<br />
look, do let me say, our task, is not on any Budget or<br />
on any measure or on anything else to please you to please<br />
John, or to please Bill or to please Tom. Thats not the<br />
job. The job is to develop this country, 10o million people<br />
a vast area to develop it as fast as we can into one of the<br />
significant countries intrinsically in the world. What have<br />
they in America? 180, 190 million people. This is colossal.<br />
The same sort of area as we have ourselves, and we have<br />
We are not going to have 10-forever, The day will come,<br />
perhaps not in my time, w: hen it will be 20, the day will come<br />
when it will be 30 or<br />
Provided we exercise our genius and produce energy,<br />
enthusiasm, a sense of devotion to our country there is no<br />
reason why, at the turn of the century, Australia should not<br />
be intrinsically one of the great nations in the world, or,<br />
at any rate, one of the very great nations in the Southern<br />
Hemisphere, And, really, as one grows older, one thinks less<br />
of the next week or of the next election, about which I couldn't<br />
care less. One thinks more and more of what kind of corntry<br />
one's grandchildren are going to live in or one's greatgrandchildren<br />
are going to live in. This is tremendously<br />
important. And what kind of a country is it? Not one in<br />
which everybody lives on the Government. That's a dependent<br />
country, not an independent one, A country in which we<br />
have made ourselves grow, in which we have understood that<br />
the great industries take the manufacturing industries<br />
must expand, if we are to expand our population, if % e are<br />
to have more and more people; one in which the tertiary<br />
industries are expanding, one in which the primary industries,<br />
which are the very root of our international existence, .2 .6 0 0 </p>
<p>succeed, grow, increase their productivity and do it at a<br />
cost level which does not price them o-. t of the worldts<br />
market, It is simple to state it, isn't it, in that way<br />
and not very simple to achieve. Not very simple to satisfy<br />
the demands of the manufacturer and at the same time keep<br />
the woolgrower, the whoatgrower and the rest of them out of<br />
trouble. Not so simple,<br />
The interesting thing about Australia, the great<br />
challenge about Australia is that every section of the economy<br />
has its own demands, its own ambitions, which somebody might<br />
call selfish ones, but in which all of these must be reconciled,<br />
made loss selfish, made more conformable with the general<br />
set-up of the country, so that when I've been given my<br />
inevitable State funeral twenty years before, people will<br />
be able to sit up at peace in Australia, have friends to<br />
dinner at peace in Australia and in security and say, " You<br />
know that in the last twenty years, this country has developed<br />
to an extent that even the Americans, in the sixties of the<br />
last century, didn't think of."<br />
Now, Sir, this is a great ambition, and all of us<br />
who preserve our sense of responsibility, contribute to it.<br />
I am a great admirer of what is done by the manufacturers.<br />
I am a great admirer of what is done by the importers. I<br />
am a great admirer of what is done by the retailers. You<br />
may go right down the list, and I have never had any stupid<br />
ambition to try to run their business for them. But all I<br />
hope is that all of us will never get so far out of balance<br />
that we think our particular interest is to be preferred to<br />
the interests of other people. I would hope that over the<br />
years to come, difficult years, tremendously difficult years;<br />
I am not only talking about the Common Market or something<br />
of that kind, but talking about the difficult years in front<br />
of this country down in its rather remote corner of the world.<br />
I hope that in all those difficult years we will, as far as<br />
we can, forget to be sectional and practice increasingly to<br />
be Australians ( hear, hear) with one nation to serve and one<br />
end to produce for our children and our grandchildren.<br />
( Applause) o </p>
