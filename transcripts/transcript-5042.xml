FOR MEDIA 8 MAY 1979<br />
TASK FORCE ON1 DEPARTMENTAL INFORMATION<br />
The Prime Minister has written to State Premiers seeking<br />
their co-operation in a study of the way Government Departments<br />
provide information to groups and individuals in the community.<br />
Mr Fraser said he was writing to the Premiers because many<br />
of the problems and issues of concern to the Commonwealth<br />
Government in this area also confronted State Government<br />
departments. State Governments had adopted a range of different approaches<br />
to the question of departmental information. " I am sure that<br />
there will be mutual benefit in an exchange of experience<br />
and views between the two levels of Government", the Prime Minister<br />
said.<br />
Mr Fraser said the, Commonwealth study was being undertaken by the<br />
Task Force on Departmental Information which was established<br />
by the Government last year following the recommendations of-the<br />
Royal Commission into Australian Government Administration.<br />
Among the issues being considered by the Task Force are the<br />
production and distribution of information in both the print<br />
and non-print media. The Task Force is examining the adequacy<br />
of content and presentation of information produced by departments<br />
and questions of expenditure and cost recovery.<br />
The role, operation and staffing of departmental information<br />
units and the need for a central professional advice and<br />
monitoring service are also being considered.<br />
Some issues of special concern to my Government are the methods<br />
adopted by departments to provide information for disadvantaged<br />
groups and,. at a broader level, the effectiveness of the methods<br />
of distribution used. The Task Force is also concerned with<br />
departmental efforts to evaluate the effectiveness of their<br />
information programs. </p>
