    <content><![CDATA[<p>This is a very fitting location for this ceremony this evening.</p>
<p>In sight are the pillars of our democracy.</p>
<p>There is the War Memorial - the ever present reminder of the sacrifice made for our freedom.</p>
<p>There is the Old Parliament House, which is a reminder of our history.</p>
<p>There is this Parliament House behind us, the home of our democracy.</p>
<p>And here, in this forecourt, are the people whom all our institutions strive to serve.</p>
<p>There is no better place to honour our finest citizens.</p>
<p>This Australia Day weekend we celebrate our history, our land, our people and our unity.</p>
<p>Two traits are characteristic of our country: the instinct to “have a go” and that passion for a “fair go”.</p>
<p>Tonight, we honour those who have “had a go” so that others might have a “fair go”.</p>
<p>We are a country that salutes those whose talents, gifts and hard work have made Australia a better place.</p>
<p>Now, I know from meeting many of our finalists earlier today, that some of you don’t feel entirely at ease with being singled out.</p>
<p>Well, we have singled you out – because you reflect the very best of our country.</p>
<p>You are what the rest of us might be – if only we kept our new year’s resolutions and heeded our best instincts.</p>
<p>You are a living embodiment of our country at its best.</p>
<p>As we look back over a half century of Australian of the Year Awards – we see Nobel laureates, academy award winners, scientists, doctors, writers, sportspeople, artists, soldiers, and carers – a good mix of larrikins and stirrers, saints and sinners.</p>
<p>This year’s finalists, like their predecessors, are as diverse as the country we are – but each has a remarkable story and each is rightly honoured.</p>
<p>So, tonight I congratulate and thank you for reminding us of our potential for good and renewing our pride in Australia.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
