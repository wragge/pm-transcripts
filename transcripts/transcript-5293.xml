The Prime Minister announced today that he Will be having<br />
discussions in Wellington on 21 March 1980 with the Prime Minister<br />

towards a closer economic and trading relationship between<br />
Australia and New Zealand.<br />
The Prime Minister recalled that he had discussed this subject<br />
with Mr Muldoon in a preliminary way at the Commonwealth<br />
Heads of Government Meeting in Lusaka last August.<br />

held early in 1980 to review progress made in the work of officials.<br />

with Mr Muldoon will rnot be to take decisions on new arrangements<br />
between Australia and New Zealand. Rather, the purpose will be<br />
