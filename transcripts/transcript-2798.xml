9. The price of WEn to be accuirod for th~ e pur~ oses of the project<br />
within the ctesir'nateE areas will be based on tie marhet level of<br />
? riees :? revailing at the Eate of 3 October 19372, 1-but a.-i!, ay<br />

The appropriate Land Price stabilisation legislation vill be<br />
introduced by the governments at an early date.<br />
The general intent of the three governments is that in the<br />
special circumstances of Albury-odonga, the corporation would<br />
comprise three full-time commissioners, with executive authority,<br />
and two part-time commissioners, drawn from the local community.<br />
11. The chairman will be nominated by the Australian Government and<br />
the two deputy chairmen by the New South Wales and Victorian<br />
G overnments respectively.<br />
12. It is agreed that the details of the corporation structure should<br />
be determined by the Council of iiinisters and that provision<br />
should be made for consultative machinery with State and local<br />
agencies and other bodies. This could take the form of a<br />
Consultative Council.<br />
13. The task of the developnent corporation will be to'create an<br />
Australian city with a high quality of environment, imaginatively<br />
planned and developed, with respect for human requirements and<br />
for public involvement.<br />
The development corporation will acquire, either directly or<br />
through the agency of a State authority, land in the areas<br />
designated for urban and associated development, will plan the<br />
urban environment and the pattern of land use, will make<br />
provision for necessary land development works, and the provision<br />
of fully serviced sites for government and private building<br />
development. The corporation will be expected to involve the established<br />
Federal, State and Local Government authorities in the development<br />
of the complex as far as possible.<br />
It will be empowered to undertake any works which it considers<br />
necessary to ensure that the development of the new urban complex<br />
is successfully achieved.<br />
14. In respect of the overall complex the development corporation<br />
will need to be ompowered to exercise statutory planning and<br />
other powers to the extent necessary to achieve these objectives.<br />
It is proposed that the development corporation, unless there are<br />
exceptional circumstances, will follow a policy of providing<br />
fully serviced sites for development on a long term leasehold<br />
tenure, normally 99 years.<br />
16. The development corporation's programme will be financed by way<br />
of Federal grants for special purposes and long term government<br />
and government guaranteed loans which carry af appropriate<br />
interest charge. In the establishment period, the corporation's<br />
administrative functions will be financed by the three governments<br />
on a basis to be agreed upon between them. It will be eligible<br />
to receive various forms of financial subsidy where this is<br />
appropriate.<br />
17. The development corporation will be empowered to negotiate for<br />
or to provide and manage municipal type facilities and services<br />
should this be necessary in the designated areas in the development<br />
period. Ihere this has been done by the corporation, the<br />
provision of these services rill be financed by way of<br />
L </p>
<p>-3-<br />
appropriate charges, under suitable arrangements made between<br />
the Australian ~ nd State Governments. lThon developed, the<br />
administration of the designated areas will be handed over<br />
to mrmnicipal self-government.<br />
18. In the development of the now growrth complex, priority will be<br />
given to control of pollution, including effluent disposal,<br />
anr to protection of the environment not only of the centre<br />
itsolf but also of areas rwhich will be affected by the<br />
establishment of this now complex. </p>
