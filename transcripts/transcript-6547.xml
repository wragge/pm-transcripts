    <content><![CDATA[<p>FOR MEDIA 8 NOVEMBER 1984<br />
I received late this afternoon the following telex:<br />
" Dear Mr Hawke,<br />
I have read in the latest Australian Business Magazine  and in today's Melbourne Herald a statement alleged to have been made by Mr John Elliott in relation to your meeting with the National Mutual Board in Canberra on September. I have disucssed these statements with Mr Elliott and he tells me that they are totally incorrect. </p>
<p>I wish to confirm that I personally made the invitation to you in a letter dated 9 March 1984. As you are aware, a similar invitation was issued to Mr Keating but he was unable to attend due to his absence overseas. No other invitations were issued. </p>
<p>National Mutual looks forward to continued close consultations with Governments.<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
E. A. Mayer<br />
Managing Director<br />
National Mutual" </p>
