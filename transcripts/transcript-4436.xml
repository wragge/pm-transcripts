FOR PRESS 9 JULY 1977<br />
ADDRESS TO W. A. LIBERAL COUNCIL PERTH<br />
It is very good to be in Perth again and a great pleasure to<br />
address this Council.<br />
You have all undoubtedly had a very interesting week watching the<br />
A. L. P. Conference go through its routines. Bob Hawke, having<br />
been unable to get a safe Labor seat, announced that if he<br />
was not given leadership of the Labor Parliamentary Party, he<br />
would not go into Parliament. It seems that even two hats<br />
are not big enough for him. But he had to admit he had not been<br />
inundated with offers of support from Labor Parliamentarians.<br />
It has become obvious that Mr Hawke and Mr Whitlam. hold one<br />
another in the highest regard. Having led the A. L. P. to its<br />
greatest defeat in Australia's history in 1975, Mr Hawke and<br />
Mr Whitlam conceded that they were still the two best campaigners<br />
the could produce. Mr Hawke's obviously aiming to prove<br />
his loyalty to the present Leader of the Opposition<br />
Yesterday he said that Mr Whitlam was " a greater man than he was".<br />
But he could not stop himself from adding " for the time being".<br />
There is no doubt about it the A. L. P. is as strongly behind<br />
its leader as it ever had been.<br />
There were some remarkable changes at the Conference.<br />
Five weeks ago, following his resounding two vote confirmation<br />
as Labor leader, Mr Whitlam had said that there was nothing<br />
wrong with the policies Labor had pursued in Government;<br />
it was obvious to use one of his own phrases that he would do<br />
it all again.<br />
In Perth, however, Mr Whitlam made an astonishing change. He<br />
said that Labor would have to behave in an economically responsible<br />
fashion. Mr Hayd~ n said that Mr Whitlam's speech was drafted<br />
on the road to Damascus. It is more likely that it was written<br />
on the road away from breakfast with two Iraki gentlemen.<br />
It is unfortunate the changes Mr Whitlam had undergone thus<br />
far have been short lived, and they have left Australia<br />
short changed. The Labor Shadow Treasurer, Mr Hurford,, said<br />
Labor had to face econiomic reality. Labor could no longer </p>
<p>afford to finance its social programme through inflation and<br />
Labor accepted tax indexation. People sat with baited<br />
breath and wondered whether a new, economically responsible<br />
Labor Party was about to be unveiled. The new image was<br />
shattered, however, once Mr Hurford said that the A. L. P. vuould<br />
raise indirect taxes substantially and spend an extra<br />
$ 800 million on social programmes if they were in power.<br />
But that was not surprising. We have heard Labor commitments<br />
to restraint before. The A. L. P. is replaying the promises of<br />
the past. Before 1972 they briefly assumed the cloak of<br />
responsibility they would not spend too much money, they<br />
would eliminate unemployment, they would be stable and sensible.<br />
That was Mr Whitlam's promise. What he delivered was the<br />
most irresponsible and outrageous government Australia<br />
has ever seen. In the Labor Budget of 1975 the so-called<br />
responsible budget Mr Hayden said: " We have exercised the utmet<br />
restraint in government spending". In that year spending<br />
increased by 23% so much for restraint. Once the charades<br />
were over, it was clear that the A. L. P. had not changed.<br />
They are still the party of economic irresponsibility and<br />
inflation, the party of massive government. The party that graver<br />
damaged business, whose inflation harmed the poor most of all.<br />
The Australian people know this -they have seen Labor in action<br />
between 1972-1975. They won't be deceived again.<br />
We have spent the last 18 months working to overcome the damage<br />
the Labor Party did to Australia. We stopped the rapid<br />
expansion of Government spending; we have controlled the money<br />
supply; and we have pressed for wage and salary restraint.<br />
To encourage initiative, reward enterprise, reduce the pressure<br />
for higher money earnings, we have cut taxes substantially.<br />
The tax cuts amount to around $ 1,000 million in revenue<br />
foregone. This year, the total will be around $ 800 million.<br />
We also took specific action to promote business investment.<br />
The results have been encouraging. Inflation came down<br />
substantially in 1976, and has come down further this year,<br />
despite those gloomy forecasts-following devaluation.<br />
Growth has been resumed, after no progress in 1974 and 1975.<br />
And practically all this growth was accounted for by the recovery<br />
of the private sector. Company profits are well up about<br />
for 1976. Business confidence has improved, and company<br />
investment is up. This will improve further as the benefits<br />
of devaluation flow through.<br />
wihshould assist a wider range of companies to raise<br />
overseas capital.,.. But the battle against inflation is not over,<br />
andweare using all the arms of government policy to continue<br />
progress. Unemployment is still a major problem and we have adopted a<br />
number of innovation schemes which have had a considerable<br />
degree of success. These schemes include: the Community Youth<br />
Support Scheme which has helped 15,000 young people to acquire </p>
<p>basic new skills; an expanded " NEAT" scheme which has trained<br />
18,000 people, three quarters of whom have found employment at<br />
the end of their service under the scheme; the most successful<br />
special youth employment training programme, which aids<br />
adolescents who have been unemployed for a lengthy period of<br />
time 70% of whom are getting jobs as a result of training<br />
they receive under the programme.<br />
Assistance is also given for apprentice training, and for those<br />
forced to relocate themselves and their families to gain<br />
employment. But as the unemployment figures show, these<br />
schemes cannot by themselves resolve the unemployment problems<br />
we inherited from Labor. One fact must be faced up to<br />
that because of the wages explosion which Labor fostered in two<br />
years there was a 53% increase in wages in manufacturing industry,<br />
unskilled and semi-skilled workers are relatively more highly<br />
paid than at any other time in Australia's history. This has<br />
meant that even though company profits are increasing, employers<br />
still tend to be reluctant to take on unskilled workers and are<br />
buying labor-saving machines. This is a factor that has<br />
not been adequately realised in Australia. But it does make<br />
it difficult to reduce unemployment as quickly as we all would<br />
wish. Unless union leaders take a responsible attitude towards wage<br />
increases, workers will find themselves priced out of employment,<br />
and the success we have had in reducing inflation and promoting<br />
economic recovery will not be translated as quickly as we would<br />
hope into reduced unemployment.<br />
Your own state has taken the lead in economic recovery. The<br />
reasons for this are not hard to find: the sharp rise in development<br />
of export-based industries which has begun, and which is likely<br />
to increase in the near future; and the very able leadership<br />
of the Western Australian Government under Sir Charles Court,<br />
which has consistently and successfully promoted Western<br />
Australia's interests. As Sir Charles recently pointed out<br />
Western Australia is in the happy position of looking forward<br />
to the prospects of major new developments over the next 7 years,<br />
as large in real terms as those that occurred over the last 17 years.<br />
The largest and most ambitious project is the development of the<br />
North West Shelf gas deposits. This $ 2-3 billion project will<br />
greatly supplement our energy supplies, and significantly<br />
boost our export earnings. Moreover, the establishment of a<br />
project of this magnitude in the Dampier area will act as a<br />
catalyst for other development. The substantial supply of<br />
natural gas should enable establishment of gas-consuIming industries<br />
along the length of the pipeline to Perth. It will assist<br />
development in thq.-Pilbara, and it will fulfil an important<br />
energy need in Perth as supplies from the the Perth Basin<br />
are reduced.<br />
The Commonwealth wants this, and other large scale projects<br />
to proceed as quickly as possible. And we have been doing all </p>
<p>that we can to promote the North West Shelf development.<br />
We have assisted the partners in the project by providing<br />
rulings and clarification on the application of tax laws,<br />
foreign investment rules, and a number of other matters.<br />
Sir Charles and I are in close and continuous contact on this<br />
issue to ensure that there is no undue delay.<br />
But for Australia to realise the benefits of such projects<br />
unwarranted industrial disputes must be avoided. So far this<br />
year, there has been a marked improvement overall in industrial<br />
relations the one glaring exception is our major export-based<br />
mineral projects. The current Mt Newman dispute and other<br />
stoppages and bans in the Pilbara have been most disruptive.<br />
Over 50,000 man days and $ 2.2 million in wages have been lost<br />
already in the Mt. Newman dispute. There is an average of more<br />
than one strike a week in the Pilbara. 20 ships are tied up at<br />
this moment at Port Hedland and more are expected each day.<br />
As a result of disputes such as these, major iron ore contracts<br />
have been entered withBrazilY which might have come to Australia.<br />
As Mr Hawke found out when he went to Japan, strikes and bans<br />
in the Pilbara have severely threatened the prospect of further<br />
investment and of further jobs. Mr Hawke went to the Pilbara<br />
presumably to stop the strikes continuing. And what happened?<br />
The position deteriorated further. The dispute between the<br />
Seamans Union and the Utah company in Queensland is also<br />
a most serious matter, and could have grave repercussions for<br />
the new ore industry in this state, and for the coal industry of<br />
New South Wales. The Utah dispute has led to the suspension of<br />
the 250 million dollar development at Norwich Park.. The<br />
same could happen to other major export-based developments.<br />
The Whitlam Government brought investment in this country to a<br />
halt. We acted to revitalise investment plans and to get a<br />
large -number-of major projects on the move. And we were<br />
successful. Three billion dollars worth of major new projects<br />
should get underway this year. And what does Labor do? What<br />
do the trade unions do? The very projects which promise to give*<br />
great impetus to our economic recovery, and provide jobs for<br />
thousands of workers are jeopardised by the very unions who<br />
are supposed to represent the best interests of those workers.<br />
These disputes have gone on so long, with so little sign of reason<br />
or commonsense being displayed, that we are entitled to ask<br />
whether the union leaders involved are trying to sabotage the<br />
prosperity of this country. I have called for a report from<br />
Mr Street and Mr Nixon on these disputes, and I may have to<br />
consider calling together-the Premiers of New South Wales, Queensland<br />
and Western Australia to discuss this whole question. It is<br />
essential that reason and commonsense prevail, and that<br />
these stoppages be brought quickly to an end so that these vital<br />
projects can proceed.<br />
When I was in Europe, the subject they always raised first in their<br />
discussions with me was uranium. This was understandable given<br />
Europe's need for energy. This need is one of the matters that<br />
we are going to have to consider very carefully in deciding the<br />
issue of uranium mining and export. Another factor will be the </p>
<p>importance of delaying the turn to the fast breeder reactor and<br />
the plutonium economy in which large quantities of plutonium<br />
would be produced and recycled. If sources of uranium are restricted<br />
the production of nuclear power for peaceful purposes will come<br />
much closer to the edge of military technology.<br />
The Labor Party's new policy on uranium would if implemented<br />
not only deny essential power to the homes and factories of<br />
Europe and Japan, it would hasten the move to the<br />
plutonium economy, and have the incidental effect of increasing<br />
the capacity of some countries to produce nuclear weapons.<br />
The Government is yet to make its own decision in the light of the<br />
two Fox Enquiry Reports. But it must be faced that a decision<br />
to ban outright uranium production in this country would not<br />
advance the well-being of mankind.<br />
In my discussions in Europe, I pointed out that the European<br />
Community wanted a secure access to uranium. And that reliability*<br />
of trade was a two-way business. I believe that they are coming<br />
to accept this. For a number of years now, Europe has been<br />
excluding Australian agricultural products from her markets,<br />
and disrupting our traditional markets in third countries by<br />
subsidising exports of her food surpluses. For many years,<br />
the European Economic Community tried to make these policies<br />
respectable by saying that such policies applied to agriculture<br />
alone. Now, these policies have been applied to Japanese<br />
manufactured goods and steel from Japan, South Africa.<br />
They tried to apply them to Australian steel. The Chairman of<br />
the Commission told me that Australia was an unfair trader<br />
in steel and demanded arbitrary cuts in our exports of<br />
There was no way I would voluntarily agree to such cuts.<br />
This morning there were news reports from Brussels that the<br />
request had been withdrawn. And these reports are confirmed<br />
by the cables I have received over the last few days. The<br />
E. E. C. is only in favour of free trade and general lowering of<br />
tariffs in things she produces better than other people.<br />
For those items which Europe produces less well, she plainly<br />
stands prepared to erect absolute and impenetrable trade<br />
barriers. When Australian industries have been in difficulty, we have still<br />
allowed access to our markets. In recent years tariffs have<br />
gone down about 30%, market penetration of imports<br />
has increased. Contrast that with the European approach,<br />
the Europeans are in fact great protectionists.<br />
After much discussion with the E. E. C. we agreed that there will<br />
be major bilateral discussions between the Community and<br />
Australia. I hope that these discussions will point the way to<br />
solutions to some of the trade problems that have created<br />
difficulties for some Australian industries. These are possibly<br />
the most critical international trade discussions in Australia's<br />
history, and the Government will be appointing a special trade<br />
negotiator to conduct them. </p>
<p>While we are discussing the international trade, I should make<br />
some reference to our trade policies with respect to ASEAN.<br />
There has been some criticism of our policies. To put it<br />
mildly, these are not well based on the facts. The facts are:<br />
Between 1970/ 71 and 197S/ 76, ASEAN's exports to Australia increased<br />
from $ 87 million to $ 317 million, a growth rate twice as<br />
fast as that of total Australian imports; these imports<br />
continued to grow by over $ 120 million through the last two<br />
years of difficult domestic economic conditions; since<br />
1971/ 72, our imports of textiles, clothing and footwear<br />
from ASEAN countries have increased four and a half times;<br />
and the rapid expansion of imports of ASEAN textiles and clothing<br />
has continued, even though some general import restraints<br />
were introduced on these items in 1974/ 75.<br />
Our own textile, clothing and footwear industries have been long<br />
established in Australia and they are substantial employers,<br />
particularly in some relatively small towns in country areas.<br />
These have been subjected to a very rapid change. It is not<br />
reasonable given the degree of unemployment in Australian industry<br />
to subject them to a greater rate of change. We can properly claJ<br />
that given our size, Australia has dealt more fairly in allowing 16<br />
ASEAN access to our markets than have the United States, Japan,<br />
Canada or Europe. In 1975 our imports, per head, of textile<br />
apparel, and footwear were $ 2.18 compared with the United<br />
States, $ 0.63; Japan, $ 0.25; E. E. C. $ 0.37; and Canada, $ 0.41.<br />
A similar situation applies to imports of manufactured goods from<br />
ASEAN. I believe that the ASEAN countries understand the<br />
position and I am looking forward to discussions with them so<br />
that we can go through the situation in detail.<br />
Mr Chairman, thank you for your invitation to address this meeti*<br />
Your state is making great progress under Sir Charles Court's<br />
leadership. And the very able team of Western Australian<br />
Senators and M. P.' s are making a major contribution to the<br />
Commonwe'alth's efforts. Reg Withers is an invaluable member<br />
of Cabinetzand Senate leader; and Senator Fred Chaney has made<br />
an outstanding contribution both as Senate Whip, Chairman<br />
of Backbenchers Committees, and as one of the leading members<br />
of various Federal Party Committees.<br />
The .3vernment is making solid progress but it will take time<br />
and your wholehearted support for us to achieve our goal<br />
of full economic recovery. 0000o0000 </p>
