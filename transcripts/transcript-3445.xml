    <content><![CDATA[<p>LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT<br />SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR E. G. WHITLAM, QC, M. P.,<br />OPENING THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL OF<br />LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATIONS, AT ALICE SPRINGS, ON MONDAY<br />11 NOVEMBER, 1974.<br />THERE IS A SYMBOLISM ABOUT THIS GATHERING WHICH<br />ONE MAY FIND FASCINATING OR FRIGHTENING ACCORDING TO ONE'S<br />PREJUDICESx AUSTRALIAN LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS AT LAST COME<br />TO THE CENTREX WHEN YOU CHOOSE NOT ONLY TO MEET IN THE<br />CENTRE, BUT HAVE THE LUCIFER OF CENTRALISM OPEN YOUR<br />CONFERENCE AND HAVE YOUR MEETING ON AN AUSTRALIAN TERRITORY<br />THEN THE PREMIER OF QUEENSLAND MIGHT WELL WONDER WHAT THE<br />WORLD IS COMING TOK I, NATURALLY AND BY CONTRAST, FIND<br />BOTH YOUR CHOICES THE VENUE AND THE OPENING SPEAKER<br />WELCOME AND GRATIFYINGX IN THE LIGHT OF THE NORTHERN<br />TERRITORY ELECTIONS IT MIGHT BE EXCESSIVE TO SAY THAT I MEET<br />YOU ON HOME TERRITORY; BUT IT IS AT LEAST NEUTRAL GROUND,<br />AND FOR ALL OF US AS FAR AS THE WARMTH OF THE WELCOME OF<br />THE PEOPLE OF ALICE SPRINGS ON THIS OCCASION IS CONCERNED<br />FRIENDLY GROUNDx</p>
<p>THIS CONFERENCE ITSELF IS ANOTHER LANDMARK ON<br />THE RAPID MARCH TO MATURITY TOWARDS PARTNERSHIP IN<br />THE FEDERAL SYSTEM WHICH LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS MADE IN<br />RECENT YEARS VERY RECENT YEARSx IT HAPPENS TO BE JUST<br />TWO YEARS THIS WEEK THAT I DELIVERED THE POLICY SPEECH<br />ON BEHALF OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY FOR THE 1972<br />ELECTIONSX IT WAS NO ACCIDENT THAT THE LENGTHIEST AND<br />MOST DETAILED SECTION OF THAT DOCUMENT DEALT DIRECTLY WITH<br />CITIES* CENTRES, REGIONS, AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE<br />SOCIAL, FINANCIAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS ASSOCIATED<br />WITH THEMA IT WAS NO ACCIDENT IN EITHER PERSONAL OR<br />POLITICAL TERMS. FROM THE TIME I WAS ELECTED TO THE<br />NATIONAL PARLIAMENT TWENTY-TWO YEARS AGO AT THE END OF<br />THIS MONTH I REFUSED TO ACCEPT WHAT WAS THEN THE<br />CONVENTIONAL WISDOM THAT THE SOLE OR CHIEF CONCERNS OF THE<br />NATIONAL PARLIAMENT SHOULD BE FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DEFENCE, THE<br />ANNUAL BUDGET AND THE LEVEL OF THE MAJOR SOCIAL WELFARE<br />PAYMENTSx POLITICALLY, IT SEEMED OBVIOUS THAT A PARTY OF<br />SOCIAL REFORM, SUCH AS OURS PROFESSED TO BE, EMASCULATED<br />ITSELF BY ACCEPTING THESE LIMITATIONS AND PREOCCUPATIONSX<br />IT COULD NEVER GET ANYWHERE UNLESS IT RECOGNISED, AS A<br />NATIONAL PARTY, THE NEED FOR NATIONAL INVOLVEMENT BY THE<br />NATIONAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE NATIONAL PARLIAMENT IN<br />THE CONCERNS OF THE PEOPLE OVER THE WHOLE RANGE OF POLICY<br />THEIR SCHOOLS, THEIR CITIES, THEIR HOSPITALS, THEIR<br />CULTURE, THEIR RECREATION, THEIR IMMEDIATE ENVIRONMENT, AND<br />PROVIDING ACCESS TO JOBS, SHOPS AND RECREATIONS) ,3/</p>
<p>AND IN ALL THESE AREAS I SAW IT TO BE NECESSARY AND<br />INESCAPABLE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT MUST PLAY A FULL<br />PART AS A FULL PARTNER WITHIN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM,<br />I FOUGHT TO HAVE THE VIEW ACCEPTED BY MY PARTY AND<br />INCORPORATED IN ITS PLATFORM I FOUGHT SUCCESSFULLY,<br />I THEN FOUGHT TO HAVE THAT: VIEW ACCEPTED BY THE<br />AUSTRALIAN ELECTORATEX I FOUGHT SUCCESSFULLY I HAVE<br />SINCE FOUGHT TO HAVE THAT VIEW INCORPORATED IN THE<br />LEGISLATION AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THIS NATIONA I<br />HAVE HAD SOME SUCCESSES AND SOME FAILURESX I HAVE NOT<br />YET FINISHED THAT FIGHT WHEN AS LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY<br />I BEGAN TO BRING LOCAL QUESTIONS TO THE CENTRE OF THE<br />NATIONAL DEBATE I CAME IN FOR SOME " CHIACKING" x I EVEN<br />HAD THE POOR TASTE TO SUGGEST THAT SEWERAGE WAS A<br />NATIONAL PROBLEM IN FACT A NATIONAL ISSUEX I REMEMBER<br />THE THEN PRIME MINISTER, JOHN GORTON, ACCUSED ME OF<br />TALKING LIKE A SHIRE PRESIDENTx I ACCEPTED THE SOFT<br />IMPEACHMENT I THOUGHT IT GOOD COMPANY TO BE INx I<br />FIND IT GOOD COMPANY TO BE IN TODAYx IRONICALLY<br />MR. GORTON HIMSELF IS NOW DEEMED AN EVEN MORE FEROCIOUS<br />CENTRALIST THAN IX THE FACT IS THAT THE APPROACH I TAKE<br />TO NATIONAL AFFAIRS OWES NOTHING TO ANY DOCTRINE CALLED<br />" CENTRALISM", IF SUCH A DOCTRINE THERE BEX</p>
<p>IT IS SCARCELY EVEN " SOCIALISM", IF SOCIALISM BE DEFINED<br />AS BERNARD SHAW AND THE WEBBS DID AND THEY WERE THE<br />PIONEERS OF MODERN LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS " THE INEVITABILITY<br />OF GRADUALISM" K I AM RATHER ENTITLED TO DESCRIBE WHAT I<br />HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING, DEFINING, AND RE-DEFINING OVER A LONG<br />TWENTY-TWO YEARS AND MORE, AS HAVING BEEN THE GRADUALISM<br />OF INEVITABILITY, FOR IT IS INEVITABLE, GIVEN AUSTRALIA'S<br />NATURE AND SITUATION, THAT THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT MUST<br />ACCEPT GREATER INVOLVEMENT IN ALL THESE MATTERS WHICH WERE<br />ONCE DEEMED TO BE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATES OR<br />OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTx THE RESULT OF THAT OLD APPROACH WAS<br />THAT THE FUNCTIONS WHICH A MODERN COMMUNITY REQUIRES SHOULD<br />BE PERFORMED THROUGH ITS ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES WERE EITHER<br />DONE INADEQUATELY OR NOT DONE AT ALL, WERE FINANCED<br />INADEQUATELY AND UNFAIRLY OR NOT FINANCED AT ALLx IT IS<br />INEVITABLE THAT THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT MUST ACCEPT INCREASING<br />RESPONSIBILITY TO FINANCE THESE FUNCTIONS FAIRLY AND<br />ADEQUATELYx WHAT I HAVE TRIED TO DO, WHAT THE AUSTRALIAN<br />GOVERNMENT HAS TRIED TO DO, IS TO CREATE THE INSTITUTIONS<br />AND MACHINERY AND TO APPOINT THE MEN AND WOMEN WHEREBY<br />THIS INEVITABLE RESPONSIBILITY CAN BE DISCHARGED<br />EFFICIENTLY AND FAIRLYx<br />TO THE EXTENT THAT THE POLICY SPEECH OF 1972<br />INCORPORATED THESE CONCEPTS IT MIGHT BE REGARDED AS<br />SOMETHING OF A POLITICAL TESTAMENTx</p>
<p>IT MAY BE THAT HAD WE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT THE ELECTIONS<br />BEFORE LAST, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MY LAST TESTAMENTX BUT<br />* IT IS USEFUL TO LOOK BACK ON THAT DOCUMENT AND SEE HOW FAR<br />THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE WHAT IT<br />SET OUT TO DO FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE FOR<br />WHOM LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS SO GREAT A RESPONSIBILITYX<br />I EXPLAINED OUR GENERAL APPROACH IN THIS WAY:<br />" EVEN THE MOST ENLIGHTENED AND EQUAL APPROACH TO<br />SOCIAL WELFARE CAN ONLY SCRATCH THE SURFACE OF THE BASIC<br />PROBLEM OF EQUALITY AND WELL-BEING OF MOST OF OUR CITIZENSX<br />WE CAN DOUBLE AND TREBLE SOCIAL BENEFITS, BUT WE CAN NEVER<br />MAKE UP THROUGH CASH PAYMENTS FOR WHAT WE TAKE AWAY IN<br />MENTAL AND PHYSICAL WELL-BEING AND SOCIAL COHESION THROUGH<br />THE BREAK-DOWN OF COMMUNITY LIFE AND COMMUNITY IDENTITY<br />INCREASINGLY, A CITIZEN'S REAL STANDARD OF LIVING, THE<br />HEALTH OF HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY, HIS CHILDREN'S<br />OPPORTUNITIES FOR EDUCATION AND SELF-IMPROVEMENT, HIS<br />ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, HIS ABILITY TO ENJOY<br />THE NATION'S RESOURCES FOR RECREATION AND CULTURE, HIS<br />ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE-IN THE DECISIONS AND ACTIONS OF THE<br />COMMUNITY ARE DETERMINED NOT BY HIS INCOME, NOT BY THE<br />HOURS HE WORKS, BUT BY WHERE HE LIVESx THIS IS WHY<br />LABOR BELIEVES THAT THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT MUST INVOLVE<br />ITSELF DIRECTLY IN CITIES AND CENTRES WHERE MOST PEOPLE LIVEA</p>
<p>PRACTICALLY EVERY MAJOR NATIONAL PROBLEM RELATES TO<br />CITIEsx A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WHICH CUTS ITSELF OFF<br />FROM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE NATION'S CITIES IS CUTTING<br />ITSELF OFF FROM THE NATION'IS REAL LIFEx A NATIONAL<br />GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT CITIES HAS<br />NOTHING RELEVANT OR ENDURING TO SAY ABOUT THE NATION<br />OR THE NATION'IS FUTUREy LABOR IS NOT A CITY-BASED<br />PARTYx IT IS A PEOPLE-BASED PARTY, AND THE OVERWHELMING<br />MAJORITY OF OUR PEOPLE LIVE IN CITIES AND TOWNS ACROSS<br />OUR NATIONX I ITHEN OUTLINED SPECIFIC PROPOSALsKr THEY WERE:<br />TO ESTABLISH A MINISTRY OR URBAN AND REGIONAL<br />DEVELOP ME N T<br />To SET UP LAND COMMISSIONS TO BUY SUBSTANTIAL<br />TRACTS OF LAND IN NEW AREAS BEING OPENED UP<br />FOR HOUSING AND TO LEASE OR SELL AT COST FULLY<br />SERVICED BLOCKS)(<br />To MAKE DIRECT GRANTS TO THE STATES FOR URBAN<br />PUBLIC TRANSPORTx<br />TO ASK THE PRINCIPAL WATER AND SEWERAGE AUTHORITIES<br />WHAT AUSTRALIAN GRANTS IN THAT FINANCIAL YEAR WOULD<br />ENABLE THEM TO EMBARK PROMPTLY AND ECONOMICALLY ON<br />AN UNINTERRUPTED PROGRAM TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO<br />THE PREMISES IN THEIR AREAS BY 1978, K 1 37/ 0</p>
<p>To MAKE DIRECT REPRESENTATION FOR LOCAL<br />GOVERNMENT A CONDITION OF PARTICIPATION<br />BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT AT THE<br />PROPOSED CONSTITUTION CONVENTION OF 1973A<br />TO AMEND THE GRANTS COMMISSION ACT TO<br />AUTHORISE THE COMMISSION TO INQUIRE INTO<br />AND REPORT UPON APPLICATION FOR AUSTRALIAN<br />GOVERNMENT GRANTS BY ANY LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />AUTHORITY OR GROUP OF AUTHORITIES, PREFERABLY<br />ON A REGIONAL OR DISTRICT BASISX<br />To SECURE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT A VOICE AND<br />A VOTE ON THE LOAN COUNCIL,<br />WITH ONE NOTABLE EXCEPTION, THESE UNDERTAKINGS<br />HAVE ALL BEEN FULFILLED IN WHOLE OR PARTx IN HIS ANNUAL<br />REPORT YOUR PRESIDENT MR GUERIN REFERS VERY GENEROUSLY TO<br />THESE ACHIEVEMENTS,. PROPERLY, HE DESCRIBES THE AMENDED<br />GRANTS COMMISSION LEGISLATION, THE SUBSEQUENT REPORT OF<br />THE GRANTS COMMISSION AND THE ACCEPTANCE BY THE AUSTRALIAN<br />GOVERNMENT OF ITS RECOMMENDATIONS AS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT<br />ACHIEVEMENT THIS YEARA AS A RESULT OF THE FIRST REPORT<br />WE HAVE AUTHORISED PAYMENT OF NEARLY $ 56 MILLION ($ 56,3' 45,000)<br />TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIESA THE 806 AUTHORITIES WHICH<br />BENEFIT COMPRISE 92 PER CENT OF ALL WHO APPLIED FOR<br />FINANCIAL ASSISTANCEA : 8' A</p>
<p>THE GRANTS RANGE FROM $ 3,000 TO $ 2 MILLION FOR THE<br />LARGEST AND MOST POPULOUS COUNCIL AREA IN AUSTRALIA<br />BRISBANEx I EMPHASISE THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />ACCEPTED THE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATION THAT THE<br />GRANTS ARE MADE WITHOUT CONDITIONS ON THE MANNER IN<br />WHICH THEY ARE SPENT BY THE RECEIVING AUTHORITYx I ALSO<br />EMPHASISE THAT THE NEW FUNDS SHOULD IN NO WAY BE A<br />SUBSTITUTE FOR REVENUE NORMALLY RAISED BY COUNCILS BY<br />LONG ESTABLISHED MEANS SUCH AS RATES AND CHARGES FOR<br />SERVICES NOR REPLACE ASSISTANCE NORMALLY PROVIDED BY<br />STATE GOVERNMENTSK As YOU WILL BE WELL AWARE, OUR CHIEF OBJECTIVE<br />IS EQUALISATION OF SERVICES WITHIN REGIONSx WE HAVE<br />LEGISLATED TO ENABLE THE GRANTS COMMISSION TO PROMOTE<br />STANDARDS AS BETWEEN REGIONS IN A WAY WHICH IT HAD ONLY<br />BEEN ABLE TO DO, FROM ITS CREATION IN 1933, AS BETWEEN<br />THE STATESY, THE GREAT INEQUALITIES IN AUSTRALIA NOW<br />LIE NOT BETWEEN THE STATES BUT BETWEEN REGIONS WITHIN<br />THE STATE BOUNDARIESX I BELIEVE THE NEW WORK OF THE GRANTS COMMISSION,<br />AS IT UNFOLDS, WILL PROMOTE ANOTHER DEVELOPMENT OF<br />PROFOUND SIGNIFANCE TO THE SHAPE, IMPORTANCE AND<br />EFFECTIVENESS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTX I REFER TO THE<br />CREATION OF REGIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF GENUINE<br />REGIONAL THINKINGX 9/,</p>
<p>THE CREATION OF APPROVED REGIONAL ORCANISATIONS FOR THE<br />PURPOSES OF THE GRANTS COMMISSION ACT IS NOW ALMOST<br />COMPLETEX So FAR THERE ARE 74 APPROVED REGIONAL<br />ORGANISATIONS) IN THE FIRST YEAR OF OPERATION OF THE<br />NEW ACT ONLY THIRTEEN LOCAL GOVERNING BODIES EITHER<br />DECLINED TO ACCEPT MEMBERSHIP OF ANY REGIONAL ORGANISATION<br />OR DID NOT SEEK ANY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE<br />GRANTS COMMISSION, THIS NUMBER HAS ALREADY BEEN REDUCED<br />AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO A VIRTUAL 100 PER CENT PARTICIPATIONX<br />THE SPIRIT IN WHICH INDIVIDUAL LOCAL AUTHORITIES ENTER INFO<br />THE REGIONAL PROGRAM IS, OF COURSE, A MATTER FOR THEIR<br />DECISIONK I DO SUGGEST, HOWEVER, THAT AN IMAGINATIVE<br />APPROACH TO THE REGIONAL ORGANISATION, INVOLVING PARTICIPATION<br />NOT ONLY OF THE CONSTITUENT COUNCILS BUT OF THE REGIONAL<br />COMMUNITY, WILL PROVIDE A MAJOR STEP TOWARDS BETTER REGIONS,<br />BETTER LOCAL GOVERNMENT, BETTER COOPERATION BETWEEN FEDERAL<br />AND STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND BETTERo HAPPIER COMMUNITIESAAT-<br />PRESENT THE REGIONAL ORGANISATION$ CONSIST SOLELY OF<br />REPRESENTATIVES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTx THE FUTURE STRUCTURE<br />AND DEVELOPMENT OF REGIONAL ORGANISATIONS IS NOT SOMETHING<br />THAT SHOULD BE FEARED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE IT IS A<br />MATTER LARGELY FOR COMPONENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES<br />THEMSELVES TO DETERMINEx THEY CAN IF THEY CHOOSE LEAVE<br />THE REGIONAL ORGANISATION AS NOTHING MORE THAN A DEVICE FOR<br />MAKING APPLICATION TO THE GRANTS COMMISSIONX</p>
<p>I DO BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT EXPERIENQE WILL DEMONSTRATE<br />THE ADVANTAGES OF REGIONAL CONSULTATION AND COOPERATION<br />IN A NATION WHICH HAS HITHERTO HAD FAR ' 00 FEW GENUINE<br />REGIONS AND FAR TOO MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES; FAR<br />TOO LITTLE REGIONALISM AND FAR TOO MUCH PAROCHIALISMX<br />I MENTIONED THAT THERE WAS ONE GREAT EXCEPTION<br />IN OUR EFFORTS TO FULFIL THE PROGRAM FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />OUTLINED TWO YEARS AGOx NOT, YOU WILL BELIEVE ME, FOR<br />WANT OF TRYINGX I REFER OF COURSE TO OUR EFFORTS TO<br />SECURE A VOICE AND A VOTE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON THE<br />LOAN COUNCILx IN THE 1972 POLICY SPEECH I SAID: " LET<br />THERE BE NO MISTAKE ABOUT OUR DETERMINATION TO MAKE LOCAL<br />GOVERNMENT A GENUINE PARTNER IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEMX IN<br />1927 WHEN THE FIRST FINANCIAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE<br />COMMONWEALTH AND STATES ESTABLISHED THE LOAN COUNCIL<br />SEMI-GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT DEBTS WERE A MERE<br />FRACTION OF STATE DEBTSx Now SEMI-GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL<br />AUTHORITIES HAVE TO FIND AS LARGE SUMS AS THE STATE<br />GOVERNMENTS FOR THE REPAYMENT OF LOANS AND PAYMENT OF INTERESTJ<br />IT WOULD BE INCONCEIVABLE, IF THE FINANCIAL AGREEMENT WERE<br />BEING DRAWN UP NOW, FOR THE SEMI AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL<br />AUTHORITIES TO BE COMPLETELY IGNOREDA AT PRESENT ON THE<br />LOAN COUNCIL EACH STATE HAS ONE VOTE AND THE COMMONWEALTH<br />HAS TWO VOTES AND A CASTING VOTE)( WE PROPOSE THAT AT<br />NEXT YEARIS CONVENTION THE LOAN COUNCIL BE RESTRUCTURED TO<br />CONSIST OF ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM EACH STATE GOVERNMENT,<br />ONE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS IN EACH<br />STATE CHOSEN PY THEM AND FOUR REPRESENTATIVES OF THE<br />COMMONWEALTH4</p>
<p>III<br />" IT WILL THEN BE POSSIBLE FOR THE COMMONWEALTH. ON<br />REQUEST. TO RAISE APPROVED LOANS QN BEHALF OF SEMIGOVERNMENT<br />AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES* THUS<br />GIVING THEM TH9 ADVANTAGE OF THE LONGER PERIOD AND<br />LOWER INTEREST APPERTAINING TO THE LOANS RAISED BY<br />THE COMMONWEALTH ON BEHALF OF THE STATgS."<br />I DON'T SUPPOSE I HAVE TO FOLLOW THROUGH THE<br />STORY IN DETAIL% AT THE CONVENTION IN SYDNEY IN<br />SEPTEMBER 1973 1 DID SECURE SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT OR<br />AT LEAST I THOUGHT I HAD SECURED IT FROM THE PREMIERSX<br />AT LEAST THEY AGREED TO DISCUSS THE PROPOSAL AND WHEN<br />THEY CAME TO CANBERRA ON 11 OCTOBER 1973 1 EXPECTED TO<br />MAKE REAL PROGRESSK I HAVE TO SAY THAT WITH ONE<br />EXCEPTION THE PREMIERS DID LITTLE MORE THAN REINFORCE<br />EACH OTHERS I PREJUDICES IN FAVOUR OF THE STATUS QUOx<br />REGRETTABLY THE ONE EXCEPTION IS NO LONGER A PREMIER.<br />THEIR ARGUMENTS BOILED DOWN TO TWO: THAT THE PRESENCE<br />OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON THE LOAN COUNCIL WOULD MAKE THAT<br />BODY UNWIELDY IF NOT UNWORKABL~ E, PARTICULARLY AS LOCAL<br />GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES WOULD LACK THE KNOW-HOW TO<br />GRAPPLE WITH THESE PROBLEMS OF BORROWINGS, DEBTS, INTEREST<br />AND FUNDING; AND SECONDLY, AL. L THAT WAS NECESSARY FOR<br />THE SOLUTION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROBLEMS WAS FOR THE<br />AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE MORE MONEY FOR THE STATESg<br />IN OTHER WORDS, THE SAME SYSTEM1 THE SAME SET-UP# WHICH<br />HAS SO MANIFESTLY FAILED, SHOULD BE CONTINUEDX 12/.</p>
<p>12,<br />I DO NOT THINK ANY LXI" LIIENCE SINCE I UECAME PRIM<br />MINISTER HAS SO COMPLETELY UPHELD THE ASSERTION I USED<br />TO MAKE AS LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION THAT THE STATES<br />WHO COMPLAIN OF STARVATION FROM CANIERRA ARE INSENSITIVE<br />TO THE NEEDS OF THEIR OWN CREATIONSx I NEXTSOUGHT TO<br />ACHIEVE OUR OBJECT IN THE ONLY WAY OPEN BY REFERENDUM,<br />BY GOING TO THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA, I DO NOT HIDE<br />FROM YOU MY DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE REJECTION OF THAT<br />REFERENDUMA IN A SENSE, I SUPPOSE IT MAY BE REGARDED<br />AS ONE OF THE CASUALITIES OF THE ELECTION FORCED UPON US<br />IN MAYX THE OFFICIAL CASE FOR NO WAS A MARVEL OF<br />MISREPRESENTATIONK THE PROPOSAL WAS TERMED A " MONEY<br />BRIBE" IT CLAIMED: " IMAGINE THE MACHINERY WHICH<br />WOULD BE NECESSARY TO EXAMINE THE AFFAIRS OF 1,000<br />MUNICIPALITIES AND TO DECIDE WHICH ONES WERE DOING WHAT,<br />WHY THEY WERE DOING IT, HOW THEY WERE DOING IT, WHETHER<br />THEY NEEDED ASSISTANCE, IF SO WHAT ASSISTANCE AND HOW<br />MUCH" IN OTHER WORDS, THE OFFICIAL CASE FOR No WAS<br />ACTUALLY ATTACKING THE WORK ALREADY UNDERTAKEN BY THE<br />GRANTS COMMISSION/., IT DELIBERATELY CONFUSED THE<br />LOAN COUNCIL AND THE GRANTS COMMISSIONA DESPITE THE<br />CONFUSION, DESPITE THE FIELD-DAY FOR ALL THE NAY-SAYERS1<br />THE PROPOSAL RECEIVED A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF PUBLIC SUPPORT4<br />THE INTERESTING FEATURE IS THAT THE SIZE OF THE YES VOTE WAS<br />IN DIRECT PROPORTION TO THE SIZE OF THE STATE THE LARGER<br />THE STATE THE LARGER THE YES VOTE. 131,</p>
<p>13.<br />BY STATES THE RESULTS WERE: yu N<br />N W SOUTH WALES 50-79 49.21<br />VICTORIA 47.38 52,62<br />QUEENSLAND 43.68 56.32<br />SOWTH AUSTRALIA 42.52 57.48<br />WESTERN AUSTRALIA 40.67 59.33<br />TASMANIA 40.00 60.00<br />AUSTRALIA 46.85 53,15<br />WHATEVER THE PRESENT OUTLOOK ON THIS OR ANY<br />OTHER MATTER AFFECTING LOCAL GOVERNMENT, AM<br />DETERMINED TO CARRY OUT THE FUNDAMENTAL PLEDGE I GAVE<br />IN 1972 THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHALL BE MADE A FULL<br />PARTNER IN OUR FEDERAL SYSTEMXk THE GRANTS COMMISSION<br />ACT. is OBVIOUSLY A BIG STEP FORWARDA., THE REJECTION SO<br />FAR OF OUR EFFORTS FOR REPRESENTATION ON THE LOAN<br />COUNCIL IS OBVIOUSLY A SET-BACK,~ YET WE ARE ACHIEVING<br />THE BASIC OBJECTIVE PARTNERSHIP IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM<br />IN MANY WAYS)( WE ARE DOING THIS BY INVOLVING LOCAL<br />GOVERNMENT CLOSELY IN MANY OF OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT<br />PROGRAMS, IN 1973 WE INSTITUTED TRIAL AREA IMPROVEMENT<br />PROGRAMS INVOLVING SPENDING OF $ 8 MILLION IN THE SYDNEY<br />AND MELBOURNE WESTERN REGIONSx, THIS YEAR THERE WILL BE<br />THI. RTEEN AREA IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS OPERATING WITH A<br />SPENDING OF $ 14 MILLIONA&amp; ? 1</p>
<p>14.<br />LAST YEAR WE PROVIDED $ 28 MILLION UNDER OUR<br />NATIONAL SEWERAGE PROGRAM, THIS YEAR THE ESTIMAIE IS<br />$ 105 MILLION AND THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO TOWNS<br />WITH A POPULATION OF MORE THAN 10,000<br />FOR THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE MADE URBAN LOCAL<br />ROADS ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE<br />AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT,<br />THE DEPARTMENT OF TOURISM AND RECREATION AND<br />OTHER AUSTRALIAN DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS DEPARTMENT OF<br />URBAN AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT ARE CONSULTING AT LOCAL<br />LEVEL ON THE RECREATIONAL NEEDS OF THE PEOPLEx OUR<br />GRANTS PROGRAM HAS MADE A START TOWARDS MEETING THOSE NEEDSA<br />WE HAVE THIS YEAR ALLOCATED $ 2.25 MILLION FOR GRANTS FOR<br />LOCAL TOURIST ATTRACTIONS AND FACILITIESx WE ARE<br />ESTABLISHING ADVISORY COMMITTEES FOR CONSULTATION WITH<br />LOCAL GOVERNMENT, REGIONAL TOURIST ORGANISATIONS AND<br />INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES TO PLAN REGIONAL TOURIST<br />DEVELOPMENTX WE HAVE EXPANDED THE PROGRAM OF LOCAL<br />OWNERSHIP OF AERODROMES.</p>
<p>LOCAL GOVERN4MENT HAS PARTICIPATED IN THE<br />INTERIM PROGRAM FOR PRE-SCHOOL AND CHILD-CARE<br />SERVICES,, ABOUT HALF OF THE 122 CAPITAL PROJECTS<br />UNDERTAKEN THROUGH OUR CHILD-CARE PROGRAM WERE<br />SPONSORED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES) PROJECTS DEVELOPED, PROGRESS PAYMENTS WERE MADE<br />DIRECT TO THESE AUTHORITIESx ONCE THE PROJECTS WERE<br />WELL UNDERWAY RECURRENT GRANTS WERE PAID TO THE<br />MANAGEMENT BODIES WHICH USUALLY INCLUDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />REPRESENTAT IONX<br />WE HAVE MADE AVAILABLE MORE THAN MILLION<br />IN DIRECT GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES FOR<br />ABORIGINAL ADVANCEMENT IN THE PAST YEARX MOST OF THAT<br />WAS ALLOCATED UNDER THE SPECIAL WORK PROJECTS SCHEME<br />ADMINISTERED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIESX MAY SAY<br />THAT, IN GENERAL, WE HAVE BEEN VERY SATISFIED WITH THE<br />ADMINISTRATION OF THE GRANTS AND I APPRECIATE THE<br />SPIRIT IN WHICH LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS ENTERED INTO THE<br />PROGRAMA WE HAVE COOPERATED CLOSELY WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />THROUGH THE CREATION OF THE REGIONAL COUNCILS FOR SOCIAL<br />D EVELOPMENT IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />ASSISTANCE PLANA</p>
<p>16.<br />THE LEGISLATION FOR THE -OSPITALS AND HEALTH<br />SERVICES COMMISSION PROVIDES FOR THE COMMISSION<br />MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO BE<br />MADE AVAILABLE BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO LOCAL<br />GOVERNMENTS AFTER CONSULTATIONS WITH THE STATESA THE<br />COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAM AND THE COMMUNITY MENTAL HEATHO<br />ALCOHOLISM AND DRUG DEPENDENCY PROGRAM, BOTH INTRODUCED<br />IN 1973, PROVIDE FOR DIRECT GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />ORGANISATIONS* LOCAL GOVERNMENT NOW HAS AN OPPORTUNIlY<br />TO PARTICIPATE DIRECTLY IN THE PROVISION OF A WIDE RANGE<br />OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND FACILITIES AT THE COMMUNITY<br />LEVEL, WHERE ITS PARTICIPATION CAN BE MOST EFFECTIVEA<br />WE HAVE BEEN GRATIFIED BY THE COOPERATION WE<br />HAVE RECEIVED FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN THE REGIONAL<br />EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT SCHEMEX So FAR, 350 PROJECTS<br />COSTING MORE THAN $ 8.5 MILLION HAVE BEEN APPROVED4 A<br />FURTHER 100 PROJECTS ARE UNDER CONSIDERATIONg A<br />PARTICULARLY ENCOURAGING FEATURE HAS BEEN THE WILLINGNESS<br />OF PROJECT SPONSORS, PREDOMINANTLY LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />AUTHORITIES, TO CONTRIBUTE THEMSELVES TO THE COST OF<br />PROJECTS. 171,</p>
<p>174<br />THE ROLE WE ASSIGN TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS<br />THE REAL IANSWER TO CHARGES OF CENTRALISMxK UNDER A<br />VARIETY OF PROGRAMS WE HAVE PROVIDED LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />WITH THE FUNDS TO UNDERTAKE A RANGE OF ACTIVITIES<br />PREVIOUSLY INADEQUATELY CARRIED OUT OR TOTALLY<br />NEGLECTEDyK WE DELIBERATELY HAVE MADE A ND SHALL MAKE<br />LOCAL GOVERNMENT A VEHICLE FOR OUR LEGISLATION ON AGED<br />PERSONS'I HOMES AND HOSTELS, SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT,<br />HANDICAPPED CHILDREN, MEALS ON WHEELS, HOME CARE AND<br />NURSING, NURSING HOMES AND HOMELESS MEN AND WOMENK<br />THESE ARE ALL ACTIVITIES WHICH CANNOT BE CLOSELY<br />REGULATED FROM THE NATIONAL OR STATE CAPITALS AND ARE<br />BEST PLANNED AND IMPLEMENTED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT WORKING<br />WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES), THEY JUSTIFY ASSISTANCE FROM<br />THE NATION'IS FINANCES BUT NOT INCREASES IN RATESX<br />LAST MONTH WE WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE<br />ABLE TO ANNOUNCE THAT MR JUSTICE ELSE-MITCHELL, JUDGE OF<br />THE LAND AND THE VALUATION COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES<br />SINCE 1962, HAD ACCEPTED APPOINTMENTr AS CHAIRMAN OF<br />THE GRANTS COMMISSION FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARSx HE IS<br />A MAN WITH A VERY DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEMS<br />OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHEN HE WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE ROYAL<br />COMMISSION INTO NEW SOUTH WALES' LAND VALUATION RATING<br />SYSTEMS IN 1965, HE SAID: am. 18/.</p>
<p>A<br />18,<br />" PRESENT CENTRALI$ ED POLICIES, WHICH HAVE REDUCED<br />LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO A STATE OF VASSALAGE AND<br />COUNCILS TO THE ROLE OF MENDICANTS, NEED DRASTIC<br />REAPPRAISEMENT, THOUGH I WONDER IF STATE<br />GOVERNMENTS ARE VERY ANXIOUS FOR LOCAL AUTHORITIES<br />TO GAIN ANY SUBSTANTIAL MEASURE OF FINANCIAL<br />INDEPENDENCE OR TO DEVELOP QUALITIES OF STRONG LOCAL<br />AUTONOMYx" THE POLICIES AND PROGRAMS OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />GOVERNMENT WILL, I BELIEVE, GO FAR TO END THAT<br />CONDITION OF VASSALAGE, THE PARADOX IS THAT MORE<br />DIRECT COOPERATION BETWEEN THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND<br />LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN HELP END STATE CENTRALISM BY GIVING<br />THE CHANCE FOR THE GROWTH OF GENUINE REGIONALISMK OUR<br />AIM IS TO PROMOTE THE QUALITY OF THE REGIONS AND TO<br />PROMOTE EQUALITY BETWEEN THE REGIONSx IT CAN BE<br />ACHIEVED ONLY THROUGH COOPERATION BETWEEN THE NATIONAL<br />GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTx THERE IS NO OTHER<br />WAYx THIS IS NOT JUST MY CHOICE; IT IS A CHOICE<br />IMPOSED UPON US BY NECESSITY, BY THE INEVITABILITY OF<br />AUSTRALIAN HISTORY, ( END)</p>
