today announced that Australia would contribute $ 250,000 to<br />
assist Zambia in its efforts to develop import-export routes<br />
alternative to those formerly operating through Rhodesia.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that in making a contribution,<br />
Australia was joining Britain, Canada, New Zealand and other<br />
0 countries who are assisting Zambia in its urgent need for<br />
transport facilities. Mr Whitlam said the Commonwealth Sanctions Committee<br />
meeting in London today was being informed of the Australian<br />
contribution. Two special assistants of President Kaunda visited<br />
Canberra in April to give first hand details of Zambia's<br />
position and its requirements for a variety of transport,<br />
communication and other equipment.<br />
Mr Whitlam said details of the form of the<br />
contribution will be determined in consultation with the<br />
Zambian authorities and other members of the Commonwealth<br />
Sanctions Committee. </p>
