    <content><![CDATA[<p>International Women's Day 1998 is an opportunity to reaffirm</p>
<p> our commitment to the continued advancement of women's rights,</p>
<p> and the inclusion of women in the decisions shaping our nation into</p>
<p> the next century.</p>
<p>In keeping with my Government's 1996 election campaign promise</p>
<p> to examine the treatment of superannuation following the dissolution</p>
<p> of marriage, I am pleased to announce today that this reform process</p>
<p> has begun.</p>
<p>I am keen to develop concrete proposals for reform so that separating</p>
<p> couples no longer face this uncertainty in the event of relationship</p>
<p> breakdown. For example, in 1996 52,466 couples registered for divorce</p>
<p> in Australia.</p>
<p>There are clear policy objectives to guide our reforms:</p>
<p>   * superannuation should be included in the division of marital</p>
<p> property;</p>
<p>   * there must be clear rules for valuing superannuation;</p>
<p>   * women and men should be encouraged to settle their own affairs</p>
<p> equipped with full information;</p>
<p>   * reforms should be consistent with retirement incomes policy</p>
<p> and the type of superannuation fund; and</p>
<p>   * the reforms should minimise the complexity and cost associated</p>
<p> with this process.</p>
<p>The Treasurer has recently written to superannuation industry representatives</p>
<p> seeking input to the reform process and I look forward to their contributions</p>
<p> in resolving this important issue.</p>
<p>I would like to pay particular credit here to the work undertaken</p>
<p> on this policy reform by my colleague, Peter Costello, and the Minister</p>
<p> for the Status of Women, Judi Moylan who has capably represented and</p>
<p> promoted the interests of women in my Government's deliberations</p>
<p> on this issue.</p>
<p>It is appropriate that on this International Women's Day I mark</p>
<p> the Government's commitment to women and to the advancement of</p>
<p> all human rights in general by announcing the appointment of the new</p>
<p> President and Sex Discrimination Commissioner to the Human Rights</p>
<p> and Equal Opportunity Commission.</p>
<p>The Government has decided to appoint Professor Alice Tay AM as President</p>
<p> of the Commission and Ms Susan Halliday as Sex Discrimination Commissioner.</p>
<p> Both individuals bring to the Commission considerable experience in</p>
<p> defending human rights and tackling discrimination.</p>
<p>Over 20 years Professor Tay has demonstrated expertise in international</p>
<p> forums as well as local work on law and human rights. As Challis Professor</p>
<p> of Jurisprudence with the University of Sydney Faculty of Law, a Director</p>
<p> of that University's Centre for Asian and Pacific Law and as</p>
<p> a Member of the International Legal Services Advisory Council Professor</p>
<p> Tay is admirably equipped to advancing the protection and promotion</p>
<p> of human rights in the region.</p>
<p>Ms Halliday also is suitably qualified. Among her current positions</p>
<p> include her role as Assistant Director of the Business Council of</p>
<p> Australia, Chair of the Board of the National Centre for Women and</p>
<p> former Assistant Director of the Council for Equal Opportunity in</p>
<p> Employment.</p>
<p>I look forward to their contribution and wish them both well in their</p>
<p> endeavours.</p>
<p>My Government is determined to enhance living conditions for Australian</p>
<p> women. Ahead of today's announcement, initiatives already undertaken</p>
<p> include:</p>
<p>* Spending more than $1 billion a year on child care - a real increase</p>
<p> for every year we have been in office, with an extra 83,000 places</p>
<p> available over the next four years.</p>
<p>* The National Campaign Against Violence and Crime is a $13 million</p>
<p> campaign aimed at making it safer for everybody, particularly women,</p>
<p> to live their lives free of fear.</p>
<p>* The Partnerships for Domestic Violence, worth $25 million over four</p>
<p> years, is particularly aimed at finding ways of preventing this particularly</p>
<p> repulsive form of abuse.</p>
