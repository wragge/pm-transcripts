    <content><![CDATA[<p><font size="3">International Women’s Day 1998 is an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to the continued advancement of women’s rights, and the inclusion of women in the decisions shaping our nation into the next century.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">In keeping with my Government’s 1996 election campaign promise to examine the treatment of superannuation following the dissolution of marriage, I am pleased to announce today that this reform process has begun.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">I am keen to develop concrete proposals for reform so that separating couples no longer face this uncertainty in the event of relationship breakdown. For example, in 1996 52,466 couples registered for divorce in Australia.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">There are clear policy objectives to guide our reforms:</font></p>
<ul><li><font size="3">superannuation should be included in the division of marital property;</font></li>
<li><font size="3">there must be clear rules for valuing superannuation;</font></li>
<li><font size="3">women and men should be encouraged to settle their own affairs equipped with full information;</font></li>
<li><font size="3">reforms should be consistent with retirement incomes policy and the type of superannuation fund; and</font></li>
<li><font size="3">the reforms should minimise the complexity and cost associated with this process.</font></li>
</ul><p><font size="3">The Treasurer has recently written to superannuation industry representatives seeking input to the reform process and I look forward to their contributions in resolving this important issue.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">I would like to pay particular credit here to the work undertaken on this policy reform by my colleague, Peter Costello, and the Minister for the Status of Women, Judi Moylan who has capably represented and promoted the interests of women in my Government’s deliberations on this issue.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">It is appropriate that on this International Women’s Day I mark the Government’s commitment to women and to the advancement of all human rights in general by announcing the appointment of the new President and Sex Discrimination Commissioner to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The Government has decided to appoint Professor Alice Tay AM as President of the Commission and Ms Susan Halliday as Sex Discrimination Commissioner. Both individuals bring to the Commission considerable experience in defending human rights and tackling discrimination.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Over 20 years Professor Tay has demonstrated expertise in international forums as well as local work on law and human rights. As Challis Professor of Jurisprudence with the University of Sydney Faculty of Law, a Director of that University’s Centre for Asian and Pacific Law and as a Member of the International Legal Services Advisory Council Professor Tay is admirably equipped to advancing the protection and promotion of human rights in the region.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Ms Halliday also is suitably qualified. Among her current positions include her role as Assistant Director of the Business Council of Australia, Chair of the Board of the National Centre for Women and former Assistant Director of the Council for Equal Opportunity in Employment.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">I look forward to their contribution and wish them both well in their endeavours.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">My Government is determined to enhance living conditions for Australian women. Ahead of today’s announcement, initiatives already undertaken include:</font></p>
<ul><li><font size="3">Spending more than $1 billion a year on child care - a real increase for every year we have been in office, with an extra 83,000 places available over the next four years.</font></li>
<li><font size="3">The National Campaign Against Violence and Crime is a $13 million campaign aimed at making it safer for everybody, particularly women, to live their lives free of fear.</font></li>
<li><font size="3">The Partnerships for Domestic Violence, worth $25 million over four years, is particularly aimed at finding ways of preventing this particularly repulsive form of abuse.</font></li>
</ul><p><font size="3">8 March 1998</font></p>
