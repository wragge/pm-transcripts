FOR l' 5J DTh cobr18<br />
CONCERN FOTR FAI41LIES<br />
The Liberal National Country Party Government is COMMitted<br />
to poli~ cies which have the utmuost concern for Australian<br />
fai iie s.<br />
Su-tch-programnnes as t e Pai~ ily A 6o w16: ecYern co ing aliout<br />
$ 1 billion a year; the doubling of the spouse rebate for<br />
sin1eicome families; _ and the improved Hoh'Ces Savings Grant<br />
Scheme, introduced in 1977, xinderline that concern.<br />
The Homes Savings Grant Scheme has now been' greatly imrproved<br />
again. flaving in Mind Sydney in particular, where house valutes have<br />
risen considerably, we will be lifting home value lim~ its up<br />
to a maximn~ u of $ 70,000 and, for families with children, the<br />
Tnaxinum grant will he increased to $ 3000.<br />
The Government is also showinj particular concern for families<br />
in nead with a range of support services that develop-ad<br />
during the International Year of the Cbild.<br />
Win are now going to establish crisis; accorqkiodation for<br />
families in distress.<br />
With thei co-operation of the States and voluntary organisations,<br />
we will be es5tablishing a lVational Children's Foundation to<br />
develop a greater public awareness of the _ P-tent o' child.<br />
abuse and to holp tackle the probl. ems of child abuse. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
This is a serious social problem that is often unrecognised<br />
Contrary to claims made by the Lab or Party, faniily living bta. ndards<br />
have risen over the past five years.<br />
The Treasurer has made it quite plain that, oni broad-based rieasaras<br />
since 1975/ 6, real private consumptiona expenditure per capita<br />
has risen -by 4.3% and-realI household disposable incojme per head<br />
has increased by 1.9%.<br />
~~ a~ ejbleproof--of -ipoe* Xiigaadrs-&amp; s h~ n i-te-..<br />
increaSinig numbers of telephone connections and motor<br />
vehicle ownership,<br />
In 1975-76 there were 366 cars anid station wyagons per thousand<br />
of population. In 1978-79 this nurmbsr had risen to 395.<br />
in 1975-76 there were 267 telephone services per thoujsand<br />
of population. In 1978-79 there were 310.<br />
in 1975-76 electricity production in Auistralia was 5,500 kilowatt<br />
hours per head; by 1979-80 this production had increased by<br />
to 6,600 kilowatt hourts per head.<br />
What the Labor Party seemns to forget is that the standard of<br />
living of Australian families dintinished daily under the scourge<br />
of inflation.<br />
Labor's expenditure proposal's of $ 2.5 billion) in the areas Of<br />
employment schemes, ho-using, health, education, welf are zind<br />
peiisions and the 250 other programmes to which the Labor Party<br />
is commuitted and which had not been costed, woulcl again spalrk<br />
massive inflation rmncetOf the I1itlan<br />
Indeed, under the policies proposed by Labor, inflation yould.<br />
again approach 20%. That woulcl represent a tax on all.---<br />
Australian fami nil.~ </p>
<p>-3-<br />
It would appear that the Labor Party are acting on<br />
the advice of their own research firm which described<br />
swinging voters a3 ignlorant.<br />
The ALP will find that Australian voters have a great<br />
deal of commonsense, that they can andc do judge what<br />
is in the bes~ t interests of their families and of<br />
Aus-tralia.<br />
The Labor Party will find that their vote cannot be<br />
bought. </p>
