<p>PRESIDENT HABIBIE:</p>
<p>Shall I start? First of all I like to thank you for being here. I</p>
<p> had a good four eyes meeting with His Excellency the Prime Minister</p>
<p> of Australia and afterward I had discussion with the Prime Minister</p>
<p> and the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Defence of</p>
<p> Australia. And on my side I was assisted also by the Minister of Foreign</p>
<p> Affairs, Minister of Defence and the States Minister of Indonesia</p>
<p> and of course other Excellencies of Australia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>We discussed several issues about the East Timor issue, about the</p>
<p> co-operation between Indonesia and Australia and economic co-operations</p>
<p> for sustainable growth and [inaudible] co-operation of our economic</p>
<p> societies. And I have informed His Excellency the Prime Minister that</p>
<p> I just received yesterday a report from the Indonesian Foreign Minister,</p>
<p> His Excellency Mr Ali Alatas, who just arrived from New York that</p>
<p> the MOU draft which was being discussed and negotiated three party</p>
<p> between the United Nations, Portugal and Indonesia and the draft was</p>
<p> given to me several months ago and I have discussed it thoroughly</p>
<p> with a special team of nine ministers and myself from one paragraph</p>
<p> to the other and afterwards the final discussion was discussed in</p>
<p> the full Cabinet Meeting before we approved changes and approved the</p>
<p> result of the MOU discussed and developed by our Foreign Minister</p>
<p> and Foreign Minister of Portugal and the Special Ambassador of the</p>
<p> United Nation for the East Timor case. Recalling to the general assembly</p>
<p> resolution of number 5514, 5541, 2625 and the [inaudible] resolution</p>
<p> and decision adopted by the Security Counsel and the General Assembly</p>
<p> on the question of East Timor. Also bearing in mind the sustained</p>
<p> effort of the Government of Indonesia and Portugal since July 1983.</p>
<p> Looking for a just, comprehensive and international acceptable solution</p>
<p> and the fact that on 5 August 1998 we offer from Indonesia special</p>
<p> autonomy for East Timor and afterwards it has been developed from</p>
<p> a special autonomy to just, free, transparent and democratic ballot</p>
<p> that East Timor people will get the freedom and the chance to determine</p>
<p> their own destiny in peace. It will provide two options, the option</p>
<p> which they will get special autonomy if they decided for integration</p>
<p> with Indonesia and the other is the option we will separate in peace</p>
<p> as friends and in honour.</p>
<p>Our proposal, or what you call that, based on the preliminary work</p>
<p> of the United Nation together with Indonesia and Portugal and afterward</p>
<p> corrected by Indonesian Government has been accepted. So there was</p>
<p> another draft agreement where the proposal was on the subject how</p>
<p> then to implement that ballot. And so I have studied it, and I agree,</p>
<p> I have approved the draft given to me by the three party negotiation</p>
<p> and also how to implement agreement regarding security arrangement</p>
<p> for East Timor popular consultation process.</p>
<p>So while the  what you call the draft agreement between the</p>
<p> Republic of Indonesia and the Republic of Portugal on the question</p>
<p> of East Timor is planned to be signed on the fifth of May and together</p>
<p> with that, that will be signed of course by the Foreign Minister of</p>
<p> Portugal, His Excellency Jami Gama and the Indonesian Foreign Minister,</p>
<p> His Excellency, Mr Alatas. Witnessed by His Excellency, the Secretary</p>
<p> General of the United Nation, Kofi Annan. And the arrangement regarding</p>
<p> the security arrangement on the East Timor popular consultation process</p>
<p> will  signed by the three party  so in this case, the</p>
<p> draft tell me that the Secretary General himself is not acting as</p>
<p> witness but he has signed because there are certain things which will</p>
<p> be taken over  done by the United Nations.</p>
<p>So the other thing it will be informed to the world in New York on</p>
<p> 5th. I cannot do that. But I tell you that I have accepted</p>
<p> the whole draft without any changes to be signed on fifth of May this</p>
<p> year. Because the spirit of this two of what you call the draft and</p>
<p> addendum to that MOU for the special autonomy which will be then given</p>
<p> to East Timor is an addendum of that agreement and that has also been</p>
<p> accepted. So theoretically there's no reason not take it for</p>
<p> granted that indeed I hope that on the fifth of May then we have started</p>
<p> to work peacefully together with the Commission on Peace and Stability</p>
<p> which was established in Dili, you know that on the 21st</p>
<p> April 1999, and two days afterwards it was already working to the</p>
<p> right direction that we will work with them together to meet the conditioning</p>
<p> that indeed the people of East Timor will get a fair chance to decide</p>
<p> it for their future.</p>
<p>So this was our discussion and of course it was also a discussion</p>
<p> about the fact that in the draft agreement regarding security arrangement</p>
<p> was also mentioned which I fully agreed and accepted that the United</p>
<p> Nations will make available a number of civilian police officers to</p>
<p> act as advisers to the Indonesian police in the discharge of their</p>
<p> duties.</p>
<p>And so on ... that be my commitment and my friend that I happen</p>
<p> to be, I have the privilege to be the friend of his Excellency the</p>
<p> Prime Minister. We knew each other when I was still responsible for</p>
<p> science and technology and His Excellency was the, what do you call</p>
<p> it, the Leader of the Opposition  correct?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>PRESIDENT HABIBIE:</p>
<p>Yes, it is so. So, I'd like to tell you that the relations between</p>
<p> my country, Indonesia, and Australia is excellent. And especially</p>
<p> the relation between the people of Indonesia and Australia starting</p>
<p> from the Prime Minister to the Opposition and the people, including</p>
<p> the press please. Because you have to be very critical, it is good.</p>
<p> So that is concerning East Timor. The other, I think your Excellency,</p>
<p> I ask you a favour to make some comment on that. Will you comment</p>
<p> first and then we go to the next thing, okay.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, thank you very much Mr President. Can I thank you and the Foreign</p>
<p> Minister, Mr Alatas, and General Wiranto and all the other members</p>
<p> of your delegation for an excellent meeting. I especially enjoyed</p>
<p> and derived a lot of benefit from our one-and-a -half hour personal</p>
<p> discussion which was the longest opportunity we'd had on a one-one</p>
<p> one basis to talk over a whole range of issues. As I indicated to</p>
<p> the President, I have come to Indonesia today as a friend both personally</p>
<p> and as the leader of the Government and a nation which has had a long</p>
<p> friendship with the people of Indonesia. And that has been a friendship</p>
<p> that has gone through better times and worse times, it is a friendship</p>
<p> that will continue into the future.</p>
<p>I also come as somebody who believes that the steps the President</p>
<p> has taken to change some of the institutions of Indonesia and most</p>
<p> particularly the very significant change in policy in relation to</p>
<p> East Timor. The steps the President has taken have perhaps not received</p>
<p> as much recognition in some parts of the world as they deserve. And</p>
<p> I want to say that in relation to both of those issues the President</p>
<p> has shown great leadership and great strength and he deserves very</p>
<p> considerable applause and support for having done that.</p>
<p>And I also come as the leader of a country that understands very well</p>
<p> the difficulties Indonesia is facing economically and the great change</p>
<p> that has been imposed on Indonesian society by those difficulties</p>
<p> and also to congratulate the President and his Government on the steps</p>
<p> that they have taken to stabilise their exchange rate, to reduce their</p>
<p> rate of inflation and to build for the future when the strength of</p>
<p> the Indonesian economy will once more be resumed. I have always held</p>
<p> the view that Indonesia suffered more than it deserved in relation</p>
<p> to the Asian economic downturn. And as an earnest of our ongoing commitment</p>
<p> to the economic future of Indonesia I informed the President today</p>
<p> that Australia would undertake later this year the sponsorship within</p>
<p> Indonesia of a foreign investment conference designed to send a very</p>
<p> clear message to the rest of the world that we regard the Indonesian</p>
<p> economy in the longer term in a very positive light. We recognise</p>
<p> the importance of foreign investment to this country and we also recognise</p>
<p> the great steps that have been taken by the Indonesian Government</p>
<p> to fight the economic difficulties that have been visited upon us.</p>
<p>We are, of course, all aware and the President and I discussed the</p>
<p> events in Timor over the past few weeks, I underlined to him the importance</p>
<p> of the steps that had been taken by General Wiranto which I very strongly</p>
<p> support, the commitment made to winding down violence, the commitment</p>
<p> made to greater peace and greater stability within the province of</p>
<p> Timor. I recognise the difficulties faced but I also recognise very</p>
<p> genuinely the commitment that the President and his Government have</p>
<p> made to a process which will allow a full and free choice by the people</p>
<p> of East Timor. And when you read the words of the United Nations Agreement</p>
<p> which have been repeated in part by the President today you recognise</p>
<p> the very significant change in policy and attitude that has occurred.</p>
<p> And I think it is important that the reset of the world understand</p>
<p> and embrace that and it is important that the significance of the</p>
<p> change given the history of the province's situation be recognised.</p>
<p>We agreed, as the President alluded to, that an adequate number of</p>
<p> civilian police officers as advisers will be required consistent with</p>
<p> the agreement regarding security to be signed by the United Nations.</p>
<p> A number of other matters were discussed and agreed between the President</p>
<p> and myself. The first of those is that there has been an agreement</p>
<p> to accelerate the opening of a consulate in Dili, an Australian consulate</p>
<p> in Dili. And the aim is that that will occur as soon as possible after</p>
<p> the autonomy package has been signed that we hope by the end of May</p>
<p> and the details of that are to be followed up between our two Foreign</p>
<p> Ministers.</p>
<p>I informed the President that Australia would make a contribution</p>
<p> to the UN consultation package, the total cost of which has been estimated</p>
<p> by the General Secretary at about $30 million American dollars, that</p>
<p> we would make a total contribution of $20 million Australian comprising</p>
<p> $10 million in cash and $10 million in logistical support.</p>
<p>It's also been agreed between us that as soon as feasible an Australian</p>
<p> medical team will be sent to East Timor. This is a matter that had</p>
<p> been previously raised and the President has very readily agreed to</p>
<p> that occurring. And there's also been an agreement that there will</p>
<p> be enhanced presence of international agencies such as the International</p>
<p> Red Cross.</p>
<p>I believe, Mr President and ladies and gentlemen, that it has been</p>
<p> an extremely productive and an extremely valuable meeting. It matched</p>
<p> the circumstances of the relationship and the value of the relationship</p>
<p> and the depth of the relationship. The two countries have been through</p>
<p> a great deal together. We have a shared common interest in the security</p>
<p> and the stability of our region. And although the particular issue</p>
<p> which brought us together was the issue of East Timor it is the long-term</p>
<p> strength of the relationship which has provided the backdrop to the</p>
<p> discussions that have taken place today.</p>
<p>The President has made a number of important declarations of policy.</p>
<p> I don't think any of us should underestimate the significance of his</p>
<p> announcing today the full approval of the United Nations agreement</p>
<p> by the Government of Indonesia and the intention of the Foreign Minister</p>
<p> of Indonesia to sign that agreement in New York on the fifth of May.</p>
<p> If you read again the wording of that agreement it is, given the history</p>
<p> of recent times, it is a very significant document and it is a document</p>
<p> for which the President of Indonesia deserves a great deal of credit</p>
<p> and a great deal of praise.</p>
<p>So can I say to you, Mr President, that I have found it an extremely</p>
<p> valuable meeting, I think we have come a long way, I think we have</p>
<p> demonstrated the strength and the flexibility of the relationship.</p>
<p> As I said to you, close friends have the privilege of speaking to</p>
<p> each other on occasions with candour and frankness, occasionally disagreeing</p>
<p> on this or that but ultimately because we are close friends agreeing</p>
<p> on common purposes and common goals. And I believe that we have the</p>
<p> common goal now of seeing that East Timor which is part of the Republic</p>
<p> of Indonesia that the people of that province of Indonesia be given</p>
<p> the opportunity in terms laid down by the United Nations and agreed</p>
<p> to by Portugal and Indonesia be given the opportunity of voting on</p>
<p> their future. And the wording of the question designed by the United</p>
<p> Nations, the circumstances and the public commitments of so many people</p>
<p> to the importance and the integrity of that process are very, very</p>
<p> important achievements and very important advances. And I think the</p>
<p> two governments can feel very well satisfied and importantly the people</p>
<p> of East Timor can be reassured that a full and open process of consultation</p>
<p> will occur prior to the decision being taken by those people under</p>
<p> United Nations auspices early in August.</p>
<p>Again Mr President, I thank you very warmly indeed for your courtesy</p>
<p> and hospitality and it's very nice to be in Bali.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>This is a question for President Habibie: Can you give a commitment</p>
<p> to the disarming of all militias in East Timor irrespective of whether</p>
<p> there might be a separate agreement in relation to disarming Falintil?</p>
<p>PRESIDENT HABIBIE:</p>
<p>Well, I have asked the Foreign Minister, after reading the result</p>
<p> of the  what you call it  work and efforts done by Portugal</p>
<p> and Indonesia on the co-ordination of the United Nations and I did</p>
<p> not change any wording because I agree with what they suggested and</p>
<p> I convinced that it's the best way for the people of East Timor.</p>
<p>My biggest and only concern is for the innocent people of East Timor,</p>
<p> the majority of them, they should get a fair chance to decide it for</p>
<p> their own future and destiny in peace and in honour. And that's</p>
<p> all what I want. And so we are prepared to accept and respect whatever</p>
<p> they have decided. Okay? And to make it fair and open. I have full</p>
<p> confidence in the United Nations and I have given my suggestion, my</p>
<p> wish that the United Nations should invite six countries to assist</p>
<p> the United Nations for implementing all those agreements for what</p>
<p> you call that, ballot, on the eighth of August.</p>
<p>Why the eighth of August? Because the 29th of August we</p>
<p> have the People Assembly of Indonesia and I will have the honour on</p>
<p> that occasion to the new elected representative of the multi-parties</p>
<p> in the People Assembly to address as the President of the Republic</p>
<p> of Indonesia and within that address I will then report about the</p>
<p> result of East Timor so that we could then implement it in peace and</p>
<p> honour.</p>
<p>Now you should know that it was indeed the People Assembly in 1978</p>
<p> who make People Assembly decision for accepting East Timor on the</p>
<p> request of people from East Timor to become the 27th province</p>
<p> of Indonesia, but this province was never recognised by the world,</p>
<p> in this case represented by the United Nations. And because of that</p>
<p> we have that issue international of East Timor, because of that we</p>
<p> were critical on the general assembly resolution 1541 and 2625 and</p>
<p> then now I think after having the, so God will it, at the age good</p>
<p> implementation of the problem and the people have accepted the chance</p>
<p> given and the condition given and peace will be decided, their own</p>
<p> destiny then as the President of the Republic of Indonesia. Whatever</p>
<p> they have decided, whether integration or separation in peace and</p>
<p> honour as friend, I have to report it to the people assembly on the</p>
<p> 29th of August.</p>
<p>So I see no problem from our side and I have asked that the United</p>
<p> Nations should invite first the Australian Government, second, the</p>
<p> United States Government, third, the Japanese Government, four, the</p>
<p> Philippines Government, fifth, the German, because they are acting</p>
<p> today as the Chairman of the European Common Market or European Community,</p>
<p> and six, the UK, British. But of course it is the request of the President</p>
<p> of the Republic of Indonesia and it is up to the United Nations to</p>
<p> add other nations to join the others with the United Nations to take</p>
<p> care that all the agreement could be implemented on schedule in peace</p>
<p> and honour. Okay? Please.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, Mr Barker?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Sir, I'd like  John ... from the Guardian in London.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, actually I'd asked Mr Barker. I'm sorry. We'll</p>
<p> come to you.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr President, how many United Nations supplied civilian police do</p>
<p> you think might be necessary to guarantee that that process can go</p>
<p> forward in the peace and honour that you've talked about and</p>
<p> Mr Prime Minister, have you given any undertaking that Australian</p>
<p> civilian police would be part of such a group?</p>
<p>PRESIDENT HABIBIE:</p>
<p>I'll leave it to the United Nation. I'm not an expert on</p>
<p> that and we have our agreement  I will honour any decision of</p>
<p> the United Nation. Okay?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Could I add that as I said earlier, the agreement between us was that</p>
<p> an adequate number will be required, it's not possible for me</p>
<p> and I'm not going to attempt, I'm in the same position as</p>
<p> the President, I can't make an expert judgement on that. We'll</p>
<p> obviously have a view as Australia to put to the United Nations, there</p>
<p> will be discussions and the adequate, the number, the adequate number</p>
<p> will be determined by the United Nations but it's an important</p>
<p> thing and that's why it's agreed that there should be an</p>
<p> adequate number. You asked in relation to Australia, we will of course</p>
<p> consider sympathetically a request from the United Nations.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>A question for President Habibie: Why do you particularly want the</p>
<p> UK to be among the six nations represented in the United Nations'</p>
<p> team?</p>
<p>PRESIDENT HABIBIE:</p>
<p>First of all, UK has an excellent relationship with Indonesia and</p>
<p> they are the second biggest investor after Japan in Indonesia. And</p>
<p> they have also, within their capabilities, always shown big interest</p>
<p> to my country and this region and with their accumulated experience.</p>
<p> All over the world, I think, it will be a good contribution for that</p>
<p> peaceful, what you call it, implementation.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>A question for Prime Minister Howard: With regard to the [inaudible]</p>
<p> parties in East Timor I get the feeling that Australia is inclined</p>
<p> to supporting the pro-independence movement. I guess there is a motive</p>
<p> there. Would you explain it to us, thank you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's not correct. We don't take sides except in</p>
<p> favour of a free, open and genuine process of consultation. It is,</p>
<p> in fact, the current policy of the Australian Government, which I</p>
<p> re-expressed to the President today and I happily express it to you</p>
<p> again, that we believe that from everybody's point of view that</p>
<p> if the people of East Timor, in that free and open process of consultation,</p>
<p> were to express support for remaining an autonomous part of the Republic</p>
<p> of Indonesia that would be better for them, for the Republic and for</p>
<p> the region. That's been our policy and it remains our policy,</p>
<p> however, it is something in our view that should be in their hands.</p>
<p> And that if offered a free and open choice they opt for separation</p>
<p> then we would seek the implementation of that wish. And the President</p>
<p> has, earlier today, said that will occur because that's part</p>
<p> of the understanding, we would hope, that any transition would be</p>
<p> orderly and measured but in the end it is for them to decide. And</p>
<p> that is the significance of the agreement that was signed in New York,</p>
<p> that there's a commitment that that free choice take place and</p>
<p> in the end it is for them to decide. And I don't know that I</p>
<p> can add any more to that and I thank you very warmly.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Howard, Paul Smith from the Ten Network. What guarantees</p>
<p> did you seek and what assurances were you given about the security</p>
<p> of not only the Australians who may go to East Timor but also the</p>
<p> East Timorese themselves under the security arrangements put in place</p>
<p> by the Indonesian authorities?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I made it very clear to the Indonesian Government, as I have</p>
<p> previously, that the Australian Government was concerned about developments,</p>
<p> in recent weeks in particular, and that it was essential that a greater</p>
<p> measure of stability be restored. It was essential that there be no</p>
<p> perception of blind eyes being turned to behaviour within that country.</p>
<p> I said all of those things with which the Australian press in particular</p>
<p> will be familiar from the comments that I have made recently. I also</p>
<p> recognise, of course, that you are dealing, as you should all recognise,</p>
<p> that you are dealing with a part of the sovereign republic of Indonesia</p>
<p> and it is not for other countries to attempt some kind of micro-definition</p>
<p> of each and every individual act which would take place in somebody</p>
<p> else's country. Others don't, or ought not, seek to do it</p>
<p> in relation to Australia and I don't seek to do it in relation</p>
<p> to Indonesia or, indeed, any other country. But it is part of the</p>
<p> agreement to which the President has referred. It is in one of the</p>
<p> recitals to the agreement that the responsibility for the national</p>
<p> defence of Indonesia rest with the armed forces. The responsibility</p>
<p> to keep law and order rest with the police. And there will be an augmentation</p>
<p> at an adviser level of those police. Now, we obviously will satisfy</p>
<p> ourselves in relation to the safety and the security of Australian</p>
<p> personnel who may go there. I'm not entirely sure in what number</p>
<p> they may go. It's too early to talk about that. There are Australians</p>
<p> who are employed at the UN who might go there as part of their work.</p>
<p> There are Australians who are on some world volunteer role for the</p>
<p> United Nations who may be asked to go. People will make individual</p>
<p> choices. We don't control the lives of individual Australians</p>
