FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, OCTOBER 4 1981<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
During their deliberation over the Retreat, the Heads of<br />
Government have decided to issue a declaration of their<br />
belief that it is imperative to reinvigorate the dialogue<br />
between developing and developed countries as a matter of<br />
urgency, and of their determination to contribute to that<br />
process. They have agreed on a declaration. It has one over-riding<br />
purpose: to express as clearly and forcefully as possible,<br />
the concern and commi~ tment of the leaders on these issues.<br />
Everything w.. hich might detract from the clarity of this<br />
message has been deliberately omitted.<br />
The declarat.-ion does not deal with specifics or with practica.<br />
measures. That is not its purpose. These, the issues of<br />
trade, food, energy or finance, will be dealt with at length<br />
-in the comr. unique at t1-he end of the meeting. But because of<br />
the intrinsic importance and urgency7 of the issues, and<br />
because of the timing of the Melbourne conference in relation<br />
to the North-South Sumumit in M2eXico, the Heads of Government<br />
think it essential to express now, and in unequivocal terms,<br />
the importance they attach to the mobilisation of the will<br />
to make progress.<br />
It is possibl~ e to over-ernphasise the-importance of will and.<br />
commitment. But it is also possible indeed very easy to<br />
underestimate them. They are essential ingredients ' for success.<br />
It is just as much a moral and intellectual failure to surrender<br />
to current realities in these economic and social spheres, as it<br />
is to try to appease aggressors and tyrants in the political<br />
sphere.<br />
We have no right to accept gross poverty and inequality as<br />
inevitable, until we have exhausted every possibility to<br />
eliminate them, and done so with vision and the utmost<br />
determination, and without inhibitionk. That is the message of<br />
the declaration. It comes from the Heads of Government of<br />
41. countries, representing a quarter of the world's population.<br />
It is a message to all the other governments of the world,<br />
including especially the non-Commonwealth governments who will<br />
be attending the Mexico Summit.. </p>
<p>2<br />
We shall be doing all we can individually and collectively<br />
to ensure that the message registers, and we hope it will<br />
serve as an example and encouragement to other countries.<br />
It is also a message to the peoples of the world, rich and<br />
poor: to the rich, that their own self-interest requires<br />
action; to the poor, that the Commonwealth cares for their<br />
plight and is determined to muster its weight to improve,<br />
their lot.<br />
The language of this declaration is not the language of<br />
compromise or official caution. It is a powerful coherent<br />
statement in language intended to appeal to the imagination<br />
will and humanity of leaders and peoples. I commend it to<br />
your attention. oOo--</p>
