<p>DAVID KOCH: We are very excited here at Sunrise because a charity close to our heart is getting a welcome boost from the Federal Government. Prime Minister Julia Gillard will this morning pledge $5 million towards Father Chris Riley's Youth Off The Streets program.</p>
<p>The charity has been helping homeless and disadvantaged young people get back on their feet for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>MELISSA DOYLE: It is sensational. Prime Minister Julia Gillard joins us now from the Koch Centre at Macquarie Fields, along with Father Chris Riley. Good morning to you both.</p>
<p>Prime Minister, I'll start with you. Why did you choose this particular charity?</p>
<p>PM: Well good morning Mel and good morning Kochie. I am standing in the incredibly well-named Koch Centre with Father Riley, and we are going to make available $5 million to Father Riley's work.</p>
<p>And we're doing that because it's so successful in getting youth off the streets, back engaged with the mainstream of Australian life, and breaking the cycle of crime.</p>
<p>We don't want to see young people who lose their way then ending up becoming criminals.</p>
<p>When I was in western Sydney a few weeks ago we announced some measures to crack down on the really serious end of crime  -  the bikies, the gang.</p>
<p>But today is about diverting young people from a life choice that could be a very bad one, back onto a productive path. And no better man to guide this work than the man I'm standing right next to.</p>
<p>KOCH: Chris, what are you going to do with the money? What will it mean for the program? It's for the Outreach programs isn't it?</p>
<p>FATHER CHRIS RILEY: It is Kochie. This money will basically get us out into suburbs that we know are in trouble at the moment, but get there before a crisis happens.</p>
<p>You know that where we're standing now, we're in Macquarie Fields after the riot about seven years ago.</p>
<p>We're trying to get to suburbs so it'll all be new work that we will be opening up. Getting to suburbs across the country where we can actually get to young people overcome by an absolute feeling of hopelessness.</p>
<p>KOCH: Yeah, it is just terrific. And a great shot in the arm. Thank you both for that, and Chris, we'll talk regularly  -  keep us up to date with how it goes. Good to see you.</p>
<p>FATHER CHRIS RILEY: Thanks David, and thanks Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PM: Thank you.</p>
