    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister’s Indigenous Advisory Council has been refreshed with new membership as part of the Government’s ongoing commitment to closer engagement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</p>
<p>The new Council will play an important role by engaging at the heart of Government, including with the Indigenous Policy Committee of Cabinet, collaborating with other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders, and ensuring the government is well positioned to renew the expiring Closing the Gap targets in the year ahead.</p>
<p>The appointments reflect the expertise and innovation that exist in Indigenous Australia and we look forward to working with the new Council to drive better outcomes for our First Australians.</p>
<p>The following Council members have been appointed for a period of three years:</p>
<p>Andrea Mason – CEO of the NPY Women’s Council Susan Murphy – CEO of Winun Ngari Aboriginal Corporation Ngiare Brown – Professor of Indigenous Health at the University of Wollongong Roy Ah See – Chair of the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council Chris Sarra – Founder and Chairman of the Stronger Smarter Institute Djambawa Marawilli – Traditional owner from Baniyala</p>
<p>All members of the Council appointed today are highly respected in their chosen fields and bring strong practical policy knowledge. This will ensure the Council is able to provide the Government with a range of advice to help deliver better outcomes in partnership with Indigenous people and communities.</p>
<p>Today’s appointments are part of a two-staged appointment process. The new Council members will meet and provide advice to the Government on the final makeup of the Council and its terms of reference. This will include engaging with other Indigenous Australians who have requested to be on the Council. This is a strong endorsement for the continuation of the Council and demonstrates that Indigenous Australians are  very focused on working in partnership with the Government on the issues impacting their communities.</p>
<p>The refreshed Council reflects the Government’s deep commitment to doing things with Indigenous Australians in a genuine partnership. The Council is expected to work with, and draw in, other Indigenous Australians to ensure the Government has advice from a range of stakeholders and communities.</p>
<p>We have asked that the Council continue to focus on the Government’s priorities of education, community safety and justice, and employment.</p>
<p>We thank the members of the Council who have served over the past three years, in particular Warren Mundine for his service as Chair. We look forward to continuing to work with the former Coucil members, seeking their guidance, experience and expertise.</p>
<p>Biographies of the new Council members are available.</p>
