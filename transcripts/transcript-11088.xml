    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE................................................................................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What are you hoping to achieve in New Zealand?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, just a further...a reinforcement of a very close bilateral</p>
<p> relationship. There's a standing arrangement between the Prime</p>
<p> Ministers of Australia and New Zealand that we should meet each year.</p>
<p> Mrs Shipley came to Australia shortly after taking over as Prime Minister</p>
<p> last year. I have seen her on a number of...at a number of international</p>
<p> meetings but we have a very strong bilateral relationship. We will</p>
<p> obviously talk about APEC because New Zealand will be in the Chair</p>
<p> at APEC this year. It will be held in New Zealand so we will want</p>
<p> to work very closely with the New Zealanders to ensure that the APEC</p>
<p> momentum is regathered and maintained because the goals of APEC are</p>
<p> still very important to the region.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, why won't anyone from the Government now meet with</p>
<p> Gerry Adams?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I am not aware of any developments this morning.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well, Mr Downer was planning to meet him in transit but it's</p>
<p> not clear whether that is going to happen. Isn't that a bit of</p>
<p> a snub?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, look you should ask Mr Downer about his meeting arrangements.</p>
<p> I don't carry the diaries of my colleagues around Â my pockets</p>
<p> aren't big enough.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, the revelation that Mr McGauran has made a further repayment,</p>
<p> why was that kept secret until now?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I am not aware of the details of that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, are you concerned about the further breakdown of the Yugoslavian</p>
<p> peace talks?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think the whole world would hold its breath and hope that there</p>
<p> will be no need for force to be used. But the stance taken by NATO</p>
<p> is entirely reasonable, completely reasonable. And I think the attitude</p>
<p> being taken by the Yugoslav Government, by Milosevic, is unreasonable</p>
<p> and I think one must hope that at five minutes to midnight he will</p>
<p> take a more consideratory attitude because the demands made by NATO</p>
<p> have our total support.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But of course they have ordered more troop movements into the area</p>
<p> this weekend because of the breakdown in those talks and President</p>
<p> Clinton has now added his word saying that NATO means business. Will</p>
<p> you be....what sort of a watching brief are you keeping on it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, very close. I totally support the stance that has been taken</p>
<p> by NATO. I am pleased that NATO has assumed the leadership role on</p>
<p> this issue. That is a very welcome development and I guess like others</p>
<p> I hope that at the last moment there will be common sense prevailing.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, business is calling for a shift in your immigration policies.</p>
<p> Are you willing to listen to their arguments.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I always consider sensible arguments but it's the Government's</p>
<p> view that the present immigration mix is right, it's appropriate</p>
<p> for Australia's economic and social circumstances. We have shifted</p>
<p> away from an undue emphasis on family reunion to a much greater emphasis</p>
<p> on skilled and business migration and that's been good for Australia.</p>
<p> I am quite happy for there to be a debate. I don't think the</p>
<p> issue is one where a sudden shift in policy makes sense but I am prepared</p>
<p> to listen to argument. But I emphasise that we have got the balance</p>
<p> right. Thank you.</p>
