<p>JOURNALIST:<br />
Prime Minister, the forum';s consideration on terror, could you tell us what you';ve decided?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well there';ll be a communique issued but I think it';s fair to say that all member states of the Forum renewed their commitment cooperate to the maximum degree to fight terrorism.  It';s still something that weighs heavily on the minds of everybody at this meeting, indeed all meetings, and nobody should assume that the Pacific, tranquil, benign as it normally appears is free of a potential terrorist threat. It';s not.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Helen Clark has been using this meeting to pressure for sanctions or even expulsion of Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth. Have you had a discussion, but I think you know what she said publicly at leastâ¦.?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We';re having a bilateral later today so I';ve not spoken to her. But for myself can I say that I understand why people are growing in their sense of frustration and anger about Zimbabwe. There has not been a really serious attempt made by that country to respond to the concerns expressed at the troika meeting in London. There has been no serious rebuttal at the finding of the Commonwealth Observer Group about the conduct of the election and of course the treatment of farmers, the arbitrary way in which they have been apparently dispossessed, the general economic decline in the country.  All of that is a matter of concern. There is a limit to what countries can do. Bear that in mind, but I understand why people feel that way. I have a few areas of consideration at the moment that I might be able to say something about later on.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Prime Minister, on the forum itself what';s your message on good governance in this region?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well very strong. I think increasingly good governance is the key to economic growth. Unless you have a stable law and order situation, unless you have confidence in the institutions of the country you';re not going to invest in it and that is a view that I';ve put quite strongly at these meetings and I';ll go on putting it. It';s a view that the European Union and the United States have put quite strongly in the context of assistance to African countries and it makes a great deal of sense.  Donor countries will continue to support aid if they believe that the aid is being used wisely and if they believe that efforts are being made to improve governance and that ultimately is the responsibility of political leaders within individual countries.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
What sort of response do you think you got, what sort of reaction did you get from the other leaders when you put thisâ¦.?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think quite understanding and accepting.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
On terrorism Prime Minister, you said the Forum reaffirms its commitmentâ¦.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well there';ll be a statement madeâ¦<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
[inaudible] further thanâ¦.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well there';ll be a communique issued and I';m not going to pre-empt what the Chairmanâ¦<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
[inaudible]<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I';m sorry. Let me finish.  I';m not going to pre-empt what the Prime Minister says.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Prime Minister, can I ask are you concerned that Australian wheat might be jeopardised given what the Iraqi Trade Minister said todayâ¦?<br />
 PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don';t know what he said today.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
He basically said that unless you and Mr Downer change your opposition toâ¦..what you';ve been saying on military attacks that wheat sales won';t go back to what they were.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look I';m not going to on an issue like that make a comment until I have my own first hand knowledge of what';s been said.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Have concrete conclusions been reached on the settlements out of this meeting Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well the observer group report was received and we have suggested that the Eminent Persons Group continue a monitoring and advice role in relation to the Solomons and that was accepted by the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands and I think that is a very strong step forward and that is very much in the context of the question that was asked by Geoffrey Barker a moment ago about the attitude of countries to the issue of governance and Australia';s views on governance.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Have you received any criticism on the issue of climate change?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Clearly there are some differences there but I think you will see the communique when it comes out notes amongst other things that despite the fact that Australia is not disposed at the present time the Kyoto protocol for reasons that I';ve outlined the other member states of the Forum note that we';re going to achieve our greenhouse gas emissions target as set down under the protocol. I actually regard the outcome of that particular discussion as very good, very positive. There';s no point in pretending there aren';t some differences. We are not willing to sign the protocol at present because we don';t think it';s in Australia';s interest to do so and I';ve made that very plain now for months. But we do have similar objectives in relation to controlling greenhouse gas emissions and I think the language focuses rather more on the things that we have in common rather than the things that we don';t.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Are you happy with this timeframe for the second inquiry into Telstra services?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Do you think that it will satisfy the concerns in the bushâ¦..?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I';m not going to pre-empt what it says. We have to take  the Telstra thing step by step. The step announced today by Richard Alston was to measure whether things are up to scratch. Until I get that I';m not going to express a view as to whether they are up to scratch and obviously we';re not going to take steps to sell further shares in Telstra unless we get a positive read out from this committee that things are up to scratch.  I think it';s a very good committee, I';m very pleased that the people who';ve agreed to serve on it have done so and I will look forward to receiving its report by the 8th of November.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
What concerns do you have about Fiji';s delays in appointing Supreme Court judges for its constitutional case?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I';m not expressing as view on that. It';s a domestic matter for Fiji. It';s got nothing to do with me.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
In your focus on governance and the Eminent Persons Group being- continuing for the Solomon Islands where would you expect or hope that the Solomons would be in twelve months time as a result of this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well certainly more stable, certainly a stronger law and order position, and hopefully a more attractive destination for investment. This really is at the key. In this world where investment flows easily you just won';t get it unless you have a safe environment and it is overwhelmingly in the interests of countries seeking investment, seeking economic growth, to look to their governance issues.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Has there been any discussion of the Pacific solution today?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Only in very general terms. No criticism of Australia. In fact the President of Nauru expressed very strong gratitude to me for being able to be part of responding and I certainly haven';t encountered at this meeting any criticism at all from anybody, I have to say that. Not in a position âin a government position. I';ve read some criticisms in some of your papers and heard them and so forth.  But I';ve had no criticisms from any government leader or any government official about our policy on illegal immigration. I';ve not had any criticism from leaders. In fact my recollection , and you can have a look at the communique, my recollection is that there was general assent to a very strong statement to condemning illegal immigration.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Mrs Clark, Helen Clark said today that she was aware of an agreement that prevented Australia and New Zealand and Fiji having the Secretary Generalship but you say you';ve found no such agreement.  Can you clarify that issue at all today?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it hasn';t been discussed today.  I';ll ask Helen about it when we have our bilateral.I';ll ask for a copy of it. But I';m not getting into any sort of belligerent position on this. I';m not aware,  I';m just acting on advice. I';m not aware of it and I';ve asked DFAT and PM&amp;C to have a look and they can';t find any trace of it.  So that';s what I';m acting on and I also guess I';m also acting on the first principle that all men and women are equal in terms of opportunities to compete for positions and the fact that you';re an Australian or New Zealander should not disqualify you from consideration if you happen to be the best person.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
The Pacific Island States are saying [inaudible] isn';t listening. Why isn';t Australia listening?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we';re listening but it';s a question of international law. The carriage of that material is permissible under international law. That';s the view we';re taking.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
[inaudible]<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I';ve said hello to him.  He was kind enough to come to the lunch that I addressed yesterday.  I made some very positive references to him in my speech. I had a lot of contact with Mr Chaudhry when he was improperly removed as Prime Minister of this country and  physically intimidated.  We made very strong statements in support .  And he';s now [inaudible] play a very positive role in Fijian politics. As to the domestic politics of the country of which I';m a guest I';m not going to make a comment.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Well he';s called for [inaudible] recognition of the Qarase government [inaudible]<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we continue to recognise the elected government of Fiji. JOURNALIST:<br />
On the issue of Greg Urwin.  Have you had any lobbying around the corridors today, lobbying other leaders?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
What';s your response to the prison sentence for the rapist?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That';s a matter for courts.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Not too strong? You won';t comment?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That is a matter for courts. I';m certainly not condemning it.<br />
