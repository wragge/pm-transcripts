   I am pleased to announce that agreement has been reached between the Commonwealth<br />
   and the States on the framework for the new Tough On Drugs Diversion Programme.</p>
<p> Under this programme, first time or minor drug offenders will be diverted<br />
   to compulsory assessment and then referred to treatment and/or education<br />
   aimed at getting them off drugs.</p>
<p> In this way, for the first time, there will be a nationwide approach whereby<br />
   minor drug offenders can have the option of treatment and/or education,<br />
   rather than getting caught up in the criminal justice system.</p>
<p> The introduction of a national diversion initiative, for which the Federal<br />
   Government will provide over $110 million, delivers on the commitment I<br />
   made together with Premiers and Chief Ministers on 9 April. In addition,<br />
   around $110 million has also been allocated by the Commonwealth for a range<br />
   of related support measures, including schools and community initiatives.<br />
   State and Territory governments have committed to take complementary action,<br />
   including in regard to prisons.</p>
<p> A nationally consistent approach to diversion has been made possible by<br />
   the historic agreement of the Council of Australian Governments on a national<br />
   framework document.</p>
<p> The framework outlines a clear pathway for individuals from detection to<br />
   assessment, education, treatment and post treatment support. It also establishes<br />
   the responsibilities of the police and those services involved in diversion.</p>
<p> The diversion initiative strengthens our Tough on Drugs policy by providing<br />
   a new early intervention focus.</p>
<p> Early intervention underpins diversion, and aims to achieve benefits for<br />
   both drug users and the community.</p>
<p> The aim of the programme is to prevent people entering into long-term drug<br />
   abuse, where the consequences are serious health problems, financial destitution,<br />
   social dysfunction, a criminal record, and in some cases, acts of violence<br />
   and property crime.</p>
<p>Diversion will give police a new option for coping with minor drug offenders.<br />
   Some offenders may also be diverted by courts under this process. It will<br />
   give police the formal power to direct those found using or in possession<br />
   of drugs away from the criminal justice system and into compulsory assessment<br />
   for treatment and/or education.</p>
<p> The assessment process will determine the appropriate clinical treatment,<br />
   rehabilitation service or education course that offenders will be required<br />
   to undertake. Following this, ongoing assistance will be available to help<br />
   individuals overcome their drug problems.</p>
<p> Those who fail to attend the initial assessment, or fail to participate<br />
   in treatment or education, risk being sent back to the criminal justice<br />
   system where they face the possibility of gaol.</p>
<p> Consistent with our mutual obligation philosophy, we are saying to people<br />
   who use drugs, that, in return for the community providing treatment, rehabilitation<br />
   and education services, you must take personal responsibility for your addiction<br />
   and participate in these services with the aim of getting yourself off drugs.</p>
<p> If these drug users want to be free of the criminal justice system, they<br />
   will have to work to free themselves of drugs.</p>
<p> Importantly, diversion will significantly increase the number of illicit<br />
   drug users who receive drug treatment and education.</p>
<p> I pay tribute to Federal and State health and law enforcement representatives<br />
   and the Australian National Council on Drugs who have each played a vital<br />
   role in the development of the diversion framework.</p>
<p> The agreed framework demonstrates how our Tough on Drugs policy is continuing<br />
   to build a social coalition of community and voluntary organisations, law<br />
   enforcement officers, health professionals, governments and the wider community<br />
   that can help address social problems at their source.</p>
<p> Agreement on the framework document paves the way for the commencement of<br />
   diversion projects in individual states and territories. We have already<br />
   received a detailed proposal from New South Wales on how they want to implement<br />
   diversion in their state. We hope to conclude bi-lateral arrangements with<br />
   them shortly.</p>
<p> I look forward to the first projects starting in the months ahead.</p>
