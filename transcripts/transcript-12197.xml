    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government welcomes the apparently peaceful and constitutional resolution of the political crisis in the Philippines.</p>
<p>We in Australia have followed with both intense interest and concern developments in the Philippines which flowed from the impeachment proceedings launched against former president Estrada.</p>
<p>It had become increasingly apparent in recent days that a peaceful transfer of authority from Joseph Estrada to his vice-president was needed to end the immediate impasse.</p>
<p>Australia enjoys a close association with the Philippines. It is a country with which we have many ties.</p>
<p>I congratulate the newly installed president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.</p>
<p>She is an experienced political figure in her country and the daughter of a former president. Her electoral support is strong having secured a higher popular vote than Estrada when they were elected in 1998.</p>
<p>Australia wishes President Macapagal Arroyo every success in responding to the enormous challenge she now faces in restoring stability and direction to political life in the Philippines.</p>
