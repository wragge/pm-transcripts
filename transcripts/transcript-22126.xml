    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Prime Minister does the prospect of perhaps having the other side of the lake named after you encourage you to stay for a few more terms?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> I am not getting into any of that. It's a beautiful morning and welcome to the beginning of another parliamentary week.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> The RU486 debate in parliament this week, Jackie Kelly's amendments do you think that's a sensible way to take it, out of the hands of one minister and back into hands of the entire parliament?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> I am not going to give a running commentary on every twist and turn of this debate. I have one vote, John Howard is the only person's vote that will be influenced by my views and we'll just wait and see how it unfolds. My general view about important decisions being taken by people who are elected and accountable is true not only of this issue but of many other issues, but I am not seeking to influence how other people vote, I will wait and see as the debate unfolds and I'll cast my vote accordingly.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Wouldn't the account of the parliament be more accountable than a single minister?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Look I am not going to get into the debate.  I mean when the time comes I'll express my detailed view and then we'll see what parliament, in its wisdom, decides.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Will you still be supporting a conscience vote on the matter?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> This is a free vote from start to finish. It's always been accepted that any aspect of it, an amendment or the main motion itself, will be a free vote.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Prime Minister, Treasury officials have said that when they were in Iraq doing the budget, they were told about kickbacks. Kevin Rudd this morning has said that this shows your government has been incompetent in the sense you haven't investigated them fully even though you were told about it. Do you have any response to that?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well I reject what Mr Rudd says and I point out that we have a royal commission looking at this matter. The royal commission has more material, is more cognisant of the facts than Mr Rudd or indeed anybody else and I think we should wait until Mr Cole brings down his report.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Prime Minister sentencing starts this week of the Bali Nine. If as expected there are death sentences involved would the government be talking, will it be protesting or seeking clemency from the Indonesians?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> The important thing is to wait and see what the Indonesian justice system hands down and then react accordingly. We have a long standing opposition to the death penalty and it's well known that if a death penalty is imposed on an Australian, we ask that that death penalty not be imposed. But I don't think now is the time to become specific about these particular people, it's better to wait until the sentences have been handed down. One more question.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Do you think we will get the same outpouring of anger that we got from the case of Van Nguyen?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Look I don't think it's right of me to express a view on that, these people are facing their sentences and determinations about their future this week. I don't think it is either fair or appropriate of me to start saying this or that level of outrage will be forthcoming. Let's wait and see what the verdicts are and the Australian Government will react appropriately. Thank you.</p>
