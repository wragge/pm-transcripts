Message to Eariwood Branch<br />
of Young Liberals for<br />
incorporation in their<br />
ma gazine.<br />
Nobody could be a greater believer than I am in<br />
the Young Liberal Movement. I sincerely look forward to<br />
the day when I shall have left the political scene and you<br />
who now are our younger members will have succeeded to the<br />
positions of power and responsibility in our country.<br />
Liberalism offers us much to believe in, not just<br />
something to oppose. We in our Party have a faith to<br />
live by and I am sure that it is a faith which appeals to<br />
the Australian spirit of independence and to youth, and<br />
not to the spirit of dependency on what governmentscaught<br />
to do that characterises 59 many of our opponents,<br />
I wish success to you in the Earlwood Branch<br />
and commend you upon your paper and the effort that you are<br />
clearly putting in to the Party in your area, ith<br />
Branches such as yours operating with the vigour that you<br />
display, the future of the Liberal Party is assured.<br />
R. G. ME4ZIES.<br />
CAtNBERRA, 29th August, 1962. </p>
