TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE WITH MR JIM KIRK AND<br />
MR BARRY COHEN 22 NOVEMBER 1985<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity of<br />
introducint to you Mr Jim Kirk-and say on behalf of the<br />
Government how pleased we are that Jim has accepted my offer and<br />
request to him to be come the Chairman of the Australian<br />
Bicentennial Authority. I would like to say at the outset too<br />
that I am pleased that when I consulted the Leader of the<br />
Opposition, Mr Howard, he indicated full support of the<br />
opposition for this appointment. I would just briefly like to say<br />
one or two things about Mr Kirk, he would be well known to you.<br />
He served in the Royal Australian navy during the second world<br />
war, Very importantly he became, in 1976, the first Australian<br />
Chairman and managing Director of Esso Australia. A company with<br />
-which he has had an association with for some 49 years, I think,<br />
Jim. He was the co-founder of the Business Round Table which was<br />
one of the organisations which merged into the Business Council<br />
of Australia and on the formation of the Business Council of<br />
Australia became the original Deputy Chairman of the Business<br />
Council of Australia. He is on the board of the Macquarie Bank.<br />
He has also had an active association with the PBEC which is the<br />
Pacific Base and Economic Council of which he is Deputy Chairman.<br />
He is a past president of the Australian-American A ' ssociation.<br />
The Government believes and I am very pleased, as I say, this is<br />
a bi-partisan position, the Government bel-ieves that Jim Kirk<br />
brings to this position all the qualities which will ensure that<br />
the preparations for and then the celebration of the Bicentennial<br />
in 1988 will be in the very best of hand and will ensure that it<br />
will be a year in which Australia can be proud. I will just make<br />
this final point and that is that in regard to the position of<br />
the Chief Executive who regarded it as appropriate that we should<br />
make the appointment of the Chairman first and one of Jim's<br />
initial responsibilities will be to look at the organisation, to<br />
fork his judgment as to the sort of person that will be required<br />
to work with him as the Chief Executive. Under the legislation itis<br />
the responsibility of the Chairman to make that appointment.<br />
He will, of course, be consulting with me but essentially this<br />
will be the responsibility that he will have. And I am certain<br />
that he will be able to find a person who will discharge that<br />
responsibility admirably. Therefore with Jim in the position and<br />
the Chief Executive position to be filled the Government has<br />
total confidence in the successful preparations of the<br />
Bicentennial. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, did the problems of the Bicentennial<br />
make it difficult for you to convince anybody to take the job?<br />
PM: No, it didn't. You will appreciate that we were fortunate in<br />
getting John Utz and I should, in introducing Jim, have said I </p>
<p>did in the press release how indebted we are to John for filling<br />
in that interim period. John Utz was prepared immediately to step<br />
into the breach that was created and we have deliberately taken<br />
our time. we have thought about this. There was no difficulty and<br />
indeed Jim's name was one which emerged no just from one source<br />
but from a number of sources and I am pleased to be able to say<br />
that as soon as I raised it with him he was affirmative in his<br />
response. JOURNALIST: Was there no one on the board at the moment who was<br />
suitable or available Mr Hawke?<br />
P1M: The composition of the board as you will appreciate. A<br />
representative one and from States and groups and it was not the<br />
source to which one would look for this position.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what is the state of play on the<br />
consideration of trying to get back the money after......<br />
$ 500,000 payout?<br />
PM: The interim Chairman Mr Utz put this matter in the hands of<br />
a solicitors and council and I as understand it he is still<br />
awaiting advice from them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Kirk being realistic about it, how hard is it<br />
going to be to find a Chief Executive and would you have a<br />
preference for an Australian over perhaps anyone from overseas?<br />
KIRK: Well, the second half is pretty to answer. I would have<br />
preference for an Australian because I feel that the Bicentennial<br />
is an important event for Australia and I feel that all those<br />
people out there that are Australians that feel same way and we<br />
have got to do something good about it. So we should have an<br />
Australian doing it I think. Now difficult it is going to, be is,<br />
I think, probably very difficult because remember it's a short<br />
tenure and we'd offer something but we don't offer any long term<br />
job for the individual. So it's not going to be easy but we'll<br />
find the right person.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, what attracted you to the job of Chairman?<br />
KIRK: I guess the challenge as much as anything and the fact<br />
that Australia has done a lot for me over the years. And if I can<br />
contribute something back, I am happy to do so.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, when would you like to have an appointment of<br />
Chief Executive? This side of Christmas?<br />
KIRK: I'd like to but I think we will be lucky if we have anyone<br />
in line by then. This is the wrong time of the year to be<br />
looking. But we will be trying. If we find somebody next week I<br />
would be making the recommendations.<br />
JOURNALIST: What-do you see as your-first responsibility given<br />
the controversy that's surrounding the Bicentennial: of late? How<br />
do you propose......<br />
KIRK: I guess as an Australian I'd say to find out what the </p>
<p>hell's going on. I don't really know, you know I'm the new boy<br />
and I have got to find out what exactly exists. I suspect that<br />
there is a lot of good there just waiting to surface.<br />
JOURNAL. IST: what sort of ideas dn voi have for the Bicentennial?<br />
-" KIRK: That's a good question you know. I like the thought of the<br />
tall ships. I happened to live in New York at the time of their<br />
Bicentennial and I saw the big ships. And that impressed me and I<br />
was also impressed by the way the little, I guess you would call<br />
them villages in the old days but theye are still 20,000 or<br />
30,000 people cities in the US had their little programs and what<br />
had generated in the way of national support. And I think that<br />
these committees that we have got could well-lead to the same<br />
sort of thing here. Because the Bicentennial is for Australians<br />
for Australians you know. It is not really for governments or for<br />
others sitting at the top, it's for the whole of the people of<br />
Australia. JOURNALIST: So you would like a fairly decentralised set of<br />
celebrations? KIRK: Well, you know, I don't like work so I'm a decentralist<br />
from way back.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you envisage any changes in the direction of the<br />
programs so far?<br />
KIRK: I am really not in a position to know. I have had a<br />
briefing paper that I got yesterday that makes me an expert. You<br />
know, anybody that has ready something like that after 24 hours<br />
is an expert. But I really couldn't tell you whether they are<br />
good bad or indifferent. They look pretty good on paper.<br />
JOURNALIST: With your background though, would you be interested<br />
in introducing some new themes. Perhaps private enterprise......<br />
PM4: This bloke has got a monopoly on it you know.<br />
KIRK: I am really a believer in the work ethnic and I am<br />
certainly a private enterprise individual. I have been all my<br />
life. But al * so I recognise the responsibilities of governments<br />
and others and you know it's a two way street. You couldn't<br />
operate the country without a government and I doubt if the<br />
government could operate satisfactorily without private<br />
enterprise so it's a two way street.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think......<br />
KIRK: I don't yet know what public servants I have got to work<br />
with. But I can tell you that if I am regarded generally as a<br />
peoples man I think in most of these parties. When I left the<br />
company they always said that and I get on well with people but<br />
if they run me the wrong way I am-a-little bit intollerant so<br />
we'll see what happens.<br />
PM: Talking about people there is one think I meant to say in<br />
introducing Jim that I was in Melbourne recently and had the </p>
<p>pleasure of presenting Jim with the Award for 1985 of the<br />
Business and Professional Womens and Advance Australia<br />
Affirmative Action Award for the businessman who had done most to<br />
advance the cause of Affirmative Action in business in Australia.<br />
So it's, I think, a eyrelevant aspect of Jim Tirkl's<br />
background. JOURNALIST: Mr Kirk, given all the difficulties that are<br />
apparent in the job. How much would the bloke or blokette that<br />
you employ as Chief Executive how much should he be paid?<br />
KIRK: Well, that's a good question you know. You have got to<br />
make sure that you pay for the -job to be done but you also can't<br />
disturb a whole other pay schedules of many other peoples in the<br />
process. what we may be doing is looking for somebody from the<br />
private sector to perhaps be seconded with us contributing<br />
something. But I really haven't had time to work out anything<br />
there and I can't tell you whether it will be a man or a woman. A<br />
woman has got just as much say. In that Award I got they gave me<br />
a badge that says now I was an honorary woman. And I look under<br />
the shower every morning to make sure.<br />
JOURNALIST: What was the result?<br />
KIRK: I haven't changed as far as I can see.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Kirk, what sort of severence arrangements have<br />
you negotiated?<br />
PM: Now, Paul, cut it out.<br />
KIRK: Maximum.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Kirk, do you believe Dr Armstrong or Mr. Reid were<br />
badly treated in any way?<br />
KIRK: I don't really know to be honest. You know, I read no more<br />
than what was in the newspapers, nothing else.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well, from what you read in the newspapers?<br />
KIRK: I hate to say it amongst this wonderful group but I get<br />
confused with what I read in the newspapers most of the time.<br />
JOURNALIST: Were you wary about taking the job on because of<br />
what happened to Mr Reid and Dr Armstrong?<br />
KIRK: Not really for that reason. I have got enough confidence<br />
in the people report in any circumstances to say that if I do a<br />
job they will recognise it. If I don't they will recognise it<br />
too. No, that doesn't trouble me. I was a little bit worried<br />
whether after turning 65 and retiring after 49 years as to<br />
whether I should take on something as responsible as this but I<br />
feel I can contri'bute so I did.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, apart from the appointment did the Cabinet<br />
make any further decisions in the discussion on the Bicentennial<br />
today? </p>
<p>PM: Yes we had an overview, Michelle, of the national program<br />
and let me say this that, that will now that the Cabinet's done<br />
that will be going with Mr Kirk to the board, the next meeting of<br />
the board and with approval of the Government they nodl.,,, be<br />
proceeding to flesh out now the details of that national program.<br />
A lot of it has already been done and I think I can say on behalf<br />
of Jim, because we did talk about this, that if in the relatively<br />
near future, after he has had the meeting with the authority, he<br />
would be in a position to have a more detailed press conference<br />
where there could be an opportunity for you to have a closer look<br />
at the sort of things to be developed in the national program.<br />
JOURNALIST: How much of a role will the updated public service<br />
division now be playing in this whole program?<br />
PM: Yes, a good question. What we decided needed to be done<br />
after the recent events was recognising the legislative position<br />
under which the ABA is an independent company. We nevertheless<br />
wanted to have a situation where the relationship between the<br />
Government and the Authority and it's Chairman in particular<br />
could be put on a more efficience and effective basis. So you now<br />
have a division there under Ron Harvey who had the responsibility<br />
of doing all the preparations for the two summits from press to<br />
the Government, very particularly in the work he did there. Under<br />
Ron we now have I believe a group which will work closely with<br />
the Authority and I think, without being exhaustive, the sorts of<br />
things that they will be ensuring is that Jim and the Authority<br />
through the Department will have the ability to tap into all the<br />
resources of Government so that the various governments and<br />
authorities will be there with their resources available to be of<br />
assistance to Jim and the Authority in whatever way they wish.<br />
There has been the understanding reached before Jim's appointment<br />
that the presence at the meetings of the Authority are<br />
representative of the Department so that we will be informed of<br />
what is happening in that way. There will be the reporting in the<br />
financial sense to us of expenditures of the Authority and very<br />
early, of course, I introduced Jim to Ron and I think now we will<br />
ensure in this personal sense, the relationship is there, to<br />
ensure that the very significant resources of the Government will<br />
be made available in a way which is consistent with the<br />
legislative independence of the Authority.<br />
JOURNALIST: So it's a helping role and a watchdog role?<br />
PM: I don't like the word watchdog because I have total<br />
confidence in Jim Kirk. I wouldn't have asked him to take the<br />
position if I didn't have that total confidence. But I think that<br />
Jim and the Authority would appreciate that with the very<br />
significant expenditures of taxpayers money that are going to be<br />
involve it is appropriate that we be kept informed of the way in<br />
which those expenditures are being undertaken. So I don't use the<br />
word watchdog. That carries an implication that we don't have<br />
confidence. I am totally confident in the new set-up and I am<br />
certain that combined resources of Government channelled through<br />
my Department and the activities of the Authority-now under the<br />
leadership of Jim Kirk will produce outstanding results for<br />
Au st rali a. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: What was the level of interest taken by the business<br />
community in the events of Mr Reid and Dr Armstrong?<br />
KIRK: Well, a lot of it harpened Just after or around the time I<br />
was retiring and I haven't been, for instance, haven't been to a<br />
Business Council meeting since then and so on. So I find that<br />
hard to answer but I don't think there is anything to worry about<br />
that I know of but you know I am not really informed.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you think appropriate if you had any<br />
discussions with either of those......<br />
KIRK: Well, I don't have any problem. I have talked to John Reid<br />
since it's all happened. In fact, I was at a dinner the other<br />
night with him at Government House in Sydney and I talked to John<br />
Utz. But I haven't heard anything that would cause me any<br />
problem. JOURNALIST: What did he say when you said you were taking the<br />
job?<br />
KIRK: I didn't tell him that. I didn't even know then.<br />
PM: He didn't know then.<br />
KIRK: I was just talking to him generally.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, could you tell us the terms of Mr Kirk's<br />
appointment? PM: They haven't been finalised yet. We have had some general<br />
discussions about that but they will be conditions which will be<br />
appropriate to both the job and the very considerable amount of<br />
time that he will be putting into it. It's quite clear, I think,<br />
that you would appreciate Alan, that as we get now closer and<br />
closer to the time the position of Chairman will occupy more and<br />
more time. So there will be conditions which will be, I believe,<br />
mutually acceptable, relevant and appropriate.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is the appointment until June 1990 much the same as<br />
Mr Reids's, is it a four year appointment?<br />
PM: It will be going certainly into the period after the end of<br />
1988. Now just precisely how long again we need to finalise that<br />
but you will appreciate Alan, that the responsibility of the<br />
Chairman just can't finish on December 31st, 1988.<br />
JOURNALIST: So it will ivlecn ct<br />
PM: There will be an exchange of letters between us.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Kirk, what do you think will be the themes of the<br />
Bicentennial in 1988? What do you think the Australian<br />
achievement has been as you see it? What makes you proud to be an<br />
Australian? What do you think the t~ ry should demand?<br />
KIRK: That's pretty tough to just bring on me at this stage but </p>
<p>if you want just my personal opinions of things. I would like to<br />
look to Australia as the future and that means getting the<br />
children involved, getting them to recognise our nation and our<br />
flag and to mean something to them. But at the same time you<br />
can' t forget all the people that ha%-marle Austral ia what it i s.<br />
So it's a combination of all those things but really I haven't<br />
had time to think as to what would be my specific suggestions or<br />
anything to do with it. And you know a lot of people have got to<br />
contribute to what we finally come up with.<br />
JOURNALIST: One aspect of my question was what makes you proud<br />
to be an Australian? Perhaps that's a way of exploring it<br />
further.<br />
KIRK: Well that's a good question you know. I worked for an<br />
American company for whole of my life but I was a true and true<br />
Australian for the whole of my life. There were a couple of<br />
occasions when I had a chance that I might have changed that but<br />
I never ever thought of anything but Australia has home and<br />
Australia has been something that has been very good to me. I<br />
wouldn't have served in the Navy and I wouldn't have stuck up for<br />
Australia around the world like I do if I didn't believe it. It's<br />
just something that's here, I don't know why it there but it is.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you like to see a new flag?<br />
KIRK: I don't know about the flag really. I am an advocate of<br />
Advance Australia Fair mainly because I learnt it at school and<br />
didn't have to re-learn it when it came along. The<br />
JOURNALIST: You actually know all the words?<br />
KIRK: I really had trouble. I am still inclined to go back to<br />
the old words but you. know that's only a matter of time. On the<br />
flag, I don't know. I have heard the arguments, I have never<br />
decided myself which way I'd like to go frankly.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, will you be delegating more of your<br />
responsibilities to Mr Cohen on the Bicentennial as you suggested<br />
a couple of months ago?<br />
PM: There w * ill be an arrangement whereby he will have the<br />
obviously the main day to day ministerial responsibility in the<br />
same way as other Ministers assisting me do have. But we have now<br />
developed, I think in a sense, as a result of the difficulties<br />
that we experienced a very satisfactory arrangement between<br />
ourselves. He consults with me but I repeate he will have the day<br />
to day ministerial responsibility.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it fair to say that Mr Kirk was your appointment?<br />
PM: Yes. When I say yes directly and unequivocally like that I<br />
took to the Cabinet, I was convinced that he was the man for the<br />
job and Cabinet unanimously endorsed that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, Mr Harvey has already shed'-some staff in<br />
his new position. Will Mr Kirk have similar powers and do you<br />
think this second appointment will set the Authority back on the </p>
<p>tracs? PM: It certainly won't set it back. Put it back on the tracks do<br />
you mean or set it back. I didn't quite hear what you said set<br />
it back in its tracks or set it hack on thn~ trackIrs?<br />
JOURNALIST: On the tracks.<br />
PM: One of the things that Jim will obviously be doing will be<br />
to go in and have a look at the Authority to make an assessment<br />
of the adequacy of staff. As far as numbers, that could be up or<br />
down. One of the things I was very pleased he immediately said to<br />
me that he would be doing would be to go around to the States and<br />
talk to the States. And the judgments he makes about the<br />
operation of the Authority will part reflect, I think, the<br />
discussions he has with the States. In general, yes, I believe<br />
that the appointment of Jim Kirk, the experience, the integrity,<br />
the enthusiasm, background that he brings to it will ensure, as I<br />
said at the beginning of this conference, the unquestionable<br />
success of 1988. Both its preparation and the actual celebrations<br />
in that year.<br />
JOURNALIST: Apart from the celebrations and the national road<br />
program. Do you envisage that 1988 will see a more lasting<br />
monument perhaps in the way of something for Australia?<br />
PM: There will be a number of elements Ken, of permanency. That<br />
will be at the national level and also in the important<br />
Federal/ State level. You will appreciate that in early year<br />
prices $ 48 million was allocated to joint Commonwealth/ State<br />
programs and those programs quite clearly already have produced<br />
projects which will have lasting benefit at the national level<br />
yes. There will also be projects of an enduring nature and I<br />
suggest, as I. said before, that in the fairly. near future Jim<br />
will be able to have a more detailed conference with you to go<br />
into those details. But I do mention, for instance without being<br />
exhaustive, the National Maritime Museum. We also are hoping and<br />
expecting that we will able to have a Bicentennial national<br />
science centre. I just mention those two as examples at the<br />
national level as distinct from the State/ Commonwealth<br />
co-operative events which will be lasting memorials of the<br />
Bicentennial. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: When you suggested in the House that the response of<br />
the current account could be a bit more drawn out change in<br />
Australia's industrial structure I think you said. Are you<br />
suggesting there is some change in the budget forecasts?<br />
PM: No, I wasn't meaning that. we still think that we will<br />
start to see the effects of the depreciation in the second half<br />
of the financial year instead of the first half, of 1986. In<br />
dis cussions with th e Treasurer I have no reason to believe that<br />
the sorts of projections that we were talking about are going to<br />
be any different, that is that looking at 85-86 the current<br />
account deficit as a proportion of the GDP should be of the<br />
order, talking of year on year, about down to four and half, 4.6<br />
per cent. And then looking at June 86, down closer to 4 per cent<br />
and then 86-87 down to the order of about three and a half per<br />
cent. The point I was making really, Mike, was not comparing it<br />
with the Budget, but I was really making the point with earlier<br />
periods in Australia's history, talking about the change in<br />
industrial composition and the international market. I think I<br />
was really making the point on the export side that given the<br />
composition of our exports and the depressed international market<br />
for some of our primary products might take a little bit longer<br />
than perhaps in earlier periods to get the benefits of the<br />
depreciation on the export side. Although I did add in my<br />
question there, I didn't go into detail. But in talking to the<br />
business community at the Business Council and also in some<br />
private conversations I have had around with the business<br />
community, there is no doubt that export opportunities have<br />
opened up and are being exploited in the manufacturing sect or as<br />
a direct result of the significant depreciation. And indeed it<br />
would be surprising, if, given the way in the Australian<br />
manufacturing sector in the last decade has become leaner and<br />
more efficient, it would be surprising if the depreciation of the<br />
magnitude we are talking about is not producing those effects.<br />
on the imports side, it is inevitable we believe, that with a<br />
per cent depreciation, it is inevitable that the domestic<br />
producers are going to be able, in the period I have been talki ' ng<br />
about, to pick up some of the benefits of the depreciation. So<br />
that was the sense in which I was making the point.<br />
JOURNALIST: What do you think are the preconditions to reducing<br />
interest rates?<br />
PM: Well, I think the market has got to be satisfied that the<br />
benefits of depreciation are going to work through in the way<br />
that I have referred to, Greg. It is one of the elements. I<br />
think also that we have got to agree that it is impossible when<br />
you are trying to analyse and weigh the components, the factors<br />
that have led to the decisions in the market over recent weeks.<br />
It is impossible to say there is that percentage for that factor.<br />
However, you can say that one of the factors has been, perhaps<br />
some uncertainty if you like, about the 3.8 per cent wages<br />
outcome. Now, I believe that as the market comes to appreciate<br />
that that wages outcome is one which is going to be consistent<br />
with very considerable wage restraint into the future. And<br />
certainly, consistent with a much lesser wages outcome than would<br />
be the alternative wages policy. Then I think as that<br />
realisation increases that will be an important condition of </p>
<p>improvement in the interest rate situation. It goes back to<br />
really what both I and the Treasurer have been saying for some<br />
time now in the current context that we firmly believe, are<br />
firmly convinced, the Government is firmly convinced, that the I<br />
fundamentals of economic policy are right. we have had, earlier<br />
in Xthe year, to be associated with some tightening of monetary<br />
pb'licy which was appropriate when we had that weakening of the<br />
dollar earlier in the year. And more recently in the last couple<br />
of weeks, also we have done that. We believe that if you look atthe<br />
evidence of private demand, if you look at evidence in the<br />
wages sector, the compliance, the overall compliance of the trade<br />
union movement to the Accord to no extra claims, that as that<br />
understanding comes through and: we start to see the benefits of<br />
the depreciation in the current account in the first half of next<br />
year. Those are the broad sets of conditions which are necessary<br />
to produce a more favourable outcome in the interest rate area.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, it is now nearly four weeks since<br />
the end of the Commonwealth meeting. The group of eminent<br />
pesns doesn't seem to be that much closer of being formed. I<br />
knowcerainnames have been put forward. I am just wondering<br />
what is holding it up or is it falling into a hole.<br />
PM: No, it is not falling into a hole. There are three names<br />
that are quite definite. one of whom you are aware of. The<br />
Indian nomination has been finalised, Mr Singh. And the UK, Tony<br />
Barber. The Commonwealth Secretary General, Sonny Ramphal, isr<br />
engaged in discussions with the Africans and I spoke to him on<br />
the phone last week. He is certainly relaxed about it. Julius<br />
Nyere is not available. And let me say I had a very, very<br />
interesting letter from Julius and it is important that it should<br />
be understood that the fact that he has not been able to accept<br />
the Chairmanship in no sense reflects any lack of enthusiasm on<br />
Nyere's part for the concept.-He has-committed himself to the<br />
success of the concept. But for legitimate internal reasons he'<br />
can't do it'. But he will be giving it his full support. Now, I<br />
am confident from the discussions I had on the phone with Sonny,,<br />
that in the quite near future the full group will be finalised.<br />
And I am hopeful as I was in the Bahamas they will be able to set<br />
about doing what we regard, and the Africans regard, as an<br />
important job.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you have had now for some time the<br />
Democrats proposals on tax. Do you intend to give them some 1<br />
concessions and are you confident of getting the tax package<br />
through intact?<br />
PM: Let me say this Michelle that Paul Keating is conducting the<br />
negotiations with the Democrats. I haven't sought in any way to<br />
interfere in that. He has spoken to me about it. I think he is<br />
confident of his capacity to reach a position where we can get an<br />
acceptable agreement with the Democrats. And on that basis,<br />
therefore, I expect the. legislation will be passed.<br />
JOURNALIST: You are willing to be flexible?<br />
PM: Well, we obviously want an acceptable package to be passed.<br />
And we understand the realities of numbers in Senate. If there </p>
<p>the floating of the dollar. And secondly, with the deregulation<br />
of the financial markets. Now those were decisions not taken<br />
lightly, nor taken in ignorance of the implications of those<br />
decisions. We knew that when you made those sets of decisions,<br />
that the market was going to havre more capacity to influence day<br />
to day results. But I want to make this point that we made those<br />
decisions within the overall framework of broad economic strategy<br />
which was based upon the proposition that this country has<br />
experienced to its great detriment, the alternative strategy.<br />
That is the strategy which meant that the previous Government<br />
deliberately limited itself to traditional economic instruments<br />
which meant monetary policy and fiscal policy. Now that stance<br />
of policy was disastrous fo-r this country. It produced, and I<br />
know you have heard me say it many time, but it is relevant to<br />
say it again, it produced the worst recession in this country's<br />
history for 50 years. Now we have deliberately put into place a<br />
Prices and Incomes Accord which gives this Government another<br />
instrument of policy. It has, to use the words of the OECD<br />
Secretary, been brilliantly successful. And we believe that it<br />
would a negation of what the Australian people voted us into<br />
government for to walk away from that strategy which has produced<br />
record growth and importantly, record employment growth. We are<br />
proud of that achievement. And I believe that the Australian<br />
community shares that satisfaction and pride with us. So our<br />
task is to use those traditional instruments of policy with the<br />
additional important instrument of policy which we have equipped<br />
ourselves with which has produced this remarkably low level of<br />
wages growth, which you saw in the statistics last week. Now, we<br />
believe that we can retain those instruments of policy. We<br />
believe that the fundamental results that have been produced,<br />
that is a reduction in real unit labour costs back to the level<br />
of the late l960s, which is again, as you know, the obverse side<br />
of the coin return of the profit share back to the same level of<br />
that period. That. those fundamentals of very significant<br />
increase in profit share, reduction in real unit labour costs,<br />
employment growth, that those results are what the Australian<br />
people want. They haven't emerged by accident. And part of the<br />
process of the emergency of those results has been the freeing b. p<br />
of the markets. So we don't look at the markets with antagonism<br />
and say look what you are doing to us. We say it was a<br />
deliberate act of policy to free up the markets. We believe that<br />
we can accommodate that freeing up of the markets in the<br />
framework of this additional range of instruments of policies<br />
that we have given ourselves.<br />
JOURNALIST: How do you know monetary policy won't be a kind of<br />
blunt instrument that it has occasions in the past the long<br />
lags involved, some evidence of that in other countries?<br />
PM: Well, I think it follows logically from the question and<br />
answer I just gave Mike. That if in fact we only had monetary<br />
policy and fiscal policy, the traditional instruments upon which<br />
the Fraser/ Howard Government relied, then that question would be<br />
much more relevant. But we have a situation within which we have<br />
been able massively to contain wages growth. And because that<br />
instrument of policy which the Liberals didn't have the wit, the<br />
wisdom or the intelligence or the understanding or the philosophy<br />
to embrace. Because we had all those things and have done it, </p>
<p>then we don't impose the same burden upon monetary policy as you<br />
would have to in the absence of that additional instrument of<br />
policy. I can assure you that the * Treasurer in consultation with<br />
the Reserve Bank, and in discussion with me, are watching very<br />
closely the impact of the combined policies that are appl. ying,<br />
including monetary policy. And we therefore think we are not in<br />
the same historical framework as our predecessors. We have more<br />
flexibility, more room, to use those range of instruments in a<br />
way which are not going to have the blunt and disastrous results<br />
which occurred under our inept predecessors.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, is it possible to identify or even<br />
speculate on the Australian..<br />
PM: No, I don't think it is. Not in a quantifiable way. All I<br />
can say on that is that if the Treasurer and the Reserve Bank<br />
believed that there was some activity t 1! ere, identifiable<br />
activity which was, if I can use theA I~ erng maliciously applied to<br />
the detriment of the Australian economy, I believe that would<br />
have been brought to my attention. It hasn't.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think it is a necessary pre-condition of the<br />
Accord it has full wage indexation. And if the markets don't<br />
accept that there is wage restraint Will you be going to the<br />
ACTU and asking for some deduction in that full indexation?<br />
PM: Well, let me take that in two steps Greg. Firstly, I think<br />
there is an increasing appreciation, and I say that not<br />
hypothetically, but through discussions with the Business<br />
Council. There is an increasing understanding and adequacy of<br />
the agreement negotiated with the ACTU. It was a matter of<br />
considerable interest to me in my meeting with the Business<br />
Council two weeks ago, that the President of the Business<br />
Council, Bob White, actually said that they saw that the<br />
arrangement was a reasonably sensible one. Which was something<br />
that they weren't saying at the time that it was made. In other<br />
words, they can see that the three elements of that arrangement<br />
are important. And I emphasise those three elements. Firstly'<br />
the 2 per cent discount. Secondly, the spreading out of the<br />
productivity claim which is to be taken in terms of<br />
superannuation. Now that, except in isolated circumstances, that<br />
is not going to apply until July of next year and will be<br />
negotiated through industry in a way which take account of<br />
differing degrees of capacity within the economy. And thirdly,<br />
the third element, is of course. may I still talking about the<br />
second point say this, that you would understand that one of the<br />
benefits from the business community's point of view of the<br />
productivity increase being taken in superannuation rather than<br />
wages is that you don't get the same degree of on-cost impact as<br />
you would otherwise get. And the third point of the negotiation<br />
is of course the agreement to no extra claims. Now, I believe<br />
Greg, that it is indisputably right to say now that there is a<br />
clearer perception and understanding in the business community of<br />
the. relevance of that agreement-. And therefore what we are<br />
seeing is that by the time we get to the next * wages case that<br />
that two per cent that has been negotiated would be about the<br />
amount, almost precisely the amount that would have been arrived<br />
at by the processes of calculation of the Commission. And may I </p>
<p>remind you that in the judgement of the Commission, they, in this<br />
last case, they said that they believed that the deferring of the<br />
discount, the deferral of the discount until next year would have<br />
a minimal impact upon the respective inflation outcomes. And I<br />
believe that that is clearly right. And I think that the<br />
business community increasingly sees that that is correct.<br />
Therefore, I don't apologise for the length of that, because it<br />
is relevant to your question. I think the pressures, the<br />
expectations, of some further approach were greater before there<br />
was this clearer understanding of this whole impact of the deal<br />
that has been negotiated. So therefore, I don't see those<br />
pressures being upon us now. I say this however, that you recall<br />
that the last paragraphs of-the agreement with the ACTU provide<br />
for further negotiation if circumstances require. We don't see<br />
that at the moment. But the fact that those provisions are there<br />
is relevant. And if the judgement in the judgement of the<br />
Government it became necessary to do that then we would do it.<br />
