CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
PRIME MPN STERSPEECH<br />
BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF THE MUNICIPAL OFFICES ANNEXE.<br />
COBURG 15 APRIL 1984<br />
Mr Mayor, Councillors, Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
I am again delighted to be here in Coburg the very heart<br />
of my constituency. It is not so long since I was last with<br />
the Council here in Coburg. In February Hazel and I<br />
attended a special Council meeting, followed by dinner as<br />
part of the celebration of the 1.25th anniversary of local<br />
government in Coburg an evening with our good friends<br />
which we particularly enjoyed.<br />
It gives me particular pleasure to be here again for the<br />
opening of these impressive, new council offices, this time<br />
as part of the Heritage W'eek celebrations organized by the<br />
National Trust of Australia.<br />
The original Town Hall offices were established in the<br />
1920' s and, apart from a few minor modifications over the<br />
years. These are largely unchanged. rhis annexe has been<br />
made necesary by the continuing growth of the municipality.<br />
Its functional character should greatly improve the working<br />
conditions of Coburg's Council staff.<br />
The vacated old offices will be used to centrally locate the<br />
Council's Human Services staff who have until now been<br />
housed at separate locations. Additionally, meeting rooms<br />
and a reference library for the use of Councillors have been<br />
provided. These welcome developments will improve the cohesion of the<br />
resources devoted to community welfare services and<br />
contribtue overall to the greater efficiency of the<br />
Council's work.<br />
The citizens of Coburg will also benefit from the improved<br />
services that will assuredly flow from the centralising of<br />
the council's departments, made possible by the<br />
establishment of this annexe. </p>
<p>2.<br />
I must commend the people responsible for the construction<br />
and design of these offices. They have matched the old with<br />
the new and provided a harmony of old wor-ld charm, with<br />
contemporary, modern structures. Their work and the efforts<br />
of the Mayor and Councillors have given the municipality of<br />
Coburg one of its most attractive features.<br />
The establishment of this annexe is an obvious testament to'<br />
the growth and dynamism of local Government in Coburg. Since<br />
its incorporation as the Coburg District Roads Board in 1859<br />
this Council has evolyed and increased its functions from<br />
that of a limited authority responsible only for roads<br />
to a multi-purpose community Government committed to the<br />
continued service of the people and to further growth and<br />
prosperity of the Coburg area. I<br />
The Government is committed to recognising local1 government'<br />
as a genuine partner in our governmental system-. and to<br />
encouraging worthwhile interaction between the three spheres<br />
of Government Federal, State and Local. In'implementing<br />
our policies we have already made some important changes:<br />
Established the first National Local Government<br />
Ministry to co-ordinate activities in areas of<br />
relevance to Local Governments.<br />
Increased the funds for general and special<br />
purposes to flow from the Commonwealth Government<br />
this year to local government by well over 40% 1 from<br />
the previous year this includes money for local<br />
roads, child care services, health, welfare and<br />
housing. Coburg has benefitted directly from this<br />
increase with the city's allocation of general<br />
purpose revenue grants rising from $ 1,285,000 in<br />
1982/ 83 to $ 1,400,000 in 1983/ 84.<br />
Finally, we have initiated a significant National<br />
Inquiry into the financial relations and capacities<br />
of local Governments.<br />
In short, the Federal Labor Government attaches considerable<br />
importance to successful implementation by Local Governments<br />
of their responsibilities. The immediate, grass-roots needs<br />
of our communities are frequently the most pressing. Very<br />
often they are also best understood and best met by those<br />
engaged in local government.<br />
Accordingly, it is with a great deal of pride and pleaseure<br />
that I now declare the Coburg Offices Annexe officially<br />
open. </p>
