SPEAKING NOTES FOR THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF BENDIGO BUILDING SOCIETY HEADQUARTERS<br />
BENDIGO 7 JUNE 1989<br />
At the outset I offer my congratulations to Australia's<br />
oldest building society as it enters, with confidence<br />
and optimism, a new phase in its growth.<br />
0 When we moved to deregulate Australia's financial system<br />
we knew this would present many opportunities and many<br />
challenges to banks and building societies around the<br />
nation. It is pleasing to see how the Bendigo Building<br />
Society has responded to this challenge.<br />
And it is also pleasing to see the growth that has taken<br />
place in Bendigo over those years.<br />
A few statistics tell this story vividly.<br />
Real level of construction activity has<br />
doubled between 1982/ 83 and 1987/ 88.<br />
House construction has nearly trebled over<br />
that period to $ 75 million in 1987/ 88. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Expenditure on retail construction has also<br />
risen very sharply over that period to more<br />
than $ 13 million.<br />
Factory construction has also increased.<br />
In other words, building activity is taking<br />
place across a broad range, which indicates<br />
the underlying strength of Bendigo's economy.<br />
The Federal Government has made an important<br />
contribution to all this activity.<br />
Work on the $ 11 million extension to the Bendigo<br />
TAFE has just been completed.<br />
We are providing nearly $ 2 million for elderly<br />
persons hostel units and some $ 40 million, with a<br />
further $ 70 million of Federal funds committed over<br />
the next five years for work on the Calder Highway.<br />
We have assisted more than 2,500 local families<br />
through the First Homes Owners Scheme.<br />
The State Government is also, I know, supporting a<br />
number of important developments which will continue to<br />
support the building industry. </p>
<p>Over these years the Bendigo Building Society has grown<br />
to support this development.<br />
In 1987-88 you lent more than $ 200 million.<br />
You have computerised; you have expanded into<br />
providing new consumers services.<br />
And now you have built Fountain Court which will<br />
serve as your headquarters for many years to come.<br />
You will play an important role in Bendigo's future<br />
just as you have in its past. I wish you well in that<br />
endeavour. I have great pleasure in declaring Fountain Court<br />
open. [ UNVEIL PLAQUE] </p>
