FULL TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING,<br />
MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH MIKE WILLESEE, A CURRENT AFFAIR, NINE<br />
NETWORK, 1 JULY 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
MW: Prime Minister, thanks for your time.<br />
PM: Good, Michael.<br />
MW: You have had varying degrees of opposition and concern about the<br />
Mabo decision, but now In Hugh Morgan you have someone prepared to<br />
lead a campaign which says that in every respect Mabo Is wrong and<br />
dangerous.<br />
PM: Well, there will always be a view put at the extremes of any of these<br />
arguments and I thinK the important thing is for Australians not to be<br />
distracted by that view. I mean it is a minority view, I think, It Is wrong, It<br />
is entirely wrong, it is technically wrong, that's the key point. The<br />
Important thing is that the rest of the country gets on arnd builds a proper<br />
administrative structure just to see this decision of the High Court's<br />
handled and to see justice done to Aboriginal Australians, and<br />
particularly, and as importantly, to see the whole community of Australia<br />
realise that we can't build our society In the future on a Ilie.<br />
MW: What does this mean In political terms, because even National Party<br />
leader, Trn Fischer, concedes there were horrific massacres and<br />
concedes the Aborigines did have cLture?<br />
PM: That Is true. The concept which the High Court overturned this Is the<br />
concept of Terra nullius, land of no one was In legal terms a Ilie. We<br />
have been trying to build a nation on that Ilie for a couple of hundred<br />
years. Well of course it wasn't a land of no one, It was a land of the<br />
Aboriginal people. Now, in other countries treaties were signed, In fact<br />
even in Captain Cook's Instructions from the Admiralty he was asked to </p>
<p>lay claim to parts of the countty with the consent of the natives. The key<br />
word being consent. Well, none of that was ever done, and now<br />
perhaps later rather than earlier, but better late than never, a decision<br />
has been made which says there Is a'n ative title in the common law.<br />
The key point Is, Michael. that we can now get on and give those<br />
Aboriginals who stiil live and have associations with the land, title to the<br />
land. But where a State land manager has Issued a freehold t~ te, such<br />
as one or residence or a mining title, that extinguishes the native title.<br />
So, there is no fear for people worrying about their land, their backyards,<br />
their et cetera.<br />
MW: But there are a lot of fears and a lot of uncertainties, and when Hugh<br />
Morgan runs a campaign like this, even with his conflict of interest<br />
running Western Mining Corporation his emotive claims make it easy<br />
to put him down, even lampoon him, but because people are confused<br />
and uncertain he can prey upon a lot of fears. That makes your job<br />
pretty difficult.<br />
PM: It does, but again we can't have good things, that is wholesome changes<br />
to the way our society functions derailed or put asunder by these narrow<br />
views. The key points for Australians to understand about this decision,<br />
first of all there Is nothing In It to tear whatsoever. The second point I<br />
made to you a moment ago but It Is worth reiterating, native title is a title<br />
subordinate to the Crown, so where the Crown, or the State, or the<br />
Commonwealth has Issued titles that extinguishes the native title. So,<br />
all of the settled areas of Australia, the freehold -titles * of Sydney and<br />
Melbourne and Brisbane et cetera, and the rural lands and the farms of<br />
this country. Those titles have extinguished the native title, the only<br />
place where native title can be claimed and awarded I s where we have<br />
got unalienated Crown land, which is mostly in places remote from the<br />
capital cities and towns and where there Is still a continuing Aboriginal<br />
association or living upon the land.<br />
MW; Where there are -racist attitudes In Australia, and Hugh Morgan refers to<br />
racism quite often, don't you think In those areas H-ugh Morgan's views<br />
might not be found to be appealing?<br />
PM: Well I think probably for anyone who has that kind of view it is tending to<br />
confirm their view, but again, I mean you can't build a society and a<br />
nation on these sorts of things. I have just come back from China and<br />
you look at the huge opportunities in China, Korea and North and South<br />
East Asia In particular, we are taken seriously In that part of the world<br />
because people see us as a nation of substance and particularly a<br />
multicultural country and a nation which has Its act together. It will<br />
matter very much to us In the future, not just at home where It matters<br />
most, but even abroad, that we have this Issue with our Indigenous<br />
people settled. So, calls to narrow sectional views of the variety that Mr<br />
Morgan made won't do anyone any good, and at any rate It Is historically </p>
<p>wrong. The thing about Mr Morgan's points were the ones you took up<br />
yourself, and I might congratulate you on the position you took, and that<br />
was to make it very clear that In the historic context he was wrong, but In<br />
the technical context he Is totally wrong. That is, that this matter can be<br />
settled providing we have competent administrative structures there and<br />
the Commonwealth Is now working on a piece of legislation to do that.<br />
One of the things he said was, we can't validate all the titles from 1975.<br />
That simply requires an amendment to a Commonwealth, the passage<br />
of a piece of Commonwealth legislation, which I told the Premiers I am<br />
prepared to do. So you can forget that as a problem as well. So,<br />
technically he was wrong, historically he was wrong, but worse than that<br />
he doesn't do anything for the peace and good governance of Australia.<br />
MW: In view of the fact that he does have an audience of indeterminate size,<br />
may It be, I would like to put a couple of his points to you. He says that<br />
Aboriginal demands that a few years ago were laughable have now been<br />
given legitimacy by Mabo.<br />
PM: Before they knew that a native title existed In the common law, they<br />
sought land because of the spiritual and traditional association of<br />
Aboriginal peopie with the land. It Is not the view a non-Aboriginal<br />
person has of land, we see It having an aesthetic or an economic use.<br />
They have a totally different association with land. Now formerly, they<br />
were asking for land rights. That was land conferred on them by the<br />
Parliaments of the State and the Commonwealth. Where Mabo Is<br />
different, It Is not a conferred right, It Is a more dignified right, It's a right<br />
which exists as a right In the common law. But again, it is limited only to<br />
where Aboriginal people can prove that they have maintained an<br />
association with it, lived on it, or had an economic use with it. And for<br />
most Aboriginals, this is the key point, and one that Mr Morgan doesn't<br />
acknowledge, most Aboriginals have been pushed off their land and<br />
dispossessed of their land, and therefore can not make a native title<br />
claim stick.<br />
MW: Morgan says that all property titles in Australia, all, have been devalued<br />
as a result.<br />
PM: That Is sheer extravagance of language, it is totally untrue. It is<br />
absolutely untrue, and it is a statement not worthy of him making.<br />
MW: And he takes up the cry of his people, the guilt Industry. What does that<br />
mean?<br />
PM: Well it Is nothing to do with guilt, It Is to do with, as I said before, the lie<br />
that sat under the earlier court judgements about the concept of Terra<br />
nullus, the Latin for land of no one. I mean it was a land of people when<br />
Europeans came here. So to put that right, to set that wrong to a right Is<br />
not to do as he says. </p>
<p>MW: He says that people In the guilt Industry have difficulty In understanding<br />
that when offered a choice between walking across the desert or riding<br />
In a Toyota an Aborigine will choose today to ride In the Toyota. And<br />
that can sound pretty stupid, except he has a point that he Is aiming at a<br />
target audience, he Is saying that that necessity of choice means you<br />
wipe out the weak culture, the weaker culture. Now there may be an<br />
audience for that message out there.<br />
PM: Well, so what's our society built on? The stronger parts of each part of<br />
our society wipes out the weaker parts.<br />
MW: I think that is what he Is saying.<br />
PM: I am sure you take the view, and I certainly do, one feature of Australia<br />
which I think most of the world acknowledges positively and that Is the<br />
great tolerance of the Australian society. I happen to think that that<br />
tolerance comes from a very deep seated sense of democracy. We<br />
have such commitments to democracy in this country that people accept<br />
the right of other people to be different. But If we get to the stage of<br />
saying tolerance goes and it Is only the strong that prosper economically<br />
and socially, god help us as a society. In other words these wealthy<br />
people who think they can put themselves up In their places with barbed<br />
wire round their front yards, that's what they would end up with in the<br />
sort of society that Mr Morgan wants to tell us that exists. It Is a very,<br />
very narrow view.<br />
MW: That Is the basic underlying message Isn't It? That they were going to<br />
die out anyway, so let's not have any guilt Industry.<br />
PM: Yes, well so what do we do, as you said I think very poignantly to Mr<br />
Fischer, well what if some other stronger society wants to Impact<br />
themselves upon us, would we accept that we should give way to them.<br />
At what stage do the Individual rights and dignity of the human person<br />
matter. At what stage do we say our society is built on a sense of<br />
democracy and a right of dignity for each person. I mean that's what<br />
makes our society tick, not how strong we are, that's not how Australia<br />
has come this far for so long. And I should think that It should never<br />
change from that.<br />
MW: Prime Minister, I would like to show you now what Mr Morgan had to say<br />
about you yesterday.<br />
HM. The Prime Minister Is believed to be a great admirer of Napolean and<br />
one can see similar qualities of leadership in the two men. But I believe<br />
there is, that In taking up the cause of Aboriginal separatism that the real<br />
agenda of the so-called reconciliation process the Prime Minister Is<br />
following Napoleon on the bitter road to Moscow. </p>
<p>MW: Prime Minister.<br />
PM If there was anyone In that period I Should like to take a lesson from it<br />
was Thomas Jefferson who was a contemporary of course of<br />
Bonaparte's and who drafted the American declaration of Independence<br />
with those immortal words ' life, liberty and the pursuit of human<br />
happiness'. Now It would do Mr Morgan well to read the US Declaration<br />
of Independence and may be as well the Gettysburg Address from<br />
President Lincoln to understand what has been the mainstream of<br />
endeavour in that country In terms of dealing with Indigenous people.<br />
MW: Prime Minister, putting aside Morgan how do you handle those fears and<br />
uncertainties that do exist about Mabo In Australia?<br />
PM: To get on with it Michael, the States and the Commonwealth should get<br />
on with It and put down a body of administrative law very simply to hear<br />
native title claims and when they have been heard and determined to<br />
award them. This wili happen largely In areas removed from the capital<br />
cities and the provinclal towns of Australia, removed from the pastoral<br />
areas, the freehold areas In particular. It can be done, the framework<br />
which I spoke to the Premiers about in Melbourne is a very adoptable<br />
one, we have now rejoined in negotiations to try and push that to some<br />
sort of finality and rather than regard this as a probiem, people should<br />
understand it for what it really Is and that Is an opportunity an<br />
opportunity to set right a wrong, to overturn a legal lie and to actually puli<br />
our country together on a basis of equality where the Indigenous people<br />
of Australia have rights equal to the non-Aboriginal people In this<br />
country. There Is a huge opportunity for us In this and If we sort this<br />
problem out In this country with our indigenous people our reputation<br />
and the estimation of those around us In Indonesia, In China, In North<br />
and South East Asia will go up even further and have a material, social<br />
and economic Impact upon us. So it is very important that we get this<br />
right and I believe we can, and-not just that we Will, do it.<br />
MW: Prime Minister, thanks for you time.<br />
PM: Thank you Michael.<br />
