PRESS RELEASE BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. E. G.<br />
WHITLAM, CLOTHING INDUSTRY<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that the first reference<br />
was being forwarded to the Textiles Authority within the<br />
Industries Assistance Commission. The reference followed<br />
discussions between the Prime Minister and the Minister for<br />
Overseas Trade, Dr. Cairns and the Minister for Secondary<br />
Industry, Mr. Enderby. The reference asked the Authority to<br />
un dertake an immediate examination of the principal sectorsof<br />
the clothing industry to ascertain whether action should be<br />
taken under the GATT Textiles Arrangement to restrain imports<br />
into Australia. The sectors covered were woven shirts, knitted<br />
outerwear, dresses and related clothing products.<br />
" It is time to find out the facts", the Prime Minister said.<br />
The Prime Minister said that the reference followed<br />
representations and claims by representatives of the local<br />
clothing industry of damage from imports. Imports of some<br />
clothing items had increased in recent months but the domestic<br />
market had grown substantially and local production was at<br />
high levels. Mr. Whitlam pointed out that there was a normal<br />
sea-sonal decline in the textile industry at this time. Checks<br />
with the Commonwealth Employment Service have revealed that<br />
statements in the press of layoffs have been grossly exaggerated.<br />
Since the 25% cut in tariffs was made in* July, 1973, a total of<br />
389 persons in the textiles and footwear industries have b. een<br />
displaced. The seasonal nature of employment in the industry<br />
is shown by the 800 persons who were displaced in January, 1973,<br />
550 persons in January 1974 ( an abnormal low) whilst there<br />
was a dectease of 400 jobs in April/ May last year. The Prime<br />
Minister said tha December, January, May and June were months<br />
where there was traditionally a seasonal decline in employment<br />
in the industry.<br />
" It is ty no means clear that restraint action is necessary<br />
at this stage and no clothing company has submitted a detailed<br />
formal case to the Government. / 2 </p>
<p>0 -2-<br />
" However, to allay any concern that may be developing about<br />
the future of the textiles indulstry and because some people<br />
are trying to make political capital out of the situation<br />
without presenting the facts, the best thing to do is to have<br />
a public inquiry to obtain any * evidence which is available<br />
and determine whether action is necessary", said the Prime<br />
Minister. The. Prime Minister invited manufacturers and other interested<br />
parties to start, preparing evidence now for submission to the<br />
Authority. The Textiles Authority would announce arrangements for public<br />
hearings shortly. Under procedural arrangements which the<br />
Government announced in February, the Textiles Authority is<br />
being asked to report as soon as possible but within a<br />
maximum period of 60 days. If action for restraints is<br />
recommended by the Authority, urgent negotiations would then<br />
be initiated with the exporting countries concerned.<br />
Any employees laid off as a result of the lifting of the import<br />
quotas or the 25% tariff cut and whose employer makes a<br />
declaration to this effect will receive their average normal<br />
wages over the previous six months until satisfactorily<br />
re-employed or a period of six months has elapsed.<br />
The Prime Minister added that if other sectors of the textiles<br />
and apparel industries faced difficulties from import<br />
competition, consideration would be given to sending further<br />
references to the Textiles Authority.<br />
