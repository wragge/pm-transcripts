PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH NEIL MITCHELLJ, 3AW, 17/ 3/ 92.<br />
E &amp; EO0-PROOF ONLY<br />
MITCHELL: The building I assume is open and with me the man who<br />
opened it, the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, good morning.<br />
PM: Good morning Neil.<br />
MITCHELL: The deed is done, is it?<br />
PM: Yes, I was just saying, it's a change from the sort of<br />
patina of the old radio station. You know they always have a<br />
comfortable feel, those thirties radio stations. 3AW here and<br />
2KY in Sydney was the same. You walked in and it was like<br />
stepping back into the old days of radio, the days of the great<br />
radio personalities, all that history came back over you.<br />
MITCHELLL: A bit like the old Parliament House.<br />
PMs Yes, a bit like the old Parliament House.<br />
MITCHELL: Ninety days today.<br />
PM: Somebody told me that.<br />
MITCHELL: Ninety days, now we've had-the Sixty Minutes thing,<br />
the family barbeque, we've had the bash the Poms, savage John<br />
Hewson, the switch to vaudeville it strikes me has been thrown.<br />
is it working?<br />
PM: Well I think' we are the important thing is getting<br />
Australia working again and I think that confidence is returning,<br />
slowly but surely, and the statement the Government put together,<br />
One Nation, was about pulling that together, and I think also a<br />
sense of confidence about ourselves helps. That is not just the<br />
mechanical things in economy but Australians knowing about<br />
themselves and being certain and confident about themselves<br />
helps. So in the full bloom of the statement and rhetoric, I<br />
think, I hope, that Australia's going to be better. e a 6 / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
MITCHELL: But obviously as a politician it's also about getting<br />
the personal rating up and about being seen as the competent<br />
leader and about regaining government. Is it working in that<br />
sense do you think?<br />
PM: Well I can only... if the polls are responding somewhat, but<br />
I think the main thing is that whatever ambitions I have for<br />
myself, they're greater for Australia and if I can engender<br />
recovery, bring it on, we've got the national accounts out today,<br />
I'll be surprised if they don't reveal Australia on the turn, the<br />
economy on the turn, and I think and hope that the One Nation<br />
statement will drive that on, power that on and consolidate a<br />
recovery. I<br />
MITCHELL: You do think then that we're coming out of recession.<br />
I mean you took a long time to be convinced we were going into it<br />
but you' re now, you're one of the first to say we're coming out.<br />
PM*: I'd say that the economy has been on the turn and we have<br />
given it an impetus, some added momentum by the package we<br />
introduced into Parliament a few weeks ago, so I think that<br />
should guarantee~ a recovery.<br />
MITCHELL: When will we feel it? When will we get jobs? When<br />
will people i3top having trouble eating?<br />
PM: Jobs aria tied up with production. If you follow any<br />
measures of production over the last thirty years, in our<br />
national accounts you find employment running right with them.<br />
So if we can lift production we lift employment, so the aim of<br />
the game is to lift production and I think that will happen.<br />
MITCHELL: But short term are we going to have more jobs or have<br />
we got to wait for a year<br />
PM: Oh no, well we've had quite a reasonable spurt of employment<br />
growth in the last three months but it's just been that the<br />
labour force has been growing by a greater amount than employment<br />
growth. We've not been losing employment over the last three or<br />
four months, we've actually been gaining employment, but<br />
unemployment has gone up a jot because the labour market is still<br />
growing. Tho point is trying to get that employment growth ahead<br />
of workforce growth so that unemployment comes down. So we've<br />
been seeing that growth coming through in employment, well we've<br />
got to see more of it. ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
MITCH-ELL: Your friend, or I think he is, Tony Sheehan, talks<br />
about eighty thousand jobs here in Victoria, and a lot of that is<br />
spinnfinlg out of the One Nation policy, but when will we see some<br />
of them?<br />
PM: I think you'll see them over the course of this year, you'll<br />
see a fair bit: of'that. We think that we can produce about eight<br />
hundred thousand over four years on the sort of forecast which<br />
we've put together for the One Nation statement which are not<br />
remarkable. They've got the economy growing at about four<br />
percent a year and if we can't do four percent a year you'd have<br />
to give the game up.<br />
MITCHELL: It's based on confidence still, about international<br />
recovery, isn" t it, both the United States and Japan, and I<br />
noticed the Nikkei figures are very bad overnight.<br />
PM: That's right Noil, the international economy does help us<br />
obviously, or hinder us, and it has been hindering us. We've had<br />
a recession really worldwide in the fallout of the stockmarket<br />
crash of 1987 and I just made the point downstairs at the opening<br />
of the station, thinking about Roosevelt's talk to the nation on<br />
radio in the United States in the thirties. Four years after the<br />
stockmarket cr7ash of 1929 American production had fallen by forty<br />
percent, but four years after the stockmarket crash of ' 87 which<br />
was bigger than 1929, American production had fallen by three<br />
percent and ours had fallen by three. In other words we've<br />
avoided an international depression but we've ended up with a<br />
recession and that's a problem that we've got to try and pull our<br />
way out of, and it will help us if those other countries come out<br />
too.<br />
MITCHELL: I'd argue though that we led the world, or one of the<br />
first countriets in the world, into recession. Are you saying<br />
we'll be one of the first out?<br />
PM: I think we all went in about the same time and we probably<br />
will emerge at-out the same time I think, but growth in America is<br />
slow. But fortunately for us we're tied up with the fastest<br />
growing part of the world, the Asia-Pacific, and growth rates in<br />
this part of the world are now around five to seven percent.<br />
That's Indonesia, Thailand, Japan, Hongkong, Phillipines, Taiwan,<br />
in this area most economies are growing at about five.. . the whole<br />
area's growing at about five to seven percent which is qtiite<br />
fast, about twice the speed of the rest of the world. So we're<br />
caught up in that fortunately and that helps tug us along as<br />
well. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
MITCHELL: Yiou mention confidence. What do you base your<br />
assessment on, that confidence is returning. I mean the latest<br />
poll, the Morgan Poll in the Time today says quite the opposiLte.<br />
PM I think that the economy has bottomed, is on the turn, that<br />
it's on the turn for the better and that the One Nation statement<br />
will consolidate that recovery. I think the banks are probably<br />
seeing the end of their well at least they can see the bottom<br />
of their own -problems and losses and with interest rates down<br />
low now for quite a long time, deals can be made again, people<br />
can do things again and they're starting to do them. So I think<br />
there is Just that feeling coming, that people think things are<br />
better, they're starting to see some light around and they're<br />
starting to pick up assets and use them....<br />
MITCHELL: Is it a gut feeling... Unaudible)..?<br />
PM. Well a bit of well... people say things to you, you<br />
know, there's an anecdotal view about the work that people have<br />
in their place and how they see the next three months and this<br />
sort of thing, and my impression is things are better than they<br />
were three months ago.<br />
MITCHELL: You mentioned interest rates. Room for them to come<br />
down further?<br />
PM: Not for the moment I don't think, but again, the Government<br />
does regard low, inflation as a great Australian achievement.<br />
We've broken the back of inflation now to one and a half percent<br />
for the first time in twenty years and we want to make sure the<br />
recovery is a low inflation recovery. But again we've tried to<br />
get that balance right and that is at the same time engender a<br />
recovery while holding inflation. We've taken interest rates<br />
down about twelve percent, then our bill rates are now about<br />
seven and a half, they're quite low by our standards, but of<br />
course inflation's low. So there's scope there for lower<br />
interest rates with a longer run, good inflation performance.<br />
MITCHELL: End of' the year? I mean you're painting a pretty<br />
optimistic picture about the end of the year if we're turning and<br />
there's still room for interest rates.<br />
PM: We have through ' 92-3 in that one Nation forecast growth at<br />
four and three quarter percent through the year, and I think as<br />
the stock cycle ' turns, as we're seeing better prices for<br />
commodities, for wheat, wool's picking up, some of the non-ferris<br />
metals, and we're seeing buildings starting to shift and<br />
retailing starting, to modestly shift, I think you can see that<br />
growth starting to come together. </p>
<p>MITCHELL: Good time for an election?<br />
PM: Well I'm sure the public want value out of the political<br />
system and out of the Parliament, so the best value they can get<br />
is a Parliament that runs longer rather than shorter and from our<br />
point of view the best thing to do is to get on governing.<br />
MITCHELL: Would you be willing to say there will not be an<br />
election this year?<br />
PM; There's no point, X don't think, any government cutting its<br />
options off about elections, but my intention at this stage is to<br />
see the Parliament run through into 1993.<br />
MITCHELLt Have you talked to Joan Kirner about election<br />
strategies? P14: Never had a conversation with her about it ever.<br />
MITCHELL: Because you'd want her presumably it'd be better for<br />
the Victorian, Government to go first.<br />
PM: I think that'll probably happen, didn't she say something<br />
about the end. of the year?<br />
MITCHELL: Certainly at this stage you wouldn't be looking at<br />
this year?<br />
PM; No.<br />
MITCHELL: Might be tempting, if popularity keeps going up<br />
and.... PM: No no no, I think the main thing is that the most tempting<br />
thing for all of us is to get that growth going and get people<br />
back feeling confident about the place and get commerce spinning<br />
again. MITCHELL: Aborigines. Now you've taken a high profile on this<br />
over recent weeks. Would you revive the treaty? 9 / 6 </p>
<p>PM: Well I think the process which we have in place is a good<br />
one, the reconcilliation council and its processes. I think what<br />
last week's events reveal, that there's a long way to go in that<br />
reconcilliation and it's important that non-aboriginal<br />
Australians feel good about their support for the aboriginal<br />
community and we see a material shift in the living standards of<br />
the aboriginal community, I think that's the most important<br />
thing. The shift in living stanldards and opportunities for the<br />
aboriginal community is more important than treaties or any other<br />
things which do not expressly or directly go to those issues.<br />
MITCHELL: So the treaty is down the track, once you sort out the<br />
other problems?<br />
PM: I would think that. I think the work of the reconcilliation<br />
council plus the work of ATSIC and the fact that the Government<br />
will be responding to the Royal Commission into Deaths in<br />
Custody, on law and Justice issues and the underlying things<br />
which produce! the problem. The underlying problems in living<br />
standards and opportunities, I think they're the things to be<br />
addressed and, if they can be addressed as the reconcilliation<br />
council addresses'the broader run attitudinal things, I think<br />
that's the way for us to go.<br />
MITCHELL: rs it time to put politics aside from it? Is there a<br />
bipartisan approach here?<br />
PM: I would always hope that was the case, that it is a<br />
bipartisan matter and that the aboriginal community can therefore<br />
enjoy that political support. We think this is the last<br />
opportunity this decade to again make another material<br />
improvement and advance in the conditions of aboriginal society<br />
and that's why we'll be using this opportunity with the Deaths3 in<br />
Custody response.<br />
MITCHELL: I notice the reports today about vilification laws.<br />
is this essentially a racist country do you think?<br />
PM I don't think it is Neil. I mean you'd have a fair idea of<br />
this as I would because you speak to many people here in the<br />
station, but I don't think it's a racist country. This is a<br />
tolerant place. We've made multiculturalism work here as well as<br />
any country in the world could work. I just made the point at a<br />
St Patrick's Day breakfast. a./ 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
I mean no two countries have, well if you like, eyed each other<br />
off so sharply over such a long period as England and Ireland,<br />
but yet a lot of Australian nationalism has come from those two<br />
streams working together. I mean Australian multiculturalism, has<br />
worked, I don't think this is a racist country though there'll<br />
always be I suppose some racist attitudes. The issue is to be<br />
rid of them.<br />
MITCHELL: I was a little surprised by the passion with which you<br />
reacted to the videos or that issue. Do you think the AH3C<br />
should've shown the, videos?<br />
PM: I think the ABC's entitled to reflect in its news issues in<br />
Australian life, and it did, and it's important I think those<br />
issues are on the table, that people know they have to be dealt<br />
with. MITCHELL: Why the passion from you?<br />
PM: Because I think it's time that that sort of racism one would<br />
expect to see In the American South of the 1930' s and 40' s was<br />
expunged from our society here in the 1990' s. I mean it was a<br />
very, I think, nasty experience for that to happen, to have those<br />
families, the families of those two people mocked in this way and<br />
I think we have to be entirely resolute. Those of us who have<br />
charge of government and in a sense some influence over<br />
attitudes, it's entirely important I think that we set the<br />
standard, we make the stand.<br />
MITCHELL: There are some who say that your statement in<br />
Parliament about the English was encouraging racism, or about<br />
England was encouraging racism and was bashing Poms.<br />
PM:. No no, it was not a complaint against the British or<br />
Britain. It was only a complaint against those people in<br />
Australia who don't have it in them to be wholeheartedly<br />
Australian in their attitudes.<br />
MITCHELL; But you were suggesting that the British had perhaps<br />
deserted Australia at a certain time.<br />
PM$ Oh yes, absolutely, I Baid it again this morning, that our<br />
sacrifice in world War One for Britain was not responded or<br />
reciprocated in kind in World War Two. a / 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
MITCHELL: The historians perhaps debated a bit.<br />
PM: 6 Well London Guardian gave me a big tick and so did the<br />
London Times. I mean I didn't get it in the tabloids but I got<br />
it in the broadsheets.<br />
MITCHELL: The Lizard of Oz.<br />
PM: Yes well that was in the tabloids but the broadsheets, the<br />
serious papers were good and the fact is that's past, but my<br />
complaint is with people here, Australians, who can't not only<br />
grasp the future but can't grasp properly and sensibly the past.<br />
Don't understand enough about the past to let that influence the<br />
future.<br />
MITCHELL: But can you see that it may have been, for whatever<br />
reasons, divisive. Certainly, I mean I've received all sorts of<br />
abuse and threats because essentially I supported a lot of what<br />
you said. But can you Bee it can be divisive in a community<br />
which is essentially British?<br />
PM: Well I don't think it is essentially British.<br />
MITCHELL: well historic.<br />
PM: I think it is now essentially Australian and I think<br />
Australians are tired of this sort of ambivalence and they<br />
want it's going to be very important to our economic future in<br />
the region, to the way we portray ourselves to the world in<br />
commerce, if the res~ t of the world knows we are clear about our<br />
identity. Who we are, what we are and that we're proud of<br />
ourselves and that we're not a derivative culture, that we don't<br />
belong to somebody else.<br />
MITCHELL: The Malaysian Prime Minister says that we tell lies<br />
and we're hard to (; et on with. Don't they understand this<br />
country? PM: Well I think there's probably, certainly in media terms, a<br />
cultural difference in the way in which these countries relate to<br />
their media, and that's a case of them understanding us and us<br />
understanding them I think.<br />
MITCHELL: How do we get the message across? It seems to have<br />
been going on for a long time and still...<br />
PM: I think that'sB right but I mean time will work that out I'm<br />
sure. </p>
<p>MITCHELL: Are -you comfortable with this sort of pride that wetre<br />
talking about in Australia, that we don't perhaps kowtow a little<br />
to people like m4alaysians Or the Indonesians?<br />
PM: I don't think we should kowtow to anybody.<br />
MITCHELLt Do you think we do or we have?<br />
PM: I don't think so, no.<br />
MITCHELL: We seem to apologise whenever our media does<br />
something.<br />
PH: No, what we've said is we disassociated ourselves, the<br />
Government disassociated itself from things which were<br />
inaccurate, but I think it's also important for these countries<br />
to understand that a free press is important, important to this<br />
country and important to them and to understand the morays of a<br />
free press. So I don't think it's a matter of we won't be<br />
tugging the forelock to anybody, Britain or anywhere else,<br />
Malaysia included.<br />
MITCHELL: How Izish are you?<br />
PM: Well my great grandfather was Irish.<br />
MITCHELL: I noticed Conrad Black last night on Four Corners<br />
suggesting that T1onyO'Reilly had been lobbying the Irish rump in<br />
the Labor Caucus.<br />
PHI And he did it pretty well.<br />
MITCHELL: And he did it with you?<br />
PM: Oh he did, he's a very charming fellow, Tony. Very<br />
charming.<br />
MITCHELL: Conrad Bla , ck also said that he believed that you would<br />
be receptive to expanding his holding beyond fifteen percent. Is<br />
that correct? too </p>
<p>PM: That's a matter of I think the Labor Caucus and the<br />
Treasurer, before I became Prime Minister decided on these levels<br />
and made a declaration, about them, made a public statement and<br />
let Mr Black's company buy fifteen percent of John Fairfax and<br />
Sons and said that would be as far as the Government was then<br />
prepared to go. I mean that's our position. I mean we're<br />
prepared to keep an open mind about it, to think about media<br />
policy, to think about print and to think about ownership, but<br />
not to be making any declarations about it.<br />
MITCHELL: So it could be reviewed, the fifteen percent?<br />
PM: Anything can hie reviewed on the application of a company to<br />
the Foreign Investment Review Board or to the Government. I mean<br />
in a sense that's always open but whether it'll be<br />
sympathetically responded to is a matter for our decision, and at<br />
the moment I think that's premature.<br />
MITCHELL: Across t~ o South Africa, what happens if there 18 a no<br />
vote in South Africa, what happens from Australia's point of view<br />
then? The referendum's being conducted this very minute.<br />
PM: Well let's wait and see I think, that's the best thing to<br />
do. I mean there's been great progress there. Let's hope that<br />
progress reflects itself in a Yes vote.<br />
MITCHELL: just quickly because I know you have to go, the<br />
performance in Parliament, your first week, you must've been<br />
pretty pleased with that.<br />
PM: Well yes but I mean the Opposition, Dr Hewson' s had an easy<br />
ride of it, for now two or three months he's become the easy<br />
rider in Australian politics and I'm sure he believed that<br />
because his Fightback package was not subject to attack,<br />
legitimate attack, that therefore the thing was beyond attack,<br />
and the fact is it's very vulnerable. Anything that wants to put<br />
a fifteen percent tai on the way in which Australians live has to<br />
be subject to examination and some of that examination started a<br />
couple of weeks ago.<br />
MITCHELL: But it was the same colleagues who failed to attack<br />
it, your colleagues. </p>
<p>-11-<br />
PM: Be that as it may, the fact is the Government'. now making<br />
it very clear whait's wrong with Fightback and the fact that it's<br />
basically limited, and when the Government brought down the One<br />
Nation statement which is now going to basically rebuild a lot Of<br />
the basic infrastruacture, which can only be done with government<br />
money, the railways, the ports, the national electricity grid,<br />
building up a TAFE system, all these things Australia needs but<br />
Dr Hewson says they're irresponsible. I don't think it's<br />
irresponsible to put kids that come out of year 12 and give them<br />
a technical and further education. I don't think it's<br />
irresponsible to build a standard gauge railway line from<br />
Melbourne to Adelaide, I don't think it's irresponsible to be<br />
able to carry freight from Brisbane to Perth, and this can not be<br />
done by taxing your Weetbix.<br />
MITCHELL: Graham Richardson says that you've exceeded his<br />
wildest dreams.<br />
PM: That's good, I'm pleased, very pleased.<br />
MITCHELL: He says that all he can find in the Caucus are<br />
backbenchers who claimed to have voted for you and he doesn't<br />
know why the vote was as close as it was.<br />
But there's two thiLngs I wonder whether you might've regretted.<br />
One is the burble burble burble.<br />
PM: No no, it was a sort of manifestation ! I mean that day Dr<br />
Hewson was Baying that the ABC was in conspiracy with the<br />
Teachers' Federation and the Labor Party and the Government to<br />
sort of undermine his party. As well as that he'd given the<br />
Central Bank Governor a bash on the way through, so I'm saying it<br />
was gibberish.<br />
MITCHELL: Yes but it's hardly very prime ministerial.<br />
PM: No but the fact that it was a physical manifestation of that<br />
gibberish, I was trying to demonstrate to people he may as well<br />
have been strumming his lips as saying what he said.<br />
MITCHELL: The other thing is mocking John Hewson' s speech<br />
impediment. is that sensible?<br />
PM: It's all part of the rough and tumble of politics, it's all<br />
part of the theatre of-it all. I've been mocked uphill and down<br />
dale, uphill and down dale. / 1 </p>
<p>-12-<br />
MITCHELL: How have they mocked you?<br />
PM: Over the years, mocked, I've been mocked forwards and<br />
backwards. MITCHELL: What for?<br />
PM: Well there's a great littany of things there, a great<br />
lit tany.<br />
MITCHELL; what sort of things do they mock you for? The suits<br />
and the rest of it?<br />
PM: Oh anything, your lifestyle things and all sorts of things.<br />
You know, I collect French clocks and this sort of stuff,, you<br />
know. MITCHELL: Does that irritate you?<br />
PM: It doesn't really, no.<br />
MITCHELL: You see I don't think John Hewson's objecting but 1:<br />
think the public's said well that's a bit rough. Do you think<br />
you'd do it again or it might be time to back off?<br />
PM: Oh no, look -the fact is he has the most sterile campaign of<br />
taking Australia back down the time tunnel to late seventies<br />
politics a la Margaret Thatcher. Don't worry about the elderly,<br />
don't worry about the sick, don't worry about the weak, don't.<br />
worry about the young, don't give them a place in TAFE, don't<br />
change the infra: 3tructure, what we'll do is tax our Weetbix and<br />
our Kellogs and our clothing and our drycleaning and that's going<br />
to change the woarld, shifting income from the low paid to the<br />
high paid. It's not a solution for Australia, he's not entitled<br />
to portray it as a solution for Australia and if he wants to push<br />
hard policies like if you're unemployed and you're on the dole<br />
after nine months you're on your own, you go down the soup<br />
kitchens, you go to the voluntary agencies. If he wants to push<br />
those sorts of vicious policies then I think the whole complexion<br />
of the policy<br />
MITCHELL: But we've got the soup kitchens now, I had in the<br />
studio yesterday a kid who sleeps in the boot of the car. Now<br />
this is from the ( Government that said no child in poverty by<br />
1990. -/ 13 </p>
<p>-13-<br />
PM: Yes, but you've still got an unemployment benefits system<br />
that you don't have in the United States. in the United States<br />
aft * er three months you'd huddle over a railway grate under a<br />
newspaper to keep warm. This is not true of Australia but it<br />
would be true under, Dr Rewson. Under Dr Hewson after nine months<br />
they're out so anyone who's unemployed, nine months the<br />
Government leaves you. Then its St Vincent de Paul, the Smith<br />
family or your relatives. Now we say that's not the sort of<br />
country Australia should be.<br />
MITCHELL: Mr Keating I know you have to go. Are you enjoying<br />
yourself? PM; Generally I ant Neil,, yes.<br />
MITCHELL: What don't you enjoy?<br />
PM: Not much about the Job really. I like most of the things.<br />
Like this morning I had the St Patricks Day breakfast and the<br />
opening at 3AW, now talking to you.<br />
MITCHELL: You have to get up early though.<br />
PM: That's okay.<br />
MITCHELL: Are you used to that yet?<br />
PM: I must confess I'm a late starter generally. I'm a nocturnal<br />
character, I perform better later but one bends as the breeze as<br />
the case may be. But look the prime ministership is a great<br />
opportunity for anybody. It's in a sense the greatest compliment<br />
anyone can be paid to be given the job and therefore I am going<br />
to do my best with it; and my interest has always been trying to<br />
push Australia along, to change it from the sort of post-war<br />
torpor we're in to become an international place, to keep that<br />
change going and in this case get out of the recession and keep<br />
that big structural change coming through.<br />
MITCHELL: Going to win the next election?<br />
PM: Well we're going to give it a good shot. We're behind but<br />
we're going to be -trying.<br />
MITCHELL: I keep saying one last thing. Bob Hawke, is he a bit<br />
of an embarrassment now?<br />
PM: No, no. </p>
<p>-14-<br />
MITCHELL: Doesn't worry you when he goes to the Logies and goes<br />
overseas and does interviews?<br />
