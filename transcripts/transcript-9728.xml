PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION, NATIONAL PRESS CLUB, THURSDAY, 24<br />
AUGUST 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Q: Tony Wright, Sydney Morning Herald. Prime Minister, is it still your view as you stated a<br />
few weeks ago that the Western Australian Royal Commission doesn't matter a tinkers<br />
cuss? Will the Government continue to try to ignore the fallout from that Royal<br />
Commission and would it ignore a finding that Dr Carmen Lawrence lied about her role in<br />
the Penny Easton affair?<br />
PM: Well, the Liberal Party have got Carmen Lawrence on trial for the suicide of Penny<br />
Easton, that is what is on here. You know it is on. It is unjust and it is immoral and we are<br />
not going to be any part of it.<br />
Q: Jenny Hewett, the Australian Financial Review. Do you think it is politically acceptable for<br />
a Minister to lie? Is there a question of morality or ethics involved or is it what you can get<br />
away with politically?<br />
PM: I think, I hope, probity in public life and integrity in public life are the stock and the core<br />
things about public life and as I have just said to you, all honesty and integrity in politics<br />
starts with policy not tricky, slick statements by politicians at doorstops. But, if the<br />
imputation of your question is that Carmen Lawrence is untruthful or has lied, you have<br />
prejudged her and not even given her the opportunity unfairly of you to put her view.<br />
Q: Lenore Taylor, The Australian. You spoke in your speech a lot about marketing and<br />
products. John Howard has been outpolling you by and large in recent months, even<br />
without a product. How do you explain that? Why don't you think the voters are focussing<br />
on the product, they seem to be agreeing with his marketing even without policies<br />
released yet?<br />
PM: I don't think you should jump to conclusions about the polls. I honestly think they vote on<br />
policy. The Government has won five successive elections. We have won them all<br />
basically on policy. We won 1984, after our first election, on the huge changes to<br />
economic policy between 1983 and the end of 1984. We won in 1987 because we were<br />
responding to the worst terms of trade Australia had enjoyed since the great depression.<br />
A huge change to fiscal policy, a huge reorientation of national savings. That is why we<br />
won. We won with the May Statement of 1987 and two months later we won an election<br />
with it. We won in 1990 because we had given Australians the growth phase and the<br />
employment that we promised them. We trebled the rate of employment growth that the<br />
Coalition was able to provide over its seven years of office. We won in 1993 because of<br />
the changes I have mentioned One Nation, the commitment I gave as Prime Minister to<br />
restart growth and employment. We won because of the commitment to those age old<br />
Australian values of egalitarianism and fairness. We won because we had a view of<br />
Australia which was the view of the enlargers of Australia and not the straighteners and </p>
<p>punishes. And we will win next time because the Labor Party alone has the capacity to<br />
change Australian inexorably, to give it a long run low inflation period of growth, to see it<br />
adopt a productivity culture, a savings culture and to give it a place in the Asia-Pacific the<br />
Liberal's could not even have conceived of.<br />
They are the things that win elections and while, no doubt, the public always like to think<br />
they have got a choice in their opposing party's leadership, particularly after the<br />
disappointment of Mr Downer and the then rush, the lift and the buoyancy of the poll<br />
support which Mr Howard has got, it is gradually coming off and it will come off most<br />
obviously on election day.<br />
Q: Ian Davis, The Canberra Times. The Reserve Bank said in its annual report yesterday,<br />
despite improvements in public and household savings Australia still needs to improve its<br />
savings performance, lift living standards to improve. Does the-Government accept that it<br />
needs to go further in improving national savings? Is renewed tax reform part of this<br />
necessary equation?<br />
PM: No, I don't think so. I think what the Bank was referring to was a need to cut back on such<br />
things as double dipping and superannuation, through the need for tighter preservation<br />
rules and access to lump sums, these sorts of things. Over time, of course, with the<br />
remedial changes we have in place the grandfathening provisions from the pre-1983<br />
changes, those were in place, a need to continue to deliver on the budget balance. That<br />
means we will have a budget balance in place as the Reserve Bank report notes, but need<br />
to keep it there and that is a message not only to the Government, but to the Opposition<br />
and the Senate. I think, the need for the Senate to support the Government's fiscal<br />
tightening strategy, I think, that is another very clear imputation or implication of the report.<br />
I have already mentioned in the speech that superannuation is going to be worth about<br />
four per cent of GDP in savings. The budget balance will have shifted from last year over<br />
the next two years by about four per cent of GDP. That is eight per cent. Alright, it is in<br />
an up-cycle. Knock one or two out of it if you like for an underlying number and we are<br />
looking at a six percentage point savings change to deal with what, a 1.5 percentage point<br />
problem? We have had the current account deficit running at about 4.5 per cent of GDP.<br />
It is stable at about 3 or just under. So we have got a 6 percentage point fix in for a<br />
percentage point problem. I think the Governor and the Bank are right to say to the<br />
nation, to say to the political system, keep your eye on the public sector. And also, keep<br />
your eye on the big change in occupational superannuation.<br />
Q: Alan Sunderland, SBS TV. Mr Keating, you have said that the next election will be won on<br />
policy. Do you think that your Government needs to come out with a major new policy<br />
statement, an economic statement or some sort of other big picture, non risk averse<br />
package before the next campaign, or do you think you will fight and win the next election,<br />
essentially, on the sort of policy mix you have outlined?<br />
PM: It is hard to get the signals from you. You are telling me big statements don't work and<br />
then you are saying maybe we need one. This has been the government of change in the<br />
post-war years. From 1983 until now we have changed Australia to make it an<br />
internationally competitive country. Look at those numbers we mentioned. We are 40 per<br />
cent more competitive today than we were in 1983. Not four. Forty. We have had a<br />
per cent increase in household disposable income in the period. We have had a 20 per<br />
cent increase in household income per capita. -We have seen exports grow from 13 per<br />
cent of GDP to 22 per cent of GDP. We have seen over two million jobs created. We<br />
have seen 680,000 jobs in two and a half years. It took us from 1788 until 1983 to get to<br />
six million and we have added over ten per cent of that in two and a half years. We have<br />
created a complete culture of change in productivity in the country, a change of attitude in<br />
the industrial workplace on the part of unions, on the part of managers, of businesses.<br />
We found ourselves a place in Asia that Australia of the past had never had before. It has<br />
come from a Labor Government and we will keep on doing it. </p>
<p>Now, having pulled the sock inside out, I don't know whether you want me to pull it back<br />
the other way. That could happen of course, we could go to sleep again, we could put the<br />
tariff wall up, we could run the flag up and ask people what they think about higher tariffs.<br />
If they don't like it run it down slightly again. We can hang on the monarchy. We can do<br />
the Native Title Act in. We can refuse to talk to the General-Secretary of the Vietnamese<br />
Communist Party even though the US Secretary of State is quite happy to speak with him.<br />
We can turn our back on the region and we can go back to sleep. We can do all that by<br />
electing John Howard.<br />
Q: Glenn Milne, Seven Network. You accused, I'm not sure wether it was us before or the<br />
Opposition, of prejudging Carmen Lawrence by suggesting that she should have her day<br />
before the Royal Commission. Does this mean that you are effectively suspending<br />
judgement on her version of events until she testifies or do you believe that Carmen<br />
Lawrence is telling the truth?<br />
PM: I can always rely on you to keep on the main game, Glenn. There is only one clear<br />
message here. The Liberal Party have Carmen Lawrence on trail for the suicide of Penny<br />
Easton. That is what it is about. And that can't be made to stick. I notice just a day or so<br />
ago we had a reference from the person who has been her chief accuser in a sense,<br />
within the former government or if not chief accuser one of them, her former deputy, he<br />
said I couldn't pin down any direct relationship between the death of Penny Easton and<br />
the petition, no one will ever be able to do that.' Her mother, Barbara Campbell, went on<br />
to say these things what about the suicide note, Mrs Campbell?', The questioner says<br />
the section that has been published in the media refers to the petition, but there was<br />
more to it I gather? Does that offer any clues to a suicide? " Oh yes, it offers an awful lot"<br />
says Mrs Campbell. Other clues beyond the petition?' " Oh yes, definitely. I mean the<br />
background, the family court. She mentioned the family court needed to be looked at. I<br />
mean, you know there is also the case that we are all accused falsely of committing<br />
perjury in the family court, that these are issues to be looked at'. ' Beyond the petition<br />
itself?' ' Yes, definitely. I mean, there was bankruptcy proceedings and all sorts of things.<br />
She was still there when she died. There was a High Court hearing still to be had on who<br />
had precedence the bankruptcy court or the family court. ' So, her life had become very<br />
confused' says the questioner ' lots of things apparently going wrong, things drawn out,<br />
she felt brought this all about. So the petition was just one factor? Mrs Campbell ' Yes,<br />
definitely". Now, we have had the Liberal Party, under Mr Howard's leadership yesterday accusing<br />
her of Penny Easton's suicide. No such link, I think, can be made. If the petition has no<br />
established link to her suicide what is the point of the Royal Commission? What is the<br />
relevance of it at all? At all? Other than who said what to whom in a former Cabinet three<br />
years ago. And that is why, in the end, if people want to go chasing down motives for the<br />
death of people we have processes, we have coroners inquiries and then we have the<br />
courts. But these things can't be resolved in a Royal Commission which is not even<br />
looking at, on the expression of the Royal Commissioner, the actual suicide or the motive<br />
for it itself. So what therefore is the relevance of the inquiry.<br />
Q: Niki Savva, Herald-Sun. Would you as leader tolerate the tabling of a petition containing<br />
details of a Family Court matter, in order to embarrass a political opponent?<br />
PM: Well the answer is I wouldn't. No, I wouldn't. I wouldn't anymore than I would let MPs in<br />
my Party stand under the privilege of Parliament and accuse somebody of being<br />
principally at blame for the suicide of somebody as John Howard did yesterday. But can I<br />
just say to you that on that theme, I think that I don't think I would agree either that<br />
Mr Lightfoot, who was among the first who raised this in the Western Australian<br />
Parliament, who said this " Is the Premier aware the two passports of Mr Brian Easton, the<br />
Commissioner of the Western Australian Public Service, had been confiscated by the<br />
Federal Court? Has Mr Easton sustained his resignation? If so, on what date did he<br />
resign? Is he to receive an ex gratia or severance payment exceeding normal public </p>
<p>service regulated payments?" He goes on. And the answer says this " I am asking you for<br />
confirmation." The then Premier says " I know Mr Easton is passing through some marital<br />
problems at the present time and I suppose that is another story, but it may have<br />
something to do with that. I hesitate to say that because I do not know. I have no doubt<br />
that if he will not provide the identity of the MP that the MP will not provide the identity<br />
of the avenue through which the information is coming, it will be disclosed in the next<br />
week or so." I wouldn't approve of that either. Could I also say that I endorse the<br />
sentiments of the then Speaker, who said this " I refer Members to certain Questions<br />
Without Notice which were asked by the Member for Murchison Eyre on Tuesday of this<br />
week. It has been suggested that those questions were based on information concerning<br />
proceedings before the Family Court. The lease of this information may well have been<br />
unlawful. The point that does concern me, however, is whether the privilege of the<br />
freedom of the House might be being used to circumvent an explicit order of a court or a<br />
written law of this country. Obviously it makes a mockery of observing a subjudice<br />
convention if the House tolerates or encourages speeches or questions aimed at<br />
subverting an order or rule given in an appropriate court. Likewise, this Parliament should<br />
not permit its privileges to be used to circumvent the written law of the Commonwealth<br />
aimed at protecting the personal privacy of citizens." That is in response to a number of<br />
issues related to this marital separation and difficulty made by members of the Liberal<br />
Party beginning with Richard Court. I wouldn't approve of those either. But, hence, Mr<br />
Easton's petition and the tabling of it, which refers to some of these matters about what<br />
money he was to receive, how can you take the view with any justice that in some way all<br />
of the burden of the pressure of this issue has come via that petition and then take the<br />
further view that it came at the behest of Carmen Lawrence? I mean the Liberal Party<br />
started using Family Court material in the Western Australian Parliament. The beginner<br />
was Richard Court, followed consistently by a number of MPs and they were rebuked by<br />
the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. And even after the petition I think was lodged,<br />
or about the same time, in 1989 there was a further reference by one of the MPs in the<br />
Legislative Council. Mr Masters on the 9th May 1989 " which former employees of the<br />
Western Australian Development Corporation, EXIM, received a payment from the<br />
Government or EXIM following their employment with WADC or EXIM for services<br />
rendered to either a subsidiary or some other Government Department." If you read the<br />
petition from Mr Easton it refers to these matters and the Liberal Party were in this right up<br />
to their neck. I mean where have you been living? Under a rock? Don't you read?<br />
Q: Randal Markey, The West Australian.<br />
PM: Oh it is such a high toned publication.<br />
Q: Earlier in an answer to a question you were saying it would be unfair to prejudge Carmen<br />
Lawrence and deny her the-opportunity to put her side of her story to the Royal<br />
Commission. Doesn't it say that it must flow from that that you will accept and abide by<br />
the findings of that Royal Commission. Otherwise, if not, the Government is contradicting<br />
itself because on the one hand you are saying that Dr Lawrence deserves her day in court<br />
to put her side of the case. And on the other you are saying that you will not commit<br />
yourself to abide by its findings.<br />
PM: Let me correct the question. It is not her day in court. It is not a court.<br />
Q: Her day in the Commission then?<br />
PM: The relevance of the reference to the Commissioner if Penny Easton had not<br />
committed suicide there would, of course, be no inquiry and yet the Commissioner made<br />
very clear, very clear indeed, that he was not about, and his terms of reference were not<br />
about, any inquiry into the motives or circumstances of Penny Easton's suicide.<br />
So, therefore, in both real and political terms the terms of reference lack all relativity to the<br />
event and, therefore, lack political relativity. </p>
<p>Q: Tony Vermeer, AAP. The Reserve Bank yesterday warned about the dangers that<br />
inflation may be on the march again and you said after the Budget that the Budget had<br />
taken the pressure off interest rates. Do you now acknowledge that the pressure is back<br />
on and can your Government win an election with interest rates higher than they are now?<br />
PM: I don't think you can conclude from the report at all that the pressure is back on. In fact, I<br />
think the last line of the report, if I can go to it, says " The balancing of these and other<br />
risks for activity and prices will be the key focus for monetary policy over the coming year.<br />
In the Bank's judgement policy is presently well positioned to respond as necessary to the<br />
evolving economic situation." It " is presently well positioned". So you can't adduce from<br />
that the imputation I think you were making there. And the Bank make a couple of other<br />
points: it says " The incorporation of the 2-3 per cent inflation objective into the Accord<br />
Mark VIII agreement", which is a very welcome endorsement of that objective, " should be<br />
helpful in this regard". That is, holding inflation. So there are any number of references of<br />
that kind and, of course, you know on some other general points, some very strong<br />
references to the public sector saving, a reference to a change in the trend of dis-saving<br />
by private individuals. I mean there is not much in the report the Government wouldn't<br />
endorse.<br />
Q: Bruce Juddery, Freelance. Prime Minister I would like to get back to your speech if we<br />
may and more particularly to a couple of omissions from it. You went through many of the<br />
achievements of the Government. You didn't mention the efforts the Government has<br />
made to transform higher education from an elite to a mass system and your own<br />
initiatives which came out over the last couple of years to add to that dimension through<br />
technical and further education. As you will appreciate, although a lot more money has<br />
gone into higher education in particular over the years, there are people who would argue<br />
like the Vice Chancellors Committee and others have argued that okay you have said<br />
you can take so many more students, but then you haven't given them enough money to<br />
[ inaudible] but the challenge the clever country is being fallen short of because you are<br />
not providing for research infrastructure and lots and lots of other things that they<br />
complain about, which we won't go through now because we haven't got all afternoon. Is<br />
there any chance of an improvement or a rejigging of the lot of technical and further<br />
education and higher education between now and the next election?<br />
PM: An improvement in<br />
Q: In the lot of higher education. What is going to happen in the Innovation Statement which<br />
will impact on higher education and technical and further?<br />
PM: Okay. Well let me approach the issue this way. You know that about 40 per cent of the<br />
completions in secondary education, 40 per cent of those students who have gone<br />
through to higher education. That has been the pattern in Australia, roughly. But, of<br />
course, when the completions were a small number, it meant that higher education was a<br />
relatively elitist thing. What the Government has done is to improve the access and,<br />
therefore, the equity of education to get those completions up and we now have them to<br />
around 8 in 10 students. They were 3 1/ 2, from memory, in 10 in 1983. So it is a<br />
revolution in participation in education. But we have kept up the 40 per cent largely<br />
throughput by adding places to higher education. We have added, I think, just on<br />
275,000 places. We had 350,000 people in higher education in the early 1980s, we<br />
have now got just on 600,000. We have created the equivalent of about 20 universities<br />
of a campus size the same as Sydney or Melbourne University. So it is a huge change.<br />
One of the things that pleases me greatly is there is an increased participation by young<br />
women, in both secondary education and higher education.<br />
But the other thing, of course, we had in One Nation was the Australian National Training<br />
Authority, the renaissance of technical and further education building a national TAFE<br />
system to sit beside the Universities. Because this has always been the Cinderella of<br />
Australian education. That is, for the 60% who did not gain access to higher education, </p>
<p>they cascaded into a system without training. And basically, what we are doing now is<br />
rapidly growing the TAFE system to pick those people up. And in fact we had more<br />
people apply for entry into TAFE last year than we had apply for higher education,<br />
because there is often closer job prospects and job relevance, and a closer profile with<br />
the labour market, with vocational education, than is the case with higher education. So,<br />
we are.-hoping to have 2 mature competent systems. And, of course, in that we have<br />
had generous payments for students, HECS has revolutionised participation in university<br />
every HECS dollar goes back into places. Every HECS dollar goes back into places.<br />
And, as a consequence, I think our education policies remain, now, the foundation of the<br />
modem Australian society and industry, of our thrust into Asia, of our future.<br />
Q: Sid Maher from the Courier Mail newspaper. Just with the election approaching, I was<br />
just wondering if you are guaranteeing, sort of Acts of God notwithstanding whether<br />
you will stay around for the full term of the next Parliament if you are re-elected?<br />
PM: I'll see you off the course, old son. If we could have a slow time-frame camera at these<br />
tables and this lectern, you would see me aging gracefully and most of you disappearing.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, Malcolm Farr from the Telegraph Mirror. Back to interest rates, and your<br />
appeal for endurance from voters. The low inflation recovery is restricting the capital<br />
gain that many home-owners can expect on their property and many of those homeowners<br />
are mortgage holders but there is no equal and opposite reaction from low<br />
inflation in terms of interest rates. In fact, people are paying something like more than 3<br />
times underlying interest rates for their mortgages how long do you expect them to<br />
endure that? And as you were asked before, do you think you can go to an election with<br />
that situation still in place?<br />
PM: Well, Malcolm, I think if you draw a line through, let's say, the most.. . the property market<br />
which has probably put on more value over time than any of that is the Sydney property<br />
market, and if you take that over 20 years, I would be surprised if it does much more than<br />
keep pace with inflation. I am sure you will see a great shift in values, 2 or 3 years, or<br />
every 6 or 7 years, and then it stops. It drops, it drops, and then it levels back out. So I<br />
don't know if people will whether people beat inflation anyway. That's the first thing, and<br />
the second thing is during the periods of high inflation, the housing interest rates have<br />
been much higher than what they are now. And we have got housing interest rates<br />
roughly around 10% some are lower, of course. But they were 15-16% some higher.<br />
And, of course, in the days when you had cocktail loans, you had some of them even<br />
greater again you would have x% at 14-15%, and then you would have a lump at<br />
So, there has been a big increase in disposable income, coming off those falls in interest<br />
rates over the last few years, and, you know, as the sustenance of low inflation becomes<br />
obvious and endemic to Australia, the whole view of the capital markets both here and<br />
abroad start to change about the premium the nation pays for its savings. So you are<br />
getting up with a better result in other words, a lower risk premium, if you like.<br />
And so I think.... . and the other thing I think most Australians also care about their<br />
children about what happens to their housing. I think it is a big issue with people. And<br />
the system we had, of high inflation, was building mortgages and values for them that<br />
essentially enslaved them for all their working life. You know, trying to buy their first<br />
home in the prospects of ever-increasing housing prices. Affordability we have seen<br />
very stark increases in affordability in the last couple of years, and I think this is a very<br />
good social trend it's not a bad social trend, it's a unambiguously good social trend. But<br />
I just also see I think it was in the Herald today that someone in the real estate sector<br />
saying medium property prices in Sydney are lifting. I mean, these things will go on, but<br />
whether over time if you wash the inflation out... . if you wash the inflation through, they do<br />
better than inflation I don't know. But the point is having a roof over your head not<br />
having a lump of inflation over your head, because that ends up meaning having an<br />
inflationary mortgage over your head. So I think there is no low inflation is an<br />
unambiguously good thing for Australia it will give us higher real incomes, higher </p>
<p>employment and a higher standard of living than we have ever been able to obtain<br />
during the periods of high inflation.<br />
Q: John Ferguson from the Adelaide Advertiser, Prime Minister. Did Sir William Deane's<br />
views on the republic influence your decision to back his appointment, and was the issue<br />
discussed at that meeting prior to his appointment?<br />
PM: I have never discussed the republic with him. Not ever. We have never discussed it.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, Alison Carabine from Radio 2UE. There is probably little doubt that the<br />
Penny Easton affair has caused problems for the Government what's your assessment<br />
of the damage? And secondly, did you encourage Carmen Lawrence to bring forward<br />
her appearance before the Royal Commission, to try and limit that damage?<br />
PM: I think she takes the view that I mean, I think her appearance before the Commission<br />
can be answered this way she takes the view that there is a sequence about her<br />
appearance, and that it is fairly difficult to ask of her, to appear, to rely on information<br />
that basically should be provided in the first instance by the petitioner, by the person who<br />
presented the petition, and the Clerk of the Upper House who drafted it. Now, one would<br />
think that was a logical starting point for such an inquiry. And not unreasonably, I think<br />
she wants to follow those people through the inquiry, relying upon not what she knows<br />
and hearsay, but the actual evidence they provide.<br />
Q: Paul Bongiomno, Network 10, Prime Minister. While I accept that the Easton Royal<br />
Commission has all the appearances of a political witchhunt, which is given potency by<br />
the death of Penny Easton, isn't the problem for you and your Government and I would<br />
suggest dynamite for Carmen Lawrence is that at this point of time, 8 of her former<br />
colleagues contradict her recollection? So that on the balance of public probabilities, for<br />
fair-minded people looking at it, Carmen Lawrence's credibility is in tatters?<br />
PM: But what was the word I can't remember you used about the 8?<br />
PB: Recollection?<br />
PM: Yes recollection. But a recollection about what?<br />
PB: About when a Cabinet meeting was held, and what was discussed at it?<br />
PM: But the outcome of which was what?<br />
PB: Well, the outcome was that I think it was about 5 days later....<br />
PM: No the outcome wasn't an established link to the suicide of Penny Easton.<br />
PB: I accept that. But...<br />
PM: Right. If you accept that, well let me answer it from there if you accept that, then...<br />
PB: . but Carmen Lawrence told the Parliament 3 days later something different?<br />
PM: Hang on you asked the question. Once you accept that, you must accept the next<br />
point the logical point of that that the discussion doesn't have a causal connection or<br />
relevance to the suicide. And once you accept that, it is basically a set of recollections<br />
by people about a Cabinet meeting that has in the broad politic no particular<br />
relevance, and where honest people have different recollections, and where the person<br />
herself has not yet had the opportunity to put a view.<br />
ends. </p>
