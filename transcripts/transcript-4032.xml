N. F76/ 8<br />
FOR PRESS 21 January 1976<br />
HONOURS, MUSICAL SALUTES AND THE TITLE ' COMMONWEALTH'<br />
The practice of recommending Australian citizens for awards<br />
under the British honours system is to be resumed when the<br />
necessary machinery is established.<br />
The British honours will not affect or replace awards under the<br />
Order of Australia which will continue to be made.<br />
The Government has also decided to resume the use, for internal<br />
purposes, of the titles ' Commonwealth of Australia' and<br />
' Commonwealth Government'. The titles ' Australia' and<br />
' Australian Government' will continue to be used abroad and<br />
in relations with foreign countries.<br />
The Governor General has'agreed that ' God Save the Queen' should<br />
be reinstated as the Salute for all vice-regal occasions.<br />
In conformity with this general arrangement Defence Force bands<br />
are being directed to play ' God Save the Queen on these<br />
as well as on royal occasions.<br />
On other occasions involving Defence Force bands organisers<br />
can exercise a choice between the following musical salutes:<br />
God Save the Queen<br />
Advance Australia Fair<br />
Waltzing Matilda<br />
Song of Australia ./ 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
Ultimately, after some form of popular consultation, one<br />
of these compositions will be selected as the appropriate<br />
National Anthem for ceremonial occasions, such as at the<br />
Olympic Games. </p>
