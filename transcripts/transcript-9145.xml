Today's meeting of the Economic Planning Advisory Council ( EPAC)<br />
provided timely input to the Government's deliberations on its forthcoming<br />
employment White Paper.<br />
The White Paper will be released on 28 April and will incorporate policies to<br />
encourage job growth and to address the particular difficulties faced by the<br />
long-term unemployed. The White Paper will also address the two related<br />
areas of Industy policy and regional development.<br />
The Prime Minister will chair a special committee of Cabinet to develop<br />
policies and programs for the White Paper. The committee will include the<br />
Deputy Prime Minister, Brian Howe, the Treasurer, Ralph Willis, the Minister<br />
for Finance, Kim Beazley, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional<br />
Development, Senator Peter Cook, the Minister for Employment, Education<br />
and Training, Simon Crean, the Minister for Social Security, Peter Baldwin,<br />
and the Minister for Industrial Relations, Laurie Brereton.<br />
The meeting of EPAC today was devoted to issues central to the White<br />
Paper. Discussion focussed on two major reports that were released last<br />
December as well as presentations on two studies commissioned by the<br />
Government that are in the process of being finalised.<br />
The Report of the Committee on Employment Opportunities, Restoring Full<br />
Employment. was introduced by Committee members Professor Bob Gregory<br />
and Mary Ann O'Loughlin and the head of the associated task force, Meredith<br />
Edwards. The Chairman of the Task Force on Regional Development, Bill Kelty,<br />
introduced the report of his task force.<br />
The issue of regional development is also being addressed in the McKinsey<br />
and Co study of Firms' Regional Location Decisions. Michael Rennie and<br />
Rob Mallick from McKinseys presented some of their preliminary findings to<br />
the meeting. </p>

Timothy Sims presented preliminary results from the L. E. K. Partnership study<br />
on Services Exports. This study highlights the fact that in the same way that<br />
exports of manufactures have been growing rapidly in recent years, services<br />
exports have also demonstrated rapid growth and it identifies some of the<br />
driving forces behind that growth.<br />
The Government is pleased to have had this opportunity to discuss these<br />
reports with their authors and the representatives of State and local<br />
governments, business, trade unions, the rural sector, welfare and other<br />
community organisations.<br />
