TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JOHN SHOVELAN, ABC ' AM' PROGRAM<br />
18 AUGUST 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
JS:-Prime Minister, thanks for your valuable time. The President of the<br />
ACTU, Martin Ferguson, has said of the Budget, don't ask me to<br />
defend the indefensible. Do you think you have got it all wrong?<br />
PM: Well, I can't understand. Are you sure you are not quoting him out of<br />
context'? You are not talking about one measure, maybe? That is an<br />
inexplicable comment to me about a B3udget which delivers to his<br />
constituency in the area of $ 20, 000 to $ 50,00 primary tax cuts worth<br />
$ 3.8 billion in a full year, starting in November, I1V weeks from now.<br />
is.-Well he went on to say that there was elation in the Labor movement<br />
on 13 March, but not the same sense after this Budget.<br />
PM: Well that's, I think, a remark he can't defend. This Budget is a sound<br />
Budget in economic terms, it is a sound Budget in social terms, it gives<br />
expression to all the Government's election committments on things<br />
such as, the home-child care allowance, which is a payment to women<br />
with dependent children to women, mainly; the seniors health card; a<br />
generalised rebate for child-care; enormous increase in the expansion<br />
of our labour market programs to half a million -that's half a million<br />
people will be touched, those who are unemployed, under the labour<br />
market programs. By which measure would you say this is not<br />
something which is Labor to the bootstraps?<br />
JS: Well, I dare say the first thing that people would point to would be the<br />
increase in petrol taxes.<br />
PM: The increase in petrol. taxes are there, but they are there because the<br />
indirect tax base has ben falling to pieces over the last few years,<br />
with customs duty coming down, with Bass Strait running down, but<br />
what's there let me just make this clear the tax cuts pay back $ 3.8<br />
billion in the full year, this revenue in any of these years when it is fully<br />
up and running raised $ 3 billion. So, by any measure this Budget is </p>
<p>i r-L 2<br />
returning tax revenue, particularly to those people who the ACTU<br />
would cl aim to represent.<br />
J S Well what about the lowest income earners who will win the $ 100<br />
rebate, is that sufficient, do you think, to compensate them fully for the<br />
increases in direct taxes and the petrol excise?<br />
PM: It is the equivalent to the tax cut someone would get on $ 23, 000.<br />
JS: So they wouldn't be any worse off?<br />
PM: We are taking the $ 23,000 tax cut, and we are running it back through<br />
those lower deciles. But remember this, John, all through the<br />
when I was Treasurer and I negotiated wage tax agreements with the<br />
ACTU, they were always pushed below $ 20,000. That was, the tax<br />
cuts when 1 first became Treasurer in 1983, the bottom rate of tax was<br />
per cent, it is now 20 per cent. And the tax free threshold was<br />
$ 4,700, it is now $ 5,400. As well as that we have supplementary<br />
payments for low paid workers, we had the family allowance<br />
supplement, all, in the main, chopping in way under $ 20,000. The key<br />
to this Budget is, to give the people who have not had that kind of<br />
success in Budget rounds in the past. And that is middle Australia,<br />
between $ 20,000 and $ 50, 000. So, what we need to do here was to<br />
cover off the kind of tax cut that someone would recieve at $ 23,000<br />
and spread that down with a rebate under $ 23,000, but then provide<br />
the tax relief from $ 20,500 up to $ 50,000. And that is $ 8.00 to $ 10.00<br />
a week for someone around average weekly earnings.<br />
JS: Well you are going to have to deal with the Democrats to get this<br />
Budget through. Now, Cheryl Kemnot, last night said that she thought<br />
the $ 100. 00 rebate was totally inadequate for low income earners.<br />
PM: Well, let me just say this. Let's get some perspective on this. This<br />
Government has been in office now 10, going on 11, years. In 10 of<br />
those 11 years we have focussed most of these tax cuts below<br />
average weekly earnings. The Family Allowance Supplement, below<br />
average weekly earnings. Most of these supporting measures..<br />
people are not entitled to look at this in terms of one year and anyone<br />
who does, it is a commentary on their lack of experience or<br />
understanding in what has preceded it in the earlier years.<br />
JS-What about, though, the fact that you with the petrol tax, it is the low<br />
income earners who drives around in the old car, in the old bomb, they<br />
are the ones who can't afford to buy the new car, aren't they getting it<br />
through the neck here? Firstly, their car is going to be worth less from<br />
tonight, and it is going to cost them an awful lot more at the bowser.<br />
PM:-But look, the point is that we have got one of the lowest petrol prices,<br />
we are the third lowest petrol price in the world. And even with these<br />
Increases we will still be the third lowest petrol price in the world, and<br />
10 mu : 1 14U UUL VL1 tik-</p>
<p>we are giving people substantial tax cuts to meet these things. To<br />
more then meet them, that's the point.<br />
JS: There's not much difference between what you are giving them, and<br />
what you are taking away.<br />
PM: What is paid in tax cuts goes often to a different group of people that<br />
are paying some of the other taxes, because business is picking up<br />
some of the other taxation,<br />
JS: So you maintain despite the increase in the wholesales tax and petrol<br />
excise, that you have kept faith with the electorate?<br />
PM: Absolutely. Because at their full year effects the tax cuts cost $ 3.8<br />
billion and the revenue costs $ 3 billion, at their full year effects. And<br />
on top of that all the Governments election committments 100 of<br />
them, listed in the booklet which is attached as part of the Budget<br />
papers in the things that I mentioned to you, like the seniors health<br />
card, the labour market programs, the home-child care allowance, the<br />
generallsed child-care rebate, all of these things are fully implemented.<br />
JS: Last night's Buget offers no real relief for the unemployed, does it? I<br />
mean, there is no suggestion at all that the unemployment rate is going<br />
to come down, in fact it is going to increase slightly in the next year.<br />
PM: It is not going to increase. It is coming off an average unemployment<br />
rate of 11 to 10 3/ 4.<br />
JS: But last week it was 10.7 and now we are looking at 1 0.75.<br />
PM:-That is only a week, though, that is only a month. I mean, we have<br />
been looking at 11, 11.4, 11.3 and we have got in here 10 3/ 4. But we<br />
have also got in there futher expenditure on labour market programs,<br />
which as I said earlier will touch about half a million of those<br />
unemployed. That is, give them training and get them back to work,<br />
and as well as that we have got the discussion paper we hope leads to<br />
a white paper on employment and unemployment to see if we can<br />
devise even more novel ways of reaching those people who are longtermed<br />
unemployed. But the key to employment, John, is growth. We<br />
have got a conservative forecast here. The growth for the year to the<br />
last quarter was 3.3 per cent. For the coming year we have got 2.75<br />
per cent.<br />
JS: So, you think you will get that easy?<br />
PM: I think we will get that easily.<br />
JS: And does that mean then that the 10 3/ 4 unemployment rate is higher<br />
then </p>
<p>rlLA-,--IQ H U. U UZ r. U 4, VU<br />
4<br />
PMV: And what it may mean, as that growth picks up, then the prospects for<br />
employment will of course be better, but the forecasts are our best<br />
estimates, and 10 3/ 4 is what we have in. But the key to employment<br />
is growth, and the economy is now growing and the key point about the<br />
tax cuts Is that there Is an extra $ 2 billion stimulus in there to keep<br />
there to keep the economy moving. You remember in the ' One Nation'<br />
package I introduced in February 1992 most of that spending has<br />
occurred in the last six months. That is now playing a very substantial<br />
role in kicking growth along, that is part of that 3.3 we saw last week.<br />
You add to that another $ 2 billion stimulus from the tax cuts and we<br />
hope then the economy will start to really roll and we will start to see<br />
the growth. In other words the tax cuts are doing two things they are<br />
giving justice to middle Australia by cutting that middle rate from 38<br />
cents to 34 cents and they are providing a necessary stimulus at the<br />
right time to keep economic growth going.<br />
JS: Prime Minister, the hard headed financial markets are likely to be<br />
disappointed with the amount of cuts from outlays. Does this Budget<br />
show a shift in the Government's thinking, like away from cutting<br />
outlays and possibly Increasing taxes, are we looking at a change?<br />
PM: If you wash the unemployment benefits out of the outlays in other<br />
words If you take the cyclical component of the outlays and look at this<br />
underlying structure, structural outlays they are at early 1970 levels.<br />
Anybody who says we should be cutting our outlays further Is an<br />
extremist. I say that advisedly, an extremist. This is one of the lowest<br />
spending governments in the world and next month, as the Treasurer<br />
has said, when the OECD figures are released it will show Australia as<br />
the lowest taxed country in the western world Australia has the lowest<br />
rate of revenue to GDP, the lowest taxed country in the western world<br />
and our outlays are similar. All these highly paid characters on<br />
newspapers who wander around and want to slip into people's<br />
pensions and supporting parents benefit and Medicare so that they<br />
can argue that we should be cutting outlays back to pre-Whitlam<br />
government levels in structural terms are extremist and not to be taken<br />
notice of.<br />
JS: Mr Keating, you were one of the people that heard the inflation stick<br />
snap first..<br />
PM: I wasn't one of the first people to hear it, I snapped it. I carried the<br />
burden for the recession and the high interest rates. The government,<br />
when I was Treasurer, walked off with the accolade of breaking the<br />
back of Australian inflation after two decades and that is why we have<br />
now got interest rates, overnight cash rates at the Reserve Bank, at<br />
4.75 per cent the lowest interest rates in twenty years.<br />
JS: Aren't these tax increases going to rebuild that stick though? We are<br />
looking at an inflation rate of 3 3.5 per cent next year. </p>
<p>PM: No, but an underlying rate with a two in front of it, that is the key point<br />
John.<br />
JS: But it does not take much to kick Australia off on an inflation binge<br />
does it, and never has?<br />
PM; There has been a lot of asset deflation around. People, I think, have<br />
learned their lesson and there is a lot of productivity around protecting<br />
the inflation rate. Can I just say as a matter of digression, one of the<br />
things in the media we have had over the years, people have said and<br />
particularly years ago in the late 1980s, when we had a lot of growth<br />
and a lot of employment and I used to say look at the employment we<br />
have 90,000 a month or 105,000, and they would say oh yeah, yeah<br />
Treasurer, but tell us about inflation and the current account. Now we<br />
are telling them about inflation, it is one of the lowest in the world as a<br />
result of this Governments policies the Accord, the tax cuts, holding<br />
wages in the boom and then the natural deflation which has came out<br />
of the recession. Remember this, in the 1982-83 recession we had a<br />
recession then, we came out of that with inflation at 11 per cent, we<br />
are coming out of this recession with inflation at 2-3 per cent.<br />
JS.-When the Business Council says it is worried about the delicate<br />
balance of inflation after last night's Budget. Is it that we should be<br />
worried?<br />
PM: Let them start, in the first instance, restraining some executive salaries<br />
to show they really mean it.<br />
JS:-Mr Keating, just before I let you go, the National Farmers Federation<br />
said that as far as the increases in petrol go that the burden of tax -will<br />
fall most heavily in regional Australia where there is no lead probl em.<br />
It is hard to argue ag~ inst that isn't It?<br />
PM:-Most farm implements are diesel and the off-road rebate for diesel still<br />
applies, but for petrol, our petrol price was the third lowest in the world<br />
and even with this increase, it will be the third lowest in the world.<br />
There is a problem with leaded cars. We haven't replaced leaded cars<br />
as rapidly as perhaps we should have. This has been a burden for the<br />
motor industry, but it has mostly been a burden for the health of<br />
Australians and it is most obvious in places like western Sydney.<br />
JS: On a number of occasions over the last six months or so you have<br />
asked business not to shed any more labour. Are you shedding any<br />
labour In the Budget?<br />
PM: There will be some in the reforms which have taken place in Telecom<br />
because of the competition now with Optus over the last few years and<br />
in some of the other GBIEs.<br />
JS: But yet you still want private enterprise to.. </p>
<p>PM: Again, it is a matter of a balance in these things. Let me just -say one<br />
of the commitments which we have adopted since the election is we<br />
have cut the company tax rates from 39 per cent to 33 per cent, we<br />
have introduced a further investment allowance, in ' One Nation' we<br />
had another investment allowance of 10 per cent for projects over<br />
million. In ' One Nation' we had massively accelerated depreciation.<br />
Australian b6siness ha've got these things: a 33 per cent company<br />
rate, massively accelerated depreciation, two investment allowances, a<br />
profit share as high as the 1 960s and going higher and full dividend<br />
imputation. You have got to say what else? Is there any other claim?<br />
The business claims of the last forty years have been met for the first<br />
time in these last two years in these statistics.<br />
JS, Maybe that takes us back to where we started and maybe that is why<br />
Martin Ferguson Is saying, I won't defend the indefensible, because<br />
business has got everything seems to be going in one direction.<br />
PM: No, this has been something we have done over a period of eight or<br />
ten years the business changes. First we took the corporate rate<br />
from 49 down to 39 and now to 33 per cent. The ACTU argued for the<br />
investment allowances and a rapid acceleration, they argued for those<br />
things as well. There is no basis, in equity, why the ACTU would not<br />
regard this as a good Budget, it is doing for that group of their<br />
constituency between $ 20 50,000 that which they have asked us to<br />
do for some time that is provide tax relief to cut the 38 rate which<br />
chops in at $ 20,500 down to 34 per cent.<br />
JS: Just finally Mr Keating, how do you think financial markets are going to<br />
see this Budget?<br />
PM: It meets one of the Government's key election commitments, it will take<br />
the trajectory of the deficit down to just 1.1 per cent of. 0? DP by 1996-<br />
97. There will be no other western government that will do that, I am<br />
sure. Most of them will still be by 1996-97 at 2 or 3 per cent or maybe<br />
higher. I think you will find by 1996-97, many other OECD countries<br />
will have a deficit with a 3 in front of them as a per cent -of GDP and we<br />
will have a 1. If the markets say this is not good enough, I tell you this<br />
John, take no notice of them.<br />
JS: Prime Minister, thanks.<br />
PMV: Good John.<br />
