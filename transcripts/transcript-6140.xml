PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 23/ 6/ 83<br />
The Commonwealth Government today offered to reimburse the<br />
Queensland Government for all expenditure on agreed works on<br />
the Burdekin Dam project in the current financial year up<br />
to $ 6.5 million.<br />
The payment will be made by way of a non-repayable grant.<br />
The Commonwealth Government expects shortly to approach the<br />
Queensland Government to begin negotiations for the future<br />
funding of the project.<br />
i understand that to date this year the amount spent on the<br />
Burdekin Dam has been approximately $ 4.8 million, including<br />
consultants fees and a range of preliminary works associated<br />
with the project.<br />
The grant will cover those aspects of -the project which the<br />
Commonwealth, following discussions with Queensland, has already<br />
indicated that it is prepared to reimburse.<br />
I today asked the Queensland Premier for an early reply to the<br />
Commonwealth offer, to enable ioavments of financial assistance<br />
to be made before the end of this financial year. </p>
