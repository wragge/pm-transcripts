SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. E. G. WHITLAM, MP.,<br />
AT A LUNCHEON GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF THE ROYAL<br />
GOVERNMENT OF LAOS. VIENTIANE; 4 FEBRUARY, 1974-<br />
I AM INDEBTED TO YOUR HIGHNESS FORGIVING ME THE<br />
OPPORTUNITY DURING MY PRESENT JOURNEY TO VISIT VIENTIANE<br />
AND TO RENEW AN ACQUAINTANCE BEGUN WHEN YOU YOURSELF WERE<br />
IN AUSTRALIA SOME YEARS AGO. I WELCOME TOO THE OCCASION<br />
TO INFORM MYSELF OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS AND PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED<br />
WITH THE LONG AWAITED RETURN OF PEACE AND ORDER THROUGHOUT<br />
YOUR COUNTRY, AS YOU WILL KNOW, THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
FIRMLY SUPPORTS THE PRINCIPLES OF NATIONAL INTEGRITY#<br />
INDEPENDENCE AND NEUTRALITY OF LAOS DECLARED IN THE GENEVA<br />
AGREEMENTS AND LOOKS TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO ENDORSE<br />
AND SUPPORT THEM.<br />
AUSTRALIA WELCOMED BOTH THE FEBRUARY AGREEMENT AND<br />
THE SUBSEQUENT PROTOCOL IN SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR. WE SAW<br />
THESE AS HIGHLY IMPORTANT IN THEMSELVES, BUT ALSO AS<br />
ENCOURAGING AND HEARTENING EVIDENCE OF A SPIRIT OF GOODWILL,<br />
MAGNANIMITY AND CO-OPERATION AMONG ALL PARTIES IN LAOS OF<br />
WILLINGNESS TO PURSUE A MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE COMPROMISE IN THE<br />
PRESIDING INTEREST OF A GENUINE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION.<br />
I KNOW HOW MUCH IMPORTANCE YOU PERSONALLY HAVE ATTACHED TO<br />
THIS GREAT OBJECTIVE OF NATIONAL RECONCILIATION AND HOW MUCH<br />
IS OWED TO YOUR WISE JUDGMENT AND IMAGINATIVE LEADERSHIP IN<br />
THE PROGRESS YOU HAVE MADE TOWARDS IT. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
I SPEAK FOR ALL MY FELLOW AUSTRALIANS WHEN I SAY THAT<br />
AUSTRALIA UNDERSTANDS HOW MUCH NOW HASTO BE DONE TO BIND<br />
UP THE WOUNDS OF WAR, TO REPAIR THE LOSS AND DAMAGE OF SO<br />
PROTRACTED A CONFLICT, ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM ARE CONSCIOUS<br />
OF WHAT THE TRAGIC EVENTS OF THE RECENT PAST HAVE MEANT IN<br />
TERMS OF FAMILY BEREAVEMENT AND HUMAN SUFFERING, THE PAINFUL<br />
REALITY WHICH UNDERLIES THE MACABRE STATISTICS OF WAR,<br />
WE CAN NEVERTHELESS LOOK FORWARD WITH OPTIMISM TO A BRIGHTER<br />
FUTURE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE OF LAOS. WE CONFIDENTLY EXPECT<br />
THAT THE DAY IS NOT FAR OFF WHEN A COALITION GOVERNMENT<br />
WILL MAKE A START IN HARNESSING NATIONAL ENERGIES FOR THE URGENT<br />
TASKS OF REHABILITATION AND RECONSTRUCTION,<br />
IN THISWORK ALL FRIENDS OF LAOS WILL WISH TO MAKE<br />
SOME CONTRIBUTION TO PROMOTE THE POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT OF THE<br />
TALENTS AND RESOURCES OF ALL ITS PEOPLES, MY OWN GOVERNMENT STANDS<br />
READY TO TAKE PART IN THIS COMMON ENDEAVOUR. I BELIEVE THAT THERE<br />
ARE AREAS IN WHICH AUSTRALIAN EXPERIENCE HAS ALREADY PROVED<br />
TO HAVE PARTICULAR RELEVANCE TO THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF THIS<br />
COUNTRY, AS FOR INSTANCE, IN AFFORESTATION AND IN PASTURE<br />
ESTABLISHMENT UNDER TROPICAL CONDITIONS. IN SUCH FIELDS WE<br />
MAY BE ABLE TO EXPAND OUR PRESENT CONTRIBUTION, IF YOU WISH US<br />
TO DO SO, HELPING TO PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT IN THE PROCESS TO<br />
REFUGEES AND DEMOBILISED SOLDIERS, AND TO LAY FOUNDATIONS FOR<br />
THE CONTROLLED DEVELOPMENT OF IMPORTANT NATIONAL RESOURCES,<br />
WE ARE HAPPY, TOO, TO CONTINUE OUR CONTRIBUTION TO FOREIGN<br />
EXCHANGE SUPPORT FOR LAOS. IN OTHER DIRECTIONS WE LOOK FORWARD<br />
TO PURPOSEFUL AND PRACTICAL DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU OF WAYS IN<br />
WHICH YOU THINK WE MIGHT HELP, AND WHERE WE WOULD COUNT IT A'<br />
PRIVILEGE TO SERVE, </p>
<p>-3-<br />
WE ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN EXPLORING WITH YOU THE<br />
POSSIBILITY OF AN AGREEMENT TO ENCOURAGE TRADE BETWEEN<br />
OUR TWO COUNTRIESy<br />
AUSTRALIA AND LAOS WILL BOTH PROSPER BEST THROUGH<br />
A COMBINATION OF OUR OWN EFFORTS AND THE PROMOTION OF<br />
A HELPFUL CLIMATE OF INTERNATIONAL OPINION AND BEHAVIOURX<br />
WE HAVE TO BE BOTH NATIONALIST AND INTERNATIONALISTy WE<br />
SEE LAOS, AS IT SEES ITSELF, AS PART OF A REGION LINKED BY<br />
GEOGRAPHY, CIRCUMSTANCES AND HISTORY TO THE OTHER COUNTRIES<br />
OF INDO-CHINA AND AS A NEIGHBOUR ALSO TO BURMA, THAILAND<br />
AND CHINAX LAOS DRAWS A RICH AND FASCINATING INHERITANCE<br />
FROM ALL THESE ASSOCIATIONS, WOVEN INTO THE FABRIC OF<br />
POPULAR LIFE AND FURNISHING THE BACKGROUND OF THE NATIONAL<br />
GENIUSy AUSTRALIA IS A MORE RECENT NEIGHBOUR WITH A SHORTER,<br />
MUCH SHORTER, AWARENESS AND EXPERIENCE OF THIS AREA* BUT WE<br />
ACCEPT FULLY AND COMPLETELY THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR DESTINIES<br />
ARE BOUND UP WITH YOURSX THEY BOTH LARGELY DEPEND UPON THE<br />
DEGREE OF SUCCESS THAT ATTENDS THE LABOURS OF US ALL TO<br />
CONTRIBUTE TO A PEACEFUL WORLD ORDER AND THE PROSPECT OF<br />
PEACEFUL ACCESS TO A FAIR SHARE OF ITS RESOURCES FOR ALL ITS<br />
PEOPLES) </p>
<p>THERE COULD BE NO BETTER EXAMPLE TO PRESENT AND<br />
FUTURE GENERATIONS OF LEADERS IN LAOS, IN INDO-CHINA AND,<br />
INDEED, THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE REGION OF SOUTH-EAST ASIA<br />
THAN THE UNREMITTING LABOUR YOUR HIGHNESS HAS DEVOTED TO<br />
PEACEy IT IS IN THE HOPE OF SEEING EXTENDED THE AREA OF<br />
PEACE, OF FRATERNAL DIALOGUE AND DISCUSSION THAT I WILL<br />
LEAVE VIENTIANE, ENCOURAGED BY THE CONVICTION THAT THE PATH<br />
OF NEGOTIATION ON WHICH YOU ARE NOW EMBARKED IS THE RIGHT<br />
ONE FOR LAOS AND FOR THE REGION OF WHICH IT IS PARTK<br />
WE SHALL FOLLOW WITH THE KEENEST INTEREST AND SYMPATHY<br />
THE OUTCOME OF YOUR ENDEAVOURS)( YOU MAY COUNT UPON US FOR<br />
SUPPORT IN YOUR ACHIEVEMENTy<br />
FINALLY, ON BEHALF OF ALL IN MY PARTY, MAY I EXPRESS<br />
MY DEEP APPRECIATION OF YOUR GENEROUS HOSPITALITY TO US ALLX<br />
I REGRET THAT CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE NOT PERMITTED A LONGER STAY<br />
AND WIDER ACQUAINTANCE WITH LAOSk WE LEAVE WITH YOU OUR MOST<br />
EARNEST HOPES AND GOOD WISHES FOR THE FUTURE PEACE AND<br />
PROGRESS, SO EARNESTLY DESIRED BY EVERY LAO, WHICH WILL<br />
REPRESENT THE CULMINATION OF YOUR EFFORTS AS A STATESMAN AND<br />
PEACEMAKERX </p>
