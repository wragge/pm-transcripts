OPENI NG OF FOD'S NEW 4 CYL1ttPER ENGGIE PLANT<br />
GEELOiJG 1 OCTOBER 1983<br />
IT GIVES, ME GREAT1 PLEASURE TO OPENi FORD'S NEW FOIUR<br />
CYLINDER ENGINE PLANTTHIS,<br />
TOGETirER WITH THE RECENTLY COMMISSIONED<br />
ROBOT-EQUIPPED SHEET METAL SUB-ASSEMBLY FACILITY AND<br />
UPGRADING OF THE STAMPTNG PLANT, INVOLVES AN INVESTMENT OF<br />
NEARLY $ 100 MiLLIO14 IN ADDITIONAL FACILITIES AT GEELONGWITH<br />
THIS ! INVESTMENT FORD WILL RAISE THE TELSTAR'S<br />
LOCAL CONTENT BY SOMETHING LIKE 15 PER CENT AND GEtE RATE 260<br />
NEWd JOBS HERE AND AErliTIONAL JOSS IN SUPPLIER COtiPAHIESCOMING<br />
AT A TIME 11HEN OTHER MAJOR AUSTRALIAN MOTOR<br />
VEHiCLE MANUFACTURERS ARE EXPE ! ENC I G COIlSIDERABLE<br />
DIFFICULTIES, FORD'S EXAMPLE IS ENCOURAGING.<br />
THE' CONSTRUCTION OF THESE FACILITIES, WHICH i'li DiX<br />
HAS ALREADY EMPHASISED WERE CONCEIVED BY FORm AUSTRALIA<br />
ENGI NEERS A: ID LARGELY iNSTALLED BY THE COMP: ANY'S OWN<br />
WORKFORCE, REPRESENTS A CLEA R DEIMONSTRATION OF FORD'S<br />
COMIITMENT TO CONTINUED IOT3r VEHICLE PRODUCTIONl INq GEEILON'G. </p>
<p>EGUAL IMPORTANTLY.. THEY IIGHLIGHT THE DIPECTION<br />
IN WHICll PRODUCT! ON NOT ONLY 1I, THE MOTOR VEHICLE INDUSTRY<br />
BUT ALSO IN OTHER MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES WILL NEED TO<br />
MOVE IF AUSTRALIA'S INDUSTRY IS TO SURVIVE AND PROSPER IN<br />
FUTUREÃ¸ IN ESSENCE, THIS INVOLVES THE APPLICATION OF NEW<br />
TECHNOLOGY IN A MANNER DESIGNED TO SECURE INCREASED<br />
PRODUCTIVITY AND GREATER COMPETITIVENESS IN BOTH DOMESTIC<br />
AND EXPORT MARKETS.<br />
IT IS PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT THAT THE 2.0 LITRE<br />
AND 1.6 L'ITRE ENGINES BEING PRODUCED AT THIS PLANT ARE<br />
DESTINED FOR EXPORT TO NE-, ZEALAND AS WELL AS FOR THE<br />
DOMESTIC MARKETAN EFFECTIVE EXPORT ORIENTATION MUST BE A<br />
SIGNIFICANT FEATURE IN THE REQUIRED ADJUSTMENT OF AUSTRALIAN<br />
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY.<br />
As WELL, THE EFFECTIVENESS WITH WHICH WE APPLY INEW<br />
TECHNOLOGY WILL DETERMINE NOT ONLY THE EFFICIENCY OF<br />
AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY, ITS COMPETITIVE PERFORMANCE AND ITS<br />
CAPACITY TO GROW, BUT ALSO WHETHER WE CAN ADDRESS<br />
EFFECTIVELY THE DISASTROUS EMPLOYM-ENT PROBLEMS OF RECENT<br />
YEARS, AND REVERSE THE LONG DO'VINIARD SLIDE iN OUR LIVIHG<br />
STANDARDS RELATIVE TO OTHER INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES-</p>
<p>WHILE CYCLICAL FACTOPS EXPLAIN PART OF OUR CURRENT<br />
ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES, A LARGE COMPONENT IS STRUCTURAL AND<br />
REFLECTS THE ENTRENCHMENT. OF LOW PRODUCTIVITY AND<br />
INAPPROPRIATE PRODUCTION F4TTERNS IN MANY PARTS OF OUR<br />
E CO0NOMY.~ F-OR THIS REASON, THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF<br />
NEW TECHNOLOGY MUST BE EMBRACEDTHERE<br />
IS, WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT, NO ESCAPING<br />
THE FACT THAT INNOVATION IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR NATION'S FUTUJRE<br />
WELL-BEING, NOT ONLY ! N INDUSTRIES PRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS,<br />
BUT ALSO tHROUGHOIT ESTABLISHED INDUSTRIES, SUCH AS THE<br />
MOTOR VEHICLE INDUSTRYFOR<br />
THIS REASON, I APPLAUD FORD'S INITIATIVE IN<br />
ESTABLISHING THESE FACILITIESI<br />
PARTICULARLY APPRECIATED M1R Dix's REFERENCE TO<br />
THE COMPANY'S ATTEMPTS TO ENCOURAGE GREATER EMPLOYEE<br />
PARTICIPATION IN PROBLEM SOLVING AND DECISION-MAKING WITH A<br />
VIEW TO INCREASING JOB SATISFACTION AND IMPROVING<br />
COMPETITIVENESSEFFECTIVE CONSULTATIVE ARRANGEMENTS AT THE W01K<br />
LEVEL ARE, IBELIEVE, CRUCIAL TO THE SUCCESSFUL<br />
IMPLEMENTATION OF NJEW TECHN IQUES OF PRODUCT IOA. </p>
<p>TH-E MANUFACTURE OF PASSErGER CARS AND COMIFONENTS IN<br />
AUSTRALIA IS A MAJOR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY.<br />
IT DIRECTLY EMPLOYS ABOUT 60,000 PEOPLE AND<br />
ACCOUNTS FOR 6 PER CENT OF TOTAL MANUFACTURING ACTIVITY ( 11<br />
PER CENT IN THE CASE OF VICTORIA).<br />
THE GROSS VALUE OF PRODUCTION IS ABOUT 1 PER CENT<br />
OF O-' R GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT.<br />
THE TOTAL AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY, IS BIGGER STILL.<br />
4IHEN WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE MANUFACTURE OF<br />
COMMERCI'A VEHICLES, IMPORTING, DISTRIBUTION, RETAILING AND<br />
SERVICING, WE ARE LOOKING AT ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILLION<br />
EMPLOYEES. IN -hEW OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LOCAL MOTOR<br />
VEHICLE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY, IT IS A MATTER OF CONCERN<br />
THAT ITS COMPETITITIVE POSITION HAS DETERIORATED SIGNIFICANTLY<br />
SINCE THE MID-1970' s.<br />
NOTWITH:: TANDING THE PROVISION OF SUBSTANTIAL<br />
ASSISTANCE EMPLOY; IENT IN THE INDUSTRY HAS NOT BEEN<br />
MAINTAINED. </p>
<p>EmPLOYMAEN1 HAS FALLEN DESPITE THE FACT THAT<br />
ASSISTANCE HAS DOUBL.' D OVER THE PERIOD To 14 TIMES THE<br />
AVEPAGE OF MANUFACTU I LJG INDUSTRY, AND NOW AMOUNTS TO<br />
SOMa__ TH i NG LIKE $ 130 P. A. FOR EVERY MAN, WO1MAN AND CH-IILD 1I;<br />
AUSTRAL IA. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE DETERIORATION IN<br />
COMPETrITIVENESS AND THE RECENT RECESSION, PROFITAB-LITY I<br />
THE NDUSTRY HAS BEEN SEVEkELY DEPRESSEDGrIH'S<br />
DECISION L-AST WEEK TO0 CLOSE ITS ACACIA RIDGE<br />

THAT DECISION INVOLVES SIGNIFICANiT AD~ jUST; I! ENT<br />
PROBLEMS IN QUEENSLAND BUT OPPORTUNITIES ALSO FOR AN<br />
APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF RATIONALISATION OF INDUSTRY<br />
STRUCTURES AND EXPANSION IN AuSTRALIA.<br />
FORD NEVERTHELESS HAS MANAGED TO D) EFY THE GENE4r. RAL<br />

FORD'S PRINCIPAL ASSEITS HAVE INCLUDED THE QUALITY<br />

ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK, THAT:<br />

SIGINIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY IMPORTS OF CER~ TAIN LIGjHT<br />
COI-1-ERC IAL AND FOUR-WHE'" L Dk IVE VEHI1CL. ES; AND THAT<br />
A CAR INDUSTRY COUNCIL IS TO BE ESTABLISHED TO<br />
REPORT ON SUCH IMP'ORTS AS WELL AS POST-198Lj<br />
ARRANGEtXENTS THE CAR INDUSTRY COUNC IL IS0 ." LSO<br />
BEING ASKED TO CON3) IDER HOW JOINT ACTIO. W BY<br />
COMPONENT AND VEHICLE PRODUCERS, TPADE UN liO:: S AND<br />
PERHAPS GOVEJRNMENT MI C'H' ACH IEVE I NCREASES ' N<br />
EFFICIENCY OF PRODUCTION-</p>
<p>BOTH ENQUIRIES ARE TO REPORT BY 14 DECEMBER.<br />
As JOHN BUTTON POINTED OUT, THE PROPOSED COUNCIL'S<br />
TERMS OF REFERENCE MAKE CLEAR THE GOVERNMENT'S CONViCTION<br />
THAT EXPOSURE TO THE DISCIPLINE OF IMPORT COMPETITION IS<br />
NECESSARY FOR THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OF THE INDUSTRY.<br />
THE AIM OF THE EXERCISE IS TO REACH DECISIONS<br />
WHICH, WHILE AT LEAST MAINTAINING THE INDUSTRY'S OVERALL<br />
EXPOSURE TO IMPORT COMPETITION, WOULD IMPROVE ITS EFFICIENCY<br />
AND LONG-TERM VIABILITY.<br />
, RATHER THAN INTRODUCING UNCERTAINTY AND DISRUPTING<br />
THE INDUSTRY AS MR PEACOCK HAS SUGGESTED, THE APPROACH WE<br />
ARE PU.-SUING SHOULD SEE THIS INDUSTRY SECURELY ESTABLISHED<br />
ON A SOUND LONG-TERM FOOTING.<br />
SSUPPORT JOHN BUTTON'S STATEMENT THAT WE SHOULD<br />
NOT BE LOO
COMPONENT PRODUCERS ARE INSULATED FROM WORLD COMPETITION AS<br />
A SOLUTION " O THE INDUSTRY'S PROBLEMWHILE<br />
MY GOVERNMENT IS COMMITTED IN CURRENT<br />
ECONOMIC CUR:. UMSTANCES TO MAINTENENCE OF EXISTING<br />
PROTECTION ARR; NGEMENTS, IT DOES NOT SEE AlY ROLE FOR<br />
INCREASES IN PiRTECTION FOR THE MOTOR VEHICLE I: NDUSTRY-</p>
<p>INE-D, THE FACI THAT THE CURRENT COST OF SUCH PROTECTION TO<br />
CONSUMERS IS APPRCXIMA\ TELY $ 2 BILLION COUPLED WilH THE<br />
MANIFEST INABILITY OF T1HI S PRiOTECTION TO MAINTAIN<br />
' EMPLOYMENT, SUGGESTS THAT IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICUL! TO<br />
JUSTIFY FURTHEA INCREASES AT THIS POIlT OF TIMEEMPLOYERS<br />
AND EMPLOYEES IN ALL SECTORS OF TH::<br />
INDUSTRY FNEED TO REALISE THAT THE LONG-TERM VIABILITY OF<br />
FIRMS AND JOBS CANNOT BE ACHIEVED IN THAT WAY; DISPARITIES<br />
BETWEEN PROTECTION LEVELS FOR THIS INDUSTRY AND OTHEF:<br />
MIANUFACTURING NEED TO BE LESSENED RATHER THAN W! DENED*<br />
-VIABILITY AND JOB OPPORTUNITIES REQUIRE INSTEAD<br />
THAT ALL SECTORS OF THE INDUSTRY WORK TOGETHER TOWARDS A<br />
COMMON GOALWITH JOHN BUTTON I BELIEVE THAT OVER THE NEXT FEWYEARS<br />
WE NEED TO TACKLE BY JOINT ACTION SUCH MATTERS AS:<br />
IMPROVING PRODUCTIVITY iAND INDUST RIAL RELAT! NS<br />
S SOURCING OF COMPONENTRY<br />
THE IMPACT OF NEW TECHNOLOGY<br />
THE RESPGCSIVENESS OF THE INDUSTRY TO CHANGES I N<br />
CONSUMER PREFERENCES AS THEY EMERGE, AND<br />
THE RETENTION OF DESIGNIER SKILLS IN AUSTRALIA </p>
<p>J<br />
THERE IS NO DOUIBT THAT THE MOTOR VEHICLE INDUSTRY,<br />
LIKE MANY OTHER OF OUR MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES, IS STANDING<br />
AT TIE CROSSROADS. IF THE INDUSTRY IS TO SURVIVE, IT MUST<br />
APPLY NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN A MANNER DESIGNED TO ENHANCE<br />
COMPET; TIVENESS AND, THEREFORE, PROFITABILITY AND<br />
EMPLOYME NT MY GOVERNMENT AIMS TO DO WHAT IT CAN TO PROMOTE<br />
SUCH A POSITIVE APPROACH. IT IS ENCOURAGED BY THE EXAMPLE<br />
FORD NOW OFFERS THE INDUSTRY.<br />
MR DIX'S PARTICIPATION IN THE CAR INDUSTRY COUNCIL<br />
GIVES ME ADDED CONFIDENCEAUSTRALIA WOULD BE SERVED WELL IF FORD'S EXAMPLE OF<br />
AN APPROPRIATELY INNOVATIVE APPROACH AS EMBODIED IN THIS<br />
MAJOR INVESTMENT WERE EXTENDED AND CARRIED FURTHER BY FORD<br />
AND OTHERS IN THE Ilil) USTRY* </p>
