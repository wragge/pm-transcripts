PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 18th NOVEMBER 1975<br />
STATEHOOD FOR THE NORTHERN TERRITORY<br />
The Liberal and National Country Parties Government will take<br />
steps after December 13 to bring the Northern Territory to<br />
Statehood<br />
Our aim-is that the Territory should achieve full Statehood<br />
over the next 5 years.<br />
As a first step. and in co-operation with the Territorial Assembly<br />
we would. begin the immediate implementation of recommendations<br />
by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the transfer of powers<br />
to the Northern Territory. This report has been ignored for 12<br />
months by the ihitlam administration.<br />
Our aim is the maximum degree of autonomy for the Northern Territory<br />
in the shortest possible time.<br />
During the 23 years of Liberal National Country Party Government<br />
up until 1972, the Northern Territory prospered and Darwin grew<br />
from a city of 8,000 to a city of 48P00..<br />
During the past three years there has been stagnation.<br />
As a first step towards progress we will begin the implementation<br />
of the recommendations Which the Joint Parliamentary Committee.<br />
made in November last year.<br />
This Committee recommended that the Northern Territory Legislative<br />
Assembly should acquire executive responsibility for a large number<br />
of Northern Territory Statutory authorities.<br />
Among the responsibilities which the Joint Parliamentary'Committee<br />
said could be taken over immediately were such bodies as the<br />
Housing Commission and the Tourist Board, museums and art galleries<br />
and the public service. .1 </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER<br />

The Committee also recommended the transfer from Canberra to Darwin<br />
of such State functions as collecting payroll tax and other<br />
local taxes agricultural services local transport and local<br />
government, sewerage and electricity, liquor licensing and<br />
gaming laws.<br />
It also recommended as a first stage that powers be shared between<br />
the Territory and the National Government in the fields of<br />
Education, Health, the Courts, Rural and Urban Land,-Urban<br />
Development and Ports and Roads.<br />
We will set up a Joint Federal and Northern Territory Legislative<br />
Assembly Committee to work on arrangements for the transition<br />
to Statehood.<br />
This Committee would set about implementing the Parliamentary<br />
Committees other recommendations on the transfer of responsibilities<br />
It would recommend sblutions to problems as they arise.<br />
During the transfer, the status and opportunity of the public<br />
service will be preserved. There will be full and proper<br />
revenue equilisation arrangements to enable the territory to<br />
develop as it once was able to.<br />
The aim is the maximum degree of autonomy and. control in the<br />
shortest possible time.<br />
The Liberal and National Country Party Government after December<br />
13 will also adopt and implement two reports by the Indtstries<br />
Assistance Commission on the Beef Industry.<br />
The first of the IAC Repqrts. make provision for emergency. aid<br />
to the industry by suspending the export levy on bees. of 1.6<br />
cents per pound and by providing funds for special assistance<br />
for producers who have been hit by the fall in beef prices. </p>
<p>S, PRIME MINISTER 3<br />
The second IAC recommendation is that producers should be compensated<br />
when their cattle show positive reactions to tests under the<br />
tubercullosis and brucellosis eradication programs.<br />
Beef producers in the Territory-and throughout Australia have<br />
suffered severely during the uncertainty produced by the Labor<br />
administration during the past three years.<br />
The past Government has pursued a hard line resources policy<br />
Sabroad which has rebounded on Australian producers.<br />
This week the U. S. Authorities closed their market to further<br />
meat exports for the remainder of the year.<br />
Immediately after December 13 we will initiate Government to<br />
Government discussion to ensure past misunderstandings are resolved.<br />
We will recreate the circumstances in which mining ventures can<br />
operate. Overseas Investment will be welcomed in partnership with<br />
Australian investors.<br />
We are going to get Australia moving.<br />
The Mining Industry which means so much to the Northern Territory<br />
will be part of that.<br />
There has not been a single major mineral development project<br />
started in the past three years.<br />
What has happened to mining industry demonstrates Labor's<br />
failure and incompetence as much as anything else.<br />
