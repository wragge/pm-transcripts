PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT PRESS CONFERENCE9 SEOUL 6 FEBRUARY 1984 AT SHILLA<br />
HOTEL<br />
E AND 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST : CAN WE DEAL WITH THIS GMH THING AND THE REACTION TO<br />
THAT ARE YOU SURPRISED AT THE LEVEL OF THE REACTION THAT HAS<br />
OCCURRED SO FAR FROM NOT ONLY FROM THE OPPOSITION BUT ALSO FROM -THE<br />
TRADE UNIONS. I AM A LITTLE SURPRISED AT THE WAY WHAT I'VE SAID HAS BEEN<br />
PRESENTED. AND I THINK YOU'' APPRECIATE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION<br />
I NEED TO GIVE A FAIRLY EXTENSIVE ANSWER AND I HOPE IN DOING THAT<br />
THAT I'LL MEET ALL THE CONSIDERATIONS THAT MAY BE IN YOUR MINDS.<br />
THE FIRST POINT THAT I. WOULD MAKE IS THAT IT COMES AS A* LITTLE<br />
SURPRISING TO ME THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SOME SUGGESTION GIVEN*<br />
MY BACKGROUND AND HISTORY THAT WH-AT I WOULD BE ABOUT IS THE<br />
DESTRUCTION OF JOBS. IN ALL OF MY PUBLIC COMMITMENTs IN THE ACTU<br />
AND SINCE I'VE BEEN IN PARLIAMENTi IS TOWARDS THE CREATION<br />
OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. AND PERHAPS MOST SPECIFICALLY I CAN<br />
PICK UP MY SURPRISE AT TK~ E MISUNDERSTANDING BY JUST LOOKING AT THE<br />
STEEL INDUSTRY.<br />
IN THE REPORTING AND REACTION THERE HAS BEEN SOME REFERENCE TO THE<br />
LOSS OF JOBS IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY. NOW LET'S REMEMBER THE FACTS.<br />
THE FACTS ARE THAT WHEN MY GOVERNMENT CAME TO OFFICE WE WERE<br />
CONFRONTED AS YOU ALL K~ OW AND AS THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY KNOWS<br />
WITH THE DISTINCT LIKELIHOOD THAT AUSTRALIA COULD FACE THE<br />
DISAPPEARANCE OF ITS STEEL INDUSTRY. THAT WAS AN OPTION WHICH<br />
WAS SERIOUSLY BEING CONTEMPLATED. I SAID ON BEHALF OF THE LABOR<br />
MOVEMENT THAT THAT WAS A CONTEMPLATION WHICH WAS NOT TO BE CANVASSED.<br />
AND WAS ONE THAT WE WOULD NOT PUT UP WITH AT ALL.<br />
POSITIVELY ON BEHALF OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT THAT WE WOULD* IN FACT,<br />
WE IN A RELATIVELY SHORT TIME OF BEING IN GOVERNMENT, BRING3 IN A<br />
STEEL INDUSTRY PLAN FOR THE SPECIFIC PURPOSES OF ENSURING THAT<br />
AUSTRALIA WOULD RETAIN A HEALTHY AND VIABLE AND COMPETITIVE STEEL<br />
INDUSTRY. AND IN FACT THAT IS WHAT'S HAPPE-NED. IT IS A IMATTER I<br />
BELIEVE OF UNIVERSAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT AS A RESULT OF TH4E PLANNINIG<br />
CONSULTATIVELY THAT WE UND) ERT( OK' THAT WE SAVED THE AUSTRALIAN STEEL<br />
INDUSTRY AND WE SAVED THOUSANDS OF JOBS IN SAVQING THE STEEL INDUSTRY. </p>
<p>NOW IT'S INSTRUCTIVE, I SUGGEST, TO RECALL JUST WHAT WE DID.<br />
WE CALLED THE COMPANY, WE CALLED THE UNIONS AND WE CALLED THE<br />
GOVERNMENTS TOGETHER. AND TOGETHER WE SET ABOUT WORKING OUT WHAT<br />
SORTS OF DECISIONS NEEDED TO BE MADE IN THE LIGHT OF CURRENT AND<br />
FORESEEABLE CIRCUMSTANCES TO ACHIEVE THE RESULT OF SAVING THE<br />
INDUSTRY AND SAVING EMPLOYMENT. THAT WAS NOT RUSHED INTO BUT IN<br />
THE RESULT, OUT OF ALL THAT CONSULTATIONi WE HAVE, AS I SAY, SAVED<br />
THE INDUSTRY AND SAVED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS DIRECTLY AND<br />
INDIRECTLY.<br />
AND THAT WAS DONE IN A WAY WHICH INVOLVED AN INPUT<br />
FROM THE COMPANY, A COMMITMENT TO HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS<br />
IN NEW INVESTMENT, A COMMITMENT ON THE PART OF THE UNIONS TO ADOPT<br />
NEW WORK PRACTICES TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND A COMMITMENT OF THE<br />
GOVERNMENT TO A FORM OF ASSISTANCE WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT DOWN TFE<br />
LINE USERS OF STEEL WOULD BE PROTECTED. TO BE PRECISE THE BOUNTY<br />
FORM OF ASSISTANCE WAS INCORPORATED INTO THE PLAN.<br />
NOW WHEN YOU HAVE THAT EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE HAVE IN FACT DONE IN THE<br />
STEEL INDUSTRY WHICH SAVED THE INDUSTRY AND SAVED TENS OF THOUSANDS<br />
OF JOBS DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY YOU CAN PERHAPS UNDERSTAND THAT SO<br />
FAR AS I FEEL TO SEE REFERENCE TO PLANNING INVOLVING A LOSS OF JOBS<br />
IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY, WHAT WE WERE ABOUT WAS INVOLVING CONSULTATIVE,<br />
CO-OPERATIVE PLANNING TO SAVE JOBS AND TO SAVE THEM INTO THE FUTURE.<br />
SIMILARLY IN REGARD TO THE CAR INDUSTRY WHAT I AM SAYING AND WHAT<br />
THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE ABOUT WILL BE TO FACE UP TO THE FACT THAT WE<br />
ALL KNOW THAT THE TASK HAS SEEN A DIMINUTION, A SIGNIFICANT<br />
DIMINUTION, OF EMPLOYMENT WITHIN THE MOTOR VEHICLE<br />
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY IN AUSTRALIA. THAT HAS HAPPENED. IT'S<br />
HAPPENED IN THE SITUATION WHERE THERE HASNT BEEN SUFFICIENT<br />
CONSTRUCTIVE CONSULTATION BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND THE INDUSTRY.<br />
AND I REMIND YOU THAT WHEN I TALK ABOUT INDUSTRY I TALK ABOUT NOT<br />
ONLY EMPLOYERS9 BUT I TALK ABOUT THE WORKERS AND THEIR<br />
REPRESENTATIVES IN THE INDUSTRY. AND SO WE WILL BE AS FAR AS THAT<br />
INDUSTRY IS CONCERNED ADOPTING THE SAME SORT OF PROCESS OF<br />
CONSULTATION TO TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT THROUGH CONSULTATION AND<br />
PLANNING WE CAN SEE THE EMERGENCE OF A TRULY VIABLE INDUSTRY IN<br />
AUSTRALIA. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER POINTS I WANT TO MAKE, BUT I'SHOULD MAKE<br />
THIS POINT TO YOU THAT THERE HAS BEEN, AS YOU WOULD APPRECIATE I<br />
THINK BECAUSE YOU'VE HEARD WHAT I SAID IN OSAKA AND WHAT I SAID IN<br />
JAPAN, I THINK YOU MORE THAN PERHAPS ANYONE WOULD APPRECIATE THAT<br />
THERE HAS BEEN A DEGREE OF MISUNDERSTANDING AS TO WHAT I'VE SAID.<br />
WHEN I'M OVERSEAS REPRESENTING AUSTRALIA I AM NOT GOING TO TAKE<br />
UP MY TIME GOING INTO A DETAILED RESPONSE TO POLITICAL ATTACKS OR<br />
MISREPRESENTATIONS THAT OCCUR AT HOME WHILE I'M AWAY. I CAN ASSURE<br />
EVERYBODY WITHIN AUSTRALIA THAT WHEN I RETURN I WILL PICK UP THE MORE<br />
GROTESQUE OF THOSE MISREPRESENTATIONS. LET ME MAKE ONE POINT THAT<br />
I THINK IS VERY SIGNIFICANT. THERE HAS BEEN SOME SUGGESTION MADE<br />
THAT I HAVE COME OVERSEAS TO MAKE THESE STATEMENTS. NOW I THINK ALL<br />
OF YOU HERE KNOW THAT THAT IS AGAIN A GROTESOUE MISREPRESENTATION.<br />
IF YOU LOOK AT THE SPEECH I MADE IN SYDNEY ON 10 NOVEMBER OF LAST<br />
YEAR TO THE SYDNEY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN RESPECT OF THE AUTOMOBILE<br />
INDUSTRY YOU WILL SEE THAT I SAID THERE PRECISELY THE SORTS OF THINGS<br />
THAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT IN JAPAN. AND INDEED NOT ONLY IN THAT SPEECH<br />
BUT IN A NUMBER OF SPEECHES THAT I'VE MADE SINCE I'VE BEEN PRIME<br />
MINISTER. I HAVE GIVEN THE SAME SORT OF THRUST THAT I HAVE GIVEN IN<br />
JAPAN. AS I SAY AS FAR AS THE POLITICS OF ALL THAT MISREPRESENTATION </p>
<p>IS CONCERNED I AM LOOKING FORWARD bREATLY TO PICKING UP THAT DEBATE<br />
WHEN I GO BACK TO AUSTRALIA9 BECAUSE THAT'S THE PROPER LOCATION<br />
UNDERTAKE THAT DEBATE. WHILE I'M OVERSEAS I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE<br />
INTERESTS OF AUSTRALIANS AND LOOKING TO THE FUTURE INTERESTS OF OUR<br />
COUNTRY. LET ME EMPHASISE THE POINT THAT I AGAIN KNOW ALL OF YOU<br />
UNDERSTOOD THAT I WENT OUT OF MY WAY TO MAKE IN MY SPEECHES IN JAPANON<br />
THE SUBJECT IN SPEECHES AND IN CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU PRIVATELY<br />
YOU KNOW THAT AT ALL POINTS I HAVE GONE OUT OF MY WAY TO EMPHASISE<br />
THESE THINGS. FIRSTLY9 THAT NOTHING-IS GOING TO BE DONE BY<br />
AUTONOMOUS GOVERNMENT FIAT9 THAT WHAT WE ARE ABOUT IS THE PROCESS OF<br />
CONSULTATION AND IN THE PROCESSES OF CONSULTATION OF MY GOVERNMENT IN<br />
LESS THAN A YEAR IN OFFICE STANDS OUT DRAMATICALLY AS BEING<br />
SUCCESSFUL AND AS BEING A COMMITTED UNDERTAKING AND THEY CONTRAST<br />
STARKLY WITH THE VIRTUAL LACK OF CONSULTATION WHICH HAS CHARACTERISED<br />
GOVERNMENT POLICY MAKING IN THE PAST.<br />
SECONDLYi AGAIN AS I SAID IN THE SPEECHES AND AS I'VE SAID IN<br />
PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WITH MANY OF YOUt AT ALL POINTS WHAT WE ARE<br />
LOOKING AT IS THE MEDIUM TO LONGER TERM WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE<br />
MAKING DECISIONS TODAY OR TOMORROW ABOUT A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY OR<br />
ABOUT THE OVERALL. STRUCTURE OF INDUSTRY. WHAT WE'VE GOT TO BE<br />
CONCERNED ABOUT IS HAVING A CONSULTATIVE PROCESSi FULLY INVOLVING<br />
GOVERNMENT AND BOTH SIDES OF INDUSTRY AND WHERE RELEVANT, OF COURSE,<br />
THE STATE GOVERNMENTSi SO THAT TOGETHER WE CAN ADDRESS OURSELVES TO<br />
THE FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION OF HOW THROUGH THE-MEDIUM AND~<br />
LONGER TERM WE ARE GOING TO INCREASE JOB OPPORTUNITIES IN<br />
AUSTRALIA AND IT WILL BE SELF-DEFEATING IF IN FACT WE WERE TO PROCEED<br />
IN ANY OTHER WAY.<br />
WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO CONVEY WELL BEFORE I LEFT AUSTRALIA AND GIVE<br />
ADDED EMPHASIS TO IN JAPANJ AND'HERE IS THAT WE DO LIVE IN A REGION<br />
OF DYNAMIC, RAPID GROWTH ANI? THAT WE CANNOT ISOLATE OURSELVES FROM<br />
THAT FACT. AND THE UNIQUE RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENTS IN AUSTRALIA<br />
IN 1984 AND THROUGH THE 1980' S IS TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS IN<br />
CONSULTATION WITH THE GREAT ELEMENTS OF OUR SOCIETY WHICH ARE GOING<br />
TO ENSURE THAT WE, AS I SAY AND I'VE SAID BEFORE I'VE USED<br />
THE PHRASE-THROUGH ' ENM1! SHING' OURSELVES WITH THIS DYNAMIC REGION<br />
CAN GET FOR OURSELVES IN AUSTRALIA THE GREATEST BENEFIT OF THE<br />
DYNAMISM OF THE REGION. AND THAT WILL MEAN WHEN SUCCESSFULLY DONE<br />
AND SUCCESSFULLY DO IT WE WILL, THROUGH CONSULTATION, THAT WILL ME AN<br />
NOT JOB LOSSES IN ANY AGGREGATE SENSE, IT WILL MEAN THROUGH TIME<br />
THE CERTAINTY OF CREATING MORE JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR AUSTRALIANS.<br />
AND WHAT WE MUST DO, AND AGAIN THE THEME THAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO<br />
EMPHASISE TO YOU AS AGAIN I HAVE IN INUMMERABLE SPEECHES IN<br />
AUSTRALIAi IS TO POINT OUT THAT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS YOU<br />
CANT TALK ABOUT INDUSTRY ADJUSTMENT IN ISOLATION, YOU'VE<br />
GOT TO SEE IT AS PART OF A WHOLE, A WHOLE WHICH INCLUDES POLICIESi<br />
DIRECTED TO AN APPROPRIATE MACROECONOMIC STRUCTUREi POLICIES DIRECTED<br />
TO AN APPROPRIATE EDUCATION STRUCTURE So THAT WE WILL HAVE A<br />
RELEVANT AND APPROPRIATELY TRAINED AND FLEXIBLE WORKFORCE WHICH<br />
WILL BE ABLE TO ADJUST TO THE CHANGES WHICH OUR CHANGING WORLD WILL<br />
DEMAND OF US. </p>
<p>IT WILL ALSO REQUIRE APPROPRIATE INVESTMENT POLICIES, IT WILL REQUIRE<br />
APPROPRIATE TRAINING AND RETRAINING POLICIES. NOW I REPEAT, AS<br />
AGAIN I THINK EVERYONE OF YOU. IN THIS ROOM KNOWS, THE<br />
WHOLE OF MY PUBLIC RECORD WITHIN THE TRADE UNIONS MOVEMENT AND'<br />
IN PARLIAMENT HAS BEEN DIRECTED TOWARDS THE ISSUE OF HOW DO<br />
WE MAKE SURE THAT WE GET AWAY FROM THE AD-HOCERY OF THE PAST<br />
WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN ADEQUATE IN THOSE DAYS OF THE LUCKY COUNTRY<br />
SYNDROME WHEN PERHAPS PLANNING AND CONSULTATION WASNT NECESSARY.<br />
TO GET AWAY FROM THAT TOWARDS AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE DELIBERATELY<br />
WILL BE CREATING JOBS AND CREATING MORE SATISFYING JOBS'AND DOING<br />
IT WITHIN AN AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY WHICH MAXIMISES THE OPPORTUNITY COR<br />
ALL AUSTRALIANS TO GET THE BENEFIT OF BEING PART OF THIS DYNAMIC<br />
REGION. BUTCH9 THAT HAS TAKEN SOME TIME T40 ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONi BUT I HOPE<br />
I'VE GONE TO THE RANGE OF ISSUES WHICH I THINK ARE RELEVANT. I<br />
JUST CONCLUDE ON THE POINT THAT. I'M NOT GOING TO DEAL WITH PARTICULAR<br />
CONTRIBUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY MY POLITICAL OPPONENTS IN TH4E<br />
LAST DAY OR SO. BUT I REPEAT I GREATLY LOOK FORWARD TO PICKING * rHEM<br />
UP WHEN I GET BACK TO AUSTRALIA.<br />
JOURNALIST: PRIME MINISTER, YOUR PREDECESSORi HIS GOVERNMENT ALSO<br />
BELIEVED IN LOWERING PROTECTION LEVELS AND* RATIONALISING AUSTRALIAN<br />
INDUSTRYi YET HE DEMONSTRABLY FAILED IN THAT. WHY WOULD YOU<br />
SUCCEED. WELL THE POINTS I'D MAKE ABOUT THAT. * MAY I JUST MAKE<br />
JUST A VERY BRIEF PREPARATORY POINT THAT AS YOU KNOW I HAVEN'S<br />
INDULGED SINCE I'VE BEEN IN OFFICE IN THE BUSINESS OF GOING ABOUT<br />
BAGGING MY PREDECESSOR, HE SPEAKS FOR HIMSELF IN A SENSE. BUT I<br />
DO.-MAKE THIS FIRST POINT THAT THE SORT OF THINGS THAT MY<br />
PREDECESSOR WAS TALKING ABOUT ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE WAS A GRAND<br />
SCALE ABOUT THE WORLD WINDING BACK PROTECTION AND AT THE SAME TIME<br />
IN AUSTRALIA BEING IN A POSITION WHERE NOTHING WAS DONE THAT WAS IN<br />
ANY SENSE CONSISTENT WITH OR RELEVANT TO THAT GRAND SORT OF APPROACH.<br />
NOW I SAY THIS THAT WE HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE MODEST IN OUR APPROACH<br />
YOU WILL RECALL THAT THE TWO THINGS THAT I HAVE SAID IN MY<br />
INTERNATION PROJECTION ON THIS ISSUE. FIRSTLY TO WELCOME THE CALL<br />
THAT HAS BEEN MADE BY OTHERS, PRIMARILY BY PRIME MINISTER NAKASONE<br />
AND SPECIAL U. S. TRADE' 1REPRESENTATIVE BOCH WHO HAVE CALLED FOR A NEW<br />
MTN ROUND. THE FIRST THING I'VE DONE IS TO WELCOME THAT , CALL AND<br />
SUPPORT IT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT FOR A GREAT TRADING NATION LIKE<br />
AUSTRALIA IT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THAT WE FREE UP THE<br />
INTERNATIONAL TRADING SYSTEM.<br />
SECONDLYi THE SPECIFIC INITIATIVE, IF YOU LIKE9 WITH WHICH I'VE BE--EN<br />
ASSOCIATED IS TO SAY IN THAT CONTEXT WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN<br />
IDENTIFY AS PART OF THE REGION A REGIONAL INTEREST IN THE APPROACH<br />
THAT OUGHT TO BE ADOPTED TO SUCH AN MTN ROUND IF IT IS TO<br />
EVENTUATE. AND SO I HAVE SENT ROUND MY REPRESENTATIVES IN ADVANCE<br />
OF THIS TRIP TO TALK WITH THE COUNTRIES IN THE REGION. WE'VE GOT<br />
A VERY POSITIVE RESPONSE TO THAT AND SO FAR ON MY OWN VISIT TO THE:<br />
TWO COUNTRIES THAT I'VE VISITED JAPAN AND KOREA I CAN SAY THAT<br />
THERE IS A VERY WARM AND POSITIVE RESPONSE. I BELIEVE WE'LL GET<br />
THE SAME RESPONSE IN THE COUNTRIES THAT WE'RE STILL To GO0 TO.<br />
AND THEN FOLLOWING MY VISIT THEN I BELIEVE WE'LL BE AT A<br />
RELATIVELY EARLY STAGE IN THE POSITION FOR OUR OFFICIALS THEN TO<br />
MEET WITH THE COUNTRIES OF THIS REGION SO THAT WE CAN REALLY THEN<br />
GET DOWN TO SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT WILL BE OF INTEREST TO<br />
AUSTRALIA AND THE COUNTRIES OF OUR REGION TO PUT ON THE AGENDA OF<br />
SUCH AN MTN ROUND. SO I THINK THERE YOU HAVE A VERY CLEAR<br />
DISTiNCTION BETWEEN * rHE B3ROAD APPROACH, IF YOU LIKE, A Q~ UITE<br />
UNREALISTIC APPROACH OF MY PREDECESSOR, AND A VERY SPECIFIC WAY IN<br />
WHICH WE'VE GONE ABOUT IT. </p>
<p>THE SECOND POINT THAT I WOULD MAKE TO DISTINGUISH OUR GOVERNMENT<br />
FROM THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT IS THAT WE RECOGNISE THAT YOU CANT TALK<br />
ABOUT THESE ISSUES OF AUSTRALIA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE REST OF THE<br />
WORLD IN THE TRADING CONTEXT AS THOUGH THAT IS ONE ISSUE. I'VE<br />
TRIED TO MAKE THE POINT THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A TOTALLY<br />
INTEGRATED APPROACH TO THESE THINGS IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IT WORK<br />
WITHIN AUSTRALIA IN POLITICAL AND IN ECONOMIC TERMS. IN OTHER WORDS<br />
WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF OUR INDUSTRY, WE HAVE TO TALK<br />
ABOUT OUR MACROECONOMIC POLICIES, WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT OUR<br />
EDCUATION POLICIES IN A WAY WHICH OUT OF CONSULTATION WITH ALL THE<br />
RELEVANT ELEMENTS MEANS THAT WE CAN GET A DEGREE OF PUBLIC<br />
UNDERSTANDING AND ACCEPTANCE OF THE NEED FOR CHANGE CAN NEVER<br />
BE IMPOSED BY GOVERNMENTS FROM ON TOP. THE ROLE AND THE FUNCTION OF<br />
GOVERNMENT, AND A CONCERNED GOVERNMENT, IS IF YOU LIKE TO EXPOSE THE<br />
FACTS OF THE WORLD TO THE PEOPLE. WE STARTED TO DO THAT IN THE<br />
SUMMIT AND WE WERE PROFOUNDLY SUCCESSFUL. AS FAR AS OUR<br />
AUSTRALIAN SITUATION IS CONCERNED. WE STARTED THERE THE PROCESS OF<br />
PUTTING THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC SITUATION INTO A WORLD CONTEXT AND<br />
WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLAIN, TO CONSULT, SO THAT THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
ELECTORATE WILL UNDERSTAND THAT IF FOR OUR CHILDREN AND THEIR<br />
CHILDREN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE SORT OF ECONOMY WHICH OFFERS THE<br />
BEST OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH AND FOR EMPLOYMENT, THAT CHANGES WILL<br />
HAVE TO OCCUR OUT OF CONSULTATION. AND THAT WHAT YOU'RE DO IN<br />
REGARD TO THE STRUCTURE OF INDUSTRY OR TARIFFS IS BUT A PART OF A<br />
WHOLE AND THAT IS A BASIC DISTINCTION IN OUR APPROACH TO THAT OF<br />
OUR PREDECESSORS.<br />
JOURNALISTI MR HAWKE ARE YOU CLAIMING THAT THERE WONT EVEN BE<br />
ANY SHORT TERM JOB LOSS AS THE ECONOMY RESTRUCTURES UNDER THE NEW<br />
PROPOS ALS.<br />
P. M: NO, IM NOT SAYING " nAT. I REFERRED TO THE STEEL INDUSTRY<br />
THAT THERE WERE JOB LOSSES HISTORICALLY. BUT WHAT I SAID IS THAT<br />
IF YOU APPROACH THE SITUATION SENSIBLY THAT YOU CAN ARREST VERY OFTEN<br />
BY STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENTS, YOU CAN ARREST THE PROCESS OF JOB LOSS.<br />
YOU DONT HAVE TO THINK OF ADJUSTMENTS AS BEING ASSOCIATED WITH JOB<br />
LOSS. IT MEANS THAT WHAT WE DID IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY SHOWS THAI<br />
SENSIBLE ADJUSTMENT PRf'CESSES, CONSULTATIVELY UNDERTAKEN, CAN BE<br />
ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALVATION OF JOBS.<br />
IF YOU LOOK AT THE EXPERIENCE OF JAPAN, THERE IS A COUNTRY WHICH<br />
RIGHT THROUGH THE PERIOD OF RECESSIONi HAS MAINTAINED AMONGST THE<br />
LQWESr LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE WORLD. AND THAT HASNT MEANT<br />
IHil Al lIMES IN IHE JAPANESE EXPERIENCE THERE HASNT BEEN JOB CHANGE<br />
AlHU JUG I RAI4SFER PARTICULAR ENTERPRISE OR PARF OF THE<br />
ENTERPRISE MAY CEASE TO BE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE WAY OF DOING THINGS<br />
BUT THE WHOLE APPROACH IS TO MAKE SUE THAT THROUGH OVERALL PROCESSES<br />
OF CONSULTATION AND UNDERSTANDING AND RESTRUCTURING THAT IN NET TERMS<br />
YOU SAVE JOBS. UT IT IS THE HEIGHT OF IRRESPONSIBLITY IF WE'RE<br />
TALKING ABOUT THE PROFOUND SORT OF THINGS THAT WE ARE, THE FUTURE<br />
OF AUSTRALIA IN THIS RAPIDLY CHANGING WORLD, THE HEIGHT OF FOLLY,<br />
TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND THAT BY SAYING, OH WELL IF YOU ADOPT THIS<br />
APPROACH DOES IT MEAN THAT A A PARTICULAR POINT THERE MAY BE A LOSS<br />
OF JOB AND THE NEED FOR RETRAINING AND EDUCATION. OF COURSE IT MAY<br />
MEAN THAT. BUT WHAT YOU'VE GOT LOOK AT IS THE AGGREGATE. ARE<br />
YOU GOING TO BY ADOPTING THIS OVERALL APPROACH INCREASE THROUGH<br />
TIME THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYMENT. FUNDAMENTALLY WE'VE GOT TO<br />
REALISE WE ARE A COUNTRY OF 15 1/ 2 MILLION PEOPLE, 15 1/ 2 MILLION<br />
PEOPLE IN A WORLD OF 4.7 BILLION, AND IN A REGION OF HUNDREDS OF </p>
<p>MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN A DYNAMIC GROWTH SITUATION. NOW THE IMPERATIVE<br />
FOR GOVERNMENT IN AUSTRALIA IS TO UNDERSTAND THOSE FACTS AND IN<br />
DISCUSSION WITH AND IN FULL CONSULTATION WITH-AND NOT BY IMPOSITION<br />
IS TO ALL US TO WORK TOGETHER TO SEE HOW WE ARE GOING TO GET THE<br />
BEST ADVANTAGE FOR AUSTRALIA OF THE DYNAMISM OF THAT REGION. NOW<br />
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN BY SITTING BACK AND SAYING, OH WELL WE<br />
DONT HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THIS, WE DONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT. WE<br />
DO HAVE TO, NOT SEE IT AS A GREAT PROOBLEMv WE'VE GOT TO SEE IT AS<br />
A CHALLENGE WITH GREAT OPPORTUNITIES. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ABOUT.<br />
JOURNALIST: MR HAWKE YOU STRESSED THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE<br />
MIDDLE AND LONG TERM AND THAT WITHIN A COUPLE OF MONTHS-THE<br />
GOVERNMENT MAY BE LOOKING AT THE FUTURE OF THE CAR INDUSTRY FROM 1985<br />
ON. HOW DO THOSE TWO THINGS FIT TOGETHER, AND SECONDLYi YOU'VE<br />
ALREADY HAD FAIRLY EXTENSIVE CONSULTATIONS IN. THE CAR<br />
INDUSTRY THROUGH THE CAR INDUSTRY COUNCIL HOW FAR DO YOU SEE<br />
THE CAR -INDUSTRY AS HAVING ALREADY GONE IN THAT CONSULTATIVE<br />
PROCESS AS BROADENING A NEED FOR FURTHER CONSULTATIONS.<br />
YES, OF COURSE THERE WILL BE NEED FOR MUCH MORE<br />
CONSULTATION. YOU MAY HAVE INFERRED FROM SOME EARLIER COMMENTS THAT<br />
I WAS EXPRESSING DISSATISFACTION WITH WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE DISCUSSIONS<br />
THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE. IT'S NOT REALLY MY POSITION.<br />
I KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE THAT WERE INVOLVED IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS WENT<br />
IN IT WITH THE BEST WILL AND IT WAS PROBABLY INEVITABLE THAT<br />
THEY WERE NOT OF THEMSELVES GOING TO BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH ANSWERS<br />
THAT WERE ACCEPTABLE TO EVERYONE EVEN TO ALL THE COMPONENTS ( WHEN<br />
I SAY COMPONENTS IN THAT SENSE I'M USING THE WORD COMPONENTS<br />
OF THE INDUSTRY) BECAUSE SOME-OF THEM HAD COMPETING INTERESTS.<br />
SOME COMPANIES OBVIOUSLY HAD A DIFFERENT INTEREST TO OTHER<br />
MANUFACTURING COMPANIES AND SO ON.<br />
SO OBVIOUSLY MORE WORK HAS TO BE DONE AND THAT WILL BE DONE.. I<br />
BELIEVE THAT OUT OF THOSE PROCESSES WE WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE IN 1985<br />
TO A POSITION WHICH WILL MORE ACCEPTABLE TO THE INDUSTRY AND THE<br />
COMMUNITY. BUT I WANT TO REPEAT W'P ARE NOT GOING TO BE SITTING DOWN AND SAYING<br />
WELL LOOK, WE'VE GIVEN YOU THE OPPORTUNITY FOR TALK ? NOW~ THE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S GOING TO IMPOSE SOMETHING ON YOU. THATS NOT THE WAY<br />
WE OPERATE.<br />
JOURNALIST: SO WILL THE DECISION ITSELF BE DEFERRED TO<br />
P. M: WELL THE EXISTING PLAN TAKES US THROUGH 1984. IT'S NOW<br />
FEBRAURY OF 1984. THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME FOR MUCH MORE DISCUSSION<br />
AND THAT WILL TAKE PLACE. </p>
