    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that Hun Sen, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, will visit Australia from 9-14 October 2006.</p>
<p>I look forward to discussing with Prime Minister Hun Sen ways to strengthen our bilateral relationship, including on trade, security and law enforcement cooperation, democratic governance, development assistance and regional issues.</p>
<p>  Australia first entered into diplomatic relations with Cambodia nearly 55 years ago, and since then our bilateral relations have expanded into new areas of mutual interest.  We are working closely to combat transnational crime and Australia will be Cambodia's third largest donor of official development assistance in 2006 07.  Our merchandise trade grew by over 80 per cent in 2005 and our people to people contacts are also expanding.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hun Sen will visit Sydney, Canberra, Wagga Wagga and Melbourne during his time in Australia.  </p>
