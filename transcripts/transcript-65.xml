STATEMENT BY THE PRIME NINISTER<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, today announced the<br />
outline progrqmme of the visit to Australia during August and<br />
September of this year of Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra<br />
of Kent. ( FOR INFORMATION: This is a simultaneous announcement,<br />
together with the Premiers of the three States Her Royal Highness<br />
will visit. The Premiers will give details of the State programmes.) i<br />
Mr. Menzies said Her Royal Highness would arrive at<br />
Canberra in the afternoon of Friday August 14. She would leave for<br />
Queensland on Tuesday, August 18. he would travel by air to New<br />
South Wales on September 9. From New South Wales she would travel<br />
to Victoria on September 16. On September 23 she would fly from<br />
Melbourne to Canberra. On Thursday and Friday, September 24+/ 25,<br />
she would visit Cooma and the Snowy Mountains area before leaving<br />
Australia on September 26 to return by air to the United Kingdom.<br />
Mr. Menzies said that so far as possible Commonwealth<br />
and State Tour Organisers had tried to produce a programme which<br />
wiould achieve three things:-<br />
1. To entertain the young Princess while, at the same time,<br />
showing her as much as possible of Australia and<br />
Australian life.<br />
2. To enable as many people as possible to see Her Royal<br />
Highness during her visit.<br />
3. To ensure that Her Royal Highness enjoyed her stay in<br />
Australia, and that the programme at every opportunity<br />
contained an " accent on youth".<br />
Mr. Menzies said that three weeks of Her Royal Highness'<br />
6-week visit would be spent in Queensland, which was celebrating<br />
its centenary year. She would spend 12 days of her Queensland tour<br />
in country areas. She would spend a long week-end on a Barrier<br />
Reef Island. Her Royal Highness' visits to New South Wales and<br />
Victoria would be comparatively brief and informal.<br />
In New South Wales she would make two country visits.<br />
In Victoria she would begin her visit with a train trip from<br />
Wodonga to Melbourne. Her Royal Highness' visits to the Australian Capital<br />
Territory would be at the beginning and end of her tour. ( AN<br />
OUTLINE OF THE A. C. T. PROGRAMME IS ATTACHED.)<br />
" I am sure that Her Royal Highness will see much to<br />
interest her, and we hope that she will enjoy herself as much as<br />
we will enjoy having her with us," Mr. Menzies said.<br />
