PRIME MNAIATEU Press Statement No. 529<br />
14 July 1975<br />
CHALLENGES* TO ENVIRONMvENTAL LEGISLATION<br />
The Prime Minister and Minister for Environment,<br />
Mr E. G. Whitlam, stated today that there had been two important<br />
challenges made in the High Court to actions undertaken by the<br />
Australian Government in consequence of recent Acts of the<br />
Australian Parliament. These related to the Environmental<br />
Inquiry being held in relation to Fraser Island and to the<br />
acquisition of Towra Point, on the foreshore of Botany Bay,<br />
for nature conservation purposes.<br />
The Prime Minister said the challenge to the Fraser<br />
Island Inquiry had been taken out by parties associated with<br />
the Dillingham-Murphyores consortium when the hearing was well<br />
advanced. He said that transcripts of evidence now totalled some<br />
1,400 pages, that over 200 documents had been tabled and that the<br />
Inquiry was about to adjourn to Brisbane for the final stage of<br />
the hearing. The attitude of the consortium contrasted with the<br />
reported attitude of the Premier of Queensland, who, whilst<br />
questioning the power of the Inquiry to call witnesses and<br />
while not accepting that there was any legal obligation on the<br />
Queensland Government to present a submission, nevertheless indicated<br />
that, because of the public controversy and interest developed by<br />
the Committee of Inquiry, his government would provide the<br />
inquiry with information in the public interest.<br />
The Prime Minister went on to say that the public<br />
could draw their own inferences about the consortium's concern<br />
for environmental obligations but, because they had raised a<br />
point turning on the letter of the law regarding the scope of the<br />
inquiry, this had to be examined by the Government. Consequently<br />
to ensure that there was no ambiguity as to where the Government<br />
stood and to provide a firm legal basis for the inquiry to be<br />
carried through, he had revoked the existing direction to the<br />
Commissioners and issued a new one to them which was specifically<br />
related to the Australian Government's export powers and which,<br />
on the advice of the Attorney-General, could withstand any<br />
High Court challenge. </p>
<p>2.<br />
The new direction requires that " an inquiry be<br />
conducted in respect of all of the environmental aspects of<br />
the making of decisions by or on behalf of the Australian<br />
Government in relation to the exportation from Australia of<br />
minerals ( including minerals that have been subjected to<br />
processing or treatment) extracted or which may hereafter<br />
be extracted from Fraser Island in the State of Queensland".<br />
The Prime Minister said he hoped that the Commissioners<br />
would be able to complete hearings under these new terms as<br />
soon as practicable. He also said that he hoped the great bulk<br />
of material already gathered could be considered by the new<br />
inquiry. With respect to the challenge by the N. S. W. Government<br />
to the purchase of Towra Point for national park purposes, he<br />
said he was certainly not attracted to the proposition that the<br />
Australian Government, having regard to its status as a national<br />
government, cannot acquire a national park or national nature<br />
reserve under an enactment of the national parliament. He<br />
hoped the High Court would clarify this as soon as practicable.<br />
