A collection of contemporary Australian art, is aboutto go<br />
on exhibition in South-East Asia.<br />
Opening in Singapore on Friday, the exhibition will<br />
subsequently be seen in Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and<br />
Indonesia. It will return to Australia in mid-June.<br />
The exhibition comprises 46 paintings, prints and<br />
sculptures. It has been selected by the Commonwealth Art Advisory<br />
Board from the National Collection and private collections.<br />
This is the second opportunity for Australian art to be seen<br />
by Australia's neighbours in Asia. The first exhibition, which toured<br />
the area in 1962, showed something of the development of Australian<br />
art. The present exhibition is by way of a postscript to the sixties and<br />
a prelude to the seventies and represents the youngest generation of<br />
Australian arti~ its to have won critical acclaim.<br />
Mr James Mollison, the Exhibitions Officer of the Prime<br />
Minister' s Department and formerly Director of the Ballarat Art<br />
Gallery, will travel with the exhibition and will lecture on Australian<br />
art in the countries visited.<br />
