    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister and Premier Steve Bracks have agreed to additional assistance to help communities, small business owners and primary producers recover from the devastating damage caused by the floods in the Gippsland region of Victoria. </p>
<p>To assist small business owners and farmers, the Prime Minister and Premier have agreed to jointly funded recovery grants of up to $15,000 for eligible small businesses and primary producers.  </p>
<p>The Prime Minister and Premier Bracks have also announced the establishment of a $1,000,000 Community Recovery Fund with equal contributions from the State and Commonwealth. This fund will be used to address the needs of affected local communities in the Gippsland region for a range of economic activities such as:</p>
<p> * Grants to community service and not-for-profit organisations involved in recovery and community information activities;</p>
<p> * Tourism and small business initiatives;</p>
<p> * Economic development initiatives; and</p>
<p> * Heritage and cultural site initiatives.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commonwealth and Victorian governments will each donate $50,000 to the Gippsland Emergency Relief Fund, which is run by local volunteers.</p>
<p>"We both understand that these people need urgent financial assistance and not just talk to help them through this very difficult period."</p>
<p>Mr Bracks said it was important local business and farm communities in the affected areas were able to recover quickly.</p>
<p>This assistance is over and above the support the Commonwealth government provides under standard Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth and Victorian governments are please to be able to work together to provide this assistance in difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth and Victorian governments have a shared commitment to a quick and smooth approval process for the grants.</p>
<p>Rural Finance Corporation Victoria administers the Community Recovery Fund.   Applications can be made via the website at <a href="http://www.ruralfinance.com.au">www.ruralfinance.com.au</a>.</p>
