WORLD WILDLIFE FUND<br />
The World Wildlife Fund is expected to extend its activities<br />
to Australia next year. An Australian World Wildlife Fund will<br />
be organised and run by Australians, and the funds raised will<br />
largely be spent on Australian projects.<br />
The World Wildlife Fund ( WWF) is an international body based in<br />
Switzerland whose objective is to help to conserve the world's<br />
natural heritage, especially threatened habitat and wildlife<br />
species. It operates through national organisations which raise funds to<br />
assist nature conservation bodies, both private and governmental,<br />
with particular conservation projects.<br />
The question of establishing a World Wildlife Fund in Australia<br />
was discussed in correspondence with the conservationist Sir<br />
Peter Scott, who was Chairman of the Board of'Trustees of the<br />
World Wildlife Fund, and again at a meeting with Sir Peter Scott<br />
in London in June.<br />
In September, the President of World Wildlife Fund International<br />
Mr. John Loudon, wrote giving his support for the proposal and<br />
offering full -co-operation and assistance.<br />
I had further discussions last week with Mr. Maurice Strong, one<br />
of WWF's International Trustees and former Executive Director of<br />
the United Nations Environment Programme. Mr. Strong emphasised<br />
the importance which WWF attaches to establishing the organisation<br />
in Australia the only continent on which it is presently not<br />
active. I emphasised to Mr. Strong my continuing personal<br />
interest in and support for the work of the WWF. He welcomed<br />
the proposal for Australian participation, as contributing to<br />
the important task of conserving Australia's unique wildlife.<br />
Mr. Strong will att-end a meeting of the WWF Executive in<br />
Switzerland nexz -week, where it is expected that the proposal<br />
for an Australian organisation will be endorsed.<br />
If the proposal goes ahead, consultations with Australian nature<br />
conservation bodies and with community leaders will take place<br />
during the next few months. This will be followed by a visit<br />
by senior WWF officials early next year to establish an<br />
appropriate basis for the Australian organisation, which is<br />
exzDected to be launched later in 1978. / WWF </p>
<p>2<br />
WWF works closely with its sister organisation, the<br />
International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN)<br />
of which Australia is a member. IUCN provides scientific<br />
and technical advice on conservation needs and priorities.<br />
