ADDRESS<br />
THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF THE NATIONAL<br />
COUNTRY PARTY OF AUSTRALIA<br />
THE RT HON. J. D. ANTHONY M. P.<br />
iT'<br />
A MEETING OF<br />
THE FEDERAL MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE<br />
OF<br />
THE NATIONAL COUNTRY PARTY OF AUSTRALIA<br />
19TH HOLE MOTEL, CANBERRA<br />
SUNDAY_ 2ND. MARCH, 1980<br />
ii </p>
<p>I have no hesitation in saying today that the coming<br />
months of 1980 will be vital ones,' for the Liberal-National<br />
Country Party Government, and for the nation as a whole. We<br />
face an international situation made more unstable by the<br />
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and by events in irain. Therc;<br />
ipotential for further instability, and more clouds on -the<br />
international economic horizon not the least of them the<br />
steadily rising price ofooil.<br />
Against that, we need to note the new de'termination of<br />
the West,, led by the United Statep, to stand up to the<br />
Soviet Union's expansionist polio'y, and the important role<br />
in this new climate of opinion played ' by the Prime Minister.<br />
We need also to look at the invaluable economic advantages<br />
Australia has at a time of rapidly rising energy priceswith<br />
its significant if relatively temporary self-sufficiency<br />
in oil and its massive reserves of other energy resources,<br />
such as coal, gas and uranium.<br />
The challenge Australia faces in 1980 and in the years*<br />
to come is to maximise the advantage *' given by our energy<br />
resources to give security to our exsting industries and to<br />
attract new investment, new industry and new jobs. If there<br />
is any downturn or faltering in the world economy, we will<br />
share in the problems there is no doubt of that. But if<br />
we can take full advantage of our energy resources, our<br />
economic and political stability and our comparatively low<br />
inflation rate we can succeed in assisting the continued<br />
growth of the Australian economy and of rising standards of<br />
living for-all Australians.<br />
The challenge to the Government is to decisively confirm<br />
a course for what could well prove to be the most important<br />
decade in Australia's history. In the 1980s the nation will<br />
make decisions with profouhd implications for its future,<br />
for those Australians who are children now, and for those<br />
not yet born. The availability of jobs for coming generations<br />
will depend very much on the decisions we make in the next<br />
few years decisions about how we respond to the technological<br />
changes under way or coming, about the way we educate our<br />
children, about the way we develop our natural resources,<br />
and about the way we trade in the products of our land,<br />
mines and factories.<br />
The policies of the Coalition Government and its achievements<br />
since 1975 have already set Australia on a successful course<br />
for the 1980s. The particular challenge of the coming<br />
months, in this election year, is to ensure that this course<br />
for the decade is recognised, accepted and put into-practice. / 2 </p>
<p>The cornerstone of economic success and social stability<br />
for Australia will be and must-remain the control of inflation.<br />
Another major aim in the economic area is the further reduction<br />
o-f taxes on earnings, both of individuals and companies. At<br />
the same time, we face. the competing-and also important<br />
demands of reducing the deficit the amount the Government<br />
borrows in competition with the private sector and maintaining<br />
spending in important areas of Government activity. These<br />
Are economic policies which have been vital for many years<br />
and will remain so. A further demand has been imposed on<br />
the Australian Government and the governments of oil-consuming<br />
nations around the world by the oil supply an' pricing<br />
uncertainties of the last few years.<br />
As a result.-of this situation, the Government introduced<br />
a policy which at first received bipartisan support of<br />
pricing Australian crude oi4L at world parity. Since the<br />
introduction of that policy, there have been substantial<br />
increases in the price of'oil, and thus of the price paid by<br />
Australians for fuel. As Leader of the National Country<br />
Party* I am made aware daily-of the concern of country people<br />
at rising fuel prices. I take this opportunity, however, of<br />
stating that although the Government recognises the concern,<br />
and sympathises with it, it will not 7 it cannot alter the<br />
policy of pricing Australian oil at import parity. I believe<br />
that for the Government to do so would be to abandon its<br />
responsibility to the nation, not just now but in the future,<br />
and in the end would bring about a great deal more harm than<br />
today's fuel prices could ever bring.<br />
However much the rural sector, and other industries<br />
which depend on liquid fuel, dislike current fuel prices,<br />
they need to under tand that they have more to gain from the<br />
success of the policy, and more to lose from any failure to<br />
pursue it, than anyone else. Farmers, in fact, should be<br />
speaking more loudly than anyone else in support and defence<br />
of this policy. They can be". sure that the Government will<br />
stick to the policy. There is no other policy it can realistically<br />
and responsibly follow.<br />
Last week we saw the go-ahead given for the Rundle oil<br />
shale project the first big alternative-energy breakthrough<br />
flowing from import parity pricing. in the years to come,<br />
when Australia's farmers and transport operators are running<br />
their trucks, tractors and harvesters on Rundle fuel, there<br />
will be few complaints about the policy which made Rundle<br />
viable. Without import parity pricing for ' new' oil a<br />
policy introduced by the Whitlam Government after continuing<br />
pressure from the Liberal Party and National Country Party<br />
th-e oil at Rundle would stay in the ground. Import parity.<br />
4 pricing is the key which will unlock this massive reserve of<br />
oil and the otherswhich I am sure will follow. It is*<br />
also the key that will help give us fuel from coal and from<br />
crops. 3 </p>
<p>This aspect of energy development the encouragement<br />
of alternatives is one of the important objectives of the<br />
import parity pricing policy. The price arrangements for<br />
' newt oil are boosting exploration, and the arrangements for<br />
told' oil arc fosteriag fuel conservation aud raLiunaii<br />
dIecisions about fuel type,,, cis well as cricouvaging the<br />
recovery from the ground of oil which previously could not<br />
be economically produced. No one is happy about rising fuel<br />
costs, but we all have a stake in seeing that fuel does not<br />
run out. This is especiaelly true of people like farmers and<br />
transport operators, who are 100% dependent on portable<br />
fuels. Availability of fuel, in the end, will be far more<br />
important than price. We must develop other 1-nergy sources,<br />
and they will not be developed unless people are assured of<br />
getting a price that will make de. elopinent economically<br />
viable. Import parity pricing does just that.<br />
The Government's firm stand on this policy has been<br />
recognised and shown to be vital. Our firm stand on the<br />
major global issue of the day the Soviet invasion of<br />
Afghanistan is equally vital.<br />
The ALP has mounted a campaign of slogans and empty<br />
gestures to attempt to hide its unwillingness or inabilityto<br />
reach any consensus at all on eff~ ctive action against<br />
the Soviet Union. It's a campaign which will not succeed.<br />
It's a campaign which depends on hysteria and ignorance.<br />
Australians have seen through it as yet another knee-jerk<br />
reaction from a Labor Party so conditioned to internal<br />
dissension that it is only able to unite in opposition to<br />
the Government. Labor parliamentarians seem to think that they can best<br />
serve the interests of sportsmen and women, and presumably<br />
what they see as -the national interest, by yelling abuse at<br />
the Government. It's no coincidence that -three of those the<br />
Labor Party sees as its top,. men I refer to Mr. Hayden, Mr.<br />
Keating and Mr. Young are among the most adept in the<br />
party at just that tactic.<br />
The low point in this mindless, demeaning exercise came<br />
in Parliament last week. We heard then some of the most<br />
vituperative, bitter and personal attacks it has ever been<br />
my misfortune to witness. The principal target of all this<br />
foul language was the Prime Minister, who is of course, the<br />
man who has done most in Australia to respond effectively to<br />
the Russian invasion of Afghanistan, and whose political<br />
courage and leadership have been responsible for Australia's<br />
part in moves for an effective international drive to bring<br />
home to the Russians-the revulsion of the free world at<br />
their actions. / 14<br />
~ 7 </p>
<p>That s eems to be why they hate him most. He has acted<br />
and led while they have fumbled and squabbled. You only<br />
have to look at some of the language used in Parliament last<br />
week to see the depth of the Opposition's bitterness on this<br />
issue. On 28th February, Mr. Keating, for example, in one<br />
speech called the Pririe Minister a " Imako shark", a " Judas",<br />
" a phoney", " a humbug", and so on. A whole catalogue of<br />
spleen. This behaviour was rightly condemned as deplorable<br />
by the community. For the Labor Party, these violent outbursts<br />
against the nation's leader were the explosion of the frustration<br />
and division which had been building up since the Russian<br />
troops went into Afghanistan. The Prime MiRister said,<br />
quite rightly on February 26th, and it is worth quoting:<br />
" There has been a thread througWV the Australian Labor Party<br />
which, quite plainly, has wanted to find excuses for the<br />
Soviet Union's actions. If it has not been a question of<br />
finding excuses for the Soviet Union's actions, it has been<br />
a question of finding reasons why we should do nothing".<br />
Those two sentences summarise exactly what is going on<br />
in the Labor Party over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.<br />
It is very easy to find the thread in the Labor Party trying<br />
to make excuses for the invasion. The great majority of<br />
Labor Party members, however, are as strongly opposed to<br />
what the Soviets did, what they are doing in the world, as<br />
any of us. The Labor Party and the Government may be in<br />
dispute about some of the ramifications of the Afghanistan<br />
situation, and the Government sees a graver threat to world<br />
peace arising from the i nvasion than the Labor Party does,<br />
but essentially, our positions are litLtle different.<br />
Where we do differ is in our response to the Soviet<br />
invasion. The Government has condemned thu invasion, has<br />
considered a response, announced it arid acted on it. The<br />
Labor Party has condemned the invasion it is unable to<br />
respond. As I have said and as the Prime Minister has said;<br />
the Labor Party says it wants to act to protest to the<br />
Soviets, but cannot agree to support action which would have<br />
impact. All it can agree to do is criticise, misrepresent<br />
and try to distort everything the Govern-m-rrt -do-es. Inst-ead<br />
of constructive proposals it offers abuse, meaningless<br />
slogans and catchcries, empty gestures.<br />
The Labor Party has comriitted itself to opposing Australia's<br />
part in what we believe will be an effective boycott by much<br />
of the free world of the Moscow Olympics. It has not done<br />
this because it believes a boycott would not be effective.<br />
Mly Hayden and many ofr his colleagues have said it would be<br />
effective, again and a gai n. it has opposed Australian<br />
participation in such a boycott because it cannot unite sufficiently<br />
to support any action at all, apart from blindl1y opposing<br />
the Government, and because it believes its ernpLy response<br />
and its empty slogans might win a few votes. </p>
<p>On the other hand,,-the Labor Party has called for<br />
unsupported Australian boycotts of trade to the Soviets.<br />
Again, it has not done this because it believes that such<br />
boycotts are effective. Again, Mr. Hayden and his colleagues<br />
have said they would not work, over* and over.<br />
The Labor Party believes an effective Olympic boycott<br />
would work but it opposes Australian participation in efforts<br />
to achieve that boycott. Yet in the clearest demonstration<br />
of the effects of its own ideological split personality, it<br />
believes Australia should impose'unsupported boycotts on<br />
trade while saying they would be: . useless, and in fact harmful<br />
to Australia. No-one denies that our athletes will be hard-hit by a<br />
boycott of the Olympics.. It is a tragedy that world events<br />
have made it necessary tp propose such an action. But I<br />
stress that such a boycott will be the single most telling<br />
blow the countries of the free world can~ strike at the<br />
. Soviets. Russia could shrug off even a total embargo of its<br />
imports from Australia with no more effort than a cat shaking<br />
water off its foot. It could conceal from its people the<br />
fact that such a boycott had ever occurred.<br />
It could not conceal the absence of many ( of the world's<br />
leading sporting nations from the Moscow Olympics. The<br />
Government knows this and the Opposition knows it.<br />
The six points for a bi-partisan policy, announced last<br />
week by Mr. Hayden, cannot get the Labor Party off the hook<br />
it has hung itself on. The Government would welcome a bipartisan<br />
policy. Nothing could be better for the national<br />
interest and for Australia's significant part in the international<br />
effort to protest to the Soviets. But Mr. Hayden's proposals<br />
are phoney. Mr. Hayden talks about linking an Olympic boycott<br />
with a trade boycott. That's just an excuse for doing<br />
nothing. Mr. Hayden does not believe in unsupported trade<br />
boycotts himself. -He knows the harm that would -do to Australia,<br />
and has said so, repeatedly. But he tries to stop an Olympic<br />
boycott, which he knows would work.<br />
Mr. Hayden must call a halt to all the talk, rein in<br />
his colleagues and show some real leadership. He has to end<br />
the empty gestures and the raftting and vicious abuse. There<br />
is far too much at stake, for Australia and the free world.<br />
If Mr. Hayden cannot bring himself and his party's warring<br />
factions together to accept the basis for a genuine bipartisan<br />
policy, he should stand down and let someone replace<br />
him who is willing to try. </p>
<p>Earlier, I spoke of some of the policies we will need<br />
to carry Australia successfully into the 1980s. It is also<br />
worth looking at how we as a nation are shaping up and I<br />
do not think the picture could be much more encouraging.<br />
Almost wherever you look in the economy today, there are<br />
clear signs of a return to prosperity after the three hard<br />
years of Labor misrule.<br />
The outlook for Au-stralia's farmers is better than it<br />
has been for many, many years. * Their improved circumstances<br />
are again helping the economic fortunes of the rest of the<br />
nation, with much of the recovery in the economy the result<br />
of higher rural incomes, and this higher rural spending.<br />
Market conditions for sugar, wo ' l6, wheat and beef are very<br />
bright. All these things have not occurred by accident, as<br />
I am sure you realise.<br />
They are the result'-of a number of things, including<br />
the way in which the Government, and the members of this<br />
Party, have worked to improve the basis of those industries.<br />
For example, I have devoted'a great deal of time and effort,<br />
along with the Prime Minister and other Ministers, to negotiating<br />
a better deal for Australia's farmer s in the Multilateral<br />
Trade negotiations and elsewhere. We have achieved significantly<br />
greater access to world markets for Australian primary<br />
products. For the minerals and energy sectors-of the Australian<br />
economy, the opportunities offered by the 1980s are unparalleled.<br />
New resources projects or expansionls to existing projects,<br />
either under way or planned in Australia now, arc valued at<br />
total of $ 20 milo. In 1979, overall mining export<br />
prices were up about 20 per cent on 1978, and volumes were<br />
up 4I. 5 per cent. Re-emerging confidence is demonstrated by<br />
a marked increase in mining investment, which has risen from<br />
$ 500 million in 1976-77 to $ 800 million in 1977-78 and<br />
$ 1,150 million in 1978-7a. ' A recent survey by the Australian<br />
Mining Industry Council forecasts a -further 22 per cent rise<br />
in capital expenditure in the industry this financial year.<br />
Estimates suggest that our net energy exports, now running<br />
at about 22 million tonnes of oil equivalent a year, will<br />
increase to about 300 million tonnes a year by 1990. On<br />
these figures, we will be one of the world's major energy<br />
suppliers. In the field of increased processing, the major developments<br />
have been in alumina/ aluminium, with a number of forecasts<br />
suggesting that aluminium will be onie of the fastest-growing<br />
mineral-based industries in the next 20 years. Our aluminium<br />
smelting capacity is expected to increase from about 250,000<br />
tonnes a year to about 1.2 million tonnes a year b~ y 1985,<br />
making us one of the world's major producers. Capital<br />
spending in aluminium projects in the 1980s could reach<br />
$ 3,500 million, with total spending in the baixite/ alumina/ aluminium<br />
areas going over $ 5,000 million. / 17 </p>
<p>In other areas, too, the outlook is brighter than it<br />
has been for a long time.<br />
I know there is coflcuvii i1ou-: UciQ. 0 L L<br />
concern fully shared by the Government, andl by myscif Personialy.<br />
But it is worthwhile pointing out that there are now more<br />
people with jobs in Australia than ever before. The number<br />
of civilian employees ir-6 Australia went over five million<br />
for the first time in October 1979. The seasonal peak in<br />
unemployment in January was down on the peak reached the<br />
previous January, and did not disguise the uqpderlying improvement<br />
in the job situation.<br />
I welcome the upward direction to the economy as a<br />
response to the Government's economic management. The great<br />
majority of Australians have the commonsense and foresight<br />
to demand firm and resporfsible decisions from their pblitical<br />
leaders and that is what they are getting. Our success in<br />
controlling inflation through firm restraint has put Australian<br />
industry in the box seat in a tough, highly-competitive<br />
world. It would be a tragedy if that advantage and the<br />
progress we have made were thrown away by politicians who<br />
lacked the resolve to stick to neces'sary policies. We need<br />
a Government that puts the nation's interests ahead of all<br />
else not one which puts outdated slogans and philosophies<br />
at the top of its priorities. </p>
