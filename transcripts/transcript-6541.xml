PRIME MINISTER'S REMARKS AT RECEPTION IN HONOUR OF THE<br />
1985 UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL, 6 NOVEMBER 1984<br />
YOUR EXCELLENCIES, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,<br />
' In January 1985, Australia will begin a two-year period as<br />
a member of the United Nations Security Council.<br />
I thought it appropriate to invite here today<br />
representatives of those countries with wifom we will be<br />
working on this important body, of other countries which<br />
will be shortly completing their p eriods of service on the<br />
Security Council, and representatives of Australian<br />
institutions, public and private, which have a major<br />
interest in the United Nations and in problems confronting<br />
the international community, in order to outline how<br />
Australia approaches its task on the Security Council.<br />
Notwithstanding the legitimate criticisms to which the<br />
United Nations is subject, our Government regards it as a<br />
uniquely valuable institution in world affairs in providing<br />
a forum for the expression of the aspirations of the<br />
peoples of the world for peace, justice, equality and<br />
political, social and economic advancement.<br />
As the authors of the UN Charter put it, the peoples of the<br />
United Nations are determined:<br />
to save succeeding generations from the scourge of<br />
war, which twice in our life-time has brought untold<br />
sorrow to mankind;<br />
to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the<br />
dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal<br />
rights of men and women of nations large and small;<br />
to establish con dcitions under which justice and<br />
respect for the obligations arising from treaties and<br />
other sources of international law-. can be maintained;<br />
and to promote social progress and better standards of<br />
life in larger freedom.<br />
One hundred and forty-six members of the United Nations<br />
voted in favour of Australia's election to the Security<br />
Council. We are extremely proud of and honoured by this<br />
strong support and I believe that it is an expression of<br />
the credibility and respect which Australia's international<br />
activity has earned in the hands of this Government, , and<br />
particularly of Bill Hayden and his officers.<br />
The Security Council is charged specifically with,-the<br />
maintenance-of international peace and security.. This is<br />
an enormous responsibility., Regrettably, the-Council's<br />
record ff ulf T-1ling' its t'ole?-f lls., fax. sho0tVo, the hopesof<br />

Australia does not conclude from this that making the<br />
Council more effective is a task beyond achievement. To<br />
the contrary, we believe that, in our increasingl1y<br />
interdependent world, there is no sensible alternative to<br />
multilateral efforts to solve problems, least of all on<br />
issues of international peace and security.<br />
Australia will approach its term on the Security Council in<br />
this spirit and with the highest sense of responsibility.<br />
We see membership of the Council as an opportunity to<br />
pursue our obligations under the United Nations Charter and<br />
as a challenge to join in the effort to make the Council<br />
what its originators envisaged and what it SO clE-arly needs<br />
to be an effective instrument for the containMEnt of<br />
existing conflicts and for the prevention of new conflicts.<br />
we believe that the Security Council continues to have an<br />
important role in seeking to moderate international tension<br />
and conflict wherever they may arise. Whether the United<br />
Nations is involved in Southern Africa, where the injustice<br />
of apartheid continues to foster violence and to affront<br />
the world community, or the Middle East, or Indochina, I<br />
would like to assure our fellow-members of the 1985<br />
Security Council that they will find Australia a cooperative,<br />
responsible and honest partner in efforts to<br />
bring about peace and reconciliation.<br />
I should like to address some particular remarks to the<br />
five Permanent Members of the Security Council, who happen<br />
also, by a symmetry not envisaged by the UN's founding<br />
fathers, to be the world's five nuclear weapons powers.<br />
The effectiveness of the Security Council is heavily<br />
dependent on the degree of commitment on the part of the<br />
five Permanent Members to make it work. And this in turn<br />
depends heavily on the state of relations between them,<br />
particularly, of course, between the United States and the<br />
Soviet Union.<br />
Despite some recent encouraging developments not~ ably the<br />
talks in Washington in October between President Reagan,<br />
Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign<br />
Minister Gromyko -( US-Soviet relations remain very<br />
strained. This is most starklj reflected in the complete<br />
absence of bilateral negotiations to.. control and reduce the<br />
nuclear arsenals and to deal with the militarisation of<br />
outer space, a development that we see as fraught with<br />
great risk and uncertainty.<br />
This situation has understandably, and rightly, given rise<br />
to feelings of great concern and anxiety all over the<br />
world. The Australian Government-has sought to address'<br />
these issues realistically. Given the existence of massive<br />
nuclear-arsenals, the first concern must be to prevent<br />
nuclear-. war through preserving a state of stable mutual<br />
deterre * nce. Australia, as an aligned nation, is in a<br />
position to contribute directly to this objective and we<br />
have consciously shouldered this responsibility. </p>
<p>3<br />
There is, however, a second imperative. We know from<br />
investigations into the probable effects of nuclear war<br />
and from the professional consensus that the prospects of<br />
keeping such a war limited are very poor that crossing<br />
the nuclear threshold may be the last thing we ever do. In.<br />
stark contrast to past wars between the major powers, the<br />
world may not again be given a second chance.<br />
The dangers inherent in this situation are only too<br />
obvious. we cannot afford to accept deterrence based on<br />
massive nuclear arsenals as a permanent solution.<br />
Notwithstanding the fact that nuclear weapons have not been<br />
used since 1945 it would be foolish in the extreme to stake<br />
our future on the perpetual infallibility of nuclear<br />
deterrence. It follows that the negotiatioi of agreements to<br />
progressively reduce the nuclear arsenals is of supreme<br />
importance. The agreements must, of course, be balanced<br />
and effectively verifiable if these fundamental<br />
requirements are neglected, stability would be jeopardised<br />
and the negotiating process difficult to sustain. But<br />
these are not insurmountable obstacles. Given the<br />
horrendous consequences of nuclear war and the global<br />
yearning for nuclear disarmament, the mutual concessions<br />
necessary to produce balanced and effectively verifiable<br />
agreements can and must be made.<br />
The control and reduction of the nuclear arsenals is the<br />
pivotal security issue of our time. In the absence of<br />
progress on this issue and in the international political<br />
atmosphere that accompanies that lack of progress the<br />
resolution of other issues that threaten international<br />
peace and security is rendered exceedingly difficult if not<br />
impossible.<br />
The nuclear weapon states alone do not have the right to<br />
determine the destiny of mankind. Every nation has the<br />
right and the responsibility to be heard on the<br />
fundamental issues of nuclear war and nuclear disarmament<br />
and Australia is determined to exercise this right to the<br />
full.<br />
The competition in nuclear weapons is a threat to the<br />
security of every nation on earth. * The-stability of the<br />
nuclear relationship is constantly challenged by.<br />
technological developments. In addition there is the<br />
ever-present risk of the further horizontal proliferation<br />
of nuclear weapons, a risk that is heightened by unceasing<br />
vertical proliferation by th e existing nuclear weapons<br />
states. The degree of stability i n the nuclear<br />
relationship that these states have managed to preserve<br />
could be very severely stressed if the number of<br />
inde pendent players increased further.'<br />
Australia has been a vigorous * advocate of renewed<br />
negotiat ions to control and reduce-the nuclear arsenals and<br />
of greater efforts to strengthen the international nonproliferation<br />
regime. However, Australia, and other<br />
countries like ours, can only do so much. Special<br />
responsibility necessarily resides with the nuclear weapons<br />
states. </p>
<p>On behalf of the Australian Government, I must say frankly<br />
that the response to date of the nuclear powers has not<br />
matched the genuine and legitimate concerns of millions of<br />
ordinary people around the world.<br />
Forty years after the Second World War, the people of the<br />
world, and certainly the people of Australia, yearn for a<br />
real peace a peace that is more than a mere absence of<br />
war.. This is particularly the heart-felt plea of our young<br />
people. They would like to see their leaders unite against<br />
a common enemy the threat of thermonuclear extinction.<br />
The matter is urgent but we must approach it in a spirit of<br />
confident determination and of persistence. We cannot<br />
afford to become despondent or desperate. Rather, through<br />
practical and realistic measures of international cooperation<br />
we must look for ways to lessen this danger which<br />
faces us all.<br />
In conclusion, let me repeat that the Australian<br />
Government's readiness to undertake the obligations of<br />
membership of the Security Council reflects our commitment<br />
to the United Nations and our determination that Australia<br />
should make a worthwhile contribution to its role in the<br />
maintenance of international peace and security'. </p>
