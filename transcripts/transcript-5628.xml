FRIME'MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIAFRIDAY, 7 AUGUST, 1981<br />
ADMM1ES TOFTRE INUGURA LFMT1NGCF THE<br />
POLICY ASSEMBLY OF THE VICTORIAN DI1VISION<br />
OF THE LIBER&amp; L PARTY<br />
I felstrongly the responsibtity yca-have put upon-me by-*-<br />
0 inviting me to this Inaugural Meeting of the Policy Assembly. K<br />
I believe that this Assembly can make a valuable contribution<br />
to the Liberal Party as a sour-ce of paricy ideas andproposals<br />
and as a significant Liberal voice On topical issues. v<br />
Our Party has always been determined te-rovide effa-e_" ve<br />
opportunities f or its mnembers. to express their views on<br />
policy arna to have those views heard. The resolutions of this<br />
Assembly will be regarded with greatattention--by the<br />
Parliamentary Parties at both Federal and State levels,<br />
Prom my own point of view the closest-consultation with t he_<br />
organisation and the detailed and candid communIcation which<br />
is a product of that closeness are absolutely invaluable.<br />
With a State election on the horizon, it is u 1eJflmPortaft than<br />
ever that there be close consultation between the State and<br />
Federal Parliamentary Parties and. the Party orgamiisation...<br />
The recently established tripartite meetings involving theF<br />
organisation, Lindsay Thompson and myself, together with othe~ r<br />
_, J~ jistrs. areextremely valuable, and provide a practical -basin.<br />
for on-going consultation. I am very happy to say that these<br />
N~ U~ meetings arose-out of i-nitiatives. taken . by some members of te<br />
formrer State Executive.___<br />
I believe that a willingness to consult, both formally arid..<br />
informally, is a great.-strength of the Libexal. Party -for provided 3<br />
* Tt the consultative process is linked with adequate<br />
decision-making procedures, wide consultation must improve the<br />
guality of policy. IWhat<br />
I would like to discuss with you tonight is the formation<br />
ofI pleiec asn smweh a ky plic-isues or ustali<br />
_-7w the eighties and beyond.<br />
We must never forget that the future of Australia lies very much<br />
-1 tehands of the Liberal Party. -We are the only party with<br />
anational outlook, representing all sections of the Australian<br />
community, all regions, all States; and I am sure I speak for all<br />
Liberal Parliamentarians when I re-emophasise something that I<br />
first said on being elected to Parliament in 1955, namely that<br />
while I am elected by Liberal voters, I always have and always<br />
will-seek to,-re(% pre sent every mCember Of the community. </p>
<p>4 -2-<br />
In addition, ours is the only Party withY a realistTLrand plraztical<br />
philosophy, whose basic values and principles are those of most<br />
Australians. The responsibility falls on us as a Party to determine the<br />
objectives we will pursue and the actions by which they can be<br />
~~ ai3eved. On the wisdom of those decisions-will deei dnot .61ey<br />
t~ elivin -standards and opportunities of mill~ ions of Australians,<br />
not Merely the capacity of Australia to play a humanitarian and<br />
constructive role in the wider world, but t-he futur-e-the-<br />
Australian way of life, including our own security and that of<br />
orchildren. It is in this perspective that the real work of<br />
this Policy Assembly must be viewed.<br />
TeLiberal Party owes much of its success to its belief that the<br />
single ' most important objective of policy is to ruppn= ELthe._ wo th,<br />
the dignity and the freedom of individual people. our belief that<br />
* 4people should have the freedom to make their own decisions and live<br />
~ their own lives, and our belief that Goverrnment haa~ aLactiY.! exole<br />
to play in protecting people's freedom and enlarging their<br />
-opportunities, are both based on our recognition that the individual<br />
person must be our px'itary concern. After all, the life of a nation<br />
4-is nothing apart from the lives of its people for it is the way<br />
ñ-that Australians live their lives which makes Australia the nation<br />
that it is.<br />
Our concern for people is expressed -very obviously in our support<br />
for individual rights through the Ombudsman, the Administrative<br />
7Appeals Tribunal, the Industrial Relations tureau, and the<br />
Human Rights Conmission lpegislation; it is expressed in our support<br />
for Aboriginal policies based on the principle of self-management<br />
rather than State paternalism; it is expressed in the support -e<br />
give to culture and the arts, as well as in educational systems<br />
designed to meet the needs and aspirations of all, Australians;<br />
is expressed in our income security programm-es, which provi~ le<br />
bai euity to all Australians who need assistance, while<br />
Ooverwhelmingly leaving to beneficiaries themselves the ch * oice of<br />
how the benefits are to be spent; it is expressed in our rejecti n<br />
f -laisseZ f aire attitudes, and in the large body of legislation,<br />
both State and Federal, designed to protect people against powerful<br />
Jlnstitutena-and-organisations; and it is expressed in our conoern<br />
for the protection of the environment, which arises Very nuuh from<br />
-the recognition that a polluted and degraded laL d diminishes the<br />
-lives-of us all.<br />
Again, in foreign affairs, it is the Liberal Party which is providing<br />
* leadership in demonstrating that our concern for theñ nMividualcannot<br />
stop at Australia'z shores. Let there be no mistake the<br />
reputation we establish for Australia, with the-developing countries<br />
in Particul~ ar, will have a significant impact indeed on the kind of<br />
future that we secure for our childrten. ./ 3 71 11.<br />

<p>We l ive i n a world in which about 100 aspiring new countries,<br />
many of them desperately poor, and with hardly any resources of<br />
their own* have come into existence in just a few decades. We live<br />
in a world in which the incomes of more than 800 million people<br />
are less? 1~ ii $ 200Fjer year. Most of these people have little hope<br />
of improving their own position or of achieving basic health and<br />
living conditions which we take for granted.<br />
I believe there is a growing recognition that in terms of our<br />
own values there iB an unanswerable moral and humanitarian case<br />
-as weft a~ a-aas-e based on-mErighte~ red self interest for doing<br />
more to help the poorest people of the world. Our recognition of<br />
the inherent worth of every person is also the basis of Australia's<br />
opposition to the-vile -andd repugnant-practice-of apartheid, a<br />
policy' based on the assumption that someone who is black. is worth<br />
*. less thaii someone who is white.<br />
What policy could violate Liberal principles more fundamentally?<br />
As Sir Robert Mienzies said in the 1950' s, it is a policy doomed to<br />
f ai lure but -our own feeling&amp;-vibout thea-brutality-o4f-his . policy<br />
and the history of white and black people in Africa, surely commit<br />
us to doing everything in our power to bring this policy to an end.<br />
In formulating policy, one thing which we in the Liberal Party recognise<br />
very clearly,. and it distinguishes us decisively from Labor, is the<br />
vitality of freedom in advancing peopla s dignity aQnd Beli'f-r ' espect.<br />
, Freedonm is in fact a practical necessity if we are to achiv a stable<br />
-'. and progressive society.. Freedom permits change, and thus prevents<br />
the build-up of the kinds of frustrations and tensions " w'hich are now<br />
manif est in Poland, and which are never f ar f rom. the surf ace in<br />
Socialist countries.<br />
When we think of f reedom, we of ten tend to think fl7.-st of p_ olitical.<br />
freedom as if it could exist almost in isolation. But without the<br />
freedom to spend one's own income and choose what to buy, without<br />
hefreedom to make a living or set up a busi: Kis', politic-aFl<br />
freedom can become illusory.<br />
K substantive measure of freedom of choice in education is equally<br />
essential to an adaptive and responsible educational system, and<br />
the same is true In health, in transport, in communications.<br />
ha--Tt-is why-the positive-role fu~ Government which we champion is<br />
one which leads to expansion of opportunities and choices, not one<br />
which cements monopolies, whether public or private.<br />
While freedom provides a basis for positive policies, it also imposes<br />
a healthy discipline on Governments. Our commiitmtent to freedom<br />
neans that Governments must think, twice before undertaking new_~<br />
programmes which can only be paid for through higher taxes -unless<br />
costs can be cut in other areas. 1

<p>4<br />
Liberal Governmnents must often face up to difficult questions<br />
of priorities._ Labor Governments canA.. ate~ pt-to evade issues of<br />
priorities, because they do not recognise the-costs of ever -bigger<br />
Government, costs which are paid for not only in money; but in a<br />
loss of freedom, a loss of flexibility, and a loss of the<br />
adaptiveness which freedom brings. F<br />
One of the very great achievements of the last six years has been<br />
the way in which the Feader-al Cab~ ihet has faced questions of<br />
priorities again and again and has sustained its Policy Of<br />
expenditure restraint, making possible the broadly based economic 4<br />
resurgence now taking pl-ace.-I -doubt if any Go7vernm6rieft in the world<br />
has kept up such restraint over such a long period, pulling back<br />
Government expenditure as a proportion of G. D. P. while maintaining I<br />
the kind of defence and s~ ti I security co= nzniEfts in many cases<br />
indexed -which the Government believes it should support.<br />
'~ It might ' seem easier to fory t themneed to ma) I'~ oicesamd' live<br />
with the comfortable illusions of former years that Government can<br />
' an option in which more pol-i-tical--apport is wa* tjng to-be bought 4<br />
with a new spending programmne. But the inevitable costs of living<br />
by these illusions are higher unemployment, reduced'economic growth,<br />
higher taxes and inflation-.----A Government which-fUSed to0 do wha t<br />
must be done to avoid these costs which refused to face up to<br />
the need to decide where its real priorities lie would inevitably<br />
betray its trust,--<br />
Without question, inflation remains our namber one enemy because it<br />
:.. destroys jobs and f ami ly we IlIbei ng -in the one brxx-th. Zfi-inf lationH<br />
got out of hand, we would find it almost impossible to maintain<br />
our projected growth rates or sulstain improvements in einploynmnt,<br />
and the difficulties of continnuingto... r ein back Covur ufenlt~<br />
* expenditure would be vastly compounded. The gains we have made<br />
have been won hard, and as a party we will forget: the lessons of<br />
the seventies at our peril.___<br />
Oe t me mention industrial relations as another ma3or area where<br />
Wour commitment to the individual and freedom provides both a<br />
peWrspective and a discipline on policy. we must never forge~ t that<br />
Industrial relations are relations between people, so their<br />
S-quality depends fundamentally on people's dealings with each other,<br />
~ nrelations7-1ps be: ween people in the workplace -especially the<br />
relations betwoen employers and employees.<br />
ladustriat-relations -can-be affe-oted by the framework established<br />
by institutions and laws but are not uliaeydeemndb<br />
Goverrnen-a or Government actions. If industrial relations are in<br />
fact determned fiyst and foreffo 7_ t7by th-e-quality of relations<br />
between people then the fundamental responsibility for achievingL<br />
good industrial relations mnust rest with employers and employees<br />
themselves, acting of course within the le.-a! framnework. Here, as<br />
in other spheres of life, the other side of freedom is the recognition<br />
that responsibility lies squarely on the shoulders of those<br />
who are free. </p>
<p>A At the level of relationships betweejVGuverrffmnt and both u<br />
leadership and emrployer organisations, a major emnphasis must<br />
be on consultation and co-operati. ve relationships. So much<br />
be achieved, and so much more easily-,-when there is a conyr<br />
understanding of problems and agreement to act based on that<br />
understanding. The consultation between the Govermanent and<br />
trade union movement that has been devieroping-4in recent me<br />
a good example. Regular meetings between ministers and the<br />
are now taking place and it was as a result of extensive<br />
consultation during the recent Transpe-rtor&amp; r-dispute tb.~ ionagain<br />
can the hiis-<br />
A. C. T. 1<br />
Lthe.<br />
Arising out of that dispute the Government and. the trade union<br />
movem~ ent have agreed to consult immuediately a major dispute looks<br />
like getting out of hand. I make these points to emphasise that<br />
it is possible as well as desirable to establish relationl. ps<br />
of consultation and co-operation with reasonable people who are<br />
I.* oncerned with the Imrpact of their actions on other members of<br />
ociety. Obni usly,-however, the Government must govern, or it<br />
~~ j~ iUbetray its trust, Equally obviously,, the trade union movemnent<br />
is diverse, and some union officials are more concerned with their<br />
own power than with conatation or co-operation.<br />
It is all too obvious tha~ t in some circumstances there is no easy<br />
or pleasant option and that son etimies the reasonable option<br />
will not be acceptable to the disputants, in suo KircMTsnCes,<br />
the responsibil. ity of Government to protect society means that<br />
stronq action, including the use of legal weapons, may be necessar'<br />
What alterii t7ive did Lindsay Thompson have a ouple of weeks ago<br />
in Victoria, what alternatiye did the Cort,' onwealth have at that<br />
time, but to invoke strong powers? Anything less would have been<br />
inef fectiveU. 3. f.<br />
The Government's overriding responsibility to look after the<br />
interests of the cornumnity as a whole means. not-only that no-eirrtgle<br />
group should get its way on everything,. but' also that militant<br />
jgroups may need to be restrained. Thus it is plain that aL<br />
balanced approach to industrial relations is part of the Liberal<br />
* commitment to the individual and freedom.<br />
What is true-4er inattatrial relatjeft is -true for other fields<br />
of-policy, as well. in wagei~-fixing for example, we obviously seeX<br />
Proceddres and institutions for which there is basic agreement,<br />
and which will produce basically acceptable xesultat~ o the<br />
community as awhole. Prior to the events of the past few weeks,<br />
the Commonwealth had. in fact moved to establish a major zinqidry<br />
inntoow age fixing in Australia.<br />
Our commitment to freedom and the value of the individual implies<br />
the rxe-erl for__ a system whichxi-equires all parties to take account<br />
of common interests and seek a co-operative approach; to accept<br />
their obligations to the comm unity through restraints on the one<br />
hand, and the satisfactory production of9opds and services on<br />
the other; and to recognise that a growing . economy ifs Tfie<br />
overriding interest of ua all, and especially of future generations. i<br />

The. ommon interests of employers and employees must be emphasisedso<br />
that nobody can forget that if wages are driven up beyond the<br />
capacity of companies to pay, or if companies cannot sell their<br />
goods, then fewer jobs must be the inevitable consequence.<br />
: 0 We are obviously going to be looking for a system in which industrial<br />
militancy does not pay, a system in which the benefits<br />
from national production are fairly shared, so that wage earners,<br />
investors and the needy all benefit, both financially and<br />
with new opportunities, from economic growth. These are principles<br />
w hich should be incorporated in a wage-fixing system.<br />
. i Let me refer to one other field of policy, that of tariffs and<br />
-pro tetion. A concern for the individual and for freedom<br />
obviously gives rise to a number of issues about protection, and<br />
i-one of these issues relates to the fairness of our dealings with<br />
developing countries, Australia's position in this connection<br />
needs to be viewed in perspective. For while we have substantial<br />
Slevels of protection in some areas a fact that we do not conceal,<br />
as some other countries do access to Australian markets,<br />
, s pially the access of developing countries, is both relatively<br />
high and increasing. In fact, Australia's overall imports from<br />
the ASEAN countries grew at an annual average rate of 38% between<br />
72-73 and 1979-80.<br />
In textiles and clothing, imports meet 30% of Australia's<br />
requirements, and of those imports 70% come from developing<br />
countries, especially the ASEAN nations. By comparison, these<br />
imports have only a 10% share of the market in North America and<br />
a 10-15%' share in Europe, with developing countries providing<br />
about two-thirds of those imports in both cases. In fact, even<br />
allowing for differences in population, on the latest figures<br />
available to me Australia's per capita imports of textiles and<br />
-clothing from developing countries were almost 20% greater than those<br />
of the 30% greater than Europe's, and over 100% greater<br />
than Japan's.<br />
For motor vehicles, about 25% of our market is met by imports<br />
despite our level of protection compared with imports of<br />
S of the market in the and 8% in Europe and both of those<br />
-nark-ts are seeking or have obtained voluntary export restraints<br />
by Japan.<br />
he Ichallenge for Liberals is to devise a balanced policy which<br />
' i recognises the importance of reducing protection as an expression<br />
of our fundamental concern for the individual and for freedom, and<br />
which also recognises that dramatic and unanticipated reductions<br />
in protection would inflict a level of damage on individuals and<br />
i. firms which would be inconsistent with the ideals of Liberalism<br />
tself. The Government has already taken decisions for a number<br />
~ o f i ndutries which achieve such a balance. Some twenty categories<br />
of manufactured products washing machines and refrigerators,<br />
books, iron and steel products, and ships to name a few are having<br />
heir -tariff or bounty rates reduced over a period of years as a result<br />
S. of decisions taken by the Government. / 7<br />

<p>I -7<br />
In the . area~ of . textiles, clothing and footw1-ear, we have announced<br />
a steven year programmue in which all market growth plus 1% of<br />
domestic production each year will be opened up to import<br />
The Govern~ ment will be acting to eliminate protection to<br />
Australian industry through preference in Gover-nment purchasing,<br />
except in respect of certain defence-strategic industries, and<br />
we will shortly be announcing the terms of a reference to the<br />
general reductions in protection*<br />
Our decisions in relation to protection and Government purchasing<br />
must obviously be viewed partly in the context of our overall<br />
economic strategy, of our~ ai concer~ buifltoo<br />
encouraging Australians to do the things that Australiant do best.<br />
We may.. not have gone as far or as fast as some would have wanted.<br />
But a gradual approach is obviously required-4fer it--takes time to--<br />
~. sort outithe problems that exist in these area-s, ti-me to work<br />
Wthrough to effective resolutions, time to achieve the kind of<br />
bal-ance that we seek.<br />
Liberal Government would want to contemplate decisions, which,<br />
_. Without any-tizne for-adjestment, would have a significant impact<br />
on major sources of employment opportunities in major cities and<br />
country towns: for exam'ple, Warrnanbool1, iendigo and Wollongong<br />
in the-c~-e of _ textile, clotb4ig and--footwear; or Geelong,<br />
Ballarat, and Albury-Wodonga in the. case of rotor vehicles,<br />
which is the next I. A. C. report for us to consider. Nor would we<br />
want to contemplateadecisions which would have a -similar kind of<br />
impact on the value of capital investments made by firms and their<br />
shareholders under existing policy : arrangements.<br />
There are obviously substantial problems in tffiswhole areai,<br />
problems which the Government recognises are particularly<br />
-s-ignificant in Victoria, but we must obviously proceed in a practical<br />
and balanced way, taking account of the interests as well as the<br />
.** legitimate expectations of everyone involved.<br />
in all areas of rnolicv fornmion. the Liberal approach is obviously-------'-<br />
to seek agreement as far as agreement i. s possible, to find the<br />
-course of action that benefits everybody and harm-s nobody wherever<br />
tfat is pos-sb-T. BiiE we must recognise that policy issues exist<br />
on which the search for agreement is illusory, on which the demands<br />
of different groups or individuals cannot be reconciled.<br />
7 ~ Ten overnm-e-FfEf haifeto make decisions, and cannot avoid them.<br />
f any Government always seeks the soft path, then its people will<br />
suffer. There is no-way to av61d the fact that more money to SOM&amp; e<br />
m~ ieans less for others, that a law to protect some may restrict<br />
others, that tariffs or quotas benefit some business, but increase<br />
the costs of uthers.-~ Governments must accept realities, must face<br />
the fact that tough decisions sometimes have to be made and<br />
followed through. ' I<br />
