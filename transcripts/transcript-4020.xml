TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW GIVEN TO PETER COLLINS FROM SATURDAY WEEK<br />
a<br />
COLLINS: To what extent has your life changed since you became Prime<br />
Minister?<br />
FRASER: I-think it is difficult to define because there has been a<br />
fairly slow and steady change over a long period. As a<br />
private member I used to be able. to spend-a lot more time<br />
with my family but that was very nearly 10 years ago. As a<br />
minister; and as Leader of the Opposition, it has meant more<br />
and more time. away from Nareen and, also, unfortunately, more<br />
and more time out of Wannon. Being Prime Minister just<br />
exaggerates ail'bf that. This time of the year, I suppose,<br />
more than any other time I am here'; It will be possible to<br />
get to Nareen at weekends occasionally, but probably not very<br />
often.'<br />
COLLINS: FRASER: Do you try to seal yourself off here?<br />
Well its nice to be able to seal yourself off it you can. I<br />
think anyone who. leads a fairly busy life needs some way of<br />
escaping. Fishing is one of the best ways, because there is<br />
no media, no television, no telephones and no newspapers.<br />
But a Prime Minister has to be accessible, and so we have<br />
telephones, there has to be a teleprinter put in so that if<br />
some sort of emergency arises a secure message can be got to<br />
you at a moments notice. You can't really do the job properly<br />
if you are out of contact for even 24 hours, and therefore the<br />
job has to follow you. / 2<br />

COLLINS: What has Nareen meant to you over the years?<br />
FRASER: Well it's my home. It's the family's home. I haven't spent<br />
in recent years all that much time here but above all else<br />
it's home for the family and also sometimes a refuge from<br />
politics.<br />
COLLINS: How do you think your' style of leadership is going to differ<br />
from your predecessor?<br />
FRASER: Well I don't think I'm the person to make a judgement about<br />
his style of leadership but from my government's point of view<br />
I think it is important to emphasise Cabinet responsibility,<br />
the relationship of Cabinet to the Party Room and the process<br />
of consultation with the States which has already started in a<br />
way which I don't think occurred on previous occasions, a<br />
relationship with the Public Service which I think is quite<br />
different. I trust the Public Service.-I trust the Service's<br />
integrity. Sometimes I might want ' a bit of prompting to<br />
get outside additional advice and build that in to the advice that<br />
the permanent head gives to a Minister, but generally if there<br />
is a particular problem under consideration, especially if the<br />
Minister is do that, and this can all be done<br />
harmoniously and not in the compet-itive manner that seemed to<br />
do so Jnuch damage to the Labor Government. I-think establishing<br />
a fran~ ework that is predictable so that average men and women<br />
in Australia can know what is going to happen and not be worried<br />
about ' what the Government is going to do next is important.<br />
COLLINS: Your ci-itics accuse you of being uninterested in areas likeaborigines,<br />
the arts and the environment if you like, the<br />
trendy areas. Is that so?,<br />
FRASER: I don't think that is so. I don't think the facts really bear<br />
it out, because I was a foundation member of the Conservation<br />
Foundation long before it was a trendy or popular issue.<br />
I can remember having discussions with Fr'ancis Ratcliffe in<br />
his house in Canberra as to what ought to be done to try and<br />
get Australia concerned with conservation and environmental<br />
issues. This was long before there was any Conservation </p>
<p>FRASER: CONT. COLLINS: Foundation, long before you would find journalists writing much<br />
about it in the newspapers, long before there was any real<br />
public awareness of the importance of the issue. On other<br />
issues, as Education Minister, again the record will show<br />
my Department was concerned, and that I was concerned, about the<br />
problems of education of aborigine children for example in the<br />
Northern Territory. I don't think the record would justify<br />
such a criticism.<br />
Can I ask you a personal type question? How do you go about<br />
setting goals. Do you set goals for yourself, and say I'm<br />
going to achieve this by a certain time? ' 1<br />
FRASER:-No I don't think so. The only goal you can really set yourself<br />
is to-try and do whatever job you've got at the particular<br />
time as well as you possibly can. Now there are many things<br />
involved in being Prime Minister and many different facets<br />
of government, many different policies, domestic and foreign<br />
policies, economic policy, problems'concerned with creation<br />
of opportunities, helping the disadvantaged. I don't think<br />
you c Set yourself a positive goal, that you are going to<br />
get to, a point by a certain time. It's just a question of<br />
doing the job oaq well as you can.<br />
COLLINS FRASER: Were there ever times, for instance around about 1970 when you<br />
were gelegated to the back benches after the Gorton business,<br />
when you wondered whether you'd just give up?<br />
I dont think for long. Somehow or other I don't think it<br />
would have been right to just give up. If you believe in things<br />
and if other people for better or worse happen to believe in you,<br />
you have obligations to them. You have obligations to your<br />
own electorate. You have a certain view of the kind of<br />
political party that you believe the Liberal Party was and is<br />
or-ought to be. There was a great deal to work for. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
COLLINS: Looking back on the past election campaign and the events<br />
leading up to it, to what extent were you able to plan things<br />
out, to map out the alternatives available both to you and<br />
to Mr Whitlam?<br />
FRASER: I think fairly carefully. I think Mr Whitlammade a great<br />
error. of judgement in assuming that under all circumstances<br />
the Governor-General would have to accept the Prime Minister<br />
of the days advice because, well, there's no need to revive<br />
history but I have always believed that there were circumstances<br />
in which there was an independent capacity on the part of the<br />
Governor-General in Australia, on behalf of the Queen in the<br />
United Kingdom. That proved to be correct. It was also<br />
not conceivable that the stale-mate should be allowed to<br />
continue throughout the summer months. It was never conceivable<br />
that a half Senate election was really a solution to the<br />
Constitutional difficulty that had arisen and that, if you like,<br />
was another miscalculation of Mr Whitlam's. We also thought<br />
that there was going to be difficulty until we actually got<br />
intoian election. Once an election was on, I believed that<br />
people would . focus on the economic issues, on the kind of<br />
government they had had for three years and that they would<br />
seriodsly ask'themselves whether they wanted that sort of<br />
government for the next three years. So it could be thought<br />
through, and was thought. through, fairly carefully. But you can<br />
never guarantee things in politics. It depends upon the judgement<br />
of a very large number of people.<br />
COLLINS: FRASER: 1975 has been a very spectacular year for you. What do you<br />
look forward to in 1976?<br />
I think a more predictable-world for all Australians.<br />
We want a situation Where people who have retired won't have<br />
their savings destroyed. We want to establish a situation<br />
where school leavers in the future are going to be able to<br />
get jobs, where university stu6ents are going to be able to use<br />
their skills. Now with what has been predicted and is still<br />
predicted as a result of past policies for this summer, there<br />
are going to be many people not in that situation, many<br />
school leavers, many university students who won't get the </p>
<p>FRASER CONT. COLLIN sort of job they basically want or seek. We want to establish<br />
a situation where people don't have to be worried about what<br />
the government is going to do from one day or one week to the<br />
next, where people know that the government is there to help<br />
them and not to hinder them achieving their own personal or<br />
family ambitions. We want to build a better Australia for<br />
everyone. It is a land of opportunity. The government<br />
has a significant part in achieving that. We can't make sure<br />
the people take advantage of opportunity that might be<br />
available, that is up to the individuals themselves. We can<br />
do a great deal to see that the opportunities are there. We<br />
have got to get confidence in industry and investment moving<br />
forward, or there won't be the jobs, there won't be t-he<br />
* opportunities and we won't have the wealth provided for the<br />
sort of education we want for our children. We won't have<br />
the wealth that is necessary to be able to look after those<br />
who are disadvantaged in one way or another. I also want<br />
to see in 1976 the first significant moves towards the most<br />
far sighted changes in our Federalism system of government<br />
that., have probzably been introduced since Federation itself.<br />
S: You mean give back special powers to the States?<br />
FRASER: Well giving financial indeperndence~ to the States in a realistic<br />
orm a Jnd at the same time giving greater financial autonomy to<br />
ocal~ government. Loc-al government used to look after roads_<br />
and almost nothing but. They've had responsibility heaped on<br />
them b5y State Governments, by Federai Govrnments and, still in<br />
large, . measure, it is the rate payers who bear the significant<br />
burden. -Now they need access to the general pool of taxation<br />
and:-that's been part of our policy. We've got to move some<br />
power, I believe away from Canberra. ' In a country that is as<br />
diverse as Australia and in a country as well educated as<br />
Australia basically is, we've got to see that more people<br />
participate in the decision making processes. This means<br />
making local government more independent. It certainly means<br />
making state governments more indepeuident:. We don't want<br />
people in Canberra monitoring both, and telling local government<br />
and telling state governments what they must do and how they must<br />
do it because we don't believe that these things should always<br />
be done in Canberra. We believe that very often state governments 6 I </p>
<p>-6-<br />
FRASER: CONT. COLLINS: FRASER: and local government know best what is necessary for their own<br />
particular area so this is, I would hope, going to be a start<br />
on a new basis of co-operation between local government, the<br />
states and the Federal Government and the first meeting in<br />
relation to these matters we hope will be on the 4th and 5th of<br />
February. The Premiers have certainly been asked to come to<br />
a meeting and I hope the dates suit them.<br />
Do you think that Australians then can look forward to a happier<br />
or prosperous year in 1976?<br />
Well I believe so but I have always said that it is going to be<br />
hard and difficult to get out of the problems that haye been<br />
caused by Labor. The deficit over two years is very nearly<br />
$ 7,000. million. That has to be paid for, either by inflation<br />
which is the process Labor was using, or by restraint on the<br />
part of governments, or by increased production which brings<br />
greater wealth and greater revenue consequently. We hope<br />
and plan that it will be done. byorestraint, by getting<br />
production moving again and the Commonwealth's revenue<br />
increAsed.-real revenue, not through the process of inflation.<br />
We will work dur way out of the deficit caused by Labor, but<br />
it is not going to be easy. It is going to be difficult. The<br />
hand-out mentality that Labor fostered so much has got to<br />
becomea thing of the past. One of the things they tried to<br />
suggesf was that the hand-out mentality was the same as doing things<br />
for the disadvantaged but it is not. Doing things for the<br />
disadvantaged is one thing-,-but the Labor-Party shuffled money<br />
around; as though it were chaff. That is one of the reasons<br />
we're in such a difficulty at the moment. </p>
