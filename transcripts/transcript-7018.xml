    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong> 20 October  1986</strong></p>
<p>I have sent today the following message to Alan Berry, Manager of the Australian Mens Hockey Team, in London:</p>
<p>Please pass on congratulations to coach Richard Aggiss, captain David Bell and other members of the team on a brilliant victory in the Sixth World Hockey Cup Final. Australia's consistent excellent performances on the international hockey field over many years have been justifiably rewarded with this major trophy.</p>
<p>Please also pass on compliments to my colleague, Ric Charlesworth, on his outstanding performance in being voted ' Man of the Series'. </p>
