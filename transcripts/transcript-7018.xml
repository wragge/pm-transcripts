    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Â 20 October Â 1986</strong></p>
<p>I have sent today the following message to Alan Berry, Manager ofÂ the Australian MensÂ Hockey Team, in London:</p>
<p>Please pass on congratulations to coach Richard Aggiss, captainÂ David Bell and other members of the team on a brilliant victoryÂ in the Sixth World Hockey Cup Final. Australia's consistentÂ excellent performances on the international hockey field overÂ many years have been justifiably rewarded with this major trophy.</p>
<p>Please also pass on compliments to my colleague, RicÂ Charlesworth, on his outstanding performance in being voted ' ManÂ of the Series'.Â </p>
