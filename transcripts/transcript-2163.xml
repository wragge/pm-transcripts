FOR PRESS P. M. L No 9/ 1970<br />
BARRIER REEF<br />
Sttmn yte rm iitr Mr John Gorton<br />
I have been asked about a communication received from the Queensland<br />
Government In June 1968 regarding the Barrier Reef.<br />
In June 1968 we received a letter from the Queensland Government<br />
informing us that they intended to set up a committee, to advise the Queensland<br />
Government on the general question of the control and exploitation of all the<br />
resources of the Great Barrier Reef which were described as " fishing, tourism,<br />
scientific research, and probably mining". The Queensland Government proposed<br />
to set up a committee of eleven members and suggested the Commonwealth might<br />
nominate one member.<br />
This general suggestion was entirely different from the present proposal<br />
which is that drilling for oil on or near the Barrier Reef be halted until a joint enquiry<br />
into possible dangers of drilling has been held, and has reported publicly to both<br />
Governments. I have endorsed this latter proposal and indicated that if the Queensland<br />
Government will agree to it the Commonwealth would be prepared to take part in such<br />
an enquiry while drilling is suspended.<br />
This is the question which now awaits the decision of the Queensland<br />
Government. CANBERRA 16 January 1970 </p>
