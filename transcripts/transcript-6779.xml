PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
NSW BRANCH ALP COUNTRY CONFERENCE<br />
QUEANBEYAN 10 NOVEMBER 1985<br />
DELEGATES THE COUNTRY CONFERENCES OF THE NSW BRANCH OF THE LABOR PARTY<br />
PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO EMPHASISE ONCE AGAIN THE CRUCIAL<br />
ROLE WHICH LABOR'S STRENGTH IN THE BUSH HAS PLAYED<br />
TRADITIONALLY IN AUSTRALIAN POLITICS, AND HAS CONTRIBUTED TO<br />
OUR OVERALL STRENGTH IN NSW IN PARTICULAR.<br />
THAT STRENGTH DERIVES FROM ALL OF YOU HERE TODAY THROUGH<br />
YOUR ORGANISATIONS, THROUGH THE NSW BRANCH, AND THROUGH<br />
SUCCESSIVE LEADERS OF THE PARTY WHO HAVE WORKED OVER THE<br />
DECADES, FIRST OF ALL, TO ESTABLISH LABOR'S DOMINANCE AND<br />
THEN TO PROTECT IT FROM THE FORCES OF CONSERVATISM.<br />
FOR ALL THAT, I PLACE ON RECORD MY DEEP THANKS FOR THE<br />
CONTRIBUTION WHICH YOUR EFFORTS HAVE M4ADE NOT ONLY TO THE<br />
WELL BEING OF LABOR GOVERNMENTS, BUT TO THE CONTINUING<br />
SUCCESS OF THE NSW LABOR GOVERNMENT IN PARTICULAR, AND ALSO<br />
TO THE CONTINUING SUCCESS OF OUR LABOR GOVERNMENT IN<br />
CANBERRA. IT IS CONVENTIONAL WISDOM AS JACK HALLAM DEMONSTRATED IN<br />
1983 IN HIS BOOK, " THE UNTOLD STORY", THAT WHILE LABOR HOLDS<br />
THE BUSH IT HOLDS GOVERNMENT IN NSW.<br />
SIMILARLY, LABOR'S STRENGTH IN THE BUSH HAS A GREAT BEARING<br />
ON OUR EXISTENCE IN CANBERRA.<br />
THE REASONS FOR LABOR'S DOMINANCE OF THE BUSH IN NSW ARE<br />
SIMPLE. QUITE APART FROM THE CREDIBILITY OF OUR POLICIES,<br />
THE REASONS HAVE BEEN THE CHOICE AND STRENGTH OF CANDIDATES<br />
SELECTED FOR COUNTRY SEATS, AND THE WILLINGNESS AND THE<br />
VIGOUR OF SUCCESSIVE PARTY OFFICERS AND PARTY LEADERS TO<br />
DEFEND AND EXTEND THAT DOMINANCE OVER THE YEARS. </p>
<p>IT BEGAN WITH BILL MCKELL IN THE 1940tS. MCKELL'S GREAT<br />
METHOD WAS HIS PERSONAL SELECTION OF CANDIDATES IN CRITICAL<br />
SEATS, THE LEGACY OF WHICH STAYED WITH US IN HUMAN FORM<br />
RIGHT INTO THE 19701S WHEN TERRY SHEAHAN REPLACED HIS FATHER<br />
BILL AT BURRINJUCK.<br />
THE TRADITION WAS CARRIED ON BY JOE CAHILL IN THE 19501S AND<br />
NOW ITS NEVILLE WRAN IN THE 1970' S AND THROUGHOUT THE 19801S<br />
A PREMIER WHO HAS LEAD LABOR AND NSW THROUGH ALMOST<br />
YEARS AND I BELIEVE WILL CONTINUE TO LEAD INTO 1988 AND<br />
BEYOND. NEVILLE INITIATED THAT HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL PRACTICE OF TAKING<br />
CABINET MEETINGS TO THE COUNTRY. ONLY LAST WEEK WE SAW<br />
STATE CABINET MEETING IN ALBURY. THIS HAS DONE MUCH TO<br />
BRING GOVERNMENT TO THE PEOPLE, TO HELP PEOPLE IDENTIFY WITH<br />
GOVERNMENT. IT IS A PRACTICE I HAVE CONTINUED MYSELF WITH<br />
OUR OWN CABINET MEETING IN TOWNSVILLE JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO.<br />
WE IN CANBERRA HAVE ALSO BEEN BLESSED WITH OUTSTANDING<br />
MEMBERS FROM RURAL NSW. I MENTION PARTICULARLY AS AN<br />
EXAMPLE JIM SNOW, IN WHOSE ELECTORATE OF EDEN-MONARO YOU ARE<br />
MEETING THIS WEEKEND.<br />
NEITHER COULD I LET THIS OPPORTUNITY PASS WITHOUT PAYING<br />
TRIBUTE TO OUR OUTSTANDING MINISTER FOR PRIMARY INDUSTRY,<br />
JOHN KERIN A MAN WHO HAS BEEN DESCRIBED BY HIS<br />
CONSTITUENCY, FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE, AS THE BOB HAWKE OF<br />
THE BUSH.<br />
IN THIS CONTEXT I AM ALSO VERY GLAD TO NOTE THE NEWS<br />
CIRCULATING IN PARTY CIRCLES AT THE MOMENT THAT IT IS<br />
LOOKING INCREASINGLY LIKELY THAT SOME OF LABOR'S STALWARTS<br />
FROM THE BUSH IN THE NSW PARLIAMENT WILL BE STICKING AROUND<br />
FOR A WHILE LONGER YET.<br />
I REFER ESPECIALLY TO HAROLD M4AIR IN ALBURY AND BILL<br />
MCCARTHY OF THE NORTHERN TABLELANDS.<br />
DELEGATES WHEN THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY WAS ELECTED IN 1983, IT CAME<br />
TO POWER AS A PARTY WITH A PROUD AND DISTINGUISHED RECORD OF<br />
A PARTY WHICH GOVERNED FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS.<br />
IN MY ADDRESS TODAY I WANT TO REFLECT ON THE SITUATION<br />
CONFRONTING THE RURAL SECTOR AND TO OVERVIEW OUR RURAL<br />
POLICIES POLICIES OFTEN NOT APPRECIATED BY THE COMMUNITY<br />
AND POLICIES OFTEN OVERLOOKED BECAUSE OF OUR OUTSTANDING<br />
SUCCESSES IN GENERAL ECONOMIC POLICY. </p>
<p>DELEGATES,<br />
AS WAS MADE ABUNDANTLY CLEAR BY JOHN KERIN IN HIS ADDRESS TO<br />
YOU YESTERDAY, THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES THE MAJOR<br />
CONTRIBUTION THAT THE RURAL SECTOR MAKES TO THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
ECONOMY. AND WE ARE VERY MUCH AWARE OF THE GRAVITY OF THE<br />
SITUATION CURRENTLY BEING FACED BY MANY PEOPLE IN THE RURAL<br />
COMMUNITY. AND SINCE WE ARE A GOVERNMENT FOR ALL<br />
AUSTRALIANS, WE ARE TACKLING, AS A HIGH PRIORITY, THE<br />
CURRENT PROBLEMS OF THE RURAL COMMUNITY.<br />
THE MINISTER FOR PRIMARY INDUSTRY, JOHN KERIN, AND I HAVE<br />
MET WITH RURAL SECTOR REPRESENTATIVES ON MANY OCCASIONS TO<br />
DISCUSS ISSUES THAT ARE OF GREAT CONCERN BOTH TO THEM AND TO<br />
THE GOVERNMENT. ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL MATTERS ADDRESSED AT<br />
THOSE MEETINGS HAS BEEN THE CONTINUING BLEAK OUTLOOK FOR<br />
MANY COMMODITIES DUE TO THE WEAKNESS OF WORLD MARKETS.<br />
THE SITUATION OF DECLINE IN NET REAL FARM PRODUCTION<br />
IDENTIFIED BY THE BUREAU OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND THE<br />
BUREAU'S EVIDENCE OF CONTINUING PRESSURE ON FARM INCOMES IS<br />
A MATTER OF CONTINUING CONCERN FOR THE GOVERNMENT. WE ARE<br />
AWARE THAT THE PRICE-COST SQUEEZE BEING FELT BY MANY IN THE<br />
RURAL COMMUNITY IS POSING A REAL THREAT TO THE LIVELIHOOD OF<br />
MANY FARMERS AND HAS LED TO A SHARP DECLINE IN THE REAL NET<br />
VALUE OF RURAL PRODUCTION.<br />
RECOGNISING THESE PRESSURES THE GOVERNMENT IN THE LAST<br />
BUDGET HAS PROVIDED A SIGNIFICANT ASSISTANCE PACKAGE FOR THE<br />
FARM SECTOR IN WHAT WAS OTHERWISE A VERY TIGHT BUDGETARY<br />
SITUATION.<br />
WE THEN AGREED TO PROVIDE A FULL REBATE OF THE EXCISE ON<br />
DIESEL USED FOR ELIGIBLE PRIMARY PRODUCTION, SAVING FARMERS<br />
2.4 CENTS PER LITRE FOR THEIR DIESEL FUEL. THIS MAKES<br />
PRIMARY PRODUCERS THE ONLY GROUP IN THE COMMUNITY TO RECEIVE<br />
A FULL REBATE OF DIESEL EXCISE.<br />
IN THE BUDGET WE ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THE REMAINING DUTIES ON<br />
IMPORTED GRAIN HARVESTERS WOULD BE REMOVED, AND THAT AN<br />
EQUIVALENT LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE BY WAY OF A BOUNTY WOULD BE<br />
PROVIDED TO LOCAL MANUFACTURERS. THIS DECISION TOOK EFFECT<br />
FROM 21 AUGUST 1985; AS A RESULT, LEADING MANUFACTURERS HAVE<br />
ALREADY REDUCED THE PRICES OF THEIR GRAIN HARVESTERS.<br />
TAKEN TOGETHER THE FULL REBATE ON DIESEL FUEL AND THE<br />
REMOVAL OF THE DUTIES ON GRAIN HARVESTERS WILL SAVE FARMERS<br />
ABOUT $ 46 MILLION IN A FULL YEAR.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO TAKEN POSITIVE STEPS TO ASSIST<br />
SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, FOR EXAMPLE </p>
<p>THE MEAT AND LIVE-STOCK INDUSTRY WILL RECEIVE $ 7 M1 OVER<br />
THE NEXT 4 YEARS, TO ASSIST INNOVATION IN THE MARKETING<br />
OF MEAT, PARTICULARLY IN EXPORT MARKETS. THOSE FUNDS<br />
WILL BE USED TO ENCOURAGE THE FURTHER USE OF OBJECTIVE<br />
MEAT EXPORT TRADE DESCRIPTIONS, LONGER TERM EXPORT<br />
MARKET STUDIES, AND OTHER PROJECTS WHICH WILL LEAD TO<br />
THE ADOPTION OF A NATIONAL MEAT AND LIVESTOCK TRADING<br />
LANGUAGE, WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A<br />
COMPUTER ASSISTED LIVESTOCK MARKETING SYSTEM.<br />
WE HAVE ALSO INCREASED BY $ 3.6 M THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS<br />
MADE AVAILABLE IN 1985/ 86 FOR WOOL PROMOTION. THE<br />
PRESENT FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS WERE INTRODUCED IN 1984 FOR<br />
A 5 YEAR PERIOD AND GUARANTEE THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL<br />
PROVIDE 1.2% OF THE GROSS VALUE OF THE AUSTRALIAN WOOL<br />
CLIP. THIS YEAR'S CONTRIBUTION IS SOME 14% HIGHER THAN<br />
LAST YEAR'S, AND IS ALMOST 50% UP ON THE $ 20M ALLOCATED<br />
IN EACH OF THE FOUR YEARS PRECEDING THAT.<br />
THESE ARE BUT TWO EXAMPLES OF OUR SPECIFIC MEASURES. THE<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO PUT FORWARD MAJOR PROPOSALS FOR THE<br />
RESTRUCTURING OF THE SUGAR AND DAIRY INDUSTRIES. BOTH THESE<br />
INDUSTRIES ARE OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO AUSTRALIA'S<br />
ECONOMIC AND TRADING PERFORMANCE.<br />
WE HAVE ALSO MADE SIGNIFICANT MOVES TO ADDRESS THE<br />
PARTICULAR REQUIREMENTS OF THE WHEAT INDUSTRY. APART FROM<br />
THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE WHEAT BOARD WE HAVE REGISTERED<br />
STRONGLY OUR CONCERNS WITH EUROPEAN SUBSIDIZATION POLICY AND<br />
WITH THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE AMERICAN ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM.<br />
WE ARE PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE SUBSIDY PROBLEM IS NOW TO BE<br />
ADDRESSED IN THE MULTILATERAL CONTEXT OF THE GATT. THIS IS<br />
WHERE SUCH ISSUES SHOULD BE TACKLED AND RESOLVED.<br />
OF COURSE THE GOVERNMENT'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE RURAL ECONOMY<br />
IS NOT LIMITED TO THE DIRECT MEASURES THAT I HAVE JUST<br />
DESCRIBED. MOST PEOPLE WOULD AGREE THAT THEY ARE MUCH<br />
BETTER OFF IN A PERIOD OF LOW INFLATION THAN WHEN PRICES ARE<br />
RAPIDLY RISING, AND IT IS IN THIS GENERAL AREA OF ECONOMIC<br />
MANAGEMENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN MOST EFFECTIVE ON<br />
BEHALF OF THE PRIMARY PRODUCER. THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICIES<br />
OF SOUND ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT ARE WORKING TO THE BENEFITS OF<br />
RURAL INDUSTRIES: THEY ARE CONTAINING INFLATION<br />
THEY ARE REDUCING UNEMPLOYMENT<br />
AND THEY WILL BE MAINTAINING THE ECONOMIC GROWTH WE<br />
HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING, FOR A THIRD SUCCESSIVE<br />
YEAR.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THESE POLICIES, AND<br />
IS DETERMINED TO ENSURE THAT ALL AUSTRALIANS CAN SHARE IN<br />
THE REAL BENEFITS WHICH WILL FLOW FROM THEM. </p>
<p>DELEGATES, IT'S ALMOST REDUNDANT TO SAY THAT THERE IS A NEW MILITANCY<br />
IN THE BUSH. FARMERS ARE CONCERNED OR FRIGHTENED ABOUT THE<br />
THREAT TO THEIR LIVELIHOOD FACED BY SHRINKING MARKETS. AS<br />
WELL, THEY ARE NOW FEELING THE CONSEQUENCES OF DECADES OF<br />
SHORT-TERM, QUICK FIX PALLIATIVES APPLIED TO OUR FARMING<br />
SECTOR. THE LONGER-TERM, FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS WERE IGNORED,<br />
AS HAS NOW BECOME ONLY TOO APPARENT, AND AS THE NATIONAL<br />
FARMERS' FEDERATION HAVE POINTED OUT TO THE NATIONAL PARTY.<br />
FARM COSTS, I POINT OUT, HAVERISEN ABOUT 6% A YEAR SINCE WE<br />
CAME INTO OFFICE. THEY ROSE BY AROUND 12% A YEAR UNDER THE<br />
CONSERVATIVES. THE ACCUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THAT, JUXTAPOSED<br />
TO THE WORLD TRADING SITUATION, IS WHAT IS AFFECTING FARMERS<br />
INCOMES AT PRESENT.<br />
BUT MORE THAN THAT ECONOMIC SITUATION, FARMERS ARE IN<br />
TURMOIL OVER THE DOMESTIC POLITICAL SITUATION. QUITE<br />
RIGHTLY, THEY FEEL BETRAYED BY THE NATIONAL PARTY WHICH HAS<br />
CLAIMED TO REPRESENT THEM FOR SO LONG BUT WHICH, AS I HAVE<br />
ALREADY SAID, LET THEM DOWN SO BADLY. THE NATIONAL PARTY<br />
FAILED THEM IN GOVERNMENT AND IT IS FAILING THEM IN<br />
OPPOSITION. BUT JUST WHAT DOES THE NATIONAL PARTY STAND FOR? WHERE DO<br />
THEY STAND ON PRIVATISATION, ON STRUCTURAL CHANGE, ON<br />
DEREGULATION? IS THEIR POSITION THE SAME AS THE LIBERALS?<br />
DOES IAN SINCLAIR AND HIS COUNTRY PARTY CRONIES WANT TO SELL<br />
OFF: TELECOM TAA<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL LINE<br />
AUSSAT THE AUTHORITY ADMINISTERING AUSTRALIA'S<br />
DOMESTIC SATELLITE<br />
THE HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION,<br />
THE HOUSING LOANS INSURANCE CORPORATION,<br />
THE COMMONWEALTH BANK AND<br />
THE PIPELINE AUTHORITY<br />
THE LIBERALS AND THE NAITONAL PARTY ARE IGNORING IN THE<br />
IDEOLOGICAL STANCE THEY ARE TAKING ON THIS ISSUE THE SOCIAL<br />
COSTS NECESSARILY ABSORBED BY OUR PUBLIC CORPORATIONS. THEY<br />
WOULD EMBARK ON AN INDISCRIMINATE ATTACK ON A WHOLE RANGE OF<br />
SERVICES GENERALLY REGARDED AS BASIC TO THE QUALITY OF<br />
AUSTRALIAN LIFE AND ESSENTIAL TO RURAL AUSTRALIA. </p>
<p>ALL THE CONSERVATIVES REALLY WANT TO DO IS TO SELL OFF THE<br />
PROFITABLE AREAS OF GOVERNMENT ACTIVITY, WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO<br />
PUBLIC REVENUE, LEAVING EVEN HEAVIER BURDENS ON TAXPAYERS TO<br />
PICK UP THE SLACK TO KEEP ESSENTIAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES<br />
OPERATING. IN REALITY, THEY WANT TO IMPOSE EVEN GREATER<br />
COSTS ON THE RURAL PEOPLE THE PEOPLE FROM YOUR TOWNS AND<br />
CITIES WHO DEPEND SO MUCH ON TELECOM, AUSTRALIA POST, TAA,<br />
THE ABC, THE COMMONWEALTH BANK, TO NAME BUT A FEW OF OUR<br />
MAJOR NATIONAL GOVERNMENT ORGAN ISATIONS.<br />
WE CERTAINLY DO KNOW WHERE THEY STOOD IN THE NOW DISCREDITED<br />
FRASER GOVERNMENT. MESSERS SINCLAIR AND HUNT ALONG WITH<br />
NIXON STAND CONDEMNED FOR THEIR ROLE IN THAT GOVERNMENT<br />
WHICH, FOR EXAMPLE, CUT WOOL PROMOTION SPENDING, TRIED TO<br />
SELL OFF THE WOOL TESTING AUTHORITY, HALVED THE INTEREST<br />
RATE SUBSIDY FOR THE AUSTRALIAN WHEAT BOARD AND REACTED<br />
TARDILY TO THE NEEDS OF FARMERS DURING THE DROUGHT.<br />
THE LITANY OF THEIR FAILURES AND LACK OF CONCERN FOR FARMING<br />
INTERESTS WAS ONLY EXCEEDED DURING THAT PERIOD BY THE<br />
LIBERALS. DURING THOSE YEARS THE LIBERALS MADE NO PRETENCE OF BEING<br />
INTERESTED IN RURAL OR FARM POLICY AND ALL THEY CAN NOW<br />
PROMISE FOR THE FARM SECTOR IS DEREGULATION AND<br />
PRIVATI SATION.<br />
BOTH THE LIBERAL AND NATIONAL PARTIES HAVE IN THE PAST TAKEN<br />
THE RURAL VOTE SO MUCH FOR GRANTED THAT INAPPROPRIATE<br />
POLICIES TO MEET SHORT TERM POLITICAL NEEDS HAVE BEEN<br />
IMPLEMENTED. THE BIGGEST COSTS TO THE FARM SECTOR ARE THE<br />
RESULT OF A SECONDARY INDUSTRY PROTECTION AND, LATELY, FUEL.<br />
FUEL PRICES ROSE ON AN INDEXED BASIS BY A STAGGERING 40%<br />
YES 40% IN 1979-80 COMPARED TO 8% THIS YEAR WITHOUT A<br />
SQUEAK FROM THOSE WHO CLAIMED TO REPRESENT THEM POLITICALLY.<br />
UNLESS THE NATIONAL PARTY SAYS IT IS GOING TO WIPE OUT THE<br />
IMPORT PARITY PRICING POLICY IT INTRODUCED, THE FLOAT OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR WHICH IT HAD NO OPINION ABOUT AND<br />
SECONDARY INDUSTRY PROTECTION WHICH IT FOSTERED, ALL ITS<br />
BLEATS ABOUT FARM COSTS ARE MERE HUMBUG.<br />
DELEGATES, THE TRADITIONAL STRENGTH OF LABOR IN COUNTRY NSW IS ONE OF<br />
THE FOUNDATIONS UPON WHICH IS BASED THE STABILITY OF OUR<br />
GOVERNMENT, BOTH IN MACQUARIE STREET AND IN CANBERRA.<br />
I KNOW THERE IS NO NEED TO TELL YOU OF THE IMPORTANCE OF<br />
MAINTAINING THIS STRENGTH THROUGH FUTURE ELECTIONS. BUT<br />
NEVER FORGET THAT IT IS ONLY THROUGH YOUR EFFORTS COMBINED<br />
THROUGH OUR EFFORTS IN MACQUARIE STREET AND IN CANBERRA THAT<br />
WE CAN STAVE OFF THE CHALLENGE TO OUR STABILITY BY THE<br />
CONSERVATIVE FORCES. </p>
<p>I 7<br />
WHAT THIS REQUIRES IS AN AWARENESS BY YOU AND ALL FELLOW<br />
PARTY MEMBERS AND THROUGH YOU, AN AWARENESS BY THE PEOPLE<br />
AT LARGE OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE FOR THE RURAL SECTOR AND<br />
WHAT WE SHALL CONTINUE TO DO AND OF HOW ECONOMIC GROWTH IS<br />
IMPROVING LIVING STANDARDS AND PRODUCING HIGHER PROSPERITY<br />
FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS.<br />
DELEGATES, OUR VISION FOR THE FUTURE IS ONE WHICH RECOGNISES,<br />
RATIONALLY AND OBJECTIVELY, THE CHALLENGES, THE PROBLEMS,<br />
THE DIFFICULTIES, AS WELL AS THE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH<br />
WE ALL FACE TOGETHER IN THIS DECADE AND BEYOND.<br />
IT IS A VISION FOR A NATION GROWING STRONGER YEAR BY YEAR BY<br />
THE WISE AND FULL USE OF ITS RICH HUMAN AND MATERIAL<br />
RESOURCES, AS A PARTNER IN THE WORLD'S MOST DYNAMIC ECONOMIC<br />
REGION, FOR A NATION BECOMING YEAR BY YEAR MORE EQUITABLE<br />
AND MORE FAIR, IN WHICH TRUE EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL<br />
IS NO MERE SLOGAN BUT A LIVING REALITY AND FOR A NATION<br />
CONSTRUCTIVELY, PERSISTENTLY, UNREMITTINGLY CONTRIBUTING TO<br />
THE SUPREME OBJECTIVE OF A WORLD AND A REGION AT PEACE, FREE<br />
FROM THE THREAT OF NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST.<br />
IT IS A VISION IN WHICH YOU AND YOUR BRANCHES' CONTRIBUTIONS<br />
ARE VITAL VITAL TO THE CREATION OF AN AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY<br />
BASED ON FREEDOM, JUSTICE, EQUITY, AND A SOCIETY IN WHICH WE<br />
ARE SECURE AND PEACEFUL.<br />
I COMMEND YOUR EFFORTS TO DATE AND THE FEDERAL AND STATE<br />
GOVERNMENTS LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT. </p>
