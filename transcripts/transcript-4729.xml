FOR PRESS 5 JUNE 1978<br />
ADDRESS TO T7iE SPECIAL SESSION OF THE GENERAL ASSELMBLY<br />
DEVOTED TO DISARMAMENT<br />
Mr. President, this Special Session, under your distinguished<br />
leadership, has already given grounds for hope that a more<br />
realistic and practical approach to disarmament is underway.<br />
It was once thought that if only men of goodwill could come<br />
together and express their common desire for peace, peace<br />
would be achieved almost overnight. It was even thought that<br />
if only we did not speak of the harsh realities of conflict.<br />
our miinds woulO~ become more receptive to peace.<br />
Experience has taught us that nations will not lay down their<br />
arms or abandon their ambitions simply in the name of<br />
idealism. Too often nations seek peace but only on their<br />
own terms. Too often they want settlement but only on<br />
their own terms. Plainly, idealism is not enough. Indeed,<br />
idealism severed from reality is futile and sometimes dangerous.<br />
Too often, the high hopes of past decades have turned to the<br />
ashes of blood of war.<br />
The problems that confront us are of enormous magnitude. The<br />
task of achieving an effective and significant measure of<br />
global disarmarient is daunting.<br />
The spectre that haunts us today is a world armed as it has<br />
never been before. Its inventory of weapons exceeds the total<br />
sum of all weaponry employed in human history. Tragically,<br />
responsible governments throughout the world feel compelled<br />
to spend vast sums on arms. Some countries spend far more<br />
on arms than can be justified for their legitimate defensive<br />
requirements. Once this occurs, the defence apparatus becomes<br />
entrenched as a strong vested interest, and such an integral part<br />
of the national economy, that significantly to reduce it would<br />
cause grave problems of economic and social adjustment.<br />
One fact is certain the forces militating against arms<br />
control are powerful. We -cannot hope to begin to dismantle<br />
the world's military apparatus. unless we address our minds to<br />
the causes which nourish and sustain it: the notion that<br />
increased military spending inevitably provides greater national<br />
security regardless of the objective facts; the narrow self<br />
interest and amtbition which nations can pursue reckless of<br />
the tension and conflict which this may generate; the quest<br />
for national status which still motivates the actions of many<br />
states, attempts to exploit the weaknesses of smaller states; the<br />
attempt to expand a nation's influence over other states, under </p>
<p>-2<br />
the cloak of ideology regardless of damaging competition<br />
with other powers which results.<br />
Above all, there is the pervasive mistrust and suspicion that<br />
haunts nations and the fear that this creates. The suspicion<br />
and fear which turns nations to increase their armaments<br />
frequently stems from the military policies of others.<br />
A sudden expansion of arms, an unexpected concentration of<br />
military forces, the growth in a country's military capacity<br />
in excess of perceived defence needs all these produce<br />
suspicion and counteraction.<br />
Another potent source of suspicion and fear is economic<br />
insecurity and uncertainty; fear about security of access<br />
to markets or essential sources of supply; unequal world<br />
trading arrangements7 the exclusion of groups, of categories of<br />
nations from fair trade; and poverty and deprivation in<br />
large areas of the world. All these are in themselves a<br />
fertile breeding ground for tension and conflict.<br />
We cannot ignore these historic and present sources of<br />
concern and fear. Our disarmament efforts will come to nothing.<br />
if we do not work to eradicate these economic causes of<br />
discontent. The multilateral trade negotiations this year and the<br />
negotiations over the Common Fund will provide opportunities<br />
to advance our common causes. Failing that, we will have<br />
missed the oppoz-rt-unity to resolve economically based tension<br />
and discord.<br />
The circumstances that fuel the fears and suspicions of nations<br />
and damage their relations are infinite. Together they conspire<br />
to create a lack of confidence in a system of international<br />
security that can regularise the differences among nations<br />
so as to avoid the outbreak or threat of war.<br />
I do not minimise the difficulties that face this Conference.<br />
But it is inconceivable that the world should become so<br />
indifferent to its fate that it does not try to remove the<br />
causes of conflict and to control the production and deployment<br />
of nuclear and conventional arms.<br />
There are so many pressing national needs, so many unrealised<br />
aspirations, that conscience and reason demand that this waste<br />
of resources cease. The significance of this Special Session<br />
is that it recognises that disarmament is a matter for<br />
political leadership, for political will and determination and<br />
common commitment and dedication.<br />
The very fact that the United Nations is assembled for this<br />
Session entitles us to assume that we share a common<br />
determination to bring arms and military spending-under control.<br />
We know that war, the threat of war, anarchy and terrorism<br />
know no frontiers, that no nation, however favourably placed,<br />
can afford to stand aside from the quest for international<br />
peace and security. ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
This is why Australia takes a most active interest in arms<br />
control and disarmament. Like other middle and sinaller<br />
powers, Australia's fate can be decided by the contest between<br />
the major powers. We place the highest value on our independence,<br />
our territorial integrity, our individuality.<br />
Separately, middle and small powers are in no position to<br />
decide global issues of war or peace. But collectively we<br />
can do much to fcster a climate of international cooperation<br />
and practical control.<br />
Australia believes that the realistic approach to disarmament<br />
lies in the steo by step development of arms control. It is<br />
essential at each step that all who are affected should feel<br />
their secur--:_ c-: is at the very least not weakened.<br />
Other-vaise, zc-': e prospects for effective arms control will be<br />
destroyed. But we should not limit ourselves merely to preserving a<br />
precarious status quo. We must aim at increasing the security<br />
of nations. Concentrating on disarmament techniques and<br />
mechanics is important but it is not enough.<br />
We must confront -the underlying political and economic<br />
anxieties and suspicions which impel nations to arm themselves.<br />
only if the causes of international tension are removed can<br />
there be any realistic hope of achieving a meaningful and<br />
long-lasting reduction in arms.<br />
A practical ag~ enda for world disarmament should therefore<br />
star't from the premise that it is essential to increase mutual<br />
confidence and trust among nations.<br />
Nuclear Issues<br />
It is accordingly natural that in this Session our main aim is<br />
to agree on a practical and realistic programme of action for<br />
arms control and disarmament. The first focus of this programme<br />
must be on issues of nuclear arms control. The avoidance of<br />
nuclear war is an imperative of mankind.<br />
My Government's position is clear and unequivocal. We oppose<br />
further escalation of the nuclear arms race. Wle oppose the<br />
spread of nuclear weapons.<br />
Even if we could depend on the technology of terror, delicately<br />
balanced between the superpowers, to prevent a nuclear holocaust,<br />
our mutual interdependence and the growing scarcity of essential<br />
resources makes manifest the futility of uncontrolled<br />
expenditures on nuclear weapons.<br />
Spurred by this realisation, nations have commenced the slow<br />
and deliberate process of negotiation to limit the production,<br />
distribution and use of these weapons.<br />
Through this step-by-step process, nuclear and non-nuclear<br />
weapon states alike have come to accept that they have a common<br />
interest in 1lmiting nuclear weaponry and that carefully<br />
negotiated 1Lz'its need not put at risk any nation' s security. </p>
<p>I,<br />
-4-<br />
We now need to build on the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963,<br />
the Nuclear-Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968 and the 1972 SALT<br />
agreementsZ between the United States and the Soviet Union. We<br />
now need to create an environment which further limits nations'<br />
capacity to acquire nuclear weapons indeed, which<br />
removes an,: incentive to possess them.<br />
Progress _ St be made in three inter-related areas. First, the<br />
nuclear wez-ons powers must take effective action to limit and<br />
reduce nuclear arsenals. Second, there must be an end to<br />
nuclear teS-..* ng in all environments. Third, the international<br />
non-profilara-tion system must be strengthened.<br />
We are dea-Li here with difficult and inter-related balances<br />
of national i-nterest. Progress in one area of nuclear arms<br />
control can negated if other essential areas are neglected.<br />
Australia believes that all three objectives are realistic and<br />
attainable.<br />
This special session can give a real impetus towards reaching<br />
a consensus on nuclear armF control by identifying the conditions<br />
that can generate a well-founded confidence between nuclear and<br />
non-nuclear weapons states and between the nuclear weapons states<br />
themselves.<br />
S . A. L. T.<br />
The first'area in which further progress needs to be made is in<br />
the strategic arms limitation talks. SALT's aim to limit and then<br />
reduce the nuclear armaments of the superpowers while preserving<br />
the strategic nuclear balance is in the interests of us all.<br />
Without progress, the prospect of checking the proliferation of<br />
nuclear weapons will be prejudiced, for some states are unwilling<br />
to abandon the option of possessing nuclear weapons until the<br />
superpowers reduce their arsenals. And so long as conventional<br />
weapons are maintained at present levels nuclear weapons form<br />
an essential element of the overall strategic balance.<br />
Against this background, any prospect of instability caused by<br />
one party gaining at the expense of the other would damage the<br />
fundamental premises of co-operation betaeen the United States<br />
and the Soviet Union. It would also gravely impair international<br />
confidence in SALT, and set back the total prospects for nuclear<br />
arms control.<br />
As confidence in these negotiations grows, it will open the door<br />
to reductions in nuclear . arsenals.<br />
We hope that ultimately SALT will open the way for negotiations<br />
involving all'nuclear weapons states.<br />
Nuclear Weapons Testing<br />
SALT must necessarily be a lengthy and continuing negotiating<br />
process. </p>
<p>An urgent and more inmmediately achievable objective is the<br />
cessation of nuclear weapons testing in all environments by<br />
all states. It is to be regretted that we do not yet have a<br />
comprehensive test ban treaty and that even the partial test<br />
ban treaty has yet t-o receive universal support.<br />
At successive general assemblies, Australia has pressed for a<br />
broad consensus = a4ainst all nuclear tests and at last year's<br />
assembly we cs-s-zonsored the first single resolution adopted by<br />
the assembly su-_-= ortiflg a comprehensive test ban.<br />
This was an i: 7zrtant expression of international opinion. It<br />
should not be Lznored. It should now be translated into<br />
concrete measures.<br />
Australia welcomes the current negotiations between the United<br />
States, the Soviet Union and Great Britain on a comprehensive<br />
test ban treaty and looks to their early and successful<br />
conclusion. There can be no question that such an agreement<br />
would be a barrier, both to the expansion of existing nuclear<br />
arsenals and to the further spread of nuclear weapons.<br />
Such a treaty would put any country initiating or continuing<br />
nuclear testing at the risk of isolation and international<br />
censure. Such a treaty would be reinforced by an international<br />
agreement to hL-alt production of fissionable material for nuclear<br />
weapons. We believe this should be the subject of early discussion among<br />
nuclear weapon states and included in the programme of action.<br />
Horizontal Non-Proliferation<br />
The third essential element in nuclear arms control is preventing<br />
the acquisition of nuclear weapons by additional countries.<br />
This involves the security of us all. Proliferation triggers<br />
further proliferation causing instability and risk for all.<br />
How do we halt the spread of nuclear weapons?<br />
Again, a difficult and careful process of international negotiations<br />
is required to find ways to stop proliferation while protecting<br />
legitimate interests. We need to create treaty obligations and<br />
with them the world opinion which will effectively deter the<br />
acquisition of such weapons, and prevent nuclear materials being<br />
diverted from peaceful purpos-es.<br />
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has been the essential first<br />
step towards the achievement of these goals. Whatever its<br />
imperfections, it is the only comprehensive international<br />
instrument directed against proliferation. Adherence to it<br />
represents an essential test of the co. Lnitment of non-nuclear<br />
powers to non-proliferation.<br />
Over one hundred states are now parties to the treaty. I urge<br />
it-s universal acceptance. / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
The treaty rests on a three-way bargain, and each element of<br />
the bargain must be honoured, by nuclear weapons powers making<br />
progress towards nuclear disarmament, non-nuclear powers not<br />
acquiring nuclear weapons and all countries co-operating in the<br />
peaceful devel: p nent of nuclear energy under effective safeguards.<br />
At the same tethose states renouncing nuclear weapons need<br />
assurances t:~ this will not jeopardise their security.<br />
There is concer= whether Security Council resolution 255 of<br />
1968 sufficien-ly protects non-nuclear weapon states which are<br />
parties to N. P. T. against threat or use of nuclear weapons.<br />
In Australia'S v; iew, such assurances should be further developed<br />
and strengthened.<br />
We welcome recent undertakings by the nuclear weapons states<br />
relating to the non-use of nuclear weapons. We commend the statement<br />
by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom that his country isI<br />
prepared to take part with other nuclear powers in firm, far--<br />
reaching and permanent assurances to the non-nuclear states.<br />
There is also-a need to assure non-nuclear weapon states of<br />
access to nucl= aar technology for peaceful purposes.<br />
If world energy; requirements are to be met and economic and<br />
social development promoted, nuclear power for peaceful purposes.<br />
is essential. Our challenge is to find ways in which nuclear<br />
energy can be further developed without compromising non-proliferatic<br />
objectives. Australia is closely involved.<br />
First, my Government decided last year to proceed with the further<br />
mining and export of Australian uranium to provide at reasonable<br />
prices supplies of uranium fuel to countries that need them.<br />
Because of our concern for non-proliferation, we have decided<br />
that our uranium exports to non-nuclear weapon states will bE!<br />
limited to those who are parties to the N. P. T. and therefore<br />
comply with requirements set by the International Atomic Energy<br />
Agency and who abide by the terms of special bilateral treaties. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
Second, we are participating actively in the International<br />
Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation Study launched last year.<br />
This study is specifically addressed to the problem of<br />
developing nuclear energy in ways consistent with<br />
non-pr-cliferation objectives. It could result in the<br />
international contr-ol of sensitive elements of the<br />
nuclear fuel c-Ncle.<br />
Australia baliJe-. es that by these actions, we can contribute<br />
to a climate~ cf-confi dence which will foster stable nuclear<br />
trade and c~ srinternational cooperation on nuclear<br />
matters. our basic cc-cern is to assure all nations including those<br />
who are not, czrties to our uranium sales contracts that<br />
our uranium and any material derived from it will be used only<br />
for peaceful purposes. It is better to have confident nuclear<br />
cooperation and trade under effective safeguards than have<br />
these exchanges crippled by suspicion and fear. We look to<br />
the further evolution of cooperative arrangements that are<br />
essential to trust and a safe nuclear world.<br />
Other Areas of Arms Control and Disarmament<br />
Mr. President, while we have made some modest advance with<br />
nuclear arms control, the outcome of efforts to limit<br />
conventional arms-* has beert disappointing. In fact, the<br />
level of conventional armaments continues to escalate.<br />
It is in the building of well founded trust and confidence<br />
that real hope ' Lies of slowing and reversing the growth<br />
of conventional arms levels. We need approaches which,<br />
while limited and specific in scope, are practical, achievable,<br />
and contribute to security at lower levels of armament.<br />
Military Budgets and Development<br />
Mr. President, there have been proposals put forward for<br />
reductions in military budgets. Australia in principle supports<br />
such reductions carried out in ways which would not be<br />
destabilising or create new tensions.<br />
There is the need to overcome the practical problems of<br />
defining and measuring military expenditures and establishing<br />
machinery for verifying compliance with any agreed reductions.<br />
All this requires thorough examination, and my Government has<br />
recently informed the Secretary General that we are willing<br />
to submit our Defence Budget for analysis as part of a pilot<br />
project on military budgets. Any significant reductions in<br />
military budgets could release substantial resources for<br />
, econcnic and social development.<br />
We support the proposal of the Nordic countries that the<br />
Secretary General undertake a major study of all aspects<br />
of the relationship between disarmament and development. / 8 </p>
<p>8-<br />
Regional Arms Control<br />
Australia sees value in regional approaches to arms control.<br />
These can contribute to stability. The ASEAN countries<br />
advocacy of a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality has<br />
had impa= ct, and has lessened the possibility of competition for<br />
influence in the region by major powers.<br />
The conceot of an Indian Ocean Zone of Peace and the current<br />
discussions between the United States and Soviet Union on<br />
mutual military limitations in the Indian Ocean are further<br />
examples of a regional approach.<br />
Any agreements reached between the superpowers must enhance<br />
security provided by existing alliances and arrangements,<br />
otherwise they will have the effect of increasing suspicions and<br />
exacerbating tensions.<br />
Verif ication<br />
Effective verification is needed to piovide the nece~ sary<br />
foundation of confidence on which any arms control or<br />
disararent must rest. Controls without verification would be<br />
meaningless. The precise requirements and means for<br />
verification will depend on the nature and scope of the<br />
agreement in question. But the objectives are clear.<br />
Verification must: protect the security of states acceptin g<br />
agreed limitations; provide reasonable confidence that a case<br />
of non-compliance would be quickly detected; deter to the<br />
maximum extent possible any brea~ h of agreed conditions;<br />
provide mechanisms to deal with possible breaches or<br />
circumvention. To the extent that verification can be brought under<br />
international control, that will further increase confidence.<br />
A number of proposals have been put forward to advance the<br />
cause of verification. I particularly note the proposal of<br />
the President of France for the establishment of an<br />
International Satellite Observation Agency. This is an<br />
interesting idea that warrants constructive consideration.<br />
Adequate arrangements for verification are indispensable to<br />
a comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. In this instance, identifying<br />
small underground tests is the greatest problem.<br />
In view of our geographical position and expertise, Australia<br />
would be well placed to participate in monitoring such a<br />
treaty by seismic means. We would obviously cooperate to<br />
achieve these objectives.<br />
Disarmament Machinery<br />
A major task of this Special Session is to review the<br />
effectiveness of the existing international disarmament machinery.<br />
The present mechanisms have evolved over the years and in the<br />
new situations we face the need to be made both more effective<br />
and more representative. The Special Session should seek to<br />
build on the expertise of existing disarmament bodies. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
In Australia's view, the basic three-tier structure should<br />
be retained: the first Committee of the General Assembly<br />
should remain as a consultative and deliberate forum with<br />
overall responsibility for international disarmament<br />
efforts; the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament<br />
should be retained, under this or another name, for<br />
negotiating specific multilateral agreements; and the<br />
United Nations Disarmament Centre should carry out the<br />
Secretariat functions. Each of these bodies needs<br />
modi ficat ion.<br />
In the case of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament,<br />
while its basic character should be retained as a compact<br />
but representative negotiating body, with a defined<br />
membership, zotnigto work by consensus, we should seek<br />
five basic cha-nges.<br />
These changes would enable the Conference of the Committee<br />
on Disarmament to strengthen its role in the period of<br />
intensified activity which we hope will follow this Session.<br />
First, it should enjoy the full confidence of the international<br />
community including all the nuclear weapons powers. A major<br />
weakness of the C. C. D. has been the absence from its<br />
deliberations of two of these powers. We would like to<br />
see this redressed.<br />
Second, it should have a membership reflecting a wider spread<br />
of geographical, political and security interests. The<br />
C. C. D's structure and membership have been too closely tied to<br />
the European context and a * modest increase in its existing<br />
membership would result in a more representative body.<br />
This could be achieved by including states from outside Europe<br />
which have demonstrated an active interest in arms control<br />
and disarmament questions. For its part, Australia stands<br />
ready to participate in a reformed C. C. D.<br />
Third, while we recognise the special obligations of the nuclear<br />
weapon states, we believe that the C. C. D. or its successor<br />
should not be subject to their overriding will and that some<br />
changes to the existing co-Chairmanship arrangements would<br />
be appropriate.<br />
Fourth, the C. C. D.' s links with the General Assembly should be<br />
strengthened to make it more responsive to a broader<br />
range of views.<br />
Fifth, greater opportunities should exist for non-member states<br />
to participate in working groups and other appropriate meetings.<br />
Many states have considerable expertise in particular areas<br />
of arms control and disarmament which should be used to the<br />
greatest extent possible.<br />
Australia also believes that the United Nations Disarmament<br />
Centre should be strengthened. In addition to its Secretariat<br />
function, it has an important role to play in increasing public<br />
awareness and understanding of arms control and disarmament<br />
questions. </p>
<p>Mr. President, ultimately it is the absolute right of<br />
sovereign governments to defend their peoples. It is the<br />
obligation of sovereign governments to do so. A realistic<br />
disarmament agenda must recognise this simple premise.<br />
National sovereignty is vital to the governments here<br />
assembled.<br />
Nonetheless, in the new world for which we strive, we<br />
must not drive this concept to the excesses of former years.<br />
We are too close to each other to be immune from the effects<br />
of one another's actions.<br />
Rules of proper behaviour do not diminish. They enhance<br />
and expand national sovereignty for they reinforce your<br />
freedom and m'ine.<br />
Mr. President, we cannot conduct our disarma-ment negotiations<br />
in isolation. What we do here is part of a broader international<br />
agenda to reduce the causes of suspicion and tension among<br />
nations, to enhance confidence in the international mechanisms<br />
for the peaceful resolution of disputes between states, to<br />
streng-then mediation, to encourage the Rule of Law between<br />
nations, to abandon aggressive ideology and to outlaw<br />
mban's inhumrani;* ty.<br />
Conclusion Mr. President, many proposals, disarma-ment proposals, could be<br />
implemented immediately, and by so doing, establish the<br />
confidence required for further and more substantial steps<br />
towards disar-mament.<br />
Can we not now achieve a comprehensive ban by all states<br />
on nuclear explosions in all environments, a responsible<br />
second SALT agreement, and a more effective non-proliferation<br />
regime? Relief from the oppressive menace of accidental or intentional<br />
nuclear war should encourage all states to reduce their<br />
dependence on weapons which are conventional but whose<br />
sophistication and expense constantly grows.<br />
Can we not look to justice, to the Rule of Law between states,<br />
to a step-by-step approach which can progressively release<br />
resources for the well-being and advancement of the human<br />
race.<br />
A great many things are within our grasp if we can, by our<br />
actions, earn trust and learn to trust.<br />
When history is written of'our time, will we be known as men<br />
who secured a safe world or ones who failed to understand or<br />
grasp the necessities of our time? 0 00---</p>
