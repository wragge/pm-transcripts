PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT SATURDAY, 9 FEBRUARY, 1980<br />
INTERVIEW WITH DON BAKER, CBS<br />
HONOLULU question Prime Minister, you had two meetings with the President, and<br />
obviously discussed the perceived threat that is common to both<br />
our countries, Did you arrive at any conclusions?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think Australia and the United States have a very common view<br />
and understanding of the dangers and also of the actions that need<br />
to be taken. The President's State of the Union message, where he<br />
stated very clearly his intentions, the-United States intentions,<br />
is a very important document and one that is essential to the<br />
well-being and security of the United States, United States<br />
allies and indeed, of independent nations around the world.<br />
I hope that that is a document, or a statement, that will be built<br />
upon. It gives us a starting point. The United States has<br />
announced increased defence budgets. Australia will be adding to<br />
its own-defences. We will be co-operating even more closely<br />
with the United States in sur~ veillance and patrolling in the<br />
Indian Ocean, and undertaking a number of other activities all of<br />
which are designed, on Australia's part, to do what Australia can<br />
to help demonstrate a collective determination to do what is<br />
necessary. I hope that'as many countries as possible will strongly<br />
support the President of the United States. In terms of a perception<br />
of the threat, in terms of an understanding of what needs to be<br />
* done, I believe the United States and Australia are really on<br />
common lines. -I say this, not from the point of view of 14 million<br />
people that go along, and say to the United States " we support,<br />
right or wrong", because we have to make our own independent<br />
judgements of what is in our interests and what is in a sense, the<br />
free world interest. -But we very strongly believe that the<br />
United States is right, that the-course that the President has taken<br />
is right, and that we therefore need to do everything we can within<br />
the limits of our capacities of 14 million people to support<br />
that position.<br />
Question Do you think the people of Australia, and-more specifically, the<br />
law makers will support you?<br />
Prime minister<br />
In Australia? I have not the slightest doubt about the law makers<br />
in Australia. I have not the slightest doubt about the will and<br />
determination of t: he overwhelming majority of the Australian people. / 2 </p>
<p>CBS, HONOLULU 2-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
One of the things, if I may say it, that was stimulating in<br />
Washington, was the extent to which senior Congressional leaders,<br />
senior Senators, who have been around the Capitol for a long<br />
while, were saying the Congress is behind the President, the<br />
people of the United S'cates are behind the President, perhaps in<br />
a way that has not been seen since 1945. We all know the<br />
divisions and difficulties that came after Vietnam. Therefore,<br />
as an ally of the United States, it was a very good thing indeed<br />
to see that sense of purpose, that sense of determination, not just<br />
from the Administration, not just from the President, but to be*<br />
told that it was something that carried through right across the<br />
United States.'<br />
Question Prime Minister, one final question. Yesterday the President<br />
recommended the most controversial part of, I'guess, the defence<br />
package the draft, or at least the registration for the draft<br />
including men and women. Did he discuss this with you?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No. What the United States does in enhancing its own defence<br />
effort is obviously a matter for itself. We did'not discuss,<br />
really, what we were intendingto do. I did advise the President<br />
that additional proposals for defence would be examined by my<br />
Government very shortly after my return to Australia. We had<br />
indicated that we were prepared to support the United States with<br />
increased patrolling and surveillance of the Indian Ocean and<br />
that our respective defence people would need to work out how the<br />
total effort can be best integrated together. We indicated<br />
a number of other things that we, from our own perspectives, had<br />
decided, as contributing to the joint effort. I would see what<br />
the President has done in that particular decision as another of<br />
the courageous acts. The President and the Administration has<br />
shown much courage in dealing with the present crisis and in<br />
dealing with the Iranian crisis not only courage, but a much<br />
needed restraint, having in min -d the lives of the hostages and<br />
the overwhelming imperative to have those hostages released and<br />
returned, without harm, to the United States. So, what the United<br />
States needs to do, I have no doubt the President will pursue with<br />
vigour and determination. 000---</p>
