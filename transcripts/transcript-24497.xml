    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth Government intends to update the <em>Australian Citizenship Act 2007</em> so dual nationals who engage in terrorism can lose their citizenship.</p>
<p>The Minister for Immigration and Border Protection will be able to exercise these powers in the national interest where a dual citizen betrays our country by participating in serious terrorist-related activities.</p>
<p>The new powers will apply to dual citizens who fight with or support groups such as ISIL, or Daesh, as well as so-called âlone wolvesâ, whether in Australia or on foreign soil.</p>
<p>The changes will be consistent with our international legal obligation not to leave a person stateless. There will also be safeguards, including judicial review, to balance these powers.</p>
<p>These new powers are a necessary and appropriate response to the terrorist threat. They modernise our laws and bring them closer to those of the UK, Canada, France, the United States and other countries.</p>
<p>Since 1949, Australians with dual citizenship who fight for a country at war with Australia have forfeited their citizenship.</p>
<p>There should be no difference in how we treat Australians who join a hostile army and those engaged in terrorism â both are betraying our country and donât deserve to be citizens of Australia.</p>
<p>Regardless of how we gain our citizenship, it is an extraordinary privilege with rights and responsibilities for all of us.</p>
<p>Our success as a nation is underpinned by a commitment by all Australians to a law abiding, peaceful and open society. In an environment in which terrorism is reaching out to our community, we need to ensure this is well understood.</p>
<p>So the Commonwealth Government will launch a national consultation to improve understanding of the privileges and responsibilities of Australian citizenship.</p>
<p>I have asked the Parliamentary Secretary for Social Services, Senator the Hon Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, and the Hon Philip Ruddock MP to lead the consultation.</p>
<p>Senator Fierravanti-Wells will undertake this task as the newly appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General, in addition to her current role.</p>
<p>This alignment of Senator Fierravanti-Wellsâ duties will strengthen the link between existing Department of Social Services programmes and the Governmentâs broader strategy for countering violent extremism.</p>
<p>I have asked Mr Ruddock to undertake this task as my Special Envoy for Citizenship and Community Engagement.</p>
<p>A national conversation about citizenship will enable us to consider whether the rights and responsibilities of citizenship are well understood and how we can better promote these, including among young Australians.</p>
<p>The consultation will seek the publicâs views on further possible measures, including the suspension of certain privileges of citizenship for those involved in serious terrorism.</p>
<p>A consultation paper on Australian citizenship and further information on the submissions process can be found at <a href="http://www.citizenship.gov.au">www.citizenship.gov.au</a>.</p>
