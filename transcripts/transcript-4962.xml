PRESSOFFICETRANSCRIPT_ 22 FEBRUARY 1979<br />
INTERVIEW WITH NATIONAL DIRECTOR OF METAL TRADES<br />
INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION, MR. KEN FRY<br />
FROM ABC'S " NEWSVOICE", 22/ 2/ 79<br />
National Director of the Metal Trades Industry Association<br />
is speaking about the reasons behind the increased<br />
confidence:<br />
MR. FRY:<br />
I think the major thing is the very excellent improvement<br />
in the reduction in the rate of inflation. I think, with<br />
inflation down around it restores confidence of<br />
the businessman considerably. That's not to say we don't<br />
want it down further we certainly can't be content with<br />
it where it is but we have found that the reduction<br />
in the inflation rate, particular when compared with<br />
other country's inflation rate, the present level of our<br />
exchange rate, has made us really more competitive than<br />
we were 12 months ago so that we are getting more orders<br />
than we were getting then.<br />
Question: Do you think the results of the survey are just one indicator<br />
of what could be a further economic recovery?<br />
MR. FRY:<br />
Yes, we think that ourselves. We don't want to overstate<br />
the figures. We think the recovery will Drobably be<br />
gradual but this is the first time in four years, in our<br />
surveying of our industry, that we've seen encouraging<br />
signs. So we read these as very favourable and that we<br />
think that the industry now is going to improve from<br />
this position. 000---</p>
