    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MNOSIE<br />FOR MEDIA 13 January 1984<br />Following invitations from the Governments of Japan, the<br />Republic of Korea# China, Singapore and Malaysia, I will be<br />visiting North East and South East Asia early in February.<br />I have been keen to pay early visits to these countries<br />in Australia's neighbourhood, all in different ways of<br />great importance to Australia's future.<br />The fiUrst country on my itinerary is Japan ( 31 January<br />4 February) 4 Australia and Japan have developed an extremely<br />close economic partnorship, whiich has acquired deepenincl<br />political importance as our mutual interests in the Western<br />Pacific area have expanded ovor recent years. I will have<br />an audience with His Majesty the Emperor and will attend a<br />lunch which he will host. I expect to have discussions in<br />Tokyo with Prime Mlinister Nak~ sone and his Cabinet colleagues<br />on a range of bilateral issued as well as exchange views on<br />regional and international devc. opments.<br />I am keen to see something of.

I also wish to inform Japanese business<br />leaders about the Australian Covernment's economic policies<br />which are important in building further the trade and economic<br />ties between our countries.<br />From Japan I will travel to th'e Republic of Korea ( 4 7 February).<br />ROK President Chun was to visit Australia in October of last<br />year but was prevented from doing so because of the bombing<br />tragedy in Ranigoon which resu]~ ted in a postponement of his<br />visit. Australia and the Republic of Korea have a rapidly developing<br />political and trade relationship and my visit will provide an<br />opportunity to have discussions with President Chun and his<br />Government on a wide range of issues of mutual interest. In<br />addition to bilateral matters, Australia has a close interest<br />in strategic developments affecting the Korean Peninsula and<br />this I expect will be discuss~ d in Seoul.<br />I will then pay my first visit as Prime Minister to China<br />( 7 12 February). In the years that followed the decision by<br />the! Whitlam Labor Government to establish diplomatic relations<br />between Australia and the Peoples Republic of China, successive<br />Australian Governments have wqrked to expand the wide-ranging<br />and close relations which exist between the two countries.<br />When Premier Zhao visited Aust: ralia in April last year, he<br />invited me to go to China to Continue and develop the close<br />dialogue which was given fresh impetus during his stay in our<br />country. I look forward to doing this.<br />In addition to Peking, I will visit Shanghai. / 2</p>

I will visit Singapore ( 12 44 February).<br />During the Commonwealth Heads'of Government meeting in<br />New Delhi last November, I held u.-efu. discussions with<br />Prime Minister Lee and the Foreign Minister of Singapore.<br />It was agreed that it was important that Australia and<br />Singapore should maintain the momentum of these contacts<br />and I accepted the suggestion of Prime Minister Lee to call<br />in to Singapore on my return from North East Asia.<br />I have not yet had the privilege of meeting Dr Mahathir, the<br />Prime Minister of Malaysia, so I propose to briefly visit<br />Kuala Lumpur to meet with him and members of his Government<br />on 14 February.<br />Australia's relations with AStAN are of major importance.<br />During the course of last year, I visited both Indonesia and<br />Thailand; to be able to have discussions with Malaysia and<br />Singapore during the course ot this visit will broaden the<br />range of my contacts with ASEAN leaders, and further strengthen<br />Australia's already solid relationship with the nations of<br />the South-East Asian region.<br />The itinerary is:<br />-Hong Kong, 729 -31 January<br />Tokyo, 31 January 3 Febiuary<br />Osaka, 3 4 February<br />Seoul, 4 7 February<br />Peking. 7 11 February<br />Shanghai, 11 12 February<br />Singapore, 12 14 February<br />Kuala Lumpur. 14 15 February</p>
