    <content><![CDATA[<p>I have convened a meeting of indigenous leaders and experts in Canberra on Wednesday 23 July to discuss the issue of domestic violence in indigenous communities. I want to listen to their views and, in particular, to talk to those who are providing community leadership in addressing the tragic consequences of the abuse of indigenous women and children.</p>
<p>I have been impressed that an increasing number of indigenous leaders have spoken out about the reasons and appalling consequences of violence and abuse within indigenous communities.  I want to hear and understand their views at first hand.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasise that no section of the Australian community is free from domestic violence and child abuse. We must always be working to counter it wherever it occurs. But there is mounting evidence that amongst indigenous Australians the incidence of abuse within families and communities is, for a variety of reasons, higher than it is for  the wider Australian community.</p>
<p>The occurrence of violence, and related issues of alcohol and drug abuse, is having a tragic impact on indigenous people.  This deeply concerns the government. I welcome the fact that indigenous leaders are now speaking out on these difficult issues.  At the local level many communities are instigating programmes to try and prevent or mitigate the appalling consequences of abuse.  They deserve our support.</p>
<p>State Governments have an important role to play. Most of them, as well as the Commonwealth, already have programmes which address the issue. I want to consider how these government programmes could be better planned and delivered.</p>
<p>We all have a responsibility to act to redress this appalling situation.  We are determined that out of this meeting we will initiate further action to tackle the abuse of indigenous women and children.</p>
<p>The issue is challenging. The problems will not be easily solved. Resources are important, but even more important is support for the community leadership necessary to bring about the behavioural change that is required.</p>
<p> My aim on 23 July will be to listen to the indigenous leaders attending the meeting and to explore their views.  I welcome their willingness to meet the government to discuss how to stop the abuse taking place.  I sincerely hope that together we can plan a better future.</p>
<p>The insights of indigenous leaders will help to inform the scheduled discussion on indigenous child protection with Premiers and Chief Ministers at the next Council of Australian Governments'; meeting on 29 August.</p>
<p>The Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Amanda Vanstone, and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Larry Anthony, will also attend the meeting.</p>
