PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, REGENT HOTEL, MELBOURNE, MONDAY, 23 MAY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: What is your view of the leadership challenge that is going on this<br />
afternoon? I<br />
PMV: Well, whether the Liberal party changes jockeys or not, this is just<br />
about people, about who they think can sell the same policies better.<br />
They might say, " we are not running the GST anymore". It's not about<br />
the GST, that is out, everyone thinks that's o-6jt,' the Liberal party. It is<br />
about the general cast of their policies. This is not a contest about<br />
policies and ideas, it is a contest about who can sell them the best. I<br />
think, the Liberal party has reached the stage in its political history<br />
where its usefulness to Australian society is very debatable,<br />
exceptionally debatable, because I don't think it has touch with the<br />
great majority of Australians, I don't think it understands the way<br />
Australia is these days or what its future is. So, whether it is John<br />
H, ewsori or Alexander Downer or whoever, until the Liberal party<br />
decides to change the way it thinks about Australia and to look at<br />
Australia in broad terms rather than sectional terms as it did at the last<br />
election and the one before that, and the one before that, then, I think,<br />
the Liberal party changing jockeys will not change the nature of the<br />
horse.<br />
J: Would you take advantage of the instability in the party and call an<br />
early election?<br />
PMV: I get asked early election questions every day of the week and I give<br />
them the same answer elections are too hard to win without giving<br />
away free time. Thank you.<br />
