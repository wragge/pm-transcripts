that the historic partnership between their two countries was continuing to<br />
deepen and grow in significance for the security and progress of the Pacific<br />

gratification with the existing scientific co-operation between the two<br />
countries. Such co-operation has advanced the state of science not only<br />

that the special assistant to the President for science and technology and<br />
a team of leading United States' scientists would visit Australia soon to<br />
meet with the Australian Minister for Education and Science and his<br />
colleagues, to identify additional areas appropriate for co-operative<br />
activities and explore ways in which the close co-operation between the<br />
American and Australian scientific communities could be broadened and<br />
extended. Stressing the importance of the soundness of the dollar to<br />
the maintenance of prosperous international economic conditions, the<br />
Prime Minister reiterated his full support for the President's programme<br />
to reduce the United States' balance of payments deficit. The President<br />

undesirable effects on Australia or other nations of measures taken under<br />
the programme.<br />

situation in South Vietnam, where Australian and American forces are<br />
fighting side by side to assure.-the right of the Vietnamese people to<br />

interest in the area, and assured the Prime Minister of his keen interest<br />
in the progress of the consultations and in the outcome of the forthcoming<br />
