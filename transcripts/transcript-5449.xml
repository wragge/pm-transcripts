PRIME MINISTER SUJNDA~ Y, 21 SE~ PTEMBWER 1980<br />
ADDRESS TO IBERAL~ SPEAKERS~ GROUP CONM'PZNCF,<br />
ME LBOU RNE<br />
I would like to thank you all for the invitation to-be with you<br />
th{ i mrning and for the timely way in which. you have organised<br />
this meeting. You obviously had some percipience about the<br />
date of the election.<br />
I have been asked to speak this morning principally about the<br />
Labor Party and the damage that the policies of the Labor Party<br />
Wdui1ia-do to A~ ustralia. I will only just skirt around the edges<br />
of this particular subject, becaise if one : wey6 to Speak in fUll<br />
about thf-damage that thoir policies would do to Autralia<br />
that persaon would2 ttay on his feet for 24 houxso anid still rnot<br />
oy-hauxt the subject.<br />
It-* s, ot likely that this could have been a Labor Speakers<br />
Group, because with what has happened over the last couple of<br />
weeks, if it we3r2, the meeting . Wop-ld bave had to be cancelled.<br />
Today I w'ould like tc, mention the AlP,-' s economic -policies which<br />
are in part at least written by Jim lRouilston of the A1WSU defence<br />
-polee-is centralism; the damnage they would do to develop~ rent7<br />
what they would do to industrial relations -that would not<br />
exist, under Labor and energy pdlicies..<br />
We all know what happened in 1972-75 whein inflation -increased<br />
* four-foldi in three year: s. Thle AIX inherited a relatively soi,, d<br />
~~~-anl-stro9 c-onemTy an) d did cnormouz damnage to it. They-inherited*<br />
an econonry thnt had traditionally peirfomed better than the world<br />
average, and they mn-hl it into one cif thti viAeaet economies<br />
in the world; with qrowth and inurc: inflation than in most<br />
of our tr! adlng partner.<br />
n o. ne year rcderal award wacy. 5, urdiar the promnotion, of Mr; Hiawxe,<br />
went up by 38% in one year. Whe~ n thl-ink of the industrial<br />
record of thos-a years;, should rnmcmber the close ard -friendly<br />
relationships bi! etween Mr. Hlawke and Fr. whitlamf as Prime Miinister.<br />
I am suro everyone and Mrz. Hawko would agree, that he was int<br />
a position oaf qre: at influence. Well, it was an influene' that Oi<br />
not do much for At; tral.-a.<br />
Health expenditure went up 114% -in one year'; uder Mr. Hayden's<br />
gentle care. Perponal inco-me taxes went up 125%-it is nio<br />
wonder that thv coantry was being btinkrupted. </p>

When we came in~ to office at the efld of 1975 it was very likr'et' 2in<br />

H-ave they learnt anything Ovef-r the last five years? If wie j. iste-n<br />
to them: not very much. In five of exp: Enditure alone thje--<br />
are cc,-tted to * 2, O00 Yndllion-mnually of additional e'% qpend1 ture,<br />
as conted by the operative depa-tments an: 3 by the Depaxtmrent of<br />

It is no wonder that Mr. 1-Iay'dn wants to do away wi ' th the Department<br />

It was Mr. Willis who elaborated on oth~ er maasures when he said<br />
it was " wrong" if we didn't have " some form of tax on capital,<br />
be it death duties, capital gjains tax, wealth taxt or perhaps<br />
som~ e kind of combination of those, or Lll three". If that is not<br />
sufficient warning, then Mr. Hayden in a little tape we have<br />
ofiT--' it was sent to all. bxanches of the L~ abor Party arotwid<br />
the cowx) try and I suppose the fa , fLthf ul were meant to play it and<br />
listen to -it in rapture -he Esaid; ' locok, if what we are talking<br />
about publicly doesn't meet what you. want. in fact, read the<br />
whole policy document, read the whole platform,, because there are<br />
an enormous numnber of -things in it, and they are co~ itted to doing<br />
th-c-lo. ) 3ut'in our ptibaic presentation we arc cowitted to being<br />
selective, because otherwise it won'It sound too good.' ILThis was<br />
all on tape. it was a remiarkable little tape, But it made it<br />
perfectly plain that they are committed to doing everything in<br />
the platform document. Because of these statements onl tax, nlobody<br />
could say that Australians have not been warned.<br />
There is in that abortive social contract, a promise of a ' P oyaJ.<br />
Co~ mmission into wealth'-~ who would undertake that? Who* would wan~ t<br />
to be in charge of that R~ oyal Commission? is it going to be<br />
Bill h-artltoy, or is it goiThg to be Llizn Roulston? They are<br />
probably amongst the likely candidates. Under covpr of -swflthing<br />
__ oaf-th t Yik -, ntx\ ducinq a wealth tax, a capital gains tax, or<br />
re-establishing death duties must be high on the list of the<br />
objectives of the Labor Party and of' the socialist left iri this State.<br />
it was Mr. 11awke who called the ALP eccoonic poliC-Y in Adelaide 1&amp; ast<br />
year a ' gutloss sellout to the loft,'. 8vcn Neville Wran, whent he<br />
was calling it a I'hotchpotch' Pteturning to<br />
the thro-e to fLive yearly Budget insteaa of having one once a year,<br />
and remnembering it was Clem Jones in Brisbane who said Mr. Hayden<br />
could not even rea6 a balance sheet, when he starts getting into<br />
difficulty in the second, third or fourth year, no doubt it will<br />
be Hartley who will tell hkrn what the red figures mean.<br />
T1h at is enough on~ eoonomics, because their economidcs is hopeless.<br />
it jiu. t does not * exist. It ' w-ould be a disaster. It would destroy<br />
the gainvs that have been worn Over five yeare. And instead of<br />
having a proud placc within the internzationzxl economic comunity,<br />
Australia would ifuediately become one of the weakest nations<br />
in the world. I am GurC that Aust. li.-ns are not going to<br />
&amp;) an~ fl he ind of confidencE that tbh'-y do ncA-7 have in* Australia's<br />
future for the hopelessness that would flow from Labor's policies.<br />
Let me turn now to deflencea. T1hey hav. e given some kind of lip<br />
ser--) ce, to condemnation of the invasiona of Afghardistann; sose<br />
kindI of lip service to s upport for the increased defence expenditure<br />
-th~ hwv&amp; e n~ ftkenin Akistralia. ntit on every hand,<br />
their tcndency is to criticioce what we dwhat the. U~ nited States<br />
do-_ s. And where do you find critioisi~ i of the Soviet Union, of<br />
the Soviet Union's invasion of Afaitno h Svet Un ion' a<br />
-stipport for that terrible occutpation of 1
</p><p>Vienono, troops which is costing the Soviets $ 1,000 glillicn<br />

interest and Au! ta'alia irs not threatened after l3. Who<br />
would wbint Afghanistan" V. That was M-x. 1( cating shortly a fter<br />
the invz~ sion, in January of this yezir. Well, the Sovets obviously<br />

more dignity and norality in the Soviet Union than there is in<br />
our own society andi in -many Western sjocitties' 1. Tall that tethe<br />

it that the Australian Labor Party feels utterl. y unable to<br />
understand that.<br />
it is not surpris5ing now, that when you find a senior columist<br />
in the Melbourne Age. sayingj some aspects of Labor policy as<br />
presented by senior spokesmen, are remrarkably similar * to those<br />
of one or other of the Australian commwnist gjroupings.-That is<br />
not the iberals or Mialcolmn Fraser saying that: it is a senior<br />
and xespected coluinnist in th6 Melbourne Age.<br />
T'here have been othL-r things. What did happen at that midnight<br />
meting between Mr. Hayden and Yasser Axafat where there were<br />
no witnesses to what occurred. Were there agreements entered into?<br />
Understandings entered into? lie all know Mr. Hfartley's affiliations<br />
and sympathies in thes c particular areas, over the years long<br />
exhibited. I woiild be very surprised if somzewh( Fe In the<br />
backgrpund Rr. Hartley's influence was not evident in relation. to<br />
that vi it and to that pbrticular m~ eting.<br />
How is it that a senior Victorian spokesman for the Australian<br />
Labor Party, and for the socialist left, wrote with such<br />
enthusiasm a pross report: " JAustralians must re-atÃ± Ge,:' tU<br />
Iranians, that the United States is thie numb~ er one enemy".<br />
Well, we know that that happens&amp; to bti the view of the sociali~ st<br />
left in this Stiite. It is oor task to make sure that all<br />
Australians know~ that that is the view of the socialist left,<br />
anda thereforct of a very s iqnificant clement witbin the Ai. lstralian<br />
Labor Party. TYhat Lp~ oCkTo smanl Called for tle--VpeVa lo-t-r-<br />
Sovie t invasion, of AfqhaniEstan, bnd he happens to be not only<br />
zrcnor spokesmain for the socialint left, but as I-am advised,<br />
a senior pre ss officer for Mx. Wilkes. And for a leader of the<br />
Labor Part%, in tho political. domain to allow any servant of his<br />
to makQ zn statc-rent like that and to stand unrepudiated-is<br />
to have the Labor Parti. y cendorsing that kind of statement. So,<br />
you have the two policies--that particular policy and the<br />
lukewcaUn coiidemn-ation of Afghanistan from some spokesmen in<br />
the Fede(, ral VPariiamont.<br />
There tre. 2 other ac of the Labor Party which have not clhanged.<br />
W They want to. D-n the Com), titutjun to iace that " the Sentate<br />
has no P0% 4cr to roject, dfror oth--iv-ise block bbilil } l<br />
just to Minirdf,. u the ' 2~ r of the Senate i. nstea:-d to abolish the<br />
Scriate. Thay n1~ want to amend the CcArstitu~ iaa to provide for<br />
its ajlte-ration by a sipemajority of the alectorate, offering,<br />

of alteringc the Constitution ought to rer min.. But the Labor<br />
Party wouId Sc'eX to aboli: sh it. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
There are some spokcsmel, sc~) l Messiahs of the Labor Party,<br />
who wouild plaimnly seek to cio ivluch. further. Mr. flawKe has s aid<br />
" we must have one government with unqiuestioned power. 1<br />
unqujestioned for what? Not to bie : subject* to chall~ nlqe befo-e<br />
tile High Court? Not. to 1z-subject to. challenge beauae -theY<br />
infringe upon States' xiij hts? It is an interesting phxa-!-e-j--<br />
' 1with unquestionable power". Couple that with the-attacks<br />
of th:, Labox Party on thc Ei9l, Court over the last eight Months.<br />
When you add thor.( e up, they comi-to considertalc conaemnations)<br />
anO critici., rns indced, It is no accident that this Labor Party,<br />
which criticises everything of importance in our socic-ty, tins<br />
over the last year tui~ rned considierable attention to the Ifigh<br />
Court itself, which is the bulwar), of the. Constitutior, and a<br />
dei end er-7YUhhe rgtsadFlbtyof individUal Australians. I<br />
But Mr. Iiawke wyent on t Australians would be better serve'a<br />
by the elimination of the eecond tier of goverfl-nt* that is, I<br />
by the elindnation of the States. And I must Confess that I<br />
don't havtc zny idea what Statcs' xcights are". We do believe<br />
inl a U. ivcrstfiation of power. We do not believe t'hat all powier<br />
be in the hainds of orne qroup of people, anid especia) ly&amp;<br />
Country as large as hustralia.<br />
W~ hat would have happened to this country if there hzad bLe-n nc,<br />
Sta-tcs from~ 1972-75, and there had beenj total power in the bands<br />
of M~ r. Whitlom, D~ r. Cairns and 1. Hiayden becatise he was a part<br />
of it, suppz~ rting everyt-hing that was then clone. The disasteys<br />
thrat befell tis ould have inacinifi ed rnan-fol3. and our capacity<br />

There have zwnrqcurncntc. over the Iast 10, 12 or 14 years that.<br />
have befen ( liff~ cult for tile Liberal Party and for he nation.<br />
Offshore sovoreiqinty and High Court cases which gate authority<br />

OWN </p>
<p>-7-<br />
old philosophy of being much more concerned about the distributi. on<br />
o! wealth than about the creation of11 it not understanding that<br />
if there is not the creation of wealth, gove-nmentG will never<br />
have_ adequate resources to meet the needs and aspirations of<br />
their own people, for schools,_ bor hospita1. s, 4QrDXjoads1 Aor all<br />
the environn'ental services nation~ al pazks and all the rest that<br />
people expect of Goverrnments in a modern society.<br />
Quite apart from what Governments need, without the creation of:<br />
additional national wezlth, there w~ ill no~ t be the resources<br />
available to people, for. them and their families to. lead the<br />
kind of lives that they wotild want in a free society, because<br />
ifGovernrrints consue more, there is less . imameciately for<br />
famnilies to consume, What we produce in any one year is finitra.<br />
To ca: st doubt on tile rIZatLJXe of development, to -quggest that there<br />
should not be as much development: well, from 1972-75 they<br />
stopped development dead in its tracks. We zhould not doubt<br />
their capacity to do that once again.<br />
S They have said they would expand the functions of the Foreign<br />
Investmerit PPOvicw Board, whih1 Australian<br />
equity in major resouxce projects very well over the last five<br />
years. They are also going to establish a spying body;<br />
. infox ration is to be gathercd about trans-national corporatio s.<br />
Ithere will be a tmonitol'ing agency, a spy agency, to fined out<br />
information on the trn-ainlcorporations and to give that<br />
to the relevant dorrastic and internatioi~ al trade uniont orgamisations<br />
and to the Unitiid Nations, W'ell, you do that and iwl hat overseas<br />
-corporation would ever again invest in Australia. So when<br />
Mr. Hayde-n says lie doubits thqt there should bpe as much investment<br />
and dcvellp mnt golng forward as wc h~ planned, as we have<br />
encouraged, and will continue to, we K-now quite well that he<br />
has the irnzncdiate pcor and the capacityll and the policiea to<br />
prevent th'at occuring, We should not doubt what they say in<br />
relation to it.<br />

Mr. h1awk-e, as President of the Australian Council of T'rade Unions<br />
he % was from 197 to 197$ in a position of enormous influence:<br />
President of the ACTU and President of the Australian Labor Party<br />
with a warm~, constructive, beneficial relationship with thie A1p<br />
Pr_ 4ne Minister of the day. What happened asi a result of that<br />
beneficial and productive relationship? Federal award wages went<br />
up 38% in the 12 -months ' to March. That was one' result of that<br />
relationship. * knoothor result was an. All time-record of well over<br />
6 million ian-day. 5 beingj lost in. 1974 for industrial disputes.-<br />
Is there any suggestion or any reason -to believe tha-the same<br />
would not happen again; that he will have m~ ore influence with<br />
thQ union:~ moven~ ent aF. a politician than he hadl -as President<br />
of the ACTU. If there were to be a better aituation with M. r.<br />
Hawko In the Parliament. than out of it, one carn only assume then<br />
that his influence a5 President of the AC'TU was one for the<br />
worse than one for the better. But it is worth nothing that he<br />
a i the-mnjor contribution of a Hayden Labor<br />
Government with myself as Minister for Induatrial. Rclationu<br />
will be to take the Government out of the role Of active<br />
participant; to be there simply to put its resources andi<br />
kno-vledge for the availability of the Commission and of the<br />
That of course, is precisely the pozition that Labor adopted in<br />
197&gt;-75; with the kind of results which you knuw-raIe-as 11<br />
said: " the Caom-monwealth is trying to take over the major role<br />
of arquing a position". That's * not the position of a Governet,<br />
he saiys. " It sihould put a factual: position before it and leave<br />
it to the parties Well, who isgoing to Protect the public<br />
intereslt? Who is cdoing to arque acainrst that kind of siv<br />
wage incrcoasc -391% as occourred in the 3.2 months to marbh1975.<br />
.~ cauerloy~ ckn wsthat that is against the interests<br />
of every ceployce, and every business and manufacturer knows that<br />
it in against their iintcrests like wise. I suppose Cliff Dolan<br />
who is President of the ACTU, and we will look forward to working<br />
with him and with thie ACTO after the elections made it plain<br />
that there is no social Contract between thie ACTU and the Labor<br />
Party. But I sug~ est that the philosophy that the Labor Party<br />
has ad. optee.\, Hawkte or no, would be a damaging Policy indeed.<br />
