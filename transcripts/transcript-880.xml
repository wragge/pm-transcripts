^ y'Ã±-ALIA DAY<br />
Message By The Pre Mister e Rt, Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Australia Day is for both memory and decision.<br />
What great events have moved across the face of Australia since<br />
January 26, 1788.' We can look back with pride on what has been<br />
achieved in almost every field of life. In this sense we are<br />
the inheritors of the work of the past. But this does not mean<br />
that we can be content merely to live on our inheritance. We must<br />
add to it, so that future generations will look back on what we<br />
have done with a pride similar to that with which we regard the<br />
work of our predecessors. In this sense, Australia Day is<br />
an occasion for renewing our determination to build soundly on<br />
the existing foundations, to develop new resources, to build up<br />
a wider and fuller civilisation. In short, we must see ourselves<br />
as the present pioneers of an even botter Australian future.<br />
Particularly in times of great prosperity, we may be tempted to<br />
regard ourselves as beneficiaries -nd to forget that we must<br />
be contributors as well. I have no doubt whatever that the<br />
national character will continue to rise to the challenge of the<br />
future, not ignoring difficulties or pretending they don't exist,<br />
but with complete confidence in our capacity to overcome threm and<br />
to play our part in what should ho c notable national growuli in<br />
the years to come.<br />
CANBERRA. January, 1963. </p>
