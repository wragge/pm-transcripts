I ill make an official visit to India on 10-11 July. This will be the first official visit to India by an Australian Prime Minister since 1989.</p>
<p>During my visit I will have talks with President Narayanan, Vice-President Kant, Prime Minister Vajpayee and senior Indian ministers. My aim is to further advance Australia's economic and political partnership with India.</p>
<p>Australia's links with India have grown considerably over the past ten years with the opening of the Indian economy. Australia recognises India as an increasingly important player in regional and international affairs, and will pursue with India an enhanced dialogue on economic and strategic issues of mutual interest.</p>
<p>I will discuss with Mr Vajpayee the potential for broader commercial cooperation and improved trade between Australia and India. Given the size of India' s emerging market and the complementarity between our economies, there are significant opportunities for Australia companies interested in investing in India, including in the IT and telecommunications sector.</p>
<p>In 1999, Australia's total trade with India amounted to $2.1 billion. Australian investment in India is currently estimated to be in excess of $1 billion.</p>
