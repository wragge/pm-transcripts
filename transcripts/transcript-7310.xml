CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
CONFERENCE ON CHILD POVERTY<br />
MELBOURNE 8 APRIL 1988<br />
In thanking you for your invitation to address this National<br />
Conference on Child Poverty, I want to congratulate you on<br />
your initiative in convening the conference and t. 9 wish you<br />
well in your deliberations.<br />
It is inevitable that a major focus of your attention today<br />
and tomorrow will be the new cash payments available for low<br />
income families as a result of a campaign pledge I made<br />
during the Federal election last year.<br />
It is inevitable because the new Family Allo; wance Supplement<br />
is, quite simply, the largest and the most effective assault<br />
made by any Australian Government upon poverty among our<br />
children. I will have some comments to make about the Family Package<br />
shortly.<br />
But at the outset I want to underline forcefully that the<br />
new program is not the only weapon the Government is using<br />
in combating child poverty.<br />
Nor did our determination to combat poverty and to improve<br />
living standards of Australians and especially the living<br />
standards of the least well-off members of the community<br />
suddenly begin last December when the first Family Package<br />
payments were made.<br />
From our earliest days in office, I made it clear that,<br />
though we had some hard economic decisions to take, there<br />
was a clear and vital purpose to that economic strategy.<br />
That purpose, as I put it in my address to the National<br />
Economic Summit shortly after we took office, was " the<br />
maintenance and, through time, an improvement of..<br />
standards of living."<br />
That ambition was expressed as well in the Prices and<br />
Incomes Accord between the Federal Government and the trade<br />
union movement which recognised, the significant contribution<br />
to living standards made by social wage increases. 0056i42 </p>
<p>2.<br />
We in Government as a Party, a ministry, and a Cabinethave<br />
never lost sight of that purpose of maintaining and<br />
through time improving living standards.<br />
Indeed as a Government facing extraordinarily adverse<br />
international economic conditions, I believe we have been<br />
singularly effective in working towards that purpose.<br />
But politics is not only about policy achievement.' It is<br />
also about effective communication of those achievements.<br />
As the recent defeat of the tlnsworth Government, and the<br />
anti-Labor swings in the two South Australian Federal<br />
by-elections made clear, we seem to have been less<br />
successful in that important communications task.<br />
I accept the need for better communication and it's a task<br />
in which groups such as yours have certain responsibilities<br />
as well.<br />
What I do not accept is that our achievements themselves are<br />
in question that we have failed not only in communication<br />
but in the more basic task of structural reform and<br />
redistribution.<br />
Labor today is presented with a two-fold communications<br />
task.<br />
We must make clear the continuing necessity flor the economic<br />
strategy we have had to follow.<br />
Because our economic difficulties, our need to restructure,<br />
the imperative to become a more competitive and productive<br />
nation will not disappear overnight. Our economic strategy<br />
is bearing fruit. Australia is turning the corner. But<br />
there is still a long haul ahead of us.<br />
At the same time, we must make clear the ways in which that<br />
economic strategy is intimately tied in with, is dependent<br />
on, and is allowing substantial progress in, our strategy<br />
for the achievement of social justice in Australia.<br />
Labor's economic and social justice strategies have simply<br />
been two sides of the same coin: creating a prosperous<br />
Australian community and distributing that prosperity<br />
throughout the community.<br />
For example, an integral part of the Government's economic<br />
strategy has been the'securing of wage restraint.<br />
This has helped make Australia a more competitive exporter<br />
and thus has enabled us to fulfil the basic task of paying<br />
our way in the world.<br />
But it has also created the circumstances whereby Australia<br />
has been able to record a job growth of more than twice the<br />
rate of the Western industrialised world, and four times the<br />
rate under our conservative predecessors. 0 05I64 3 </p>
<p>over one million new jobs have been created since Labor came<br />
to office in 1983.<br />
It is an established fact that the best route out of poverty<br />
and dependence is employment. So one million extra jobs<br />
means one million Australians providing for themselves and<br />
their families.<br />
of particular relevance to this conference, it means'a<br />
significant number of children who are not living in poverty<br />
who might otherwise have done so had their family been<br />
unemployed. Similarly, there have been important social justice<br />
implications from Labor's taxation and welfare reforms.<br />
By introducing the capital gains and fringe benefits taxes,<br />
we created not only a more efficient taxation system but a<br />
fairer one.<br />
By eliminating welfare payments to those who did notneed<br />
them such as through the assets test on pensions and means<br />
testing of family allowances we have been able to target<br />
more assistance on those welfare recipients who are in<br />
greatest need.<br />
As a major step in the Government's new effort to<br />
communicate our social justice achievements and future<br />
directions I will shortly be launching a Government report<br />
on social justice called Towards a Fairer Australia.<br />
It will demonstrate beyond question that the real wage<br />
declines suffered by Australian workers have been matched by<br />
significant improvements in the social wage, especially for<br />
those on the lowest incomes.<br />
In other words, and despite media claims to the contrary,<br />
there is no simple equation between those real wage cuts and<br />
declines in living standards of individual families.<br />
And the new report will also demonstrate that the very real<br />
improvements which have been made since 1983 in the quality<br />
and quantity of services provided by Government have not<br />
been introduced in a random fashion.<br />
They have not been bandaids applied to social problems only<br />
as they happen to arise.<br />
Rather they have been part of a consistent, carefully<br />
thought out and properly funded strategy to improve social<br />
justice in Australia.<br />
Nowhere is this clearer than in the measures we are taking<br />
to wipe out the need for Australian children to live in<br />
poverty. As you know, the new payment offers, on a means tested<br />
basis, significant cash assistance~ to Australian families<br />
struggling to make ends meet. 0056bt44 </p>
<p>4.<br />
It recognises in a tangible way that parents incur heavy<br />
costs in raising children.<br />
Eligible families receive a ma ximum tax-free payment of $ 22<br />
a week for each child under 13 years old; children aged 13<br />
to 15 receive $ 28 a week.<br />
Currently nearly 115,000 low-income working families are<br />
receiving the new payment still well down on ther Budget<br />
projection of 200,000 families but currently rising with<br />
000 new claims being received each week.<br />
The new payment is also being received by another 400,000<br />
families who receive a social security pension or benefit.<br />
In all, over one million Australian children will benefit<br />
from the Family Package.<br />
The new payment has received favourable comment from all the<br />
organisations sponsoring this conference.<br />
And it was described by Bill Kelty of the ACTJ as '-a<br />
breakthrough for working Australians which, if it had to be<br />
won by traditional industrial means, would have taken<br />
years to achieve.<br />
in fact, for a family earning $ 320, a week with 3 children,<br />
the new tax free payment of $ 66 a week is the equivalent of<br />
a wage rise of $ 93 a week.<br />
As Bill Kelty has also pointed out, the wages system itself<br />
has contained significant biases in favour of the lower paid<br />
with the full support of this Government. These include<br />
the awarding of a $ 10 per week flat increase to all workers<br />
last year and the incorporation of the supplementary<br />
payments principle into the new guidelines. Both of these<br />
favour the lowly paid relative to higher income earners.<br />
In all, the new Family Allowance Supplement is a significant<br />
instalment on our pledge that by 1990 no child need live in<br />
poverty.<br />
We have set targets to raise the level of payments under the<br />
Family Package so that by 1990:-<br />
children under the age of 13 receive 15 per cent'of<br />
the married rate of pension;<br />
children aged 13 to 15 receive 20 per cent of the<br />
married rate.<br />
Once attained, these benchmarks will then be maintained to<br />
ensure the purchasing power of the Family Package is not<br />
eroded by price rises.<br />
But it was never intended that the new Family Package<br />
operate in a vacuum in the elimination of the need for<br />
children to live in poverty. Q 005645 </p>
<p>That is why it is supported by the range of other measures<br />
we have taken to increase the social wage and protect the<br />
less well-off.<br />
The Government's record on job creation, as I have already<br />
said, promises income security for many Australians whose<br />
children would otherwise be in poverty.<br />
Supplemented by the doubling of child care places over the<br />
last five years, this record means many families now have<br />
the opportunity to work which previously was denied them.<br />
We have alleviated poverty traps which needlessly meant<br />
hardship for many pensioners and beneficiaries..<br />
our reformi of education and training programs will also have<br />
the long-term effect of reducing the incidence of poverty.<br />
If young Australians are encouraged to complete their<br />
education and to undertake quality job trainirfg, they will<br />
be better equipped to lead satisfying and productive lives<br />
in employment.<br />
Under my Government, retention rates at secondary schools<br />
have risen from just over one-third to more than half;<br />
general recurrent funding for each child at school has risen<br />
by 28 per cent in real terms and financial assistance for<br />
poor students has been more than doubled.<br />
The restoration of Medicare by this Government brought some<br />
two million Australians without health cover under its<br />
protection. This means that families which might otherwise be thrust<br />
into poverty through catastrophic illness or accident have<br />
the security of insurance against the cost of medical<br />
services and access to free hospital care. It has saved the<br />
average family $ 21 a week in private health insurance<br />
premiums.<br />
After unemployment, another major determinant of poverty is<br />
the cost of housing.<br />
That is why the Family Package extended rent assistance to<br />
all low income families.<br />
The shelter needs of homeless people have also received<br />
special consideration. Funding for youth refuges, women's<br />
refuges and shelter for homeless people has increased by 76%<br />
in real terms since 1984, providing assistance to over<br />
60,000 people in need.<br />
We have also doubled real funding for public housing and<br />
introduced the First Home Owners Scheme. Taken together,<br />
these have helped about half a million Australian families<br />
into public housing or into their own homes. Falling<br />
interest rates will also ease the mortgage burden on<br />
Australian families. 4 0 056C* 4 6 </p>
<p>6.<br />
On this matter, I am pleased to report progress in our<br />
efforts to discourage State and Territory Governments from<br />
counting Family Allowance Supplement in calculating rent of<br />
public housing tenants.<br />
With the introduction of the Family Allowance Supplement,<br />
the then Commonwealth Housing Minister wrote to all State<br />
Housing Ministers urging that only 15% of this assistance be<br />
regarded as income for the purpose of setting rents lor<br />
Public Housing tenants in each State.<br />
Despite the obvious attractions for the States to increase<br />
their rental incomes by taking a slice of the Family<br />
Allowance, we have been able to win the co-operation of most<br />
States in ensuring that the integrity of the Family Package<br />
is maintained and that the real benefits of the allowance<br />
flow through to those who need it.<br />
I trust the new Government in New South Wales will honour<br />
the commitment of the previous Government to do all Tt can<br />
to ensure Family Package recipients get the maximum. Denefits<br />
from the new scheme.<br />
The only State to adopt a hostile. and negative attitude to<br />
these proposals has been Queensland, which has a shabby<br />
record in public housing stretching back over many years<br />
though even here, we hope to win some acceptance of the<br />
purpose of the Family Package.<br />
As an extra measure, following Commonwealth representations<br />
in recent weeks, several States are also considering further<br />
reductions in rents for low income households with large<br />
numbers of dependents.<br />
The final outcome of these negotiations will not be known<br />
until the Housing Ministers' Conference next month.<br />
I hope the co-operative attitude most States have displayed<br />
so far will be extended to that Conference so that<br />
low-income families throughout Australia will be able to<br />
benefit fully from the scheme.<br />
The Family Package was intended to help low-income families<br />
not State Government budgets.<br />
Finally, in our efforts to combat child poverty, the<br />
Government has established the new Child Support Scheme.<br />
Currently, more than 70 per cent of non-custodial parents do<br />
not pay regular maintenance for their children.<br />
This helps explain the massive surge over recent years in<br />
the number of sole parent families relying on the welfare<br />
system. The Social Security system now supports more than a<br />
quarter of a million sole parent families with 450,000<br />
children through pensions and benefits. 0O05 0A7 </p>
<p>in the great majority of these cases, the other parent is<br />
capable of contributing to the upkeep of his or her child<br />
but is not meeting the responsibility to do so.<br />
The new Child Support Scheme, the first stage of which is<br />
being introduced in June, will help ensure that parents who<br />
have the capacity to pay can no longer abandon their<br />
financial responsibility to their children.<br />
It will establish a centralised collection agency and<br />
distribution arrangements for maintenance payments. Under<br />
the second stage, to be implemented within a year, the<br />
Government will develop new arrangements to give greater<br />
predictability and fairness to the level of child.<br />
maintenance payments.<br />
When fully operational the Child Support Scheme will provide<br />
secure, regular maintenance for children in these family<br />
circumstances. It will be a major step in combating child<br />
poverty. Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Australians, with the active and constructive assistance of<br />
groups such as the convenors of this conference, have long<br />
felt it was the decent and compassionate thing to do to help<br />
their fellow citizens in need.<br />
They were right. They are still right.<br />
But in the 1980s, we are in an era of harder times and more<br />
difficult choices.<br />
Decency and compassion are still powerful and valuable<br />
forces. But today, Australians have learned that adequate<br />
and carefully costed welfare payments are increasingly<br />
recognised as necessary not just for those reasons but on<br />
equally powerful grounds of national self-interest.<br />
No society can afford, on grounds of morality or<br />
self-interest, to ignore the claims of those of its members<br />
who most need help. Because that help, if given in a timely<br />
fashion, will be fully repaid in-the creation and<br />
preservation of a more harmonious and an increasingly<br />
productive society.<br />
This is surely the essence of a social justice strategy in<br />
times of fiscal restraint, because it encapsulates both what<br />
our hearts say we must do and what our minds say we can-do.<br />
Nowhere is this lesson more true than in the case of those<br />
of our children who live in poverty.<br />
It is essential to realise that a child entering school this<br />
year will leave Year 12 on the very eve of the twenty-first<br />
century. 005648 </p>
<p>So the decisions we make now will be absolutely critical in<br />
determining the kind of Australia that child inherits as he<br />
or she enters the new century.<br />
If we are incapable of helping that child avoid poverty now,<br />
we will be doing an unacceptable disservice not only to that<br />
child but to the Australia of the future. 005 64 9 </p>
