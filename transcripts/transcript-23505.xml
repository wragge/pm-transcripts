    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia has lost a legend.</p>
<p>With his pioneering spirit Sir Jack Brabham personified many great Australian characteristics. He served first in the Royal Australian Air Force and then served his chosen field of motor racing for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Always willing to have a go, Sir JackÂ was named Australian of the Year in 1966, a National Treasure in 2012 and was the first driver in history to be knighted for his services to motorsport. Â He was respected and admired for his spirit, and for his great skill as an engineer.</p>
<p>My thoughts and prayers are with Sir Jackâs family at this time.</p>
