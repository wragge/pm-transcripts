    <content><![CDATA[<p>23RD OCTOBER, 1966.</p>
<p>No Australian Prime Minister can visit the Philippines without recallin with gratitude and admiration the heroic resistance and courage of te people of the Philippines in the Second World  War. It was from the Philippines that General MacArthur came to Australia to base the recovery made by the Allies from their early reversals.</p>
<p>The Philippines and Australia also took part in the United Nations Forces which secured the freedom of the South Korean people from Communist aggression. At the time this seemed a formidable task but it brought forth a vigorous nation which stands with us today in the defence of South Vietnam.</p>
<p>The Philippines and Australia work together for security, national freedom and peaceful progress throughout South-East Asia. We are partners in great enterprises for co-operative economic and social effort, such as the Colombo Plan, J. C. A. F. The Asian Pacific Council and the Asian Development Bank. The Development Bank has its Headquarters in Manila  and should be able to make a valuable contribution to economic growth in Asia.</p>
<p>We meet in acceptance of the historic invitation of President  Marcos and his co-sponsors to work together for the securing of peace, freedom and rehabilitation for the people of the Republic of Vietnam. Our oujective is a just and enduring peace. The allied military effort is not directed to the destruction of the national entity of the aggressor, but it is directed to the termination of aggression. Here in Manila we shall try to further policies advancing the security and peaceful construction of that war-torn country.</p>
<p>The countries represented at this Manila Conference of Chiefs of State or Government have an impressive record of successful work together in international co-operation. Our discussions will bring us a closer identity of policies will strengthen our common purposes and pujlicly domonstrate our dedication to peace, security and progress.</p>
