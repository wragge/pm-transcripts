    <content><![CDATA[<p>23RD OCTOBER, 1966.</p>
<p>No Australian Prime Minister can visit the PhilippinesÂ without recallin with gratitude and admiration the heroic resistanceÂ and courage of te people of the Philippines in the Second World Â War. It was from the Philippines that General MacArthur came toÂ Australia to base the recovery made by the Allies from their earlyÂ reversals.</p>
<p>The Philippines and Australia also took part in the UnitedÂ Nations Forces which secured the freedom of the South Korean peopleÂ from Communist aggression. At the time this seemed a formidableÂ task but it brought forth a vigorous nation which stands with usÂ today in the defence of South Vietnam.</p>
<p>The Philippines and Australia work together for security,Â national freedom and peaceful progress throughout South-East Asia. We are partners in great enterprises for co-operative economic andÂ social effort, such as the Colombo Plan, J. C. A. F. The AsianÂ Pacific Council and the Asian Development Bank. The DevelopmentÂ Bank has its Headquarters in Manila Â andÂ should be able to make aÂ valuable contribution to economic growth in Asia.</p>
<p>We meet in acceptance of the historic invitation of President Â Marcos and his co-sponsors to work together for the securing ofÂ peace, freedom and rehabilitation for the people of the RepublicÂ of Vietnam. Our oujective is a just and enduring peace. The alliedÂ military effort is not directed to the destruction of the nationalÂ entity of the aggressor, but it is directed to the termination ofÂ aggression. Here in Manila we shall try to further policies advancingÂ the security and peaceful construction of that war-torn country.</p>
<p>The countries represented at this Manila Conference of ChiefsÂ of State or Government have an impressive record of successful workÂ together in international co-operation. Our discussions will bringÂ us a closer identity of policies will strengthen our commonÂ purposes and pujlicly domonstrate our dedication to peace, securityÂ and progress.</p>
