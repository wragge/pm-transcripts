    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister, Mr Holt, confirmed today that arising out of a proposal he had made at a recent Council of the Liberal Party, a talk of an informal kind would be held among Commonwealth and State leaders of the Parliamentary Liberal Parties on Commonwealth/ State financial relations. </p>
<p>He said that he had pointed out that it would probably not be possible to hold the meeting until the end of this year or early next year. He would be fixing a time for the meeting once dates for other outstanding commitments had become clearer.</p>
