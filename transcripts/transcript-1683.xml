    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister, Mr Holt, confirmed today thatÂ arising out of a proposal he had made at a recent Council of theÂ Liberal Party, a talk of an informal kind would be held among CommonwealthÂ and State leaders of the Parliamentary Liberal Parties onÂ Commonwealth/ State financial relations.Â </p>
<p>He said that he had pointed out that it would probablyÂ not be possible to hold the meeting until the end of this year or earlyÂ next year. He would be fixing a time for the meeting once datesÂ for other outstanding commitments had become clearer.</p>
