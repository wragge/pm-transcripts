PRIME MNMSTIER<br />
-A<br />
FOR MEDIA THURSDAY, 20 JANUARY 1983<br />
ARMY TO PROVIDE FABRIC TANKS FOR TEMPORARY WATER STORAGE<br />
The Prine. Minister announced today that he had written to the<br />
Premier of Victoria indicating that the Army was prepared<br />
to meet the Premier's request for fabric tanks for temporary<br />
water storage at railheads for transporting water to drought<br />
affected rural towns in Victoria. The Premier had written<br />
indicating that contingency planning was under way for<br />
transporting water by rail to drought affected rural towns and<br />
Shires, and asked that the Army make available, on a stand-by<br />
basis by late January, fabric tanks with a total capacity of<br />
750,000 litres.<br />
This assistance follows on from the Commonwealth's agreement,<br />
conveyed to the Premier by the Acting Prime Minister on<br />
17 December, to allow State expenditure on transporting<br />
water to drought affected towns and households as eligible<br />
for assistance on a $ 3 Commonwealth to $ 1 State basis under<br />
the Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements.<br />
It is a further example of the Comonwealth's willingness to<br />
co-operate with the State Governments in providing measures<br />
of real assistance to those affected by the drought. </p>
