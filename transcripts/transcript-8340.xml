SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING THE COOPERATIVE RESEARCH<br />
CENTRE FOR PLANT SCIENCE<br />
CANBERRA 26 SEPTEMBER 1991<br />
Distinguished guests,<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Governments must grapple with and overcome a host of<br />
urgent problems on a day to day basis. But, while we're<br />
doing that, we have to keep the broader strategy in view, to<br />
stick to the game plan, and to take those decisions which<br />
will benefit: Australia in the longer term.<br />
So it is particularly satisfying to have an opportunity to<br />
step aside from the cut and thrust of the day to day, to<br />
participate in the fruition of a long term policy launch.<br />
Today, we celebrate a further step in the realisation of a<br />
major commitment by my Government to Australia's future.<br />
Our commitment to the Cooperative Research Centres Program<br />
forms an important part of the wider, longer term vision of<br />
the kind of Australia we are seeking to build; an Australia<br />
which will increasingly be able to pay its way in the world<br />
with the currency of its creative skills and technology, to<br />
further expand the provision of secondary and tertiary goods<br />
and services to our established position as a world class<br />
supplier of -primary products.<br />
In March this year I outlined the elements of the<br />
Government's strategy for achieving these goals in my<br />
statement to Parliament, ' Building a Competitive Australia'.<br />
That statement was about what we must do together, in<br />
meeting the economic challenges facing this country; about<br />
putting in place the right policy framework to build an<br />
internationally competitive economy; and about utilising our<br />
resources and mobilising our talents to build our future.<br />
The Cooperative Research Centres Program is a key element of<br />
this framework. It will see the establishment of up to<br />
fifty Centres, of which the first fifteen were announced in<br />
my Parliamentary Statement. </p>
<p>This occasion marks the culmination of that selection<br />
process for one of those fifteen, the cooperative Research<br />
Centre for Plant Science.<br />
The first fifteen Centres were chosen because of the<br />
demonstrated excellence of their proposed programs of<br />
cooperative research, the quality of the researchers they<br />
gathered together, their sound education programs and the<br />
active involvement of industry groups and other research<br />
users. It is through initiatives such as the CRC Program that<br />
Australian ingenuity is given expression and direction in<br />
our national research and development effort, with direct<br />
benefits to the Australian economy, as well as to our<br />
overall strategic goals as a nation.<br />
The Commonwealth Government is providing substantial funding<br />
support for the Program and will be contributing $ 100<br />
million annually in 1990 dollars when the Program is fully<br />
underway. These funds will be very significant in<br />
triggering broader support.<br />
The first fifteen Centres for instance, are expected to<br />
mobilise additional resources from State Governments and<br />
instrumentalities, CSIRO and related organisations,<br />
universities and the private sector, so that for every<br />
dollar the Commonwealth provides, almost $ 2.50 in cash and<br />
kind will be contributed by these sources. This adds up to<br />
an impressive figure, demonstrating the commitment of all<br />
parties to the Program.<br />
The CRC Program, however, is not just about increasing<br />
available research dollars. It is also about better<br />
utilising our existing research resources, building on<br />
existing strengths, consolidating research infrastructure<br />
and ensuring that research is directed at meeting the needs<br />
of research users.<br />
As we all know, Australia has produced many world class<br />
researchers indeed several are here with us today and<br />
what makes the Cooperative Research Centres Program so<br />
exciting is the way it will provide these researchers with<br />
new opportunities to work together.<br />
They will be backed by a concentration of equipment and<br />
associated facilities which are essential to building and<br />
maintaining a leading edge in research.<br />
It will also allow researchers to link more effectively with<br />
end users in industry and Government. This is essential if<br />
the multitude of good ideas that will arise in such<br />
productive environments are to result in tangible benefits<br />
to all Australians. </p>
<p>d 3<br />
The Centres have also established integrated and innovative<br />
education components in their programs. These components<br />
will play a major role in enhancing the quality and skill<br />
levels of Australian science and engineering students.<br />
These studeats, our next generation of researchers, will be<br />
able to train with some of the best research scientists and<br />
engineers in Australia. Their contact with researchers from<br />
outside the Universities will be particularly valuable,<br />
exposing them to the kinds of R&amp; D challenges faced by<br />
leading edge companies and research organisations.<br />
The Cooperative Research Centre for Plant Science is a good<br />
example of ithe CRC: concept in practice. It is a partnership<br />
between the Australian National University, the CSIRO<br />
Division of Plant Industry arnd Biocem [ prnnnunced BiosemJ<br />
Pacific. It will be a Centre of excellence in its field arid<br />
add to the international reputation its constituent partners<br />
have already gained.<br />
Most of you will be well aware of the group's significant<br />
contributions in such areas as the CSIRO's involvement in<br />
the breakthrough ' gene shears' technology, and the ANU<br />
group's discovery of a technique to screen plants for their<br />
water use efficiency, which could increase wheat production<br />
in years of low rainfall.<br />
This Centre will be playing a major role in research and<br />
training relating to modern plant biology and ecologically<br />
sustainable agriculture. It will support and stimulate<br />
Australia's rural industries with better plants, and new<br />
plant based products.<br />
Because of the importance of rural industries to Australia's<br />
economy it can be expected that any major research<br />
breakthrough, any technical edge, will have a direct and<br />
significant impact on our overall trade and economy.<br />
The Centre's program target three major areas research,<br />
education, and liaison with industry.<br />
The research component will focus on learning how to control<br />
plant growth, improving plant quality and assisting plants<br />
to resist pests and diseases.<br />
The education component appears particularly innovative. It<br />
aims not only to provide high level research training, but<br />
also to foster plant science at primary and secondary school<br />
levels to ensure' more students are attracted into plant<br />
science, agriculture and environmental science.<br />
In addition -to its association with Biocem Pacific, the<br />
Centre will Jae encouraging further direct partnerships with<br />
other industrial enterprises. </p>
<p>4<br />
The Centre will initially be funded for seven years. Its<br />
operating costs over that period will total to over $ 37<br />
million, of which the Commonwealth will be providing more<br />
than $ 15 million.<br />
It remains to me to wish the Centre's Co-directors,<br />
Dr Jim Peacock of the CSIRO and Professor Brian Gunning of<br />
the ANU, together with Dr Eric Huttner of Biocem Pacific,<br />
and all those who will be working with them under the<br />
auspices of this Cooperative Research Centre, the very best<br />
for their future endeavours.<br />
It is now with great pleasure that I declare open the<br />
Cooperative Research Centre for Plant Science. </p>
