FO PRESS 3 DEC14BER~ 1977<br />
ADDRESS TOro ASTERN R. EGION 1RAAL~ t-SYDNE\'<br />
This iB the crucis) last week of the election campaigno.<br />
All the polls show that we are winning. but the only poll that<br />
really counts is the poll held next Saturday, the tenthof December...<br />
V. elve still got a lot of hard work to do over the next seven daya.<br />
We've got to do more than just maintain our momentitim.<br />
V. e've got toaccelerate it.<br />
Da vid. Combe, the-secretary of the Labor Party, says lie doesn't<br />
believe the polls.. You all remember David don't yon?<br />
H~ e had. to be brought back off a Russian ship to explain why<br />
Kr Wi tlam triofl to f inanue -Labor'a 1975 election campaiqrt by<br />
borrowing money from a foreiqn government.. David doesn't.<br />
believe the polls because he says that the-y Show Labor is doing<br />
. worse in New South Wales than they did in 1975-Well they should<br />
be doi ng -worse-the -Labor -Party is irsultinigihe intelliqjence of<br />
the A-ustralian people by presenting the same recipe for disaster<br />
they cooked up between 1972 and 1975. They i~ till think that gooc)<br />
government is spending up big they still think that the people wi.<br />
accept a party of diaunity, disagreement and disaccoxA.<br />
Our policies, by contrast, have been vioxking. lie have broken<br />
the back of inflation. inflation is 9 percent-and still falling.<br />
: Interest rates are falling-and in the next twelve months they could<br />
be reduced by as-much as 2 percent that is a saving -of $ 520<br />
a year for the average young couple buying anew, home.<br />
investment is increasing $ 6,000 million of new investment projectare<br />
underway or ready to go that means jobs-, and the Septembet'-<br />
quarter figtires confirm the strength of investment -that nteans<br />
jobs. flecause we have controlled governm~ ent expenditure-we' have<br />
been able to introduce historic tckx reforms tax. cuts for<br />
every taxpayer. Tax Indexation has ended Labor's. tax-ripoff.<br />
Our February tax reforms, reforms which are already low, will.<br />
inject $ 26.7 million into the economy that means jobs.<br />
under our, tax reforms, taxpayers on average earniinqt; of $ 10,000 a yoar wil<br />
pay a marginal rate of tax of only 32 cents 12 cents less than<br />
under Fir Hayden'a scales; and they can increase their income up<br />
to $ 16,000 a year without moving on to a higher marginml rate<br />
of tax. Over 90 percent of taxpayvr~ s will pay' less than)<br />
one quarter of their income in tax,' e WVC.' reStOrCYd illc{-* ivu fcr Wvc-aCAu<br />
and fair reward for achievement. It's worth working overtime again<br />
and an additional quarter of n millionlow income earners with<br />
taxable incomes under $ 3,750 per year including-tens of thousandia<br />
of pensioners, widows and studen~ ts will no longer pay any<br />
tax at all. And we haven't just stopped there.<br />
on being-elected we will-legislate to e-xempt. all estates </p>
<p>I<br />
passing between man and wife,-parent and child, from Federal<br />
estate and gift~ ciuty. From November 27, 1917, -the day of mny<br />
election speech, and over . tihc!: ife of the next Parliam~ ent.<br />
all-Faderal estate andygift duties will.-be entirelyabolished-...<br />
Australia is on the -move again.. We've ( jot, the -real -answer to<br />
unemployment. _ Investment means-jobs;-cjettinq interest rates.<br />
down that means jobs; restraining government eXpenditure,<br />
that means jobs;, giving tax cut. s -that means jobs.-,<br />
M4r Whitlam,-with his usual-high -regard for the truth-said that..<br />
I'd used the term " uneuiployment" just once-in my policy-speech.<br />
Well,, 1. usedl the word. a nximberl of tin-as -and I'd Jlike to<br />
put some of themn on the record allain.'<br />
" Because of our job-maintenance strategy because of the growth and<br />
development-our. polici'es, have mnade-possible, -, unemployment-<br />
-will fall. from PeVbru2ary and )' eep falling'.<br />
I also said:,<br />
" It'is Labor that is the party of unemploymunt. 1: Labor today<br />
are still peddling-the same policies whichin one. year<br />
increased unemployment by 157 percent...<br />
" The only things that went ahead under. Labor-were. inf lation and<br />
unemployment. Mr Whitlin wa-nt8 to dlo it: all agin.<br />
i'd. Iike to repeat that. Pleld do it; all again.<br />
He is obsessed with reducing protection for Australian jobs...<br />
When he was Prime: Minister hu used unemploymen~ t as a aelibexate.<br />
calculated act of government ipolicy.-HeI wipeed ouit-tens of<br />
thousands-.-of Australian jobs with a stroke. of his pen by<br />
slashinqg t ariffs by 25 percent across the-board, dtespite the<br />
fact-that he Wqas officially warned by a report -that-industry<br />
would be harmed and unemployment. would be created.<br />
N'ow he want8 to do it again M~ r Witlan -and -Senator Wriedt<br />
are conunitted to an immediate restructuring .' of industry.<br />
We all -know what. that mneans they want. to restructure tens of<br />
thouisands of Australians onto the dole..<br />
Labor's past performance and present policies make their<br />
protestations of concern for-the unemployed a hollow mockery.<br />
* After. 20 years of full em-ployment xxnder succeSsive -Liber-al<br />
governments they made , unemploymient a major problem, with their<br />
irresponsibility'.~ : their extravagance, their -wages-policy, and<br />
their tariff cutL,* Now~ they'~ re callinq themselves a free trade party<br />
well,-industry~ has' seen through them.-as the Executive Director<br />
of the AnstralianiConfederation.-of Apparel said yesterday:.<br />
" No'industry-could be certain of Burvivl. If a Labor: Party<br />
committed to free-: tradte and the -restructuiring-of industry came into,<br />
power.". I/ 3. </p>
<p>The wor): ing IMvo and women of Austral~ ia have seun through them<br />
that'-3 why Lab) or W'On' t get into p) OWer. We haVe ( given<br />
Austtaliafl industry, ustralian employmen-t, the protection'.<br />
it needs. We have inceceosed proteeticn -for industries with a<br />
total emploNymcnt of ovc-r a q1uarte~ r of a milliun Australians,<br />
We know quite well that. Australia has ciot to focus on the things,<br />
we'xe qood at doing.-Wut to talk% about restructurinq AuJstraliain.<br />
~ iustry at a timo when onernployrnent. is hig4h and the economy, 6<br />
capability is not fully used. just means inore untemploynient,<br />
that's what Mir 19bitlm wants Lo do,<br />
OoY policies have the suppoit of many L~ abor men Pit Dunstan,)<br />
backs our. stand on protection, In Sinclapore last wonth he<br />
said " It's a perfectly proper thing for us to say wo can't<br />
allow our. employment. to be lessened by ilmports which will Simply<br />
throw our people into xihtemploylfeft.".<br />

I t's no wonder Mr Hawke is going around saying M4r<br />

saying " No. It used to be." -The drinkter persisted, saying:.<br />
" But all you see on T. V. is Whitlamr". By this time Mr Hawke'spatience<br />

<p>Obviotusly, Mt. llawke realised this as h3P got int~ o the act'by syin<br />

which he representc l would acce-pt nothing short of full insdcxation<br />
Through all this, the Shadow-Teas: urer, the official spokesman on<br />
these m'atters, sat in shaking ;; ilence. WThen a : 1ouxnalist finally<br />
caught up with him in Cairns, Mrx. 3nrfo-rd Etaid he could. Wt say<br />
what Labor's-policy was because he had only re~ ad the (: aiirts Post.<br />
Last Monday, Mr. 1Jawke announiced that all conflicts were over, thei<br />
would be full indexation: from July. : Yesterday, M~ r. Whft3am said<br />
' Gabor's position was that there. woold only be fifty percent<br />
indexationi from 1978/ 79.<br />
This he said had been decided in the weeks before his policy<br />
speech, it was just that no one had bothered to ask him about it.<br />
Asked why t-he decision had not been annowicea previously, Mr. Whit<br />
sair, there was a limit to the ntwiber of things which would be<br />
announced in a policy speech. And he topped this by saying: " You)<br />
will remember I was only able to read to the rapturous audienqe<br />
in the Opera House, about hal f of the text of the speech",<br />
The Labor Party Is once again demOnIstratinq -what Austral'a,<br />
