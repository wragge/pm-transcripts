FOR MEDIA 13 September 1984<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE HON. J. J. BROWN,<br />
MINISTER FOR SPORT, RECREATION AND TOURISM<br />
The Australian Sports Commission, which will hold its first<br />
meeting today, will bring a new focus to sports funding and<br />
development.<br />
While Federal Governments over the past decade have been<br />
involved in sports development, their efforts have<br />
suffered from fragmentation, erratic funding and lack of<br />
consultation with sports bodies.<br />
The ASC will be responsible for overseeing the allocation of<br />
funds to national sporting associations.<br />
It will also help to develop and implement more imaginative<br />
and effective sports policies and programs.<br />
The Government expects the Commission to achieve two fundamental<br />
objectives. First, it will increase the level of direct input by the<br />
sporting community to the process of defining needs and priorities.<br />
Second, it will have the flexibility and autonomy required to<br />
generate additional funds from the private sector, through a<br />
Sports Aid Foundation, to supplement funds from the Federal<br />
Budget. The Foundation will aim to attract additional, private sector<br />
resources that can be used to support sports development programs<br />
that will benefit all levels of Australian sport, including<br />
assistance to Australia's high performance athletes.<br />
The Foundation will provide Australian sport with a valuable<br />
extra source of funds to complement Federal Government spending.<br />
Sport is a vital element in the life of the vast majority of<br />
Australians. It has been an integral part of our growth and development<br />
as a nation.<br />
Because of our increasingly competitive and technologically<br />
sophisticated environment it will become more important than<br />
ever as a way of celebrating and reinforcing a sense of national<br />
identity. 2 </p>
<p>Sport will continue to make a direct and positive contribution<br />
to individual health, fitness and well being.<br />
It is essential to have a flexible, effective mechanism that<br />
will allow Australia to develop its national sporting potential<br />
from the community participation level to the provision of<br />
assistance to high performance athletes.<br />
The Australian Sports Commission will be an essential part<br />
of that task.<br />
The Commission will operate as an advisory body to the Government<br />
pending legislation to establish it as a statutory authority.<br />
The first Chairman of the ASC will be Mr Ted Harris, Chief<br />
Executive and 1. naging Director of Ampol, who was Chairman of<br />
the Interim Committee which prepared a number of recommendations<br />
for the Government on the role, structure and functions of<br />
the proposed Commission.<br />
There will be another 20 Commissioners.<br />
The Sports Commission will be run on a day-to-day basis by an<br />
executive staff based in Canberra.<br />
Mr Greg Hartung has been appointed as General Manager of<br />
the ASC, and Mr Perry Crosswhite and Ms Libby Darlison have<br />
been appointed as Assistant General Managers.<br />
Initially, the staff of the Commission will consist of officers<br />
transferred from the Sport and Recreation Division of the<br />
Department of Sport, Recreation and Tourism. </p>
