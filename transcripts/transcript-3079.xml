EMBARGO: 6.3OPM FRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER 1973<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
FOR THE OPENING OF THE FIRST BIENNALE OF SYDNEY, SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE,<br />
FRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER 1973<br />
At last I find myself at an opening ceremony at the<br />
Sydney Opera House where I'm not left out in the cold. I hope<br />
no one will accuse me of stealing the limelight from Sir Robert<br />
Askin. He manages these affairs more lavishly than the Transfield<br />
organisation. After all, he provided a fireworks display and a<br />
Royal tour for his opening ceremony. This ceremony, I hope, will<br />
be just as memorable, for there could be no more fitting place to<br />
stage this exhibition. than here in this building. The proudest<br />
possession of the city in which it stands, It is a measure of<br />
the fame that the Opera House has won for Sydney and for Australia,<br />
of the central place it holds in the hearts and imaginations of<br />
the people of this city, of its relevance to our whole artistic<br />
and cultural life, that it should be the natural location for<br />
the most important exhibition of visual arts ever assembled in<br />
this country. I hope that will not be taken as an overstatement. I can<br />
think of no display of contemporary art in Australia more diverse<br />
in its origins, richer in what it offers, or richer in what it<br />
promises. Here are representative works from 36 leading artists<br />
in 14 nations. There can be no doubt that the Biennale of Sydney,<br />
like those of Venice, Paris, Sao Paulo, Tokyo and Mlexico City,<br />
will take its place among the leading art shows in the world.<br />
It can be said today that the Opera House is no longer a local<br />
institution. We stand now on international ground. We are hosts<br />
to the artists of the world, and this f-rst international exhibition<br />
of art may be seen as the most characteristic and fitting event of<br />
the opening season.<br />
I welcome those who have come as ambassadors to exhibit here<br />
with Australian artists. They are doubly welcome: for the<br />
interest and pleasure they and their works will bring us, and for<br />
showing by their presence that Australia has joined a community<br />
of the highest importance and with the most admirable of aims<br />
the increase of excellence in the practice of the arts, and<br />
their widened appreciation and enjoyment by all communities.<br />
This may not be the occasion to strike too nationalistic<br />
a note, let alone boast about the achievements of my own Government.<br />
Nevertheless, I think there are two points I should stress. One<br />
is that Australia is by no means without distinction in the fields<br />
of international art. Our artists are widely known and admired,<br />
and I recall my pleasure a few weeks ago when I heard of<br />
John Armstrong's important prize at the Biennale in Sao Paulo.<br />
The significance of exhibitions such as this is that the work of our<br />
own artists may be seen with that of equally eminent artists from<br />
overseas. The community of spirit, the humanity common to all<br />
artistic creation, may be felt and shared directly. The result must<br />
be to enrich our own artistic experience and stimulate the energies<br />
and perceptions of artists themselves. ./ 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
My second point concerns the responsibility of the<br />
Governments to the arts. I suppose nobody will contradict<br />
me if I remark that neither Opera houses nor large works of art<br />
come cheaply these days. The Australian Government has tried to<br />
ensure that the funds available will produce the maximum benefit<br />
to the cultural life of the country. Nothing could be more<br />
welcome in achieving this object than to have the active aid<br />
of industry and commerce: not only at the level of this<br />
impressive event, but in smaller yet immensely valuable ways.<br />
Governents, however, have a deep and continuing<br />
responsibility. Elsewhere today I announced two notable<br />
decisions by the Australian Government. I have approved a grant<br />
of $ 20,000 to the Art Gallery ofNew South Wales to help clear its<br />
outstanding debt of $ 75,000 on the purchase of the self-portrait<br />
by Pierre Bonnard. This grant is conditional on the Government<br />
of NSW providing the balance. In addition, I announced grants<br />
to Australian artists totalling $ 258,000, which we have approved<br />
on the recommendation of the Visual Arts Board of the Australian<br />
Council for the Arts. In the same way, my Government, through<br />
the Australian Council for the Arts, Is happy to be a minor<br />
partner in financing this event in collaboration with the<br />
Transfield organisation.<br />
The works here are in every sense contemporary ones.<br />
I noticed in the catalogue a painting by David Aspden called<br />
" Some Other Blues". That struck a chord with me. Indeed to my<br />
untutored eye it bore some fleeting resemblance to our celebrated<br />
acquisition for the National Gallery. I know how distressing it<br />
must have been for many of you to see that purchase greeted in some<br />
quarters with derision and incomprehension. Quite ignorant comments<br />
were made by people who ought to know better. Do notthink for a<br />
moment that I put myself -forward as an authority in these matters.<br />
I merely say this: In " Blue Poles" we acquired an acknowledged<br />
masterpiece, and I am proud that we bought it. Generations of<br />
future Australians will thank Mr. Mollison and the National<br />
Gallery for what they have done. The point is that there remains<br />
an invincible element of philistinism in all societies, including<br />
our own, that exhibitions like this will help to break down.<br />
The fast that none of these works are judged, and that no prizes<br />
are awarded, reflects the fect that in the hih4y experimental<br />
world of modern art comparisons between individual iorks are<br />
diffLcuit. Thoere Piyst a3wbys be a place in art for whal. is<br />
challenging, p√± uvocative, unconventional even baffling.<br />
Indeed it may be said that these have been the essential<br />
qualities of all true art for all time.<br />
This Biennale is a community event. Just as one hopes that<br />
the Opera House itself will draw its audiences from the widest<br />
possible community, I like to think that events such as this will<br />
multiply and involve people of all ages and interests. This will<br />
happen, not because the Government becomes an ever more generous<br />
patron of the arts, but because the example of Mr. Belgiorno-Nettis<br />
and Mr. Salteri will be followed by others inside and outside the<br />
commercial world. I commend their efforts unreservedly. Theyand<br />
the Transf ield organisation are to be congratulated on bringing<br />
this event the first, I hope, of many to the Australian people. </p>
