    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE................................................................................................</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>This is a very important day for the lower Hunter region, particularly</p>
<p> with the announcement that the early warning aircraft under the banner</p>
<p> of No. 2 Squadron, one of the great battle squadrons of the RAAF,</p>
<p> will be located here in Williamtown. That's another $50 million</p>
<p> of infrastructure, another 200 RAAF personnel, another 80 local contractors.</p>
<p> When you add that to the huge investment of several hundred million</p>
<p> dollars represented by the Hawk Lead-in Fighter Project it does represent</p>
<p> a massive injection of jobs, of money and commitment to the lower</p>
<p> Hunter region. And it's an indication of the practical commitment</p>
<p> of the Coalition Government to the future of Newcastle and to the</p>
<p> future of the lower Hunter region. The best way to help the region</p>
<p> is to bring it lasting jobs, to bring it investment, to bring it resources</p>
<p> and we have done that and we've done it very significantly.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Upgrading the base like this, does that put pressure on the airport</p>
<p> here to [inaudible]...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, that's something that belongs to question and answer</p>
<p> at a later time. We're waiting on the outcome of the EIS in relation</p>
<p> to Badgery's Creek and until I get that I'm not going to</p>
<p> answer questions about hypothetical alternatives.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, [inaudible] reference this morning to risk in defence</p>
<p> projects. Was that particular reference to submarines or is there</p>
<p> something else?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't remember using the word risk' in my</p>
<p> entire speech.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>With this being such a significant region so many car plants here,</p>
<p> do you think that the Carr Government should come clean on their policy</p>
<p> about what they plan to do with electricity in this State?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's a fairly old argument but I made a predication a</p>
<p> couple of weeks ago that some time in the life of the re-elected Labor</p>
<p> government in New South Wales it would get around to privatising electricity.</p>
<p> It should because it's a sensible long-term policy but I don't</p>
<p> think it will happen for a few months.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>When do you expect it to happen?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I predict it will happen some time in the next four years.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On Kosovo  a Yugoslav foreign ministry official on radio this</p>
<p> morning was saying it might help Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace if</p>
<p> Australia began to speak out against a NATO campaign. Is that something</p>
<p> that you'd consider at all?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You've got to remember who they are. You've got to remember</p>
<p> what they were doing in Kosovo. They weren't soldiers. They were</p>
<p> humanitarian workers. They were looking after people irrespective</p>
<p> of their race. They weren't engaged in racial persecution. They</p>
<p> were engaged in humanitarian work. And their entitlement to release</p>
<p> and their right to proper treatment derives from who they are and</p>
<p> what they were doing, not on the basis of a political posture taken</p>
<p> by the government of their home country. The obligation that the Yugoslav</p>
<p> Government has to treat these men well and to let them go derives</p>
<p> from that, who they are, what they were doing. They weren't soldiers.</p>
<p> They weren't fighting anybody. They were helping people. And</p>
<p> in those circumstances it is quite outrageous that conditions be imposed,</p>
<p> political conditions, be imposed on their release.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How would you describe the Yugoslav's official comments this</p>
<p> morning?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think I've answered the question appropriately. It's</p>
<p> important in these circumstances to speak carefully but firmly, to</p>
<p> understand the sensitivities, to respect, as I do, the personal anguish</p>
<p> and trauma of the families associated with the two men, to keep reminding</p>
<p> the Australian public and the Yugoslav Government that they weren't</p>
<p> soldiers. They weren't trying to hurt anybody. They were only</p>
<p> trying to help people. And it seems quite inhumane that people who</p>
<p> are there to do a mercy mission, so to speak, should be treated unfairly.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you have a response to Jeff Kennett's republican preamble?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, my pulse rate remains stable.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And the absence of God' in the preamble, what do you think</p>
<p> on that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>My pulse rate remains stable.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On the GST, you've even Stan Wallis calling for an increase in</p>
<p> the compensation package. Does that influence you at all [inaudible]...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I heard Stan this morning. I thought Stan was on all fore's with</p>
<p> the Government. And he says that it would be crazy and a huge mistake</p>
<p> to take out food. He said that some fine-tuning, that was the expression</p>
<p> he used, I actually recall him using that on numerous occasions.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Would you agree with fine-tuning [inaudible]...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, no that's putting words into my mouth, Rafael. We have always</p>
<p> said that if some fine-tuning were needed we'd be willing to</p>
<p> do it. And along the pathway already there's been a bit of fine-tuning.</p>
<p> The Treasurer's made a number of announcements. But you're</p>
<p> not going to get me, sort of, looking at crystal balls over the next</p>
<p> couple of months. We have a package. It's been endorsed by the</p>
<p> Australian people. And I notice this morning, and Mr Beazley has,</p>
<p> in effect, said that they will try and stop it but if it gets through</p>
<p> they'll then look at what changes they need to make. You can</p>
<p> deconstruct that. And you hear Mr Beazley saying, well, we don't</p>
<p> have the guts to reform the tax system but if somebody else does,</p>
<p> we're happy to get the benefit and we'll just do a bit nipping</p>
<p> and tucking at the edges.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is that any different to their stand through the campaign?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, equally lacking in, what do they call it, something or other.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, the consumer [inaudible] figures yesterday had economists</p>
<p> saying that the surplus could rise to $8 billion and the economic</p>
<p> forecast could also increase...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm not going to start speculating about what the surplus</p>
<p> will be. That will be announced by the Treasurer on budget night.</p>
<p> The economy is doing well. It's doing well because we've</p>
<p> run it well and because the Australian people have responded to our</p>
<p> policies. The economic strength Australia enjoys at the present time</p>
<p> more than anything is due to the commitment of the Australian people,</p>
<p> of Australian employees, of Australian companies, of Australian businessmen</p>
<p> and women. They have responded to the good economic conditions provided</p>
<p> by government policies. But you can have good policies but if your</p>
<p> people don't respond you don't get the benefit. And I believe</p>
<p> the first prize ought to go to the Australian people, to workers,</p>
<p> to businessmen and women alike for the commitment they've made</p>
<p> to the economic growth of Australia over the last three years.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Could we get a comment, perhaps, on Malaysia and Anwar's [inaudible]...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They only comment I would make is that plainly this has been no ordinary</p>
<p> trial. Plainly the world was disturbed that Anwar has been treated</p>
<p> in a particular fashion because of a political dispute. And I say</p>
<p> as Prime Minister of a country that is very friendly towards Malaysia,</p>
<p> the eyes of the world are on Malaysia, the appeal process must be</p>
<p> utterly transparent and it must appear to be utterly transparent.</p>
<p> I don't pretend to put myself in the place of the judicial tribunals</p>
<p> of that country but I do know that this is no ordinary situation and</p>
<p> the people have every reason to be concerned about the lurch towards</p>
<p> authoritarianism in that country. I am concerned about Malaysia because</p>
<p> it's a close ally. It's part of the Asian-Pacific region.</p>
<p> We have very good links with Malaysia. We've educated tens of</p>
<p> thousands of citizens of Malaysia and we want to continue that association.</p>
<p> Anwar is the number two political figure in that country. I just hope</p>
<p> that the trial is conducted in an utterly transparent fashion.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think that trial will be utterly transparent?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I haven't been there and it's very difficult for me</p>
<p> to sit in judgement and I wouldn't normally comment on the outcome</p>
<p> of a trial of a person in another the country. The fact that I and</p>
<p> the fact that you're asking me these questions indicates that</p>
<p> it's been no ordinary situation and it would be unrealistic for</p>
<p> me to determine that it were an ordinary situation and to hide behind</p>
<p> this sort of no comment' wall. I just say that it's</p>
<p> in Malaysia's interests for the world to be completely satisfied</p>
<p> that the appeal is transparent and importantly that it appears transparent.</p>
<p> Now, I can't and won't say any more than that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What about the ASEAN, most of the ASEAN nations accept that the Philippines</p>
<p> have had a no comment approach. Would the region be better off that</p>
<p> they said....?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't pitch my comments, as you know, in relation to</p>
<p> Malaysia or my attitudes according to what other countries do.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Would it be better for the region if they said something?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the region can do what it wants to do. Australia will, as always,</p>
<p> condition its responses according to Australia's interests and</p>
<p> the principles that we see involved. We are an open, democratic society.</p>
<p> We value the rule of law and the transparency that is involved in</p>
<p> the operation of the rule of law and that's a very important</p>
<p> consideration for Australia. Thank you.</p>
