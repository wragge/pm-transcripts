It. is worth reflecting on how we have arrived at the position which<br />
Makes these changeos imprative. over the'past five decadtus thle<br />
worl. d, iriCludin( J. Auat: ali. 1, has come to depend on anl evoze kgreater<br />
use of eneir'qy and a dramaticallV increasing use of oil. oil was<br />
Seen to have many advantages over itfs alternzAtivoe; it war, checap,<br />
abundant, easy to tranrport and to store. TIherefore, while in the<br />

xpandcd five-fold, oil usage increased. more than 17 fold. in 1925<br />
coal accounted for 8 of the world's conufercial energy consumption,<br />
hit by 1915 this figure had dizoppod to 30 and the share of oil<br />
had risen to<br />
Tha, si~ ngle most important reison foir the T. Alvid increaso ill oil<br />

Many uountries were affected. But in Australia, as in many<br />
overseas countrics, the response of the Government of the day was,<br />
in itself, a transparent crisis of manaqenient and policy. There<br />
was some d( isbelief i even a disposition to act as though the<br />
dsa's of choap o. il could be resurrected. H-owever, events in Iran<br />
in 1979, and a second dramatic rise in oil. prices for the decade,<br />
have once again highlighted the nccd for the world to come to<br />
gjrips with the energy reality.<br />
The signs are now clear that: enorgy consujcrs ar'c dotermined to<br />
reduoe their demand for oil to a vgigf leant degree. This<br />
dotorndnation was highlighted An a communlcjua following the Venlnc<br />
Nconomio Summit in June this year. Sunmit countries exprorscd<br />
their Intention to reduce the role of oil in meeting their renergy<br />
dlemands from 53% to 40t by 1990 (-net to greatly increase the use of<br />
cal and ur-anium1 O. P. E. C. coontricei havc of course bcon calling<br />
for rvducod oil demand by the industrial ised countries for 801110 time<br />
The reduction in dem~ and, the breaking of the link between oil use<br />
0 and growth in GDP and the development of new energy resources, will<br />
all play mnajor-roles In the transition away from oil depondonce<br />
over the nvxt 20 years. Australia recognises and appreciiitcs its<br />
resonsibility An thAs area in our present age of increasing world<br />
energy shortage.<br />
our rich resource endowment carries with it ain international<br />
responsibility to make our resources available on fair terms and<br />
conditions to countriefi who arc less well endowed than ourselves.<br />
Doveloped and de-velopingc countric$ allike are vitally dcpcndont on)<br />
stable and scure supplies of cenergy rzeourccs, In tuirn, Austx-a. 1. a<br />
expocts consiumingcj ountric~ n to prov~ de stable accoss to thoir<br />
markets for our resowrces by way of long-tcrmi contracts whether<br />
in processed or unprocssd form. This is absolutely essential if<br />
companies are to commijt the huge amiounts of risk capital which are<br />
necessary to bring Aur. talla's resource projects on stream in<br />
the 1980n.<br />
Undoniably, Austra3Aa's energy resources will become an increasingly<br />
important source of energy to the rest of the world, Our greatest<br />
is coal; compriing over 80% of our total, identified, economically<br />
recoverable energy rcrourcs. It currently provides 70% to 80% of<br />
our electricity and, In addItion, is a major and rising export<br />
commioity, Since 1960, annual exports of coal have risen from<br />
1.9 million tonncei to over 41 million tonnes in 1979. And these<br />
exports are ex4pected to . incroase significantly.<br />
For example, the X. JB. A. recently joredicted that Australia's steaming<br />
coal exports could bu. expected t~ o rcach 35 to 40 million tonnes<br />
annuall. y by 3990, r compared with about 6 million tonnes at present,<br />
Australia Is well placed to meet this increasing demanei.<br />
The changing international cnergy position has brougqht new<br />
significance to the North-West Shelf energy project, involving<br />
capital expenditure of $ 4 billion to * 5 billion. It will produce<br />
natural gau, liquefied natural gas, liqluefied petrolexua gas ande<br />
condensate, Plan. b for the project arc firming up and they providefor<br />
the joint ventureors to coimmence exports of LNG by 18. ' I I t Ii ii~ 64 H Ij 11 Jr </p>
<p>It is enivisacd that 6 million tonnca of LNG a year will b) e<br />
exported for up t~ o 20 yvars fxoni that time, The Governnment la,% t<br />
year grainted Jong toxin vciport pcormits for the export of liMO and,<br />
subject to the re~ quiremnts of the dciestio mana' ct I LPO. The. a e<br />

uppr un ie in Australia. II<br />
Tho magnitude of these possibilities is evidenced by the f act that<br />
borrowiiig of nearly $ 3 billion have t-43ready boo~ n provided under<br />
our infrastrticture programme for electricity cnor A. iflJ pro-jeets<br />

$ 7 hillion, In addition, fuirther electricity gocraitingc projects arc%<br />
Under vxamination. An~ d they involve borrowings of over $ 4 billion<br />
and total outlays of over ' J billion.<br />
These figures convey the magnitudeñ and importance to Australia of<br />
thosv. developrnent. Indeee, between 1950 and .1960, in! tallL'd<br />

Plains, installed generating capaoity is expected to rise by 2. i, 000<br />

And as the cost of oil cont. 111ues to rise, it becomor, Ancreasingly<br />
attractive to process raw material. s In Australia, using our low<br />
cost electricity, in preferenIce to transport~ ing them to other<br />
countries where cnergy costs are higjher or where there is nl<br />
doubt about the availability of the required energy.<br />
Our ernerqy advantage, togother with the plentiful. supplies of raw<br />
materials, has incroeasid the opportunities for the c(: onomio<br />

Of thc 1980s, We recogjnise, as a Government, that r ooUrco and<br />
emfergy related development8 have an immense pote~ ntial1 for<br />
genorating coonomic gjrowth in this country, and raiving tho standard<br />
of l~ iving for all AUSnirallians. We recognise also that th. is<br />
potontial Qan only be re~ alied In anl econoirdic environment An wWfioll<br />
the inat; vdvc investment that will be 3-eg~ uired can proceud with<br />
c01) 1 idence.<br />
The central issue in achieving this conliidonce Is. the knowledge<br />
that responsible economic managcment will cont16inue with absolute<br />
priority being given to th6 fIght against inflation. But also of<br />
( jreat importance is the inmplemontation of ecoonomically sound enorgy<br />
policies, in partioular, the pricing of . indigenous crude oil at<br />
Import parity.<br />
' ihe importanca of using the pricing mechanism to control energy usage<br />
was reinforced in the communique of tho Venice Summit inl Jiune<br />
tis year, which vaidl " We must break tho existing link between<br />
economic growth and consumption of oil, and we mean t~ o do so this<br />
decadIe. T'his nitratc-gy requires conservIng o. 0 and substantially<br />
incroasing production and u~ e of alternative energy nourccu.<br />
TrO thiz. end, maximum reliance should be placed onl the price<br />
mechanism and domstio prices for oil sihould take into Account<br />
representative wiorld prices , Such an uncquivocal statement<br />
is confirmation of the stand we have taken on ortide oil p~ ricing.<br />
Prom the outset, we hnve been~ aware that such a polloy would not<br />
be popular. Nobody likes paying more for petrol but we hanve chosen<br />
this course not. just beciruse. it was necessary, but because we<br />
believc~ It to be absolutely right. Full import parity pricing Is<br />
vital if we arc to conserve our scarce suppl ies of liquid fuels,<br />
to encourage exploration for oil, and to assist developMent of<br />
alternative sources of energy,<br />
The case for oil parity pricing is overwhelmfing. It . is vital that<br />
we should price our own supplies of oil at compatitivo world prices<br />
and not allow them to be guzzled at artificially low prics. To<br />
allow this to happen would be an act of wanton self~ shness, ignoring<br />
the needs of our children,. and our respongibility to provide for<br />
thcir security.. i o#/ </p>

Trhis spirit was in evidence at the iniaugxiral r~ egional ieetirag of<br />
the Commonwea3th lleaos of Government, where renewable energy for<br />
ruxal conxmunitien was Adentifled as a major priority. And at the<br />
Second Conunonwelth Heado of Govexiimcnt Regional Plecting which I<br />
recently attended in New Delhi, thc neod for clouc co-operation<br />
in energy matters was retiffirmcd.<br />
In the larger sphere, the United N. ationf~ t Conferonce on nciw anid<br />

Trhough all our effortg may be expected to Improve our ablility<br />

prevent an inevitable decline of crude oil as, our major enorgsource.<br />
The answer lies in the comx., rvation of existing energy<br />
