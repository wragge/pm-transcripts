CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
TO THE CONTRACTING PARTIES OF THE GENERAL AGREEMENT<br />
ON TARIFFS AND TRADES<br />
GENEVA, SWITZERLAND 22 OCTOBER 1987<br />
Director-General<br />
Excellencies Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
want at the outset to express my thanks for the oPono: tunitv<br />
you have given me to speak about issues of immense importancethe<br />
profound problems besetting world trade today. I have<br />
spoken on this subject in many forums, but I am very conscious<br />
of the fact that, as representatives of your countries<br />
professionally responsible for trade negotiations, you<br />
constitute an exceptionally expert body.<br />
I do not today intend to talk to you about matters of technical<br />
detail, important though those are in the negotiating process.<br />
I want to talk to you on a broader scale, as the Prime Minister<br />
of a countzy deeply concerned not just with the precise terms of<br />
trade negotiations but with the whole trend of. what is happening<br />
in international trade and with the direction in which I believe<br />
we should be heading. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
For many of us in western society the decade of our forties can<br />
trigger that troubling period of self-appraisai known as<br />
m-d-life crisis. it can lead to aimlessness and a los-of self<br />
es. teen. 3ut handled with ma&amp; rity it can be a positive<br />
experience: : t can lead to reinvigoration and a renewed sense<br />
of purpose.<br />
Sbelieve that the GATT,' which this year celebrates its<br />
birthday, has entered a period akin to a mid-life crisis. Forty<br />
years is certainly long enough to reduce an institution to<br />
irrelevance if there is no process of introspection, of<br />
reappraisal and, if necessary, of redirection.<br />
it is my belief that nothing short of a fundamental rethink of<br />
domestic policy settings by all economies, and especially by the<br />
largest industrial economies, can remedy the current malaise in<br />
the world trading system.<br />
And I believe too that the rules of world trade must also be<br />
reformed. For without a growth-oriented trading system<br />
associated, I might add, as the founders of GATT recognised,<br />
with an efficient financial system the imbalances will be<br />
corrected only with severe economic cost and, stemming from<br />
that, mounting social and political tension.<br />
The simple fact is that since GATT was formed and even since<br />
the last review of GATT the world has moved on. If we want to<br />
see GATT remain relevant to the world's economic needs, it needs<br />
to move with it. </p>
<p>The challenge confronting all of us as members of GATT is to use<br />
the period of reappraisal afforded by the Uruguay Round to<br />
provide a stable base for free and fair world trade for decades<br />
to come just as the original Contracting Parties did 40 years<br />
ago. That reappraisal must also provide the foundation from<br />
which we can maximise equitable low-inflation world growth.<br />
The need is great. Time is short. The costs of failure are<br />
high. I am by nature an optimist but I must say that present<br />
indications suggest that there is a long way to go before this<br />
urgency is properly reflected in the actions of some of the<br />
largest trading nations.<br />
Today then, as the leader of a nation thoroughly committed to<br />
the cause of liberalising world trade, I want to impress upon<br />
you the necessity to take up this cause as a matter of highest<br />
priority. And so that the theoretical validity of my argument is backed by<br />
an immediately applicable course of action, I want to announce<br />
new proposals which I believe show the way forward.<br />
These new measures are of two kinds: they further demonstrate<br />
the commitment of my Government to make what changes are needed<br />
to further liberalise trade with Australia, and they demonstrate<br />
the commitment of a number of countries, brought together in the<br />
Cairns Group, to work towards change at the international level. </p>
<p>Resolution of the difficulties facing the world trading system<br />
is not, and must not be allowed to be, a matter exclusively for<br />
the major trading nations. Smaller trading countries have a<br />
vital interest in the outcome and have a legitimate right to be<br />
represented forcefully at the negotiating table.<br />
As you know the rationale for the GATT was set out in the 1941<br />
Atlantic Charter. The intention was to ensure that, after the<br />
War, all countries ' great or small, victor or vanquished" would<br />
enjoy " access on equal terms to the trade and to the raw<br />
materials of the world."<br />
The Contracting Parties to the GATT, who came together some si. x<br />
years later after protracted but inconclusive negotiations to<br />
establish a more permanent regime of management, had fresh in<br />
their minds the exoerience of the 1920' s and 1930' s.<br />
These were years in which the younger manufacturing nations were<br />
inhibited in trade by bilateral arrangements among the<br />
traditional European traders, and by other barrriers to trade,<br />
investment and technology. World growth suffered. So, too, did<br />
world harmony. The tensions created by these " beggar thy<br />
neighbour" policies came to a head in the global conflict of<br />
World War 2, with its incalculable cost in economic destruction<br />
and human misery and suffering. </p>
<p>Forty years ago the parties to GATT appreciated the importance<br />
of having a framework of rules that provide fairness,<br />
non-discrimination and openness in the complex trading<br />
environment needed to promote post-war recovery.<br />
Although efforts have been made to update and refurbish it, the<br />
fact is that the world now demands more of the GATT framework<br />
than it has hitherto delivered.<br />
We have just passed the first anniversary of the Uruguay<br />
Declaration and are approaching the end of the initial phase of<br />
the negotiations to update GATT to meet today's needs.<br />
The Uruguay Round deals with a very broad range of subjects.<br />
Nobody will be more familiar than this group with the fact that<br />
Australia's paramount concern in this new round of multilateral<br />
trade negotiations is agriculture.<br />
But I do not wish to talk about agriculture exclusively, because<br />
my country, like many of yours, has other major interests. We<br />
are deliberately re-structuring our economy to diversify and<br />
strengthen the base upon which Australia can engage<br />
competitively in international trade. We are already an<br />
exporter not just of primary commodities but of services and<br />
manufactures. </p>
<p>we aspire to still greater success in these areas and it is<br />
therefore very much in our interest that the negotiations<br />
succeed in opening up markets and freeing up trade in the<br />
services and manufactures fields.<br />
Let me discuss these other issues first, before returning to the<br />
question of agriculture.<br />
1I1 is clear that without the development of global markets fox<br />
services such as telecommunications and data services, without<br />
the rapid growth of international financial and insurance<br />
services, without rapid and flexible global transport, the total<br />
world market for goods would be very much smaller, and we would<br />
all be the poorer.<br />
However the services sector is bound, world-wide, in a network<br />
of regulations and restrictions which closely control the entry<br />
into, and investment in, the services sector, and even in some<br />
cases the physical delivery of services. Moreover, major<br />
exporters have demonstrated willingness to protect their service<br />
markets by bilateral agreements which by their nature are<br />
discriminatory. Clearly, it is in the interests of all nations,<br />
developed and developing alike, to ensure that the most<br />
efficient and cheapest services are available to all.<br />
The historic declaration at Punta del Este recognised this when<br />
it called, for the first time, for services to be brought withi. n<br />
the multilateral framework. </p>
<p>None of us can afford to let this opportunity pass.<br />
The clear objective of the Round must be to develop a<br />
non-discriminatory, multilateral framework for services which<br />
provides: steady liberalisation and expansion of access to markets;<br />
effective transparency of national regulations on services;<br />
and workable procedures for the settlement of disputes.<br />
To turn to trade in manufactured goods, we see a similar need<br />
for reform.<br />
Since the end of the Tokyo Round, the US and the European<br />
Communities have undone much of the good which flowed from the<br />
continuing reduction of tariff barriers by their proliferation<br />
of non-tariff barriers.<br />
I </p>
<p>UNCTAD and the World Bank estimate that about a sixth of<br />
industriai country impoLts from other industrial countries and<br />
more than a fifth of their imports from developing countries a-e<br />
now controlled by non-tariff barriers such as prohibitions,<br />
quotas, " voluntary" restraints by exporters and discretionary<br />
imoort licensing.<br />
Overall, the use of such measures represents an increase of<br />
almost 25 per cent on barriers to industrial country imports<br />
since the end of the Tokyo Round.<br />
Accordingly, progress in the market access negotiations is<br />
essential to halt and reverse the slide towards increased<br />
protectionism which we have witnessed in recent years. These<br />
negotiations address directly the liberalisation of trade<br />
barriers of both the traditional and so-called<br />
" new-protectionist" variety.<br />
Unfortunately, the largest economies have not so far presented<br />
proposals which provide a basis for tackling these matters<br />
comprehensively, in conjunction with measures to reduce tariffs<br />
on a broad front.<br />
Australia is seeking real progress in reducing the high levels<br />
of industry assistance that reduce the size of the internanional<br />
market and cut the gains from trade. </p>
<p>Let me turn, then, to what Aus-zalia is prenared to do in this<br />
resoeCt. In January this year I announced that Australia was p~ epared to<br />
participate in these GATT negotiations in a way that it had<br />
never agreed to do before. We said we are : eady to negotiate<br />
bindings on tariffs in all sectors of the tariff. on that issue<br />
our good faith has been pledged already.<br />
Today I announce that we are prepared to go even further.<br />
The tariff is the most significant form of support for<br />
Australian industry.<br />
We are prepared to negotiate a broad package of measures to<br />
reduce overall levels of effective assistance to Australian<br />
industry including tariffs as part of a broad-based<br />
multilateral approach.<br />
In this context, we are prepared to eliminate, over an<br />
appropriate implementation phase, all quantitative import<br />
measures designed to protect domestic industry. This means we<br />
would phase-out all our quantitative restrictions, including<br />
tariff quotas, licensing and embargoes.<br />
This is a radical approach -but it is the kind of radical<br />
approach necessary to provide the world with its best chance to<br />
capture fully the potential gains from trade. </p>
<p>it i. s an offer made in good faith, seeking to persuade our<br />
trading partners and multilateral forums such as this to see<br />
that we are %, illing to practice what we preach.<br />
We will be looking to our trading partners, who employ a panoply<br />
of assistance measures, to reciprocate this offer by making a<br />
similar reduction in effective rates of industry assistance.<br />
And let me be clea! r: I am seeking from them cuts not only in<br />
tariffs but also in various non-tariff measures and subsidies.<br />
Let me turn last but not least to agriculture one area in<br />
which we have seen signs of an historic willingness on the part<br />
of GAT" T members to make progress towards reform. That I<br />
certainly welcome. But we are still far from agreeing to, yet<br />
alone implementing, effective solutions.<br />
in January I had the honor of delivering the keynote address at,<br />
the World Economic Forum at Davos, and I used that address to<br />
draw attention to the crisis confronting worlAd trade in<br />
agriculture. my argument was that countries which endeavour to achieve<br />
domestic goals by distorting world trade are not only hurting<br />
others, they are hurting and deluding themselves.<br />
Reform of agricultural trade would produce gains far beyond the<br />
agricultural sectors of our industrial economies. </p>
<p>FO: example, in the industrialised world, reforn would reduce<br />
struc-tural inefficiencies which have, for example, added one<br />
million people to the queues of unemployed in the Eutopean<br />
Community predominantly in manufacturing.<br />
Developing countries with onerous debt burdens would gain from<br />
agricultural trade reform because they could comfortably trade<br />
out of their problems if they could get a fair return for their<br />
agricultural produce.<br />
If world prices for many agricultural goods were allowed to rise<br />
to undistorted levels, the agricultural sectors of many<br />
developing countries could become engines of growth.<br />
At Davos I welcomed the commitment of the GATT members at Punta<br />
del Este to negotiate on agriculture in the Uruguay Round. It<br />
presents an opportunity for reform which we literally all of<br />
us cannot afford to refuse.<br />
in the apprroach which I proposed for resolving the crisis in<br />
agricultural trade I called for an immediate ceasefire in the<br />
subsidies war. 1 said sound principles must be developed to<br />
govern world agricultural trade, recognising the realistic need<br />
for transitional support in some cases while reform proceeds.<br />
Given all this, I was pleased to see that the OECD Ministerial<br />
Council and the Venice Summit strengthened the resolve of<br />
industrialized countries to reform agricultural trade. </p>
<p>-12-<br />
Within the Uruguay Round itself, the United States proposed a<br />
bold and imaginative plan for the elimination of distortions in<br />
the agricultural markets in which both the US and its trading<br />
partners participate.<br />
We in Australia recognise that the thrust of the US proposal is<br />
towards truly liberalised trade in agriculture and we welcome<br />
that.<br />
But much as I applaud this general position, I am bound to say<br />
and it will come as no surprise to my friends in the United<br />
States that I do so we have reservations about its lack of<br />
completeness.<br />
Along with our colleagues in the Cairns Group, we believe that<br />
the American proposals fall short of providing the necessary<br />
basis for reform. Two deficiencies deserve particular mention.<br />
First, there is no acknowledgement of the need to provide early<br />
relief from the distorting effects of the existing arrangements,<br />
evidenced by undertakings to begin soon the task of reducing<br />
subsidies. Second, it does not adequately recognise that greatest<br />
responsibility for reform rests with those whose policies are<br />
causing greatest damage to world markets. </p>
<p>Now in case it seems that 1 am singling out the United States<br />
let me s:: aight away correct that impression.<br />
The European Community has yet to table its formal proposal<br />
but the indications to date are that it is prepared to make the<br />
historic decision to negotiate. But I must add that, as we<br />
understand them, the measures in contemplation do not go far<br />
enough. To be credible, the Community's approach must make an<br />
explicit commitment to libeLalisation. Fat-sighted, creative<br />
proposals are needed soon.<br />
Further, theze are also countries tempted to argue that since<br />
they are nc: significant exporters they have a lesser<br />
responsibility. But they should remember that their highly<br />
restrictive import regimes contribute just as much as heavily<br />
subsidised exports to the problems of world markets.<br />
The fact is that efficient agricultural exporters including<br />
Australia are fed up with being caught in a crossfire of<br />
competitive subsidisation by the US and the European Community.<br />
We are also fed up with being denied access to legitimate<br />
markets. It was to exc: ess this frustration that Australia, along with<br />
other agricultural producers who are increasingly anxious about<br />
the growing tide of protectionism, joined together to form a<br />
third force in trade negotiations the Cairns Group. </p>
<p>I-<br />
k<br />
These coun: tries represent some 550 million people, account fo:<br />
orie-auar: ter of the total amount of aaicultural exports, and<br />
have suffered enormous damaae because of agricultural<br />
protection. It is my pleasure today to present, on behalf of the Cairns<br />
Group, our proposals which we believe not only meet our<br />
interests but also provide a framework for reform which will<br />
ultimately benefit all parties.<br />
The proposal is comprehensive and it is far-reaching. It will<br />
be formally tabled by the Cairns Group at the Agriculture<br />
Negotiating Group meeting next week.<br />
It contains three elements.<br />
First, the overall objective of the proposal is to establish a<br />
lono'term framework within which agricultural production and<br />
trade can take place with minimum distortion and disruption. We<br />
rnust go as far as possible towards eliminating all agricultural<br />
subsidies and access barriers. This long term framework would<br />
be supported by new or amended GATT rules.<br />
Second, recognising the truly massive scale of structural<br />
distortions which we all must tackle, the Group proposes a<br />
teform'program, whereby countries would negotiate commitments to<br />
reduce trade distorting policies using defined rules. </p>
<p>n. nlike othe: pooosals, this pio zam assigns priority to phasing<br />
out those measures which most disrupt trade. 7he European<br />
Community, the United States and Japan obviowsly bear a<br />
particular responsibility here.<br />
Two other features of the program deserve mention.<br />
The program calls for international co-operation to minimise the<br />
impact on trade of regulations protecting human, animal or plant<br />
health. These regulations should not be used as unwarranted<br />
barriers to trade.<br />
It also proposes a surveillance mechanism to avoid any<br />
circumvention of remedial action, to ensure that remaining or<br />
new measures do not impede the reform process and to ensure<br />
compliance with undertakings.<br />
The third major element of the Cairns Group proposal reflects<br />
our recognition that such a reform process is gradual and must<br />
be bolstered by specific earlv'relief-measares.<br />
Cairns Group members take no comfort from the assurances of the<br />
major economies that their subsidies are not aimed at us. ' What<br />
matters is that they are hitting us. Indeed our casualties are<br />
greater than those of the protagonists.<br />
Efficient producers are being forced out of the market, to the<br />
long term detriment of all consumers. </p>
<p>-16-<br />
Therefore the proposal calls for early relief in the form of:<br />
a freeze on access barriers, on production and export<br />
subsidies, and on unjustified health regulations;<br />
a political commitment to the responsible management<br />
and non disruptive release of stocks: and<br />
a concerted multilateral cutback on all export and<br />
production subsidies, coupled with a commitment to<br />
increase access opportunities.<br />
The proposal recognises the reality of uneven stages of<br />
development in various countries and their industries.<br />
It provides for the principle of differential and more<br />
favourable treatment for developing countries to apply to the<br />
agricultural reform process. This is consistent with the GATT<br />
itself and the Punta del Este Declaration.<br />
Realism demands that certain exceptions will have to be allowed<br />
if the will for reform is to be translated into action.<br />
Therefore the proposal allows scope for a strictly defined list<br />
of support measures to continue if they have a negligible effect<br />
on output and trade. </p>
<p>-17-<br />
The Cairns Group believes that its proposal provides a firm<br />
basis on which to proceed into the substantive negotiating<br />
phase. We will be aiming to achieve agreement on the parameters for the<br />
reform program by the end of next year, or sooner if possible,<br />
so that the early relief measures can be implemented immediately<br />
thereafter.<br />
We will be aiming to agree on the details of the reform program<br />
and implement them from the end of 1990 at the very latest, with<br />
a maximum phase-in period of 10 years.<br />
I recognise that this timetable is ambitious. 3ut the trade<br />
crisis calls for urgent measures. Such measures should indeed be<br />
achievable given the sincerity of the commitments made by the<br />
leaders of industrialised countries to urgent agricultural<br />
reform.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
Last week in Vancouver the Commonwealth Heads of Government<br />
M~ eeting issued a declaration on world trade.<br />
In that declaration the Commonwealth representing some<br />
nations and one quarter of the world's population expressed<br />
its opposition to continued protectionism and correspondingly,<br />
our strong support for trade liberalisation. </p>
<p>-18-<br />
It supported a strong, credible and working GATT and welcomed<br />
the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. It agreed<br />
on the crucial need for reform of trade-distorting agricultural<br />
policies. And, most signficantly, it expressed hope for an<br />
" early harvest" from the negotiations on agriculture and other<br />
key subjects.<br />
The Vancouver Decla: ation is only the latest demonstration of<br />
the growing world-wide momentum towards the achievement of trade<br />
liberalisation. Forty years after the establishment of GATT, the international<br />
trading system is ccrrupted and ailing. The members of GATT<br />
have a fundamental choice to make.<br />
We can do nothing, decide that it is all too hard, and plunge<br />
the world into escalating protectionism and the heightened<br />
global political tensions that would inevitably follow.<br />
Or we can decide to add to the momentum of reform, moving<br />
forward, cooperatively dismantling the barriers to trade,<br />
improving the economic well being of all nations and making an<br />
invaluable contribution to the prospects of world peace.<br />
I have often remarked on this paradox: the remarkable capacities<br />
of the human mind in the realm of scientific and technological<br />
engineering have almost continuously dazzled us in the post war<br />
era. Telecom ' 87 which I visited this morning reminds us </p>
<p>-19-<br />
vividly of this seemingly endless capacity. But there has been<br />
no symmetry with that genius in our demonstrated capacity in<br />
social engineering.<br />
This is, of course, not so much a failure or dysfunction of the<br />
mind but a failure of political will.<br />
If we are not prepared now to grasp the challenge and the<br />
opportunity before us, history will harshly and properly judge<br />
us as the incompetent imitators of that tragic pattern. For us<br />
the prospect of such a judgement should be incentive enough.<br />
For me, even more damning would be that we were not sensible<br />
enough to perceive and pursue what enlightened self interest<br />
makes so glaringly obvious. </p>
<p>CAIRNS GROUP PROPOSAL ON AGRICULTURE<br />
1. Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia,<br />
Hungary, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines,<br />
Thailand and Uruguay submit the following proposal to achieve<br />
the objectives relating to agriculture in the Punta del Este<br />
Declaration. The proposal envisages participants agreeing to a<br />
short " reform programme" to take 10 years or less at the<br />
conclusion of which a long-term framework to govern world<br />
agriculture would apply fully.<br />
Introduction 2. The fundamental aim of the proposal is to provide the<br />
means to achieve fully liberalised trade in agriculture, to<br />
eliminate distortive agricultural policies and to bind the<br />
necessary undertakings under strengthened GATT rules and<br />
disciplines, taking into account the general principles<br />
governing the negotiations.<br />
3. World agricultural markets are currently characterised<br />
by barriers to access, widespread government price and income<br />
support programmes, massive overproduction and stagnant demand<br />
in some parts of the world and unfulfilled demand in others.<br />
4. Accordingly, there is a need for early action to give<br />
relief and a reform programme that will take us progressively<br />
from these massively distorted agricultural markets to a point<br />
where all subsidies and other government support measures<br />
having an effect on agricultural trade are no longer permitted<br />
and domestic markets are open to effective competition from<br />
imports. At the same time, no reform programme will be capable<br />
of effecting secure liberalisation of agricultural trade unless<br />
it is devised in light of, and becomes firmly entrenched in, an<br />
effective new framework of strengthened and more operationally<br />
effective GATT rules and disciplines.<br />
6. In light of this, the proposal involves three<br />
inter-related phases: the full application of the long-term framework<br />
of revised and strengthened rules and disciplines for<br />
agriculture; the systematic reduction of aggregate support by<br />
the removal of distorting policy measures, supported by interim<br />
rules which will govern during the reform period; and<br />
the achievement of immediate steps for early<br />
relief from the severe distortions affecting agricultural trade. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Differential and More Favourable Treatment for Developing<br />
Countries 7. The principle of differential and more favourable<br />
treatment for developing countries as embodied in the GATT and<br />
related instruments as well as in the Punta del Este<br />
Declaration applies to all elements of this proposal, including<br />
early relief measures: for example<br />
longer timeframes for the implementation of<br />
the measures prescribed in this proposal;<br />
certain support measures in relation to<br />
domestic economic programmes to promote<br />
economic and social development, which are<br />
not explicitly linked to export purposes.<br />
I THE LONG-TERM FRAMEWORK<br />
8. The implementation of a long-term framework is<br />
necessary to achieve the objectives of full liberalisation in,<br />
and elimination of existing exceptions for, agriculture. This<br />
framework will both underpin and drive the adjustment process<br />
during the reform phase and will come into effect at its<br />
conclusion.<br />
9. It is also recognised that the successful conclusion<br />
of negotiations in other related groups will be crucial to the<br />
effective operation of an open and fair agricultural trading<br />
system. Market Access<br />
GATT rules and disciplines should be agreed to remove<br />
restrictions to the free flow of trade in agricultural<br />
products. This would include:<br />
a prohibition on the introduction or<br />
continued use of all measures not explicitly<br />
provided for in the GATT, including<br />
non-tariff barriers and other measures such<br />
as variable levies and minimum import prices.<br />
the elimination when the long-term framework<br />
comes into force of all provisions for<br />
exceptional treatment whether maintained<br />
under waivers, protocols of accession, or<br />
other derogations and exceptions;<br />
a binding of all tariffs on agricultural<br />
products at low levels or zero. </p>
<p>3.<br />
Agricultural Subsidies<br />
11. GATT rules and disciplines should be agreed upon to<br />
prohibit the use of all subsidies and other government support<br />
measures, including consumer transfers, having an effect on<br />
agricultural trade.<br />
12. In the long-term framework, measures deemed to be<br />
exceptions to the general prohibition would be strictly defined<br />
in relation to the following categories:<br />
structural adjustment measures which do not<br />
impact negatively on trade;<br />
measures to assist domestic consumption of<br />
food which do not impede trade or<br />
discriminate against imports;<br />
non-commodity specific aid for<br />
infrastructure development covering<br />
research, extension, education, market<br />
information, inspection, grading, pest and<br />
disease control;<br />
measures for specific disaster relief; and<br />
measures for humanitarian purposes which<br />
respect obligations equivalent to those<br />
applying to surplus disposal transactions;<br />
direct income support which is decoupled<br />
from production and marketing.<br />
Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures<br />
13. A long-term framework for sanitary and phytosanitary<br />
measures will be established which reflects only strict<br />
justification to protect human, animal or plant life or<br />
health. The aim shall be to harmonise sanitary and<br />
phytosanitary regulations to remove barriers to international<br />
trade: and where full harmonisation is not technically<br />
feasible adverse trade effects of differing regulations will be<br />
minimised to the maximum extent.<br />
Consultation, Surveillance, Dispute Settlement<br />
14. With the application of the long-term framework, trade<br />
in agricultural products will be integrated fully into the<br />
generally applicable provisions and mechanisms for<br />
consultation, surveillance and dispute settlement within the<br />
GATT system, as strengthened through negotiations in the<br />
Uruguay Round. I </p>
<p>4.<br />
II REFORM PROGRAMME<br />
An effective reform programme must be both shaped by<br />
and capable of creating the conditions for application of, the<br />
long-term framework. The key to this is a programme that rolls<br />
back the levels of aggregate support.<br />
The reform programme would have the following elements:<br />
Phase Down of Aggregate Support<br />
16. As overall government support levels are the root<br />
cause of trade distortions, commitments would be undertaken by<br />
countries to reduce and eliminate trade distorting policies in<br />
the form of country schedules of reductions, implemented on a<br />
non-discriminatory unconditional MFN basis.<br />
17. Countries would determine the most effective mechanism<br />
for translating the overall objective of the negotiations into<br />
clear, specific and easily monitored commitments in their<br />
schedules. 18. However, the development of countries' schedules of<br />
reduction would be subject to defined terms and conditions.<br />
Most importantly, it would be necessary to make those<br />
systematic and coordinated adjustments required to ensure<br />
conformity with the long-term framework that will apply at the<br />
end of the reform period. The terms and conditions would<br />
include the following: countries would have to reach targets of<br />
reduced levels of overall support;<br />
those support and policy measures which<br />
contribute most heavily to trade distortions<br />
would need to be targetted for priority<br />
attention. This would require countries to<br />
ensure their schedules manifestly contribute<br />
to early and significant reform of the most<br />
trade distorting measures;<br />
the range of agricultural products to be<br />
covered would be as comprehensive as<br />
possible, as would be the range of trade<br />
distorting policies.<br />
19. This reform programme would be facilitated by<br />
establishment of a measure of aggregate support capable of<br />
capturing the diverse policies that have distorted<br />
international agricultural production, consumption and trade.<br />
A PSE-type measure should be developed in the GATT context to<br />
provide this function. Such an aggregate country PSE-type<br />
measure could play an appropriate role in specifying the </p>
<p>measured point of departure for, and monitoring progress<br />
towards, the targets for reduced levels of overall support.<br />
However to ensure that support for every commodity is reduced,<br />
commodity-specific PSE-type measures would be used in<br />
conjunction with the aggregate measures.<br />
Priorities for Phase Down<br />
As indicated above, the precise pattern of phase down<br />
may vary from country to country, but would include priority<br />
treatment for the: phase out of direct export subsidies and<br />
other subsidies which operate directly or<br />
indirectly to increase exports or reduce<br />
imports and cause or threaten serious<br />
prejudice; systematic enlargement of import access<br />
opportunity involving tariff reductions,<br />
phase out of non-tariff measures or<br />
enlargement of minimum access arrangements<br />
as applicable.<br />
Exceptions<br />
21. The only exceptions to be considered to the coverage<br />
of the programme of reductions of overall support levels would<br />
be certain measures with humanitarian objectives, including<br />
consumption subsidies, or for the promotion of structural<br />
adjustment. These measures would be permissible only if their<br />
effects on output and trade are negligible. They would be<br />
excepted under certain prescribed and tightly circumscribed<br />
conditions. 22. In this regard precise terms and conditions would be<br />
developed in relation to the following elements:<br />
direct income support which is decoupled<br />
from production and marketing;<br />
adjustment or resource redeployment<br />
assistance which has a negligible impact on<br />
production and trade or which acts to reduce<br />
production/ export levels;<br />
non-commodity specific aid for<br />
infrastructure development covering<br />
research, extension, education, market<br />
information, inspection, grading, pest and<br />
disease control;<br />
specific, natural disaster relief measures.<br />
I I </p>
<p>6.<br />
Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures<br />
23. Negotiation of agreements and undertakings oriented to<br />
fulfil the Long-term framework of objectives, specifically they<br />
have to include among others:<br />
establishing a procedure of notification and<br />
reverse notification to achieve full<br />
transparency concerning the application of<br />
such measures, with provision for review<br />
under the relevant provisions of the General<br />
Agreement, clarified as appropriate;<br />
harmonising sanitary and phytosanitary<br />
regulations and standards among countries<br />
with the aim of removing barriers to<br />
international trade. Even where full<br />
harmonisation is not feasible, countries<br />
would give greater recognition to the<br />
principle of equivalency of treatment;<br />
developing procedures to require any<br />
Contracting Party so requested by another<br />
Contracting Party to set out the precise<br />
terms and timetable of steps required to be<br />
undertaken to achieve conformity with its<br />
sanitary or phytosanitary regulations;<br />
providing that, upon request, technical<br />
assistance from countries with regulations<br />
in place for exporting developing countries<br />
would be given to help them overcome the<br />
substantive and administrative problem<br />
arising from phytosanitary and sanitary<br />
measures.<br />
Consultation, Surveillance, Dispute Settlement and<br />
Transitional Rules<br />
24. Such a programme of systematic reduction in assistance<br />
to agriculture would require effective verification procedures.<br />
Pending full application of the long-term framework,<br />
agreement will also be required on supplementary rules and<br />
arrangements applicable in the transition to secure its<br />
effective operation. These would also provide a basis for any<br />
recourse to dispute settlement procedures.<br />
26. Countries should: provide a binding commitment to implement<br />
agreed schedules including an undertaking<br />
not to resort to any measures to circumvent<br />
I I </p>
<p>7.<br />
this commitment or to offset reductions in<br />
measures undertaken as per schedules by<br />
introducing new measures or expanding the<br />
use of existing ones;<br />
agree to establish a surveillance mechanism<br />
to monitor countries' compliance with agreed<br />
implementation schedules which would include<br />
an obligation to notify all relevant<br />
measures affecting trade in agriculture;<br />
in order to monitor recourse by countries to<br />
exceptions, also subject to surveillance the<br />
total level of support, including excepted<br />
measures, during the reform period;<br />
define strengthened and more operationally<br />
effective rules reinforcing the reform<br />
programme, which will further Limit any<br />
scope for prejuduce to the trade interests<br />
of Contracting Parties, pending application<br />
of the long-term framework.<br />
III EARLY RELIEF MEASURES<br />
27. Given the urgent need to achieve greater<br />
liberalization and reduce distortion in world agricultural<br />
trade, early relief measures would be implemented immediately<br />
there is provisional agreement on the long-term framework or by<br />
the end of 1988, whichever is the sooner.<br />
28. As a first step these measures would be, as an<br />
integral part of negotiations, a precise, immediate commitment<br />
on trade distorting measures distinct from and additional to<br />
the overall standstill and rollback commitments contained in<br />
the Ministerial Declaration instituting the Uruguay Round. In<br />
addition these measures would not be a substitute for the<br />
reform or long-term measures.<br />
Freeze Access: No reduction in existing levels of<br />
access through, for example, the<br />
introduction of new quantitative<br />
restrictions, the reduction in access levels<br />
of existing quantitative restrictions, the<br />
extension of variable levy coverage to new<br />
commodities, the reduction of existing<br />
levy-free or reduced Levy commitments, the<br />
extension of minimum import prices to new<br />
commodities, the application to new<br />
commodities of measures not explicitly<br />
provided for in the GATT. </p>
<p>8.<br />
Subsidies: Freeze all export and production<br />
subsidies affecting directly or indirectly<br />
world agricultural trade.<br />
No introduction of new sanitary or<br />
phytosanitary regulations operating as a<br />
disguised barrier to trade and inconsistent<br />
with the long-term objectives of<br />
negotiations. Stock Disposal: A political commitment to<br />
the responsible management and<br />
non-disruptive release of stocks built up as<br />
a consequence of government support<br />
policies. Consideration to be given to<br />
alternative methods of stock disposal<br />
including increased domestic consumption,<br />
and food aid programmes which would be<br />
managed in strict accord with FAO Principles<br />
of Surplus Disposal. Steps to be taken to<br />
promote enhanced consultative procedures for<br />
stock disposal with other interested<br />
countries.<br />
Cutback: On the basis of the above freeze there would<br />
be a concerted multilateral first step to provide relief from<br />
existing distortions. This would demonstrate political will to<br />
take urgent and positive action to improve agricultural trade.<br />
It would involve: an across the board reduction by X percent<br />
of all export and production subsidies<br />
affecting directly or indirectly world<br />
agricultural trade;<br />
a commitment to increase access opportunity.<br />
It would apply from the end of 1988 until overtaken by the<br />
effects of implementation of the programmed reduction in<br />
agricultural support. Measures implemented will be taken into<br />
account in the programme of reduction. </p>
