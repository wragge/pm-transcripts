    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER CANBERRA</p>
<p>The following is the Prime Minister's Australia Day<br />
message for publication on 26 January 1989:<br />
our Bicentennial year saw a host of activities large and smallacross<br />
our nation, as Australians celebrated our past and present<br />
achievements. It was a time when more people than ever before chose<br />
to show publicly their pride in being Australian.<br />
N4ow is an appropriate time to think about the future what we would<br />
like Australia to be, and what each of us can do to build on our<br />
achievements and take our nation successfully into the twenty.-first<br />
century. our national identity then, as now, will be the sum of<br />
every Australian's contribution because Australia is its people.<br />
we are a young nation. One way or another most of us or our<br />
forbears come from overseas. The process continues, enriching our<br />
country, adding to its vitality and helping establish the linkages a<br />
modern Australia simply must have in an age of internationalism.<br />
The cement which binds us together, whatever our origins, is a<br />
common commitment to Australia and to Australian values a fair go<br />
for all, tolerance, and insistence upon the rights of the<br />
individual. No matter how our social, economic and political.<br />
landscape may change in the future, in ways which none of us can<br />
fully foresee, those values and that commitment will remain the<br />
bedrock of our unity and our vitality.<br />
Citizenship is perhaps the most important symbol of commitment to<br />
our nation. It is for this reason that I have declared this a Year<br />
of Citizenship. I want to raise awareness in the community about<br />
what it means to be an Australian, and to encourage as many people<br />
as possible to make this solemn and public affirmation of their<br />
commitment to our nation. On this Australia Day 1989, all over<br />
Australia, people will be doing so.<br />
Australians have much to celebrate. we have inherited and created a<br />
wonderful country and each of us has responsibilities to see that<br />
it continues to be a peaceful, just and prosperous nation. We can<br />
take pride in being recognised as a people of courage, determination<br />
and achievement people who have always been prepared to ' give it a<br />
go, even in the hardest of times.<br />
one Bicentennial project last year listed the two-hundred people who<br />
had made Australia great. But the fact is that it is the millions<br />
of Australians, part and present,. who in their everyday lives have<br />
contributed to this country who have made this, in many ways, the<br />
greatest of nations in which to live.<br />
I hope you will join me in celebrating Australia Day.<br />
