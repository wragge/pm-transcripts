STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
NATIONAL AGENDA FOR WOMEN<br />
" Women Shaping and Sharing the Future'", the New National Agenda for<br />
Women, released today, is the Commonwealth Govcramcnt's blueprint for action<br />
for women to thc end of the dccade. The 162 page document describcs women's<br />
aspirations, as expressed during extcnsivc community consultations, and outlines<br />
the government's strategies to meet those aspirations. The Agcnda identifies<br />
-sixtccn important policy areas, including child care, employment, violence against<br />
women and health and wvell being, and also covcrs groups such as women in rural<br />
and remote areas and women with disabilities.<br />
In my Message to the Women of Australia, included in the document, I state that<br />
Australia is recognised around the world for our achievements in improving<br />
women's lives, and I commit my Government to maintaining and improving this<br />
record. I invite the women of Australia to comment on the document and look<br />
forward to hearing their reactions.<br />
On Wednesday in Sydney I will outline in detail how the Government proposes to<br />
act on the strategies outlined in the New National Agenda for Women.<br />
