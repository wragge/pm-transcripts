    <content><![CDATA[<p>8 OCTOBER 1990</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government today reached agreement with the NSW Government on a reservation system for the South East Forests.</p>
<p>This decision is based on detailed analysis of conservation and resource needs in the South East region.</p>
<p>The system of new reserves to be established in the South East region is based on a NSW proposal modified after consultation between the two Governments. Because the boundaries of the new reserves have been drawn taking account of both conservation and resource considerations, they provide the basis for an integrated land management system for the forests.</p>
<p>The reservation system for the South East Forests will conserve, through National Parks, Nature Reserves and Flora Reserves, about 60% of the three National Estate places involved in recent disputes.</p>
<p>The new reserves will withdraw about 11.5% of the timber resource currently available to the industry. The agreement will ensure that jobs are protected in a viable timber industry in the region. The growth of this industry through restructuring is critical to meeting the nation's requirements for paper and timber products and will assist in the reduction of our $ 1.8 billion timber products deficit. This deficit is now nearly 10% of the nation's total annual trade deficit.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government will continue to cooperate with the NSW Government, the industry, conservation organisations, unions and other relevant advisers to achieve a package of measures including resource supplementation through plantations; industry development through improved resource -utilisation and value-adding; further biological research; and management of the new national parks and reserves.</p>
<p>It is expected that these measures and the reservation system will provide for a more stable long-term strategy for the management of the South East Forests. This strategy will be finalised in consultation with the New South Wales Government by the end of the year.</p>
