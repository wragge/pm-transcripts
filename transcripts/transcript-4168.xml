VICTORIAN MANUFACTURERS' EXPORT COUNCIL 2<br />
Annual Dinner Melbourne 22nd June 1976<br />
by the Acting Prime Minister the Rt Hon. Anthony<br />
I would expect that$ as exporters, one of the things most<br />
in your minds is the Government's decision to reduce, and in<br />
some cases defer, benefits to exporters under the Export<br />
Market Development Grants Scheme.<br />
This is a decision none of us likes.<br />
Bu t it is a decision which was part of the Government's<br />
firm approach to economic management.<br />
The Government's basic and imperative objectives are to<br />
bring down the rate of inflation and to restore economic<br />
stability to this country.<br />
Inflation lies at the very heart of our economic<br />
difficulties. I suggest it lies at the heart of your difficulties as<br />
manufacturers and exporters.<br />
And a major contributor to our damaging inflation rate<br />
has been excessive Government spending in recent years.<br />
We inherited a massive and intensely inflationary<br />
budget deficit.<br />
If inflation is to be reduced.-and it must be<br />
then that deficit must be reduced.<br />
The major acceptable way of reducing the deficit is by<br />
reducing the rate of growth in Government spending and if,<br />
this is to be done, then all sectors must share in the cuts<br />
to be made.<br />
As I've spoken to people around Australia recently, they<br />
all tell me they understand our problem, and support what<br />
we are doing but they all feel that their particular area<br />
of interest should get special consideration. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, I think the community now accepts the<br />
fact that a Government that tries to spend its way out of<br />
economic problems only drags the country deeper into trouble.<br />
Our experience of the last two years should have shown<br />
us that. I hope you will accept my statement that our action on<br />
export incentives in no way diminishes the importance<br />
the Government attaches to the sustained development of<br />
overseas trade.<br />
In fact, I think it fair to say that the total program--<br />
of which this decision is part is designed to help exporters<br />
maintain competitiveness and strengthen their positions by<br />
cutting inflation.<br />
In aggregate terms, as distinct from the situation of<br />
individual industries and exporters, our export situation<br />
is most healthy.<br />
Total exports for 1975/ 76 will be well in excess of<br />
$ 9,500 million,' having doubled in the past four years.<br />
Exports of manufactured goods, have more than doubled<br />
over this period and are expected to total a record $ 2,150<br />
million for 1975/ 76.<br />
I think it's a great tribute to the strength and<br />
resilience of the Australian economy and to the skills<br />
of its producers and entrepeneurs that this very substantial<br />
growth in Australia's exports took place against the<br />
background of the world's worst economic recession since<br />
the 1930s. But whilst the aggregate figures are gratifying, you<br />
know very well there are many difficulties being encountered<br />
in our export industries which are not revealed in the total<br />
growth figures.<br />
As you are only too well aware, the export of a wide<br />
range of manufactu-.' ed products has been sharply reduced,<br />
or has ceased.<br />
Most factories are running at under capacity.<br />
Some have shut down. </p>
<p>I don't have to tell you that the staggering rate of<br />
inflation we had to contend with has meant a severe erosion<br />
of Australia's export competitiveness.<br />
While it is true that our competitors have similarly<br />
had to contend with rising costs, Australia's rate of<br />
inflation has been much greater than all of the major<br />
Western economies except the United Kingdom and some of our<br />
major competitors, such as the United States, Japan and<br />
the Federal Republic of Germany now, have cut their inflation<br />
rates to less than half those with which you have had to<br />
contend. Unless our objective of controlling inflation is<br />
achieved, all of our export industries not only manufactured<br />
exports, but the mining and farming industries as well<br />
will face intolerable burdens.<br />
They simply will not be able to compete in overseas<br />
markets. The vigorous and determined pursuit of our objective to<br />
control inflation has meant and will mean many difficult<br />
decisions by the Government.<br />
I've already mentioned one of direct concern to you<br />
as exporters. The Government did give very careful consideration to<br />
the proposals put forward by yours and other organisations.<br />
I hope you will appreciate that at this time the Government<br />
cannot afford the luxury of looking at individual proposals<br />
in isolation a method our predecessors used with<br />
disastrous results.<br />
Rather, we must look at the whole range of Government<br />
activities, and determine the priorities that &amp; re in the<br />
nation's best overall interest.<br />
As I have already said, we are fully conscious of the<br />
need for a continued strong export sector.<br />
But, we believe that in the present circumstances, we<br />
can best contribute to the attainment of that objective by<br />
arresting and reversing the erosion of our international price<br />
competitiveness. </p>
<p>And, to do that we must reduce inflation.<br />
So it was in this context of an overall anti-inflationary<br />
policy and the urgent need to alleviate the immediate<br />
budgetary problems that the decision was taken to defer part<br />
of the payment on some of the market development claims lodged<br />
in 1976/ 77 until the following year.<br />
In allocating the available funds, particular regard<br />
will be had to the claims of smaller exporters.<br />
Where the amount of the grant appro ved does not exceed<br />
$ 10,000, claimants will be paid in full.<br />
Those firms whose approved claims exceed $ 10,000 will<br />
be paid an initial grant of $ 10,000 as soon as their claims<br />
have been processed.<br />
It is estimated that about two-thirds of all firms submitting<br />
claims in 1976/ 77 will receive their grant payments in full,<br />
immediately on approval.<br />
As I announced last week, in keeping with the Government's<br />
overall policy of expenditure reductions, legislation will<br />
be introduced during the budget session of Parliament to<br />
amend the provisions of the Export Market Development Grants<br />
Act. Briefly, the premium rate of grant of 85 per cent will be<br />
removed, leaving the present 60 per cent as, the standard rate<br />
for all grants.<br />
In addition, the grant ceiling will be reduced from<br />
$ 100,000 per annum to $ 70,000 per annum, while the provisions<br />
relating to Commonwealth Government-sponsored promotions will<br />
be removed after 31 December, 1976.<br />
These changes are designed to bring Government expenditure<br />
under the scheme to the level originally provided for when<br />
the scheme was first introduced.<br />
Although it has been decided to reduce the overall benefits<br />
available, the changes have been designed to minimise the<br />
impact on the smaller and more financially vulnerable exporters<br />
who make up the bulk of the claimants under the scheme.<br />
Whilst I fully appreciate the importance exporters attach<br />
to incentive arrangements, there are other important and<br />
extensive forms of assistance that the Government is continuing<br />
to provide to exporters.<br />
The services of the Department of Overseas Trade in<br />
Canberra and through its six State Regional Offices are<br />
avallable acL all timues tc, assist exporters wizh their problems.<br />
The Trade Commissioner Service will be only very marginally<br />
affected by the Government's expenditure cuts. </p>
<p>Funds for overseas trade promotion are to be maintainied<br />
at approximately existing levels.<br />
The department will continue to arrange and service what<br />
has been to date a most effective programme of trade displays,<br />
exhibitions and trade missions throughout the world.<br />
An Australian Trade Exhibition is to be held in Moscow<br />
next month. This is one of the most ambitious exhibitions staged by<br />
Australia, with about 50 Australian firms participating.<br />
I will be visiting Moscow to open the Exhibition and I will<br />
take the opportunity to have discussions on future trade<br />
prospects generally between our two countries.<br />
The successful overseas trade publicity programme of the<br />
Department of Overseas Trade will be continued.<br />
The Government intends to maintain and strengthen the export<br />
finance facility under which the Export Finance and Insurance<br />
Corporation provides concessional finance on a long-term basis to<br />
Australian captial goods exporters to enable them to compete<br />
with overseas suppliers.<br />
Negotiations are being held with the private banks to<br />
extensively widen their involvement in this area.<br />
This is consistent with the Government's desire to ensure<br />
that initiative and responsibility in appropriate areas are<br />
restored to the private sector.<br />
However, should the private sector specifically request<br />
Government co-operation in the commercial sector, then prompt<br />
and practical consideration would be given to the proposal.<br />
Recently the Government has been in close consultation with<br />
some Australian firms on the possibility of co-operation in a<br />
large overseas turnkey project.<br />
In addition, a proposal canvassing the possible establishment<br />
of an Australian Overseas Projects Corporation has been received<br />
from the Associated Chambers of Manufactures and is currently<br />
the subject of study within my Department.<br />
As sson as the economy is restored to a satisfactory state<br />
we will be able to give further attention to expanding the<br />
assistance that can be made available to exporters.<br />
Meanwhile the state of the economy must be our prime concern.<br />
And I must say, Mr Chairman, that when I read the resolution<br />
carried by the National Executive of the Labor Party last week,<br />
my feeling was what a tragedy that such lack of understanding<br />
of the nature and depth of our economic crisis continues to exist<br />
in That Party.<br />
How ironic that a resolution purporting to call for<br />
protection of incomes and living standards completely ignores<br />
the most devastating enemy of those standards inflation! </p>
<p>How ironic too that we are attached on unemployment by<br />
the party whose policies contributed so largely to the worst<br />
unemployment in 40 years.<br />
And how disturbing it is that there is still no realisation<br />
in the Labor Party that inflation is the root cause of unemployment,<br />
and that we won't beat unemployment until we beat inflation.<br />
Private investment will, of course, play an important part in<br />
economic recovery.<br />
One of the very early steps we took was to introduce a new<br />
investment allowance.<br />
And by deferring company taxation early this year, the<br />
Government tried to cushion the cash flow of companies from<br />
the ravages of inflation.<br />
We are also committed to changes in the company tax<br />
arrangements and this is even more complex than income tax<br />
indexation, but we have various proposals now under consideration.<br />
I believe that we are seeing early, yet clear, signs of<br />
recovery. The March quarter national accounts lend support to this,<br />
showing an improvement in gross domestic product and an<br />
important reversal in the trend in expenditure on such items<br />
as plant and equipment.<br />
The last Survey of Manufacturing Activity published<br />
in May shows an aggregate upturn in orders and employment,<br />
and further increases in overtime and the utilisation of installed<br />
capacity. This is not to say, however, that there are not major problem<br />
areas. Nor is it to say that there is the slightest room for any<br />
complacency about rising costs and prices on either the<br />
Government's or the private sector's part.<br />
Inflation is still the major obstacle to stability and<br />
growth in the Australian economy.<br />
That's why the Government is taking such stringent steps<br />
against spending.<br />
No doubt there will be further criticisms levelled at the<br />
Government for scaling down some of the programmes of our<br />
predecessors. But it was the enormous cost of these programmes that played<br />
a major part in leaciing the Australian economy to where it is<br />
at present. A!-xhough it is never easy to take unpopular decisions, ido<br />
believe that there is growing acceptance by the community of the<br />
need for the kind of firm and decisive action we're taking.<br />
No doubt some elements in the trade union movement will<br />
endeavour to frus~--c-e our efforts. </p>
<p>However, I'm quite confident that the great majority of<br />
people are prepared to have the patience and to accept the<br />
discipline needed to get the economic situation under control.<br />
For until it is under control, no-one will gain any real<br />
benefits. The Government believes that the direct relationship between<br />
excessive wage rises and the continued rate of high inflation<br />
and unemployment is now becoming much better understood<br />
throughout the community.<br />
The Government has recently had very useful discussions<br />
with the ACTu, and I think we can all be very encouraged by the<br />
constructive and positive atmosphere in which that meeting took<br />
place. What the discussions should have made clear to the whole<br />
community is that we are all in this fight together.<br />
If we're not, we might as well give it away now.<br />
It is essential that the basic competitive position of<br />
Australian producers be restored.<br />
The steps taken by the Government have all been with this<br />
prime objective uppermost.<br />
We believe in a strong and healthy free-enterprise sector,<br />
which has the necessary resources to grow and provide employment<br />
for Australian workers.<br />
We believe also that too many of our available resources<br />
were directed to the Government sector over the last three<br />
years. We are acting to change this situation.<br />
I am confident we can achieve a real recovery.<br />
But we won't do it without a lot of discipline, restraint<br />
and even some sacrifice.<br />
I hope that when economic recovery gets under way, there<br />
will be much more scope for industry and Government to work<br />
together on new initiatives and new projects to ensure<br />
sustained national growth in the future.<br />
But we've first got to rebuild a strong foundation for that<br />
recovery if it's to be a lasting one. </p>
