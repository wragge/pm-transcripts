PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA3 July 1983<br />
No total costing of the Federal Government's compensation<br />
offer to Tasmania is possible at this stage.<br />
The Tasmanian Premier, Mr Gray, is only guessing when he<br />
estimates the cost of compensation at more than $ 500 million.<br />
Until all the alternative employment projects are approved and<br />
a study of the level and sources of future electricity needs<br />
is completed it will not be possible to provide any reliable<br />
costing. I have given Tasmanians an assurance that there will be full<br />
consultation with the State authorities on these issues.<br />
The Federal Government Will ensure that Tasmania is properly<br />
compensated for the decision to halt the Gordon-below-Franklin<br />
dam and again assurs the workers involved that their employment<br />
needs will be met.<br />
