REMARKS BY PRIME MINISTER AT SICHUAN ZOO,.<br />
CHENGDU : 21 MAY 1986<br />
CHINA HAS ACCORDED AUSTRALIA A GREAT HONOUR IN ANNOUNCING<br />
4 THAT IT WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE CELEBRATION OF AUSTRALIA'S<br />
BiCENTENARY BY PERMITTING US TO DISPLAY IN AUSTRALIA A<br />
PAIR OF RARE AND APPEALING GIANT PANDAS.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF HOW PRECIOUS THE GIANT)<br />
PANDA IS NOT ONLY TO THE CHINESE PEOPLE BUT TO PEOPLE ALL<br />
OVER THE WORLD. WE ARE VERY AWARE OF THE MASSIVE RESCUE<br />
MEASURES TAKEN BY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO SAVE PANDAS<br />
FROM STARVATION WITH THE WIDESPREAD DEATH OF BAMBOO IN<br />
THE MOUNTAINS. FOR YOU TO CONTRIBUTE SO GENEROUSLY TO<br />
* OUR BiCENTENARY CELEBRATIONS MARKS THE STRENGTH AND WARMTH<br />
OF THE RELATIONS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED BETWEEN OUR TWO<br />
COUNTRIES. IN AUSTRALIA WE SHARE YOUR CONCERN AND THAT OF ORGANISATIONS<br />
SUCH AS THE WORLD WILD LIFE FUND FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE<br />
GIANT PANDA AND IWANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE WILL TAKE ALL<br />
NECESSARY STEPS TO ENSURE THE SAFETYj COMFORT AND WELL<br />
BEING OF THE PANDAS DURING THEIR JOURNEY TO AND FROM OURCOUNTRY<br />
AND WHILE THEY ARE IN AUSTRALIA. THERE IS PRESENTLY<br />
AN AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION FROM OUR WILDLIFE AUTHORITY IN<br />
CHINA DISCUSSING ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE CARE AND NURTURE OF<br />
THE PANDAS WITH THE RELEVANT CHINESE AUTHORITIES. </p>
<p>2.<br />
MANY ACTIVITIES WILL CLAIM THE ATTENTION OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
PEOPLE DURING 1988. OUR YEAR OF CELEBRATION WILL BEGIN<br />
WITH A SPECTACULAR OPENING CEREMONY. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR<br />
THERE WILL BE WORLD CLASS EXHIBITIONS AND PERFORMANCES,<br />
A GATHERING FROM AROUND THE WORLD OF TALL SHIPS, THE<br />
OPENING OF AUSTRALIA'S NEW PARLIAMENT HOUSE, A WORLD<br />
EXPOSITION, AT WHICH CHINA WILL BE A PARTICIPANT, AND MANY<br />
INTERNATIONAL SPORTING EVENTS. YET I CAN PREDICT THAT FOR<br />
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AUSTRALIANS THE EXHIBITION OF GIANT<br />
PANDAS WILL BE A HIGHLIGHT.<br />
JUST AS WE HAVE TRAVELLED ACROSS CHINA TODAY TO SICHUAN<br />
PROVINCE TO VIEW THE PANDAS AT THIS ZOO, THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
PEOPLE WILL TRAVEL FROM THE DISTANT CORNERS OF OUR<br />
CONTINENT TO SEE THIS MOST TREASURED SPECIES OF ALL<br />
ANIMALS WHICH HAS BECOME THE INTERNATIONAL SYMBOL FOR THE<br />
CONSERVATION OF NATURE.<br />
IT IS WITH THE HIGHEST SENSE OF THE GREAT HONOUR THAT YOU<br />
ACCORD AUSTRALIA THAT I MOST GRATEFULLY ACCEPT THIS OFFER<br />
OF A PAIR OF GIANT PANDAS FOR EXHIBITION IN AUSTRALIA DURING<br />
OUR BICENTENARY YEAR CELEBRATIONS IN 1988, </p>
