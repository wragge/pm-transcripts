PRIME MINISTER<br />
PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF SPEECH. OPENING OF BOB CATLEY'S<br />
ELECTORATE OFFICE, SEFTON PARK, ADELAIDE. 23 JUNE 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
Now ladies and gentlemen, it would be aooropriate, as I'm<br />
opening the office of a local Member just to say something<br />
about a couole of things that happened yesterday. A few<br />
discussions I had with my friend Bishop Peter<br />
Hollingworth. Let me say, I use the word friend advisedly<br />
because I'm amazed that I'm told by my Press Officer that<br />
one of the. the television stations last night and they're<br />
quite remarkable how they manufacture news. said that after<br />
a few words we had together I then commanded the Archbishop<br />
to come to my office. The truth is. my friends, is that we<br />
had a orior appointment which he'd arranged, which he'd<br />
requested to meet me in my office ana when we finished we<br />
walked out amicably together. We had a very. very amicable<br />
discussion and we parted, as we went in, as very good<br />
friends.<br />
But it is important that I go to the issue of what I was<br />
talking about yesterday because it couldn't be more<br />
relevant than it is in opening the office of a Member of<br />
Parliament. The words that upset me vesterday were not<br />
words that uoset me in regards to myself cersonally. Now I<br />
just remind you what the worcs were. They were these all<br />
politicians willi only do something about it. that's child<br />
Doverty, all politicians will only do somethina about it if<br />
they feel tney have to at election time, for instance.<br />
Now ladies and gentlemen. I thought that yesterday I had an<br />
obligation, as rime Minister of this country, to speak uo<br />
for all politicians because I think that one of the great<br />
dangers in our democracy is the way in which ooiiticians.<br />
as a class, are denegrated. It is easy. extraordinarily<br />
easy to have the cheac shot at ooliticians. Very, very<br />
easy but I want to say to you and my remarks are not only<br />
directed to Labor Members of Par iament we have our<br />
ideological. ohilosoonical differences with our opponents,<br />
but by anrd arge what I say of my own Members I wi1l say of<br />
Members of the ODoosition as individual Members of<br />
Parliament they are hara-worki ng. </p>
<p>There's no great glamour or joy for your ordinary Member of<br />
Parliament, particularly those in relatively marginal<br />
seats. They have unceasing demands uoon their time. You<br />
all know that it is not a financially well rewarding<br />
vocation. Bob Cat ley will undoubtedly be worse off<br />
financially in net terms as a representative here of this<br />
seat of Adelaide than ne would have been if he'd continued<br />
what he was doing before. And that is true. that is true i<br />
think for the majority of Members of Parliament. that they<br />
could be getting highet remuneration eisewhere.<br />
But the uoiid. Umi noiinuH. my~ W ends. is this. 1 believe<br />
that the Australi an soc ie~ y is in danger of being a less<br />
efficient, a less nuhesive. a less aroductive society if we<br />
encourage and al low. witho~ ut comment. the cheap shots at<br />
the politician. And i say that not just of members of my<br />
Party and I was not speaking yesterday just for Labor<br />
members. I simply think it is not the case that members of<br />
Parliament will only do the right thing if they are pushed<br />
to do it and particularly at election time. I say this of<br />
Members of Parliament across the spectrum. although i have<br />
deep philosopnical differences with those on the other<br />
side, but in regard to the overwhelming majority of<br />
individual Parliamentarians. be they in the Labor Party,<br />
the Liberal Party, the National Party or the Democrats,<br />
that they do have a sense of commitment and oublic<br />
service. They do not get great rewards, they have enormous<br />
demands upon their times, their-families as well are<br />
subject to enormous pressures and you will find that..<br />
you already found it out now.<br />
And what i was about therefore yesterday, my friends, was<br />
not some defence of the Governmenz's policy, but trying to<br />
say something whicn I thinK is important. if we're going<br />

let's make sure that we recognise the aischarge of the<br />
obligations by ooliticians of the great resoonsibilities<br />
they have upon them. And may i say. without going to<br />
confidences in the discussions 1 had with Peter afterwards,<br />
he acknowledged the validity of what I was saying and the<br />
right that i had to oul; it. So I just want to make it<br />
clear., that's what my concern was.<br />
