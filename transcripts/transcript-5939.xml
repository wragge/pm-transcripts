COMMONWEALTH HEADS OF GOVERNMENT REGIONAL MEETING<br />
SUVA, OCTOBER 1982<br />
FINAL COMMUNIQUE<br />
I. Commonwealth Heads of Government from the Asia-Pacific region met in Suva from-<br />
14 to 18 October 1982. Seventeen countries attended the Meeting, namely, Australia,<br />
Bangladesh, Fiji, India, Kiribati, Malaysia, Maldives, Nauru, New Zealand, Papua New<br />
Guinea, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Tonga, Tuvalu, Western Samoa and<br />
Vanuatu. Fourteen were represented by their Presidents or Prime Ministers. The Prime<br />
Minister of Fiji, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, was in the Chair.<br />
2. Heads of Government warmly welcomed to the Meeting the Republic of Maldives,<br />
which had become a Special Member of the Commonwealth earlier in the year.<br />
POLITICAL TRENDS<br />
3. Heads of Government expressed concern that the deterioration in the overall<br />
international situation had continued since their Meeting in 1980, and that this had<br />
led to a deepening sense of insecurity among people throughout the world. They noted<br />
that current international economic difficulties had clearly exacerbated political<br />
issues, not only in regard to East-West problems, but in relation to North-South<br />
problems as well.<br />
4. Against this background, they drew special attention to the relevance of the<br />
recent Report to the General Assembly by the Secretary-General of the United Nations.<br />
They commended his appeal for a sustained effort to reinvest the United Nations, and<br />
particularly the Security Council, with the necessary means and authority to enable it<br />
to fulfil the task of maintaining international peace and security entrusted to it by<br />
its Charter. They strongly urged states to give thorough consideration at the current<br />
Assembly session to the Secretary-General's recommendations.<br />
As at their previous Meetings, Heads of Government rea ffirmed the<br />
inadmissability of the use of force in international relations and of interference in<br />
the internal affairs of states, and stressed the need to resolve differences by<br />
peaceful means based on respect for sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity<br />
and equality. 1hey recognised that adherence to these precepts and progress towards<br />
disarmament were essential and complementary aspects to the achievement of<br />
international security. They were therefore greatly disturbed by the failure of the<br />
international community to reach any agreement on the Comprehensive Programme for<br />
Disarmament considered at the recent United Nations Special Session devoted to<br />
disarmament. They expressed the hope that the World Campaign, which had been launched<br />
at the Special Session would help to create a climate of world public opinion that<br />
would bring effective pressure to bear on governments to tackle difficult disarmament<br />
issues with greater determination.<br />
6. Heads of Government were gravely concerned that the conflicts in the Middle<br />
East remain unresolved and continue to threaten world peace and security. They<br />
stressed the urgent need to recognise the legir~ mate and inalienable rights of the<br />
Palestinian people, including their right to a homeland, and to seek a just settlement </p>
<p>i f the problem on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions. They<br />
condemned Israel for its invasion of Lebanon and expressed their revulsion at the<br />
resultant death and devastation particularly in Beirut. They were deeply concerned at<br />
the grave consequences that these recent events could have for the prospects for any<br />
future settlement. Recognising that the untold human misery could not be undone they<br />
nevertheless urged the governments concerned to redouble their efforts to find an<br />
urgent solution to the problem, to enable the Lebanon and all peoples in the area to<br />
live in peace.<br />
7. Heads of Government reaffirmed their total and unequivocal condemnation of<br />
apartheid perpetuated by the white minority regime in South Africa. They condemned<br />
the increasingly frequent military incursions by South Africa into the neighbouring,<br />
states of Angola, Mozambique and Zimbabwe in an attempt to subvert the process of<br />
liberation in Southern Africa. They expressed deep concern at South Africa's delaying<br />
tactics over the negotiations for Namibia's independence on the basis of Security<br />
Council Resolution 435.<br />
The Asia-Pacific Region<br />
8. In reaffirming their commitment to the goal of establishing a zone of peace in<br />
the Indian Ocean, Heads of Government noted with alarm the increasing build-up of the<br />
Great Power military presence in the area which was taking place against the expressed<br />
wishes of the Littoral and hinterland states. They endorsed the view expressed by the<br />
General Assembly that the projected United Nations Conference on the Indian Ocean was<br />
a necessary step towards implementing the 1971 United Nations Declaration. They<br />
called upon the Great Powers to take immediate action to reduce tension in the Indian<br />
Ocean area and urged all concerned to work towards the convening of the Conference<br />
without further delay.<br />
9. Heads of Government expressed grave concern at the situation in and around<br />
Afghanistan and its implications both for the region's peace and stability and for<br />
international security. They reiterated their urgent call for a political settlement<br />
on the basis of the withdrawal of foreign troops and full respect for the<br />
independence, sovereignty and non-aligned status of Afghanistan and strict observance<br />
ot the principles of non-intervention and non-interference. They were disturbed that<br />
none of the international initiatives designed to assist the affected parties to find<br />
a mutually acceptable solution had proved successful. They affirmed the right of the<br />
Afghan refugees to return to their homes in safety and honour. They urged all<br />
concerned to work towards a negotiated settlement which would leave the Afghan people<br />
free to determine their own future.<br />
Heads of Government expressed grave concern at the persistence of foreign<br />
military intervention and interference in Kampuchea which has aggravated tension and<br />
instability in South East Asia. They reiterated their concern that if the situation<br />
remains unresolved, it would only invite greater involvement by major powers in the<br />
affairs of the region. They reaffirmed the need for all states to strictly adhere to<br />
the fundamental principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of other<br />
states, respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states and<br />
non-recourse to the use or threat of force in settling disputes. They stressed that<br />
it was imperative for a comprehensive political solution to be found to the Kampuchean<br />
question on the basis of the total withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea,<br />
and the restoration of the independence, sovereignty, and neutrality of Kampuchea so<br />
as to enable the people to determine their future free of outside interference. In<br />
this regard Heads of Government noted developments on Kampuchea since their last<br />
discussion including the formation of the coalition ~ government of Democratic Kampuchea<br />
and the announcement of the Government of Vietnam of a pa-rtial withdrawal of its<br />
forces from Kampuchea and its consultations with other r-ountries of the region. They<br />
hoped that the prospect of a political solution to the problem would be enhanced. </p>
<p>Iheads of Government noted with approval the efforts to establish a Zone of<br />
Peace, Freedom and Neutrality ( ZOPFAN) in South East Asia, and they called upon all<br />
states to fully support those efforts. They expressed concern that the unresol. ved<br />
Kampuchean question continues to pose a serious obstacle to the realisation of<br />
ZOPFAN. They therefore urged that efforts towards a comprehensive political solution<br />
of the Kampuchean question be intensified so as to achieve lasting peace in the region.<br />
12. Heads of Government agreed that the South Pacific was an area of great economic<br />
and strategic importance and endorsed the concern expressed for the security of the<br />
area. They agreed that any intrusion of Great Power rivalry in the South Pacific<br />
would introduce a new and undesirable element of instability.<br />
13. Heads of Government were concerned at the persistence of the. problem of<br />
refugees / illegal immigrants from Indo-China. They expressed their appreciation to the<br />
countries providing transit and final settlement. They reiterated the view that the<br />
problem should be tackled at its source and urged the countries primarily responsible<br />
for the situation to create an environment in which the peoples of Indo-China could<br />
live in peace and harmony. They hoped that, pending a political solution to th e<br />
conflicts in Indo-China which were the root cause of the problem, the countries<br />
concerned would continue to co-operate by preventing further illegal departures and by<br />
working with UNHCR and resettlement countries to implement the programme of orderly<br />
departures. 14. Heads of Government strongly reaffirmed the conviction expressed in the<br />
Melbourne Communique the previous year, that the peoples of the South Pacific should<br />
be given the opportunity to exercise their right of self-determination and<br />
independence in accordance with principles laid down in the United Nations Charter.<br />
They noted with satisfaction the assurances which the President of France had given<br />
earlier in the year to the special South Pacific Forum mission led by the Prime<br />
LMinister of Fiji. heads of Government acknowledged the efforts of the Kanak people of<br />
~ Ne4, C, a ledonia towards the attainment of self-determination and independence by<br />
peacetul means. They welcomed the French Government's programme for reforms in the<br />
territory and expressed the hope that these reforms would assist the Kanaks in their<br />
efforts towards a smooth and speecy transition to independence.<br />
heads of Government took note of the desire of the South Pacific island states<br />
to establish their region as a nuclear weapon-free zone, recalling the resolution<br />
already adopted on the subject by the United Nations General Assembly in 1975. They<br />
agreed that the continuation of nuclear weapon testing in the region was a matter for<br />
deep concern. They fully supported the South Pacific Forum's strong condemnation of<br />
France's continued test programme as well as its failure to provide information on the<br />
effects of past tests on the human and natural environment of the Pacific. They also<br />
expressed anxiety over the possibility of the South Pacific becoming an international<br />
dumping ground for nuclear waste and called on all states to desist from the storage<br />
or dumping of nuclear wastes in the Pacific.<br />
16. Heads of Government welcomed the adoption in April 1982, of the new<br />
comzprehensive Convention on the Law of the Sea, which had been the fruit of nine years<br />
of painstaking negotiations and which was of special significance to the countries of<br />
the region. At the same time they deeply deplored the declared decision by the United<br />
States not to become a party to the Convention. Observing that a number of other<br />
developed states had abstained in the vote on its adoption, they recognised that the<br />
lack of active support from these states could seriously undermine the effectiveness<br />
of an instrument that was designed to establish-an international regime for the<br />
equitable and orderly management of the resources of the sea to the benefit of<br />
developed and developing countries alike. They therefore strongly urged all states to<br />
sign the Convention at the forthcoming signing conference in 1982 and to proceed to<br />
the ratification process without unnecessary delay. </p>
<p>. LN'ERNA1IONAL ECONOMIC ISSUES<br />
World Economic Situation<br />
17. Heads at Governiment expressed grave concern at the continuing deterioration of<br />
the world economy and in international economi~ c co-operation. Inflation was<br />
continuing at high levels. Living standards were declining in many countries and<br />
unemployment, already high, was still increasing, particularly among the young. The<br />
deepening economic crisis had dangerous consequences for the social and political<br />
fabric. ot societies. Its impact was severest on developing countries, particularly<br />
the Least developed countries. Increas-i. ng numbers of developing countries were<br />
experiencing declining per capita i ncomes. Balance of payments deficits and debt<br />
servicing burdens had become dangerously -high for many countries, and this had been--<br />
exacerbated by high interest rates and reduced demand in export' markets. The<br />
situation in low income countries was particularly acute. Against the background of<br />
their limited access to capital markets, deterioratinig ext-ernal payments were imposing<br />
severe contraction on growth rates that were already at critical levels. Heads of<br />
Government warned that the situation was becoming politically explosive in many<br />
developing countries. Problems of recovery and development, they stressed, now<br />
required immediate action in the form of appropriate policies and measures.<br />
18. Heads of Government welcomed the recent reductions in inflation and interest<br />
rates in the major industrialised countries. They underlined, however, the urgent<br />
need for policies to bring about non-inflationary economic growth. They regarded<br />
continued progress in lowering inlterest rates as crucial. They agreed that vigorous<br />
joint and co-ordinated remedial international action could not be further postponed.<br />
Bold decisions were required and it was extremely important that the opportunities<br />
presented by forthcoming n. eetings the GATT Contracting Parties at Ministerial level<br />
in November 1982, the LMF Interim Committee in April 1983 and UNCTAD-VI in June--1983<br />
were not missed.<br />
19. Heads of Government noted with concern the continuing stalemate-in-launching<br />
Global Negotiations. Wvhi le differences had narrowed, the impasse had continued. They<br />
expressed the hope that the political resolve evident at the Commonwealth heads of<br />
Government Meeting in Melbourne and the summits of Cancun and Versailles would be<br />
brought to bear to clear the way for an early start to-the Negotiations. They<br />
emphasised the need-for a special effort at the current session of the United Nations<br />
General Assembly to resolve outstanding difficulties. They reiterated the need for<br />
parallel, concurrent and immediate action in ci~ itical areas such as trade, energy,<br />
food and finance.<br />
Heads of Government welcomed the decision of the recent Meeting of Commonwealth<br />
Finance Ministers to request the Commonwealth Secretariat to undertake an overall<br />
examination of the international trade and payments system and in particular the role<br />
of the international economic institutions without prejudice to action on immediate<br />
measures.* In view of: the vast changes that had taken place since the establishment of<br />
the Bretton Woods institutions and of the evident mal-functioning of the international<br />
economic system, they . agreed that the time was most opportune for such an<br />
examination. They looked ' forward to its * results with great interest. They expressed<br />
the hope that the study would help to focus attention on a comprehensive examination<br />
of the world's Lrade and payments system.<br />
21. * Without prejudice to Global Negotiations, but mindful of the emergency facing<br />
the world economy, heads of Government noted with appreciation the New Zealand<br />
proposal for a review of the Bretton Woods system. Acknowl~ dging the need tar an<br />
appropriate review and for reform of the world's tradinlg * and payments arrangements on<br />
linEs responsive to contemporary needs and realities, they agreed that their<br />
governments would give particular attention to it in the light of the study<br />
Commonwealth Finance Ministers had commnissioned from the CommonweaIth Secretariat. </p>
<p>Heads of Government considered the report on Protectionism by a Group of<br />
. perts headed by Sir Alec Cairncross. They agreed that it made a uniquely important<br />
S-ontribution to the consideration of protectionism as it affects developing<br />
countries. Accordingly they decided that the Secretary-General should make available<br />
a copy of the report to the Director-General of GATT for circulation at the<br />
forthcoming GAIT Ministerial meeting. It would be desirable for Commonwealth<br />
Ministers attending the GAT meeting to endeavour to see that the outcome of that<br />
meeting reflects as much as possible the recommendations of the report by the Group of<br />
Exprts. 23. Heads of Government agreed that two central issues on the international<br />
economic agenda were creeping protectionism and growing disorder in the international<br />
financial system. While not seekLng to postpone consideration of other important<br />
issues, they believed these two were crucial to both development and recovery and<br />
required immediate attention and action.<br />
Financial Issues<br />
24. leads ol Government recogiised that there had been tundamental political and<br />
economic changes since the framework for international economic co-operation had been<br />
established at Bretton Woods and Havana. Within the last decade, high and<br />
difterential rates of inflation had disturbed exchange rates, economic activity had<br />
slowed and balance of payments deficits and surpluses had emerged of a persistent<br />
rather than cyclical character. While recognising that sound domestic policies to<br />
foster adjustments were among the essential prerequisites to world economic recovery<br />
and development, they stressed that features of the present trade and payments systems<br />
were not conducive to an orderly adjustment process.<br />
They were conc . r-ned over the mounting debt problems of many developing<br />
countries and their growing reliance on such shorter-term commercial borrowing as<br />
cannot be sustained. Agreeing that the LMF, the IBRD and its associated bodies should<br />
continue to play a key role, they considered that a review of these institutions was<br />
uesirable to enable them to adapt more adequately to present-day conditions. They saw<br />
the need tor greater resources to facilitate longer-term finance for adjustment, and a<br />
more realistic application of conditionality. They stressed the importance of<br />
reaching agreemcent at the April meeting of the Interim Committee for a very<br />
substantial increase in quotas under the Eighth General Quota Review.<br />
26. In view of the desperate situation facing most low income and least developed<br />
countries, Heads of Government voiced disappointment that aid flows were again<br />
declining in real terms. They called on all donors to make special efforts to<br />
increase ODA to meet internationally agreed targets and to provide the necessary<br />
support for facilitating adjustments in developing countries.<br />
27. Heads of Government recognised the substantial contribution that IDA had made<br />
in transferring concessional resources to low-income countries. They welcomed the<br />
recent efforts by many donors to ensure that IDA flows were not disrupted by the<br />
decision of the United States to stretch out its IDA VI replenishment. They called<br />
for early agreement on a replenishment level for IDA VII which would ensure an<br />
increase in real terms in keeping with past trends and the urgency of satisfying<br />
present needs for concessional finance.<br />
28. Noting that the growth rate in World Bank lending remained significantly below<br />
the target of 5 per cent in real terms, Heads of Government called for special efforts<br />
to expand the Bank's operations. They noted its efforts to increase co-financing, but<br />
stressed that the Bank's development role must be preserved and. that this required<br />
continued expansion of its own resources and lending. </p>
<p>cernational Trade<br />
29. Heads of Government considered that protectionism posed a threat to the<br />
multilateral trading system, impaired the ability of deficit countries to service and<br />
repay loans through increased export earnings, and hampered the development efforts of<br />
developing countries. Noting that the Australian proposals initially for a standstill<br />
and subsequently for a phased-in windback of all forms of protection having a trade<br />
distorting effect could help signiticantly in revitalising the world economy, they<br />
were of the view that developing countries in particular would benefit from any<br />
relaxation of trade distorting measures and that such relaxation would assist world<br />
economic recovery to the benefit of all.<br />
Heads of Government reaffirmed their commitment to an open international<br />
trading system and viewed with alarm the growing disregard for basic principles and<br />
rules such as non-discrimination, transparency and predictability. They fully<br />
supported the need to reinforce these rules.<br />
31. Heads of Government agreed that the GATT Ministerial meeting must bring about a<br />
complete standstill on protection and must establish arrangements to facilitate the<br />
reduction of protectionist barriers. They emphasised the importance of an effective<br />
non-discriminatory safeguards system under which new protectionist measures would be<br />
discouraged and orderly marketing arrangements such as the Multi-fibre Arrangement and<br />
voluntary export restraints would eventually be phased out. Recognising that little<br />
progress had so far been made in dismantling agricultural protectionism, they urged<br />
the development of an approach to overcome the obstacles posed by the close<br />
relationship between agr: icultural protectionism and domestic agricultural policies.<br />
They agreed in this context that an early start should be made iln reducing export<br />
subsidies adopted by developed countries to support their agriculture. They stressed<br />
the importance of improving the disputes settlement procedures under the GATT and of<br />
all countries adhering to the decisions and disciplines involved.<br />
Commodity Problems<br />
32. Heads of Government expressed great concern at the sharp decline in commodity<br />
prices in recent years and the disastrous ettect this was having on the terms of trade<br />
of many developing countries. Current trends demonstrated the vital importance of<br />
commodity price and export earnings stabilisation arrangements and the need to<br />
redouble efforts to secure thair establishment. They agreed that early relief could<br />
be given by more adequate provision for meeting export shortfalls through the<br />
liberalisation of access to the IMF Compensatory Financing Facility. The situation<br />
also called for innovative approaches including increased emphasis on co-operation<br />
among producing countries to protect themselves against the vagaries of international<br />
commodity markets.<br />
Energy 33. Heads of Government were of the view that the present softness of the oil<br />
market should not lull the international community into inaction on the energy front.<br />
They stressed that immediate consideration should be given to devising special<br />
arrangments to meet the energy needs of low income and least developed countries<br />
facing difficult balance of payment problems and to facilitating increased<br />
availability of international financing for development of their indigenous energy<br />
resources including the establishment of the energy affiliate of the World Bank. They<br />
welcomed the concessional arrangements for the purchase of oil introduced by several<br />
oil exporting countries such as Mexico, Venezuela, and Trinidad and Tobago for central<br />
American and Caribbean countries and Nigeria for African countries, and urged wider<br />
application of similar measures encompassing other geographical zones. I </p>
<p>ood ' Problems<br />
34. Heads of Government expressed deep concern over the critical and worsening tood<br />
situation faced by many developing countries, particularly the least developed<br />
countries. There was an urgent need ror a dependable system of world food security.<br />
lTh-y called for early establishmeiit of an Lnternationai grains arrangement which<br />
should recognise the special needs of developing countries. They urged that effective<br />
steps by taken to meet the food aid target agreed in the International Development<br />
Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. They stressed the<br />
importance of providing adequate financial and technical resources to enhance food<br />
production.<br />
REGIONAL ECONOMIC AND FUCTIONAL CO-OPERATION<br />
Heads of Government recognised that programmes of practical co-operation<br />
designed to assist the process of development were an important product of their<br />
deliberations and they noted with satisfaction the progress achieved in this regard by<br />
the Consultative/ Working Groups set up at earlier meetings. They agreed that the work<br />
of the Groups should be continued with greater emphasis on a practical, action<br />
oriented approach. They further agreed that one of the major objectives of the<br />
programmes of functional co-operation was to assist the -small island countries of the<br />
region to overcome their special problems of development.<br />
36. While calling for an expansion or CFTC support for all developing countries of<br />
the region, they welcomed the enhanced programmes of assistance to the small island<br />
countries undertaken by the CFTC through regional and functional programmes and in<br />
collaboration with CHOCRM Groups. They expressed particular appreciation for the<br />
assistance provided by the CFTC in the implementation of the Pacific Regional Advisory<br />
Service which has been established within the South Pacific Bureau for Economic<br />
Co-operation, and for the financial assistance pledged by the Australian Government<br />
for the Secretariat to facilitate CHOGRM states to have permanent representation at<br />
the United Nations.<br />
Trade 37. Heads of Government emphasised the importance of continuing to pursue efforts<br />
to facilitate the liberalisation of trade within the region and to bring collective<br />
pressure to bear on barriers in the major industrialised countries to exports from<br />
CHOGRM countries. They recognised the importance of the GSP as an instrument for<br />
promoting further trade liberalisation within the region and urged the developed<br />
countries in the region to accord careful and sympathetic consideration to proposals<br />
aimed at achieving an expansion of product coverage and a deepening of preferences for<br />
the exports of developing member countries. They noted the view of developing<br />
countries that the more advanced countries within the region could play a dynamic role<br />
in increasing regional trade by reducing their import barriers. In this context they<br />
welcomed the initiative of Australia and New Zealand in establishing the SPARTECA<br />
Agreement which provides for duty free, unrestricted access for the Forum island<br />
countries. They directed the CHOGRM Trade Group to consider the recommendations of<br />
the various studies it had commissioned with a view to their practical implementation.<br />
38. Heads of Government recognised that considerable scope existed for Asian and<br />
Pacitic Commonwealth countries to increase their exports to destinations both within<br />
and outside the region. They noted however, that infrastructural facilities for trade<br />
needea to be developed or strengthened; opportunities for trade had to be identified<br />
and technical assistance was required if they were to be. exploited. Heads of<br />
Government noted the facilities available within the Export Market Development<br />
Division ot the Secretariat to take up an extensive range of projects to develop and </p>
<p>alnd the trade of the countries of the region and the considerable work that had<br />

exotdevelopment in the Asian and Pacific region and agreed that additional funds<br />
should be provided to make this possible.<br />
39. , In endorsing its report [ leads of Government requested the Trade Group to<br />
continue its work within * its present mandate and to take due regard of, inter alia,<br />
the decisions of the GATT Ministerial meeting in determining its priorities for future<br />
work. Energy Heads of Government endorsed the Report of the Consultative Group on Energy.<br />
They noted with satisfaction that the Group was now entering a new phase of activities<br />
in which a concrete programme of demonstration projects will be undertaken. They<br />
welcomed the recent initiatives taken in identifying projects and sites for the<br />
establishment of renewable energy systems and energy conservation technologies for<br />
purposes of demonstration, evaluation and training. They also welcomed. the<br />
willingness of Australia and India to support the installation of some of these<br />
systems as part of the programme. They also noted with satisfaction that the Group's<br />
activ iite e ouh acfi wllinfuture complement and supplement the Pacific<br />
Energy Programme co-ordiinated by SPEC. They also agreed that the services of CRRERIS<br />
be extended to SPEC.<br />
41. Noting that there (-, xLS ts8 Scope tor co-operation in respect of. feasibility<br />
studies, consultancy services, project execution, etc., Heads of Government agreed<br />
that the scope of activities of the Group should be expanded to help promote such<br />
co-operation in commercial. scale energy projects in countries of the region.<br />
Indus try<br />
42. Heads of Government considered the Rleport of the Working Group on Industry and<br />
noted with appreciation the thrust of its work in assisting member countries,<br />
especially small island states, toward the achievement of tangible results in<br />
industrial projects. They commended the work of the Industrial Development Unit ( IDU)<br />
of the CFTC in providing the necessary technical and field services for the<br />
establishment of projects on the ground. They noted with satisfaction that the<br />
viability of more than seventy industrial projects, mainly in the small scale and<br />
agro-based sectors, has been established in the region and that their progress toward<br />
implementation has been facilitated by inputs of technology, engineering, information<br />
exchanges, technical collaboration, entrepreneurship development and investment flows.<br />
43. They noted the arrangements effected by the Group for co-ordination with SPEC<br />
and other international agencies and expressed gratitude for the financial and other<br />
practical assistance provided by individual member countries. Heads of Government<br />
also approved the future programme ot work as proposed In the Group's Report which<br />
could lead to further progress in the implementation of projects.<br />
Agriculture 44. Heads of Government considered the Report of the Expert Study Group on<br />
Agricultural Research and Development set up by the. Secretary-General in response to<br />
their request made in New Delhi in 1980. They endorsed the views expressed in the<br />
Report on the priority needs of member couintries of the~ region and its recommendations<br />
relating to the upgrading of profesional skills; the exchange of publications and<br />
research materials between member countries; greater dissemination of information<br />
through more efficient utilisation of existing information services; and the </p>
<p>~ gt -hening of programmes of specialist training using existing institutions within<br />
reg ion.-They agreed that in order to provide a central focus for the various<br />
tivities proposed a Consultative Group on Agricuiture should be established and<br />
iccepted the offer of Sri Lanka to act as convener of the Group.<br />
Illicit Drugs<br />
Heads of Government complimented the Working Group on Illicit Drugs whose work<br />
had contributed to the awareness of the problems associated with drug trafticking and<br />
the nced for co-operation amnong Commonwealth and other countries in the region. Its<br />
deliberations had demonstrated that the problem of illicit drugs constituted a threat<br />
to the security, stability and social order of a nation. They endorsed the<br />
recommendation of the Working Group that since the Group had fulfilled its mandate it<br />
should only meet in the future at the request of member countries as and when the need<br />
arose. IMaritime Issues<br />
46. Heads of Government recognised the critical importance of maritime issues to<br />
all members of the region. They noted, in particular, the complexity, diversity and<br />
interrelated nature of these matters which were of both political and economic<br />
significance to governments. They welcomed the suggestion of the Secretary-General<br />
that potential exists for co-operation among member governments in this area and<br />
expressed appreciation for the specific proposal of the Government of Australia for<br />
the commissioning of a report on such co-operation. Heads of Government therefore<br />
asked the Secretary -General after further consultations with governments as<br />
appropriate, to convene a small group. of experts from multidisciplinary backgrounds to<br />
prepare a report to be available as early as possible. Ihis report should assess what<br />
activity is already being carried out on a regional, multilateral and bilateral basis<br />
and should identify possible new areas which might be taken up and whether scope<br />
exists for complementing existing programmes.<br />
Human Resources<br />
47. Heads of Government recognised that shortages of trained manpower constituted a<br />
major constraint on development, particularly in the small island countries. Gaps in<br />
the availability of human resources existed in a wide range of technical and<br />
professional fields throughout the region and Heads of Government acknowledged that<br />
considerable scope existed for additional training facilities and programmes. They<br />
agreed that each of the Consul tat ive / Working Groups should give greater emphasis to<br />
the development of skills through training programmes and specialist attachments,<br />
making maximum use of existing institutions wherever relevant.<br />
Employment/ Labour<br />
48. Heads of Government welcomed the outcome of the First Meeting of Commonwealth<br />
Ministers of Employment / Labour, held in Geneva on I June 1982, which had been arranged<br />
in response to the request by Commonwealth Heads of Government at their Meeting in<br />
Melbourne in October 1981. They expressed the view that greater Commonwealth<br />
co-operation on important employment and labour issues, including education and<br />
training and manpower development, was desirable and looked forward to receiving<br />
specific proposals from the 1983 meeting of Employment/ Labour Ministers.<br />
Funding 49. Heads ' of Government, recognising that the work of the Consul tat ive / Working<br />
Groups had entered a more action-oriented phase, took -the view that regional<br />
functional co-operation required a firmer basis for mobilising regional financial </p>
<p>, ources. They agreed that additional earmarked contributions from member countries,<br />
a a voluntary basis, should, through a special account within the CFTC, be used to<br />
finance activities undertaken at the request of the Groups on Trade, Energy, Industry<br />
and Agriculture and to meet the costs of the new Study Group on Maritime Issues. The<br />
CFTC, in pursuance of its normal activities in the region would continue to respond to<br />
requests for assistance from individual member governments and regional institutions.<br />
They expressed the hope that these financial resources would be supplemented from<br />
other international sources including the United Nations development system.<br />
Appreciation and Next Meeting<br />
Heads of Government welcomed with great pleasure the opportunity of their<br />
meeting in Suva and expressed their appreciation of the excellent arrangements made<br />
for the Meeting and the warm and friendly hospitality of the Government and people of<br />
Fiji. They accepted with pleasure the invitation of the Government of Papua New<br />
Guinea to hold their next Meeting there in about two years. </p>
