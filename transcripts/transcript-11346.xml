    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..........................................................................................</p>
<p>Well thank you very much Ian. To the Mayor of Longreach, Joan Maloney,</p>
<p> to Vaughan Johnson, to my many parliamentary colleagues who are here</p>
<p> today and members of the National Farmers' Federation, ladies</p>
<p> and gentlemen.</p>
<p>This is the first occasion, I think, in history that the Federal Cabinet</p>
<p> has met at Longreach. It is also, as you said, the 20th</p>
<p> anniversary gathering of the National Farmers' Federation and</p>
<p> it is also 25 years ago today that I was elected in the middle of</p>
<p> the three year term of the Whitlam Government to Federal Parliament</p>
<p> as the member for Bennelong.</p>
<p>I want to say how pleased I am as part of a programme since we were</p>
<p> elected of taking Cabinet around the country and out of the larger</p>
<p> population centres, how pleased I am that we are having this meeting</p>
<p> in Longreach and that it coincides with the National Farmers'</p>
<p> Federation special 20th anniversary gathering. The Party</p>
<p> I lead, the Coalition Government I lead has had a long association</p>
<p> with the National Farmers' Federation and its predecessor organisations.</p>
<p> And as I look around the room I am reminded of the many discussions</p>
<p> we have had on very important issues. And your organisation has been</p>
<p> an outstandingly clear and loud voice for the interests of farmers</p>
<p> all around Australia.</p>
<p>And as I look back over the last 20 years I can recall that the National</p>
<p> Farmers' Federation has been in the forefront of arguing for</p>
<p> necessary change and reform. The National Farmers' Federation</p>
<p> was one of the first organisations at a national level to articulate</p>
<p> the need for a floating exchange rate. And to argue the cause that</p>
<p> attempts to regulate the value of the Australian dollar in an increasingly</p>
<p> globalised world market were doomed to failure. And, of course, I</p>
<p> am very conscious of the great campaign that the National Farmers'</p>
<p> Federation waged in favour of industrial relations reform. Something</p>
<p> that has been very close to my heart most of the time that I have</p>
<p> been in Parliament and one of the most fundamental reforms that this</p>
<p> country has needed to embrace over the years if we are to become a</p>
<p> more competitive nation and a more effective player on the world stage.</p>
<p>I am very conscious as I address this gathering of something of a</p>
<p> paradox in the Australian economy. On the one hand, the general economic</p>
<p> conditions in our country are better now than they have been at any</p>
<p> time since the late 1960s. We grew stronger last year than any country</p>
<p> in the industrialised world. We have low inflation, low interest rates,</p>
<p> in fact, the lowest for more than 30 years, we have high levels of</p>
<p> business investment, we have turned a budget deficit of $10.5 billion</p>
<p> into a strong surplus, we are repaying debt. And if indeed we can</p>
<p> implement all of our commitments out of the last election then we</p>
<p> can by the year 2003 be completely free of any Commonwealth Government</p>
<p> debt. And we can in effect begin the next century, the third millennium,</p>
<p> as essentially a debt free nation.</p>
<p>That is the general situation but I am also deeply conscious that</p>
<p> in many parts of rural Australia the scene is starkly different. There</p>
<p> are still areas of massive economic and social difficulty. There are</p>
<p> still many communities which are steadily losing services, there are</p>
<p> many parts of rural Australia where the population drift either to</p>
<p> larger regional centres or to the cities goes on unabated. I am also</p>
<p> most conscious that Australian farmers on world markets are still</p>
<p> being severely disadvantaged by the corrupt trading practices of many</p>
<p> of the major players. And I know how important the upcoming discussions</p>
<p> at a world trade organisation level are to the future of Australian</p>
<p> agriculture and Australian farmers. So as I address you, of course</p>
<p> I talk of the strong national economic conditions but I do recognise</p>
<p> that those strong economic conditions nationally are not universally</p>
<p> shared and are certainly not shared in areas of the Australian bush.</p>
<p> And that we have sought in a sensitive and intelligent way to address</p>
<p> many of those areas of particular disadvantage.</p>
<p>You will be aware that in our first term out of the proceeds of the</p>
<p> privatisation of 30 per cent of Telstra we were able to fund a natural</p>
<p> heritage trust and many of the programmes funded out of the natural</p>
<p> heritage trust are of particular benefit to rural and regional Australia.</p>
<p> You will be pleased to know, of course, that in the recent Federal</p>
<p> Budget we committed $31.8 million over five years to rehabilitate</p>
<p> elements of the great Artesian Basin. And I am delighted to say that</p>
<p> a little way from here in Longreach later today my wife will be capping,</p>
<p> as it is, capping the first bore as part of that programme which over</p>
<p> a period of five years will provide very important support and very</p>
<p> important repair to something that is of tremendous importance and</p>
<p> significance to rural Australia.</p>
<p>Two years ago John Anderson and I announced the $515 million AAA programme</p>
<p> to boost farm businesses provide a new start for many and aid planning</p>
<p> for the future. Out of the most recent budget we have begun to address</p>
<p> what I know and accept and recognise and will continue with my Health</p>
<p> Minister to try and remedy and that is the legitimate complaint of</p>
<p> people in rural Australia about the inadequate number of rural general</p>
<p> practitioners. And we're investing $43.1 million this financial</p>
<p> year for rural GP retention grants. We are going to establish 30 regional</p>
<p> health service centres and we are also going to put over $50 million</p>
<p> into creating more rural apprenticeships and we hope to create up</p>
<p> to 30,000 more of those in rural and regional areas. And if we can</p>
<p> secure through the Senate approval for the sale of another 16 per</p>
<p> cent of Telstra to take it up to just under 50 per cent privatisation</p>
<p> we hope to establish out of that second tranche of the sale of Telstra</p>
<p> 500 rural transaction centres which are designed to address the deficiency</p>
<p> of services in many parts of rural and regional Australia.</p>
<p>But, ladies and gentlemen, these are particular issues which are designed</p>
<p> to attack areas of special disadvantage and areas where people have</p>
<p> a right to expect, indeed a right to demand, the maintenance and the</p>
<p> provision of adequate basic services.</p>
<p>I can't, of course, address this gathering and open this conference</p>
<p> today without saying something about the issue of taxation reform.</p>
<p> Last year the National Farmers' Federation gave very strong and</p>
<p> effective support to the Government's policy to reform the Australian</p>
<p> taxation system. You will be aware that we took a detailed policy</p>
<p> to the last election. We didn't fudge anything, we didn't</p>
<p> obfuscate, we didn't hide anything, we didn't deceive about</p>
<p> anything, we put all of it on the table. And in a manner unparalleled</p>
<p> in the experience of any other government since Federation we explained</p>
<p> in great detail what we intended to do with the Australian taxation</p>
<p> system if we were returned to Government. We said that we would sweep</p>
<p> away all the existing indirect taxes such as the wholesales sales</p>
<p> tax and many of those inefficient State taxes, financial institutions</p>
<p> duties, stamp duty on share transfers and other transactions. That</p>
<p> we would get rid of all of those and replace that with a single rate</p>
<p> broad-based indirect tax, a goods and services tax which would be</p>
<p> fully rebatable in relation to business expenses. We also proposed</p>
<p> major initiatives to reduce the cost of fuel. A very critical item</p>
<p> in the operating costs of people on the land in this very vast country</p>
<p> of ours.</p>
<p>Our reforms if they are implemented will reduce general business costs</p>
<p> in Australia by $10.5 billion a year. They will reduce export costs</p>
<p> by $4.5 billion, they will reduce fuel costs by $3.5 billion, they</p>
<p> involve personal income tax cuts of $13 billion and very importantly</p>
<p> they will underwrite for the first time through a growth tax the financial</p>
<p> position of the Australian States.</p>
<p>Now, the Senate was meant in the federation compact to be a States</p>
<p> house. You will all know that the federation compact represented a</p>
<p> compromise between single member constituencies in the House of Representatives</p>
<p> where the predominance would inevitably be held by people elected</p>
<p> from the major population centres of Australia, that is the major</p>
<p> cities such as Sydney and Melbourne. The compromise was that you would</p>
<p> have a Senate with equal representation from the States, the idea</p>
<p> being that the Senate would look to the interest of the States. Over</p>
<p> the years, of course, that has become a joke. The Senate is no longer</p>
<p> a States house, the Senate is even more politicised and even more</p>
<p> partisan in its political poses than in fact the House of Representatives.</p>
<p> Because if the Senate were now a States house the Senate would be</p>
<p> rushing to pass our taxation legislation because the States will benefit</p>
<p> enormously from our taxation reform.</p>
<p>Under our taxation reform after the transitional period, the States</p>
<p> of Australia will be significantly better off and that is why, at</p>
<p> the special Premiers' conference meeting a few weeks ago, all of the</p>
<p> States of Australia were very happy through their Premiers to sign</p>
<p> the agreement carving up the proceeds of the GST, every last dollar</p>
<p> of the GST will go to the states. Every Premier, Beattie, Peter Beattie</p>
<p> or Jeff Kennett, irrespective of their politics they were all very</p>
<p> happy to sign on the dotted line. And so they should be. And instead</p>
<p> of having another Premiers' conference the Premiers should be</p>
<p> convening conferences of Senators from their various States, irrespective</p>
<p> of their party allegiance and telling those people that they ought</p>
<p> to be supporting the Government's taxation package. Because if</p>
<p> this package goes down the best opportunity we have had since World</p>
<p> War II to reform Commonwealth / State financial relations will have</p>
<p> been lost.</p>
<p>I have been involved in probably a dozen or more Premiers' conferences</p>
<p> in the twenty five years that I have been in Parliament. Few of them</p>
<p> have been satisfactory. They are normally forums for grandstanding</p>
<p> by Premiers, attacking Prime Ministers, irrespective of the political</p>
<p> stripe of either. It happened when Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister</p>
<p> and I was Treasurer. When a Premier from this State, I think his name</p>
<p> was Joh Bjelke-Peterson, used to come along and used to attack us.</p>
<p> I can remember Charlie Court doing exactly the same thing, I can remember</p>
<p> Neville Wran doing it. The script is almost the same, only the names</p>
<p> of the players were altered. And it used to go on year after year.</p>
<p>Now, the last Premiers' Conference we had there was a difference.</p>
<p> And the difference that was, ladies and gentlemen, that every person</p>
<p> participating in that conference knew that we were making a bit of</p>
<p> history. That we were changing the methodology. We were ending the</p>
<p> annual farce of the Premiers' Conference. We were getting rid</p>
<p> of this forum where people played games rather than made serious decisions</p>
<p> about the national interest. And if that opportunity is lost, and</p>
<p> it will be because if this package does not go through, we will go</p>
<p> back to the old nonsense of Peter Beattie, or Bob Carr or Jeff Kennett</p>
<p> doing his doorstop as they walk in and saying, you know, we want more</p>
<p> money otherwise we will have to sack teachers and police and nurses</p>
<p> and we on the other hand will be forced to respond to that and the</p>
<p> Australian peoples estimation and the Australian peoples esteem for</p>
<p> the political processes of this country will go down further.</p>
<p>We have come a long way in this country over the last few years. There</p>
<p> have been reforms undertaken on both sides of politics over the last</p>
<p> few years that have been to the benefit of this country. And over</p>
<p> the last three years because of the way we got the budget back into</p>
<p> order, because of our willingness to tackle industrial relations reform,</p>
<p> because of our willingness to undertake all sorts of other reforms,</p>
<p> we have delivered the Australian economy in general terms to a position</p>
<p> of strength none of us thought possible when we came to office a little</p>
<p> over three years ago. And we did it because we didn't play games</p>
<p> with the country's future. But what we are witnessing at the</p>
<p> moment in relation to taxation is game playing. Everybody who has</p>
<p> had any serious association with politics and public policy in this</p>
<p> nation over the last twenty years knows that we have got to reform</p>
<p> our taxation system. My predecessor, Paul Keating, knew it in the</p>
<p> middle 1980s and he campaigned passionately for it until the rug was</p>
<p> pulled under his feat by his then Prime Minister. Bob Hawke knew it</p>
<p> because he supported Keating's original campaign. Kim Beazley</p>
<p> knows it because he was one of the strongest advocates of option C</p>
<p> when the Cabinet discussed the matter in 1985. Privately, Labor people</p>
<p> will agree with you that taxation reform is necessary. Everybody knows</p>
<p> we can't go on forever with this system, but what are we witnessing</p>
<p> at the moment? We are witnessing game playing. People are fiddling</p>
<p> around with partisan politics while the national interest is being</p>
<p> sacrificed. We are strong at the moment because of reforms we took</p>
<p> earlier. We will be strong in the future because of reforms we take</p>
<p> now. The idea that a country can sit still and automatically reap</p>
<p> the benefit of past reform forever is wrong.</p>
<p>When I became Prime Minister of this country in 1996 I felt Australia</p>
<p> was the anxious outsider in the Asian Pacific region, knocking on</p>
<p> the door seeking admission. In reality over the last three years,</p>
<p> that has all changed. We are seen with new respect and afforded a</p>
<p> new dignity in our region because we have performed well. And we haven't</p>
<p> played games. And those who are frustrating what the people voted</p>
<p> for in October of last year are fiddling and playing with Australia's</p>
<p> economic future and are not looking to the national interest.</p>
<p>Can I go to something that is of very direction interest to you and</p>
<p> that is the question of the place of the commitments we made concerning</p>
<p> fuel in the tax package. We are having some discussions with the Australian</p>
<p> Democrats on Thursday and I want to make it perfectly clear to you</p>
<p> that we are not going to trade away the commitments we have given</p>
<p> to the farm sector. We remain strongly committed to ensuring that</p>
<p> the farm sector is significantly advantaged out of any taxation reform.</p>
<p> And as far as we are concerned the entitlements of the Australian</p>
<p> farm community are not negotiable and you have a perfect right to</p>
<p> expect that we will stand by the commitments we have made. And I want</p>
<p> the Australian people to understand that, I want the people that you</p>
<p> represent to understand that.</p>
<p>We are not in the business of trading away the relative advantages</p>
<p> that you have got out of the taxation package. We will be talking</p>
<p> to the Australian Democrats to see if there is any proper basis for</p>
<p> an agreement consistent with the things that we regard as important.</p>
<p> But people should not make assumptions about automatic compromises</p>
<p> just because a meeting is taking place between myself, the Treasurer</p>
<p> and the Leader of the Australian Democrats.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, can I just say one or two other things about</p>
<p> the importance of international trade before I formally open this</p>
<p> conference and wish you well in your deliberations. All of your know,</p>
<p> I don't think there is a group of people in Australia who are</p>
<p> more conscious, of the importance of winning greater access to world</p>
<p> markets than are Australian farmers. And can I, at this conference,</p>
<p> pay an absolutely genuine and heart felt tribute to the work of Tim</p>
<p> Fischer as Deputy Prime Minister, Leader of the National Party and</p>
<p> as Trade Minister for Australia over the last three years. I could</p>
<p> not have a had a better Deputy. This country could not have had a</p>
<p> better Trade Minister and the National Party could not have had a</p>
<p> finer leader than Tim Fischer. He has fought for the interests of</p>
<p> Australian farmers. He is respected overseas in a way that I find</p>
<p> constantly impressive in the discussions I have with world leaders.</p>
<p> Today, as I speak, he is in Beijing, talking directly to the Chinese</p>
<p> Government about negotiations for the admission to China to the World</p>
<p> Trade Organisation. He has spent large parts of the last three years</p>
<p> vigorously and successfully promoting the interests of Australia abroad.</p>
<p> And as a result of his interest we have won access to world markets</p>
<p> that we didn't think possible a few years ago.</p>
<p>A key challenge, of course, ahead of us will be to obtain agreement</p>
<p> to a further World Trade Organisation round at the World Trade Organisation</p>
<p> Ministerial Meeting later this year in Seattle. This, of course, as</p>
<p> past experience as taught us, will not be easy. Building momentum</p>
<p> for an ambitious mandate to the WTO agriculture negotiations and a</p>
<p> new World Trade Organisation round will be difficult. We want to work</p>
<p> very closely with the industry to prepare for these important negotiations.</p>
<p> We have appointed trade facilitators for agriculture and for processed</p>
<p> foods and beverages. And we have financially supported Graham Blight's</p>
<p> work as agricultural trade representative of the Australian farming</p>
<p> industry.</p>
<p>And today, I want to announce that the Federal Government will contribute</p>
<p> a further sum of a half a million dollars to ABARE to further promote</p>
<p> the dissemination amongst developing countries of the advantages of</p>
<p> trade liberalisation. And also to further promote the results of research</p>
<p> that we have carried out into trade barriers and trade blockages which</p>
<p> if removed will be of enormous advantage, not only to Australia, but</p>
<p> to other countries which are members of the Cairns Group.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, we continue to work very hard through the Cairns</p>
<p> Group and through APEC to achieve our goals. And there will be a meeting</p>
<p> of the Cairns Groups of countries on the 27th and 28th</p>
<p> of August in order to prepare for the Ministerial Meeting which will</p>
<p> take place in Seattle.</p>
<p>As Prime Minister, I will go to the APEC meeting which this year is</p>
<p> being held in New Zealand in September and we will maintain at that</p>
<p> APEC meeting the strongest possible push towards the momentum that</p>
<p> was originally behind the formation of APEC and the goal of achieving</p>
<p> within the region free trade by the year 2010 for developed countries</p>
<p> and the year 2020 for developing countries.</p>
<p>Can I conclude, Mr President, by congratulating the National Farmers'</p>
<p> Federation on twenty years of representing the rural community of</p>
<p> Australia. Can I, on behalf of the Coalition Government, thank you</p>
<p> for the very constructive relationship that we have developed over</p>
<p> the last three years. Can I take the opportunity in this forum of</p>
<p> particularly thanking my three Ministers who have interacted so much</p>
<p> with the farming community during that period of time, Tim Fischer,</p>
<p> John Anderson and Mark Vaile. Of course, many others such as Richard</p>
<p> Alston in the area of communications and of course Peter Reith in</p>
<p> the area of industrial relations and as always, because of the importance</p>
<p> of the health of the economy generally, Peter Costello as Treasurer.</p>
<p>But I want to pay a particular tribute to the three Ministers whose</p>
<p> more constant responsibility is to interact with the rural sector</p>
<p> and to thank them for the work they have done.</p>
<p>I declare this conference open, I thank the National Farmers'</p>
<p> Federation for the work it does for Australia and I wish it and all</p>
<p> its members and supporter organisations a very successful next twenty</p>
<p> years.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
