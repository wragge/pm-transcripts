    <content><![CDATA[<p>Archbishop Mannix, as I met him and knew him, was a most remarkable man. He had great intellectual power, marked courage, and a power of persuasive speech which I have never known surpassed. He had become a dignified and almost legendary figure, not only in his own community, but among the people generally.</p>
<p>He will be greatly missed, and his memory will be deeply respected.</p>
