TRANSCR~ IPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P. J. KEATING MP,<br />
DOORSTOP, BORDER CONTROL FACILITY, VIENTIANE,<br />
WEDNESDAY, 6 APRIL 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: My first comment would be to say that I have had a very warm<br />
reception here in, Laos, very good meefings with the Prime<br />
Minister and the President. I think they appreciate very much the<br />
tangible manifestation of Australia's friendship with Laos in the<br />
building of this bridge which will change the commerce of this<br />
country by allowing traffic from Thailand for the first time ever.<br />
This Border Control Facility we are standing in now is set up<br />
really for the next thirty or forty years of traffic of people between<br />
these two countries, This is a matter of great significance to thorn<br />
and, of course, not only were jobs created here in Laos, but many<br />
Australian jobs were created in providing the materials for these<br />
particular construction projects and the design work which went<br />
with thern.<br />
Australians are very Interested in the area, they are very<br />
interested In the Asia Pacific, they do want to see Australia<br />
projecting Itself and engaging Itself with the area. I can think of<br />
no better example of that than this that is, a change of material<br />
substance to two nations brought about by Australia's financial<br />
assistance and technical capacity. I thnk this will open the way<br />
for our many major companies in this country for Instance. the<br />
, likes of CRA the gold miner Normandy Poseidon, T eistra which<br />
is our major telecommunications carrier operating here and many<br />
other companies as well, and our construction companies, of<br />
course, who have built these facilities.<br />
So, in a sense, the civil work~ s are a pipe opener to even greater<br />
things in commerce which we can do together and these things<br />
auger well for our relationships in this part of South East Asia.<br />

J: Mr Keating, did you seek or did you gain any assurance from the<br />
Lao authorities that the buidge would be able to operate efficiently<br />
and that it would start carrying treffic soon after it opens?<br />
PM:. That assurance is completely clear. That is, there is no way that<br />
these facilities are going to be built and not in any way used to<br />
their maximum capacity. I had very good talks with the<br />
Government and with the Prime Minister and he told me that the<br />
priorities for development is this country were firstly, for human<br />
development, education, health, social security and then In areas<br />
where the country has a oomparative advantage in hydro<br />
electricity, in agriculture, and in these areas he said that national<br />
policy was being focused and he mentioned most particularly<br />
protection of the environment. The Government here is very<br />
conscious of the natural heritage of Laos and they want to keep<br />
that heritage while developing the country. I was very heartened<br />
to hear this and as part of out aid program we have provided $ 1<br />
million which can be devoted to an environmental protection<br />
strategy which may assist the Government of Laos in developing<br />
the country, but doing it in a way which is harmonious with the<br />
environment.<br />
J, Aid has been the primary feature of Australia's relationship with<br />
Laos to date, how quickly do you think that that will be reweighted<br />
in favour of trade over time?<br />
PM: I think it will be reweighted first In favour of investment and then<br />
latter in favour of trade. Trade between us is growing, but in<br />
absolute terms it is not great, but the Investment is going to pick<br />
up quite sharply because Laos has attracted a clutch of the best<br />
of Australian companies. That is, the financially strongest,<br />
technically able and, I think thW given the prospectivity In<br />
minerals, the prospects in agriculture, the Interest the<br />
Government has in developing hydro electricity, civil engineering,<br />
road and other constructions, all of these things, I think, lend<br />
themselves to Australian companies and these projects are a<br />
demonstration of what Australia can do. So, I think, there is<br />
going to be probably quite substantial investment by Australia in<br />
. Laos and what will follow that will be trade.<br />
J: This investment message is similar to that you were putting in<br />
China last year. Are Australian companies moving quickly<br />
enough?<br />
PM: I think so. In China we have got nearly one thousand companies<br />
operating and here we are seeing over fifty companies already,<br />
but as I said, they happen to be somne of the strongest that we<br />
have. They are not just any companies, but some of our<br />
strongest companies. When one looks at the tremendous<br />

development possibilities here and you can start to see,<br />
particularly some of the Thai financial institutions in the city,<br />
some of the buildings which have been built on the highway out<br />
to te bridge, it is not going to take very long before you start to<br />
see this economy tick over and it will require fir3t: and foremast<br />
primary infrastructure which we are very much In the position of<br />
supplying.<br />
J: Do you think ordinary Australians realise the extent to which<br />
Australia is now involved in South East Asia?<br />
PM: I would like to think that Australians are both not just pleased to<br />
be involved in South East Asia for their economic long-run<br />
benefits and prosperity, but proud to be as well. That is, to be<br />
engaged with the region as wo have never been engaged before<br />
because all of these things are laying the foundations for the 21 st<br />
century Australia. The one that will have a much closer<br />
engagement with Asia, whose economic fortunes will be<br />
interwoven with Asia. I think ali of this means, this is a pro-cursor<br />
to growth and jobs in Australia. That is, if we want long-term<br />
increments to wealth and employment, exports and trade in<br />
services are going to be part of that story and this is the place to<br />
be selling it.<br />
J: Did you make any specific representations to the Lao<br />
Governiment about the need for human rights and greater<br />
democratisation?<br />
PM: one question I did raise with them was the q~ uestion of North<br />
Koreg and the Laotian Government has very good relationi with<br />
' 4orth Korea and I pointed out the futility of North Korean attitudes<br />
in terms of the International reaction to thorn and how the<br />
Government of L8os May encourage the government of North<br />
Korea in the kind of developments which we have seen here. I<br />
had an encouraging response from the Prime Minister also<br />
saying that, of course, matters have got to be resolved by Cooperation,<br />
by discussion and amicably, but he did echo the<br />
concerns which I had expressed and agreed in my view that the<br />
kind of development which North Korea ought to be able to take<br />
is precisely what we are seeing here.<br />
