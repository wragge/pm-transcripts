SOUTH AUSTRALIAN CHAMBER OF MANUFACTURES<br />
ANA. iA'j DINNER AT ADELAIDE _ JRDOCTBER,,_ 196LÃ±<br />
S-oeech by the Prime inister the Et.__ Hon. SirRnbert Menzies<br />
Sir Mr. Premier ( I never go in for any of these fa!-lals I<br />
jus say " Sir, Mr. Premier....<br />
I wondered wihen I came here in wi-at guise I was to<br />
speak to you I had no idea that I was a species of -uestlecturer.<br />
I thought that I'd probably be able to reply to a<br />
few friendly insults in answering some toast, and sure enoug<br />
up pops my old friend, Tom Playford if I may refer to him<br />
in such familiar terms to you wh. o know him so little. ( Laughter)<br />
I think on the whole it would have been better, Sir, if I had<br />
said " No, I couldn't come" because Tom Playford has over the<br />
trifling period of years for which I have been Prime Minister<br />
( a fraction of the substantial period of years in which he has<br />
been Premier). occasionally given me some good advice. Sometimes<br />
he doesn't bother to advise me; he just says, " This is what<br />
I want", and when I say then well... I needn't complete<br />
the sentence. ( Laughter3<br />
But I remember years ago he said to me, " You know,<br />
old man no fellow in our game ever got into trouble for what<br />
he didn't say." Now this may seem to you a bit of mere<br />
flippancy, but of course, it's profoundly true. It's like the<br />
old proverb, you know, about the wise old owl who sat on an<br />
oak the more he heard the less he spoke; the less he spoke<br />
the more he lieard; why can't some folks be like that bird?<br />
Do you remember that? That put into four lines what he put<br />
into a single sentence with me, He said, " Never forget: You<br />
never get into trouble for what you don't say." Oh well, I think<br />
there's a good deal of truth in that, though in my experience<br />
what you don't say is frequently reported. ( Laughter)<br />
Now, if you don't mind I would like to make another<br />
preliminary observation. I was taken this afternoon to the<br />
Adelaide Cricket Ground, where I found myself looking at a<br />
fuotball match, of sorts. ( Laughter) I decided that I was a<br />
suppo'ter of South ( Cheers) now wait a moment. I decided<br />
before the match began and for a very elementary reason.<br />
They had the same colours as Carlton in Melbourne, who have<br />
had a singularly unsuccessful season,<br />
One of the things that was pointed out to me by the<br />
Lord Mayor was a clock face wonderful, superb; there it is<br />
handsome, controlled by electric power and this would tell<br />
you at any given moment how long was to go before the quarter<br />
ended, all time off being allowed for. A brilliant piece of<br />
mechanism, the electric power no doubt being supplied under the<br />
authority of the Premier. ( Laughter) And just after half time,<br />
the power was cut off and I thought to myself, " Now what s Tom<br />
up to now?" ( Laughter) I wouldn't put it past him to have it<br />
deliberately cut off end then send me a little note to say, " tIe<br />
can't afford to keep it on all the time. Don't forget there's<br />
a Loan Council meeting coming up. You have to watch this chap,<br />
you know." I have been watching him in an imperfect way for<br />
a long time. And then, of course, he confirmed this, I thought,<br />
tonight, because he was referring to electric power and he gave<br />
you a broad hint, a somewhat indiscreet one I thought, that by<br />
about March or before March you might expect a reduction in the<br />
charges. Then, I suppose, 1he fellows who run the clock would<br />
be able to keep it going for all four quarters during the game. / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
This is a mere broad hint. You are so accustomed to looking<br />
at him as if he were an unsophisticated character I'm not.<br />
And the moment he said, " You might expect a little reduction<br />
by March," I thought, " By Jove, I'll have to go back on Monday<br />
and tell Harold Holt what to expect in the next Loan Council<br />
Meeting." ( Laughter)<br />
But, Sir, that's all as it may be. The truth is<br />
that contrary to all these rumours both Sir Thomas Playford<br />
and I can talk with a very good will about the development of<br />
secondary industry in this State because he in a great way,<br />
and I in my own fashion, have had something to do wlch it, going<br />
back over a long period of yearso<br />
He has been a great champion of this State. I never<br />
make any secret of my view that this State would be lucky if<br />
it ever had another Premier like him for galloping on behalf<br />
of this State. ( Applause) Mind you, he's tiresome occasionally<br />
yes, difficult occasionally, but always either tiresome<br />
or difficult or enthusiastic or demanding, not on his own<br />
behalf but oi behalf of this State of South Australia, and<br />
that is something I can admire and always will.<br />
And indeed, of course, one of the things that you<br />
must remamber on all these matters is that no Commonwealth<br />
Government, though it has major responsibilities in this fie'd,<br />
no Commonwealth Government by itself can complete a full<br />
improvement in industrial development. It must have in the<br />
various States governments with imagination and the willingness<br />
to do things that the States can do and that the Commonwealth<br />
cannot do. Our main job in life, a job which everybody knows<br />
we peiform indifferently, is to create an economic climate,<br />
to pursue economic policies that will be sound Ãµ to pioduce,<br />
so far as we can by cur policies though there are some<br />
things that we cannot control a state of affairs in which<br />
there is a reasonable stability in the price level, a reasonable<br />
stability in the value of money, and at the same time a feeling<br />
of confidence outside Australia in our future. Now these are<br />
-reat tasks, and we have to do our best in the Parliament of<br />
the nation and in the Government of the nation to perform them,<br />
-nd on the whole, looking back on it over the last fifteen<br />
years, I would venture to hope not too badly, when I look back<br />
on what has happened during that time,<br />
But what I really want to say a little to you about<br />
is this. The longer I live, the longer I hold my present<br />
responsibilities, the more I am struck by the fact that the<br />
day is fast disappearing in which wie ought to divide ourselves<br />
as if inevitably into groups, de want this we want this<br />
we want this it's quite true, I am not objecting to<br />
organisations. I am all in favour of them. But if there is<br />
one thing that is quite clear today, it is that what we need<br />
is a full sense of our interdependence in this country. In<br />
the words of the apostle Paul, " We are all members, one of<br />
another." Now this is profoundly true.<br />
I have said before and it will stand repeating, that<br />
I have lived long enough to remember the days when political<br />
controversy in Australia was between the protectionists and<br />
the free-traders, I suppose there are some free-traders left<br />
in Australia, but not too many, not too many. The day has<br />
gone when it was said that there was an inevitable conflict<br />
between the manufacturer and the man on the land. Increasingly s / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
it is understood that there is no such conflict, that the man<br />
on the land achieves enormous advantages from developed<br />
manufacturing industry, and that manufacturing industry derives<br />
tremendous advantages for a variety of reasons, one of which<br />
is, to put it quite plainly that the great exports of primary<br />
commodities from Australia to the rest of the world provide<br />
every year hundreds of millions of money for imports by manufacturers<br />
of raw materials and of plant. Don't forget that.<br />
There is a tremendous community of interest.<br />
It is a very interesting thing to reflect that the<br />
greatest importers . n Australia are the manufacturers, as you<br />
all know. The greatest exporters are the primary industries,<br />
Under the pressure of events and with some enccuragement, the<br />
secondary industries are now becoming, as Mr. Allison reminded<br />
us, very substantial exporters, and when the day comes that we<br />
are exporting the products of our factories, and why not, to<br />
a world that is opening up before us, and we are doing that to<br />
the same extent as we are exporting wool and wheat and dairy<br />
and products and meat and what-have you, that will be the day<br />
in which we can say that Australia has a conspicuous example in<br />
itself of the balanced economy, which is the best kind of<br />
economy to survive the shocks of economic variation. And therefore<br />
this is a case of interdependenceo<br />
But it goes beyond that. Interdependence all along<br />
the line, I suppose this old nonsense that used to be talked<br />
about the inevitable conflict between the employer and the<br />
employee tends to disappear. I acknowledge with great pleasure<br />
the remarkable record of South Australia in this field. but the<br />
job is noc yeti completeo Tilere nre still people who appcer to<br />
think that the solvency and success and pr'ofit-making capacity<br />
of the employer has nothing to do with his employee, o0 with the<br />
future of his employee, or the welfare of his employee, the truth<br />
being, of course that each is dependent on the other. They b3ve<br />
a common interesk, It would shock some of biie old-fashioned<br />
warriors in this field, wouldn't it,, to be told that all their<br />
interests are in common and yet they are.<br />
There is another aspect of this matter. You know, I<br />
have a very great respect for economists because they're quite<br />
numerous and give them enough chance and they cancel out, and<br />
therefore I like them. By the time I have measured one against<br />
the other, and the other against one, I find I am at complete<br />
liberty to apply my own judgment and I like this very much.<br />
But they will keep on, won't they, Tom, talking about " expenditure<br />
in the public sector" and " expenditure in the private sector,"<br />
And some of you gentlemen here tonight have pursued them no doubt<br />
into those tortuous paths, when you look at a budget. You look<br />
at it and you say, " Look at the way the public expenditure, the<br />
expenditure in the public sector is increasing; that is a great<br />
mistake. They ought to cut that down by a couple of hundred<br />
millions and have more expenditure in the private sector."<br />
Now just let's have a look at that,<br />
What is this expenditure in the public sector? The<br />
Premier of South Australia is in course of spending a great deal<br />
of money, with which we have something to do, in constructing<br />
the Chowilla Dam. Why? WJhy are these steps being taken with<br />
the expenditure in the public sector, mind you, to create this<br />
doubling, I suppose, of the water supply of South Australia,<br />
water being the greatest non-indigenous commodity that this<br />
State needs. Nowr why is that being done? In order to have the<br />
water laid on at the public offices? Don't be silly. In order<br />
to give this State and the industries of this State an opportunity<br />
* 0 </p>
<p>sometimes without much advantage to anybody finds its way into<br />
the stock exchange, but mostly finds its way into capital<br />
investment in Australia. And some of us are more nervous about<br />
this than others, but I don't think that when we come to reflect<br />
on it we'll have much real difference among us.<br />
Every time a million pounds comes in, or ten, or<br />
twenty, or a hundred or, as in recent years, two hundred, for<br />
investment in an enterprise, say of this kind that we are in<br />
( and it's not the only one by a long chalk) every time that<br />
happens, something is created in Australia an industry, a<br />
section of an industry; something is added to Australia<br />
experience know-how, special skills, special techniques. These<br />
are part at once of our national assets, and a few thousand<br />
Australians get employment of a highly stable kind. Is this<br />
a bad thing for Australia? I don't believe that it is.<br />
I admit, Sir, that I would be much happier if all<br />
the people who came into Australia were willing to admit<br />
Australians to some share in the equity in the business, some<br />
share in the management of the business. This is sometimes done,<br />
it is sometimes not done, but we haven't yet reached the point<br />
of time at which we can frown at a movement of investment in<br />
Australia, because properly considered it is again an example<br />
of interdependence. I don't imagine that Chryslers, I don't imagine<br />
that General-Motors, I don't imagine that Fords, or the<br />
International Harvester family, whoever it may be, lay out<br />
millions and scores of millions in Australia because they have<br />
an undying affection foi you or even for me. They lay their<br />
millions out in Australia because they feel that this is a<br />
country with a future, and that this is a country wheie there<br />
is sanity in government, and where there is a reasonable stability<br />
in currency and in monetary management. Don't let's overlook<br />
that. I don-t imagine that any country or any company would<br />
be anxious to throw its money into a whirlpool of inflation and<br />
instabilityo I don't believe it for a moment.<br />
Our great task, speaking now on behalf of the<br />
C. mmonwealth, has been to achieve as great a degree of stability<br />
as we could and at the same time encourage by national development<br />
the greatest degree of growth that we can, and that this has<br />
succeeded, I think is beyond controversy. And I hope, whoever<br />
is in the government, it will continue.<br />
I am not meaning that we want to live indefinitely<br />
in our balances of payments in our overseas reserves on private<br />
capital investment. I hope it goes on, I don't want to be<br />
entirely dependent on it, but we won't be entirely dependent<br />
on it. We have just come out of a year the past year, in which<br />
our record exports were achieved, in which our overseas balances<br />
rose to an enormous extent. There will be fluctuations of course,<br />
but we are in a very healthy position in our overseas funds, and<br />
at the same time, we are attracting the interest of investors,<br />
shrewd investors, experienced investors, industrial investors,<br />
from other countries, because they see in Australia a degree of<br />
good sense and stability and opportunities for the future that,<br />
quite frankly, they can't see in any other country in the<br />
world. a */ 6 j </p>
<p>6-<br />
And so? Sir, all I have to say can be summed<br />
up in this fashion. We ought to be jolly proud to be<br />
Australians, and we are. die ought to be jolly proud to<br />
live in a country which has established enormous records<br />
in our own time of growth, of expansion and of solidity.<br />
Wle ought Sir, to conduct ourselves that we will continue<br />
to be attractive in that sense to the rest of the w~ orld.<br />
And if we keep on doing that, and we keep on realising that<br />
we are not just a lot of fragments warring with each other,<br />
but that we have all our greatest interests in common, and<br />
that fundamentally we depend upon each other in tbio,<br />
country, then I believe that the future of Australia is<br />
completely assured, and indeed, will exceed anybodyts<br />
expe cta tions. And if that's not~ true. I will rise some day<br />
from my grave and shake my fist at all of you~ t </p>
