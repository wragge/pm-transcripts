PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT FROM PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS TO THE<br />
AUSTRAUAN TOURISM TASK FORCE LUNCHCON, SYDNEY, 11/ 6/ 93<br />
"... Australia does have great things about it and I think it's very important that we<br />
understand ourselves what we have and seek to protect it. John ( Brown) mentioned at the<br />
table the importance now of the environment In tourism, and people coming to Australia<br />
to ee something that they can't-we In any other part of the wodd... this is just about the<br />
oldest part of the world's crust, the flora and the fauna here are different to everywhere<br />
else in the world and people do come here to see SomethinS they can't see somewhere else<br />
and it's Important therefore that we protect a lot of these thinp.<br />
And I think that some of the things we did in the eighties, like preserving the wet tropics<br />
area of north Queensland has been an important draw to the north Queensland community,<br />
the work of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in preserving the Marine Park and<br />
undcestanding It better the reef ecosystem better Is important to us, the declarations<br />
of some of the wilderness areas of NSW and Tasmania have been important, the role of<br />
the States themselves let me pay tribute to Neville in the period he was Premier in<br />
declaring National Parks in NSW these things ar quite important and we have as a<br />
country taken opportunities to preserve the natural environment in many key places.<br />
We've not done as well with the built environment, and I think this lets a lot of people<br />
down and It Is one of the things we have to concentrate on over the period, but it is<br />
Important that places important to tourism are developed sensitively. Let me give you an<br />
example say with Cairns In Queensland. Cairns is a place which has not been developed<br />
sensitively. It's an important tourism place. There's no point in building 16 storey hotels in<br />
the middle of Cairns when the building next door is a two storey warehouse or one storey<br />
residential accommodation. You can double the footprint of these buildings and halve the<br />
height and keep them more of human scale than just letting the developers dominate these<br />
municipal or shire councils, or city councils trying to get their way.<br />
And I think It's Important to take stock of places like Cairns to say, look,, if this Is one of<br />
the attractions, let's keep It an attraction. If people come here to see it as a town in the<br />
Queensland tropics, let's keep like a town In the Queensland tropica and let's not devclop<br />

It as a Miamil Beacb or Suifers Paradise or somewhere, else. In that wonderful hinterland of<br />
Cairns across the river of that wonderful mountain and the mangroves, there is a<br />
development proposal there, and It may well bt that that development could procced but<br />
again, In those things, you're then playing wilh the actual attractions of the city Itself and<br />
you notice It. I'll eive you San example, you cross into Douglas shire in Queensland no<br />
building above tree height, the cnvironument and public access to the beaches and things<br />
have a premium on them and of course the development of the wet tropics area which Is<br />
within that shire all of those things go towards making a long term~ attracion for the<br />
tourism industry.<br />
I think the envirornent and the built environment beyond the capital cities amc very<br />
Important to us as are the services We provide In the capital cities themsclves. And in<br />
Sydney, which is of course the main port of entry for tourism, we tried to do things not<br />
only has the city Improved dramatically over the pust ten years and again let me pay<br />
tribute to Neville ( Wrmn) for developing a core in the City of Sydney, If you like, In these<br />
key places like Darling Harbour and the Macquaric Street area and down by the Quayside<br />
these are important things and T was very pleased to see John Fahey express<br />
interest a week or two ago In knocking over the Cahill Expressway and beautifying the<br />
wholo Quay-side area.<br />
We've just done, a deal with the Sydney City Councfl with Frank Sartor, where we've now,<br />
on a sixty year lease, eiven the City of Sydney the Customs House which we think will be<br />
the key civic building of the Quay-side and can provide, itself, an important contribution<br />
to Quay-side tourism and tourism of the city with so much of the maritime history which<br />
the Quay represents being Involved there. And of course the buildings near the Opera<br />
House which we've just signed an agreement with the City Council to see them sensitively<br />
developed with proper height limitations to pay due and appropriate deference to one of<br />
the world's greatest buildings, the Opera House, is again snother important thing in terms<br />
of Sydncy.<br />
As are things like the second runway which has taken so many years to bring to fruition<br />
and yet we're seeing substantial and rapid progress on seeing that second runway form<br />
Itself out there In the bay ind seeing it go Into place, ARl these things, I think, are things<br />
the Federal Government's been involved in so Its more than just a bit of money to the<br />
lb" 0ist Commission and something In the depreciation schedules, I think we've been<br />
enuinely Interested tn the industry as a destination for people to come In these areas of<br />
the capital cities and the services in the cities and beyond the cities in the remote areas, to<br />
keep them as beautiful as we've known them to be and where. they have to be maintained.<br />
That Is, there should be an emphasis on the environment and an emphasis on beauty. This<br />
Is Dot a word which, in planning terms, ever Sor of cuts the mustard. Providing we're<br />
always run by either developers or en~ gineers but not often enough by architects and the<br />
reault is we are not beautIfying our capital citis. And if we ame not wise to that we won't<br />

attract people to this country to Come and see it. Why would you come and see something<br />
you can go to seo down the west or cast cows of the United States when we're sort of<br />
seeking to emulate or duplicate what they have when in fact we ca do something so<br />
much better. So the enviroment I think does matter a great deal.<br />
Airlines have been another important change in the One Nation package. One of the<br />
important changes was for Qantas to acquire AustrAlian Airtincs so that we could develop<br />
Arisett as a second International car-Ic You will have noticed In the last week or two that<br />
Anscut are now flying to pants of south-cast Asia and will now qualify for some Important<br />
schedule of flight Into Kansal Airport, Osaka Airport, service in Japan and this is an<br />
Important development In our aviation history, to develop a -second Australian carrier and<br />
to have It working out there is going to be very important to tourism.<br />
Can I . also say that we ane having a dispute with the United States at the moment about<br />
-Northwest Airlines and I think that Qantas as a corporate entity and its role in the world<br />
has been Important to the Government and to all Australians but I don't want to sec the<br />
Australia-Japan traffc dominated by just a couple of carriers where they are basically<br />
litng an economic rent out of the travellers and diminishing the number of people<br />
coming to Australia. These things should always be kept in balance.<br />
Nor do we want to see Ameican carriers breaking their signed agreemnen-ts in terms of<br />
their access. We can ha-ve access and people on these routes providing that they ant<br />
negotiated ones but where the obj ective has to be that mom people visit Australia than not.<br />
So In terms of what will guide our policy towards these things it will be the number of<br />
people coming to Australia rather than which particular Airline is flying them, but I don't<br />
in that sense want to give Northwest any encouragemicnt that is those who break<br />
agreements can't cxpect to be treated well. But, again, Australia will have a balanced<br />
approach towards airline policy both in and out of Australia arnd policy will not be made<br />
exclusively for Qantas.<br />
Now, we did well with Qantas and we'll do well when wc see It developed as a public<br />
company where It's got a better availability of capital to it and can develop itself properly,<br />
which It Wa not really beei able to do with a Govetnment guamatee and a lot of debt, and<br />
I do look forward to that time and I think the British Airways purchase of. Qantas will<br />
make a great " ea of difference to the operations of Qantas within a world system, and the<br />
fit betuieen British Airways routes and Qantas routes was really quite an uncanny fit and<br />
one which should be a partnership that works well. But, * gain, they'll only be a minority<br />
holder in Qazitas and the majority, which will be the Australian public ought to be able to<br />
turn Qantas Into a firt class carr ier with a good debt to equity ratio in the company, and<br />
with people like Mr Pemberton as its Chair then the= 1' really no reason why we can't<br />
develop an oiline company with already a substantial reputation can grow along in-Asia.<br />
But seeing Azrsett grow along with it will be, I think, Important to us as well. </p>

When I was ccently In New Zealand with Prime Minister Jim Bolger we apeed on<br />
facilitating trans-Tasman flying and we'll be flyiD domestic terminal to domestic<br />
terminal probably by Christmas and this should make quite a difference to tourism across<br />
the Tasman where you can go on to an Australian Airlines or Ansett flight and hop off in<br />
Wellington or Auckland as the case may be rather than through the International terminals<br />
and this is another change which came from the One Nation package. So the shift to the<br />
acquisition of Australian by Qatas, the development of Ansett as a second carier, the<br />
trans-Tasman flying this must augur well for the tourism industry In general in getting<br />
more sewiblc uirlinc arrangements.<br />
The other thing I think we need to do is to again focus on our cultural identity aud this is<br />
why I think it is important not that we want to sign everybody up though we'd like<br />
to not that wc can sign everybody up in the movement to an Australian Republic but<br />
the fact is that it will help our identity as will cominS to terms with the aspirations of<br />
Aboriginal Australia. Aboriginal culture is now featuring much more in the culture of<br />
Australia and in the culture of Australian tourism as it should. And as one of the signature<br />
tunes of this country In terms of its art and what have you and of course the more we<br />
progcss that isue as a country the better off we'll be, not only at home in our own<br />
relations one to another, but In the view of the rest of the world which approves of<br />
countries which can get their acts together and run themselves sensibly and at the same<br />
time distinguishing our culture by what the Aboriginal community can bring to the culture<br />
of Australia. So these things like our cultural identity, the environment, having a sensible<br />
transportation policy, as well as all the other things, general promotion, tax incentives and<br />
the like, I think arc important and that's why I have wanted to sec tourism as a Cabinet<br />
ranked post and why we've set up a department of Tourism because it is an important<br />
Industry and it can play an important role and I know in Michael Lec we have a Minister<br />
who will take the Industry's interests to heart and barack for them sensibly and<br />
appropriately In the places that matter." J. </p>
