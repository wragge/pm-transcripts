POLICY<br />
INTERVIEW GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER. MR.<br />
GALLERY. CANBERRA 9TH MARCH, 196<br />
MR. HOLT Gentlemen, my principle purpose in asking you to come<br />
together with me this morning was that after such a lengthy statement<br />
covering so much ground, I thought there would be a fair amount of<br />
fill-in required. Some of you may feel that you wanted some<br />
amplification at various points, so I didn't bring you together<br />
to make another lmng speech, but to be available to clarify where<br />
that seemed desirable. And so unless otherwise indicated, I think<br />
what arises here is clarification from me.<br />
Q. Mr. Caiwell, Sir, has asked for a referendum for conscripts<br />
that are being sent to Viet Nam.<br />
MR. HOLT: A referendum? I don't think Australia has found a<br />
referendum a satisfactory way of resolving issues of this charaeter,<br />
and the Government is fully conscious of the responsibility it has<br />
exercised in coming to its decision. What I should paint out is<br />
the significant difference between the situation which existed in<br />
the wars in which a referendum was held and the disposition of our<br />
fbrces an this occasion. At that time, the issue was whether a<br />
man was to remain in the army, in effect, for the duration of the<br />
conflict which, in the result, in both world wars, was spread over<br />
a considerable number of years. In the case 4f the National<br />
Servicemen, who will go abroad for service, most of them have the<br />
best part of twelve months' training in Australia before being<br />
posted abroad and their total period of service is two years,<br />
so that those posted to, say, South Viet Nam, would not be likely<br />
to be required to serve for lnnger than approximately twelve months<br />
in that particular posting, by which, in most cases, they would<br />
have reached the end of their required period of service.<br />
Q. Doesn't the Defence Act give the Government power to extend<br />
their period of service in certain circumstances?<br />
MR. HOLT That is subject to correction. I think that is in the case<br />
of defence emergency, isn't it? Or a declared defence emergency.<br />
Q. Mr. Holt, in your opinion then, the test of public opinion<br />
will be at the next election. </p>
<p>1A.<br />
MR. HOLT ( Summing up) It is my view that a referendum<br />
certainly would not be a satisfactory method of dealing with<br />
a situation of this sort. Is the referendum to relate<br />
solely to the situation in South Viet Nam? Would Mr. Calwell<br />
see the discharge of our commitments in Malaysia in respect<br />
of Indonesian confrontation in Malaysia or any action we<br />
might find it necessary to take for the security of New<br />
Guinea in the same light. I think Mr. Calwell's rather<br />
hasty statement on this matter reflects the woolly-mindedness<br />
of the Opposition generally and its evident division on the<br />
issue in South Viet Nam and what should be done about it,<br />
which I thought became clearly apparent as my statement<br />
proceeded last night. It was quite obvious to me that there<br />
were many members * f the Opposition discomfited by the<br />
alacrity with which Mr. Calwell persisted in his view that<br />
this is a civil war which is being fought in South Viet Nam,<br />
ignoring the deeper significance and the wider ramifications<br />
which I spelt out in some detail. </p>
<p>-2<br />
' MR. HOLT I welcome that, Prank. I was about to say something<br />
to the effect that while the issue is not one appropriate for<br />
decision by referendum, the Government having accepted responsibility<br />
for its decision, will at no distant point of time be required to<br />
answer to the Australian electorate for its actions. I am<br />
confident that faced with the situation in which we find<br />
ourselves, the Australian public will continue to give us its<br />
firm support. the engagement of servicemen for Viet Nam inescapable?<br />
MR. HOLT We think so if we are to deal effectively with the total<br />
defence situation. Australia has a variety of commitments and<br />
we wish to so organise our affairs as to maintain the nation in the<br />
necessary economic strength to back up our military and aid effort.<br />
This has appeared to us to be the most effective way of going aqbout<br />
the business. Ne-one could seriously argue that the inducements<br />
to men of the desired ages are inadequate. I think we now can-claim<br />
to have the highest paid army of men of lozer ranks anyhow<br />
engaged anywhere in the world. The last time this matter came under<br />
my notice, our men of the lower ranks were being paid more than their<br />
opposite numbers in the army of the United States.<br />
Q. Can you give us a break-up, Sir, of how this 4,500 men will be<br />
made up?<br />
MR. HOLT Well, I tried to get some detail on that for you. We<br />
had this material, of course, before us. I may say we went over<br />
this decision, or at least we had extensive discussions leading up<br />
to it over a considerable period of time. This hasn't just happened<br />
since, say, Vice-President' Humphrey was here. One of the earliest<br />
items of business of the new Government was to consider what should<br />
be done further in the defence field. Apart from that, there were<br />
of course, reviews going on of one kind or another almost<br />
continuously before the end of last year, and one of the factors<br />
which influenced our decision was that a force smaller than this<br />
would not hae enabled Australia to operate its own unified command<br />
under Australian leadership and direction. If we had sent, for<br />
example, another battalion, it wouldn't have been located with the<br />
battalion corresponding to that one already there. The composition<br />
of the American force, the need for logistic arrangements and for<br />
specialist troops would have debarred an additional battalion to<br />
be placed in another United States regiment, but by a decision to<br />
send a force on the scale that we have, our troops are enabled to<br />
cord-ict their ovm nampaignl as a unified Australian command, with<br />
their own specialist services and with this special SAS force<br />
accompanying them, so that it should be an extremely effective body<br />
of men, and in our judgment the most effective military contribution<br />
which Australia could make at this time. Now the question naturally e 9 / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
MR. HOLT ( CONTD.) arises, " Can wie make these troops available, and<br />
at the same time--he-ready to meet our other commitments" and our<br />
military advice is " Yes we can." Have in mind although the numbers<br />
may seem large to some, they seem small to others. You have to<br />
keep in mind what I said at the outset about the rotation process<br />
and that as ore force moves out, we have to be in a position to move<br />
in a force of equivalent strength. The battalion there will, as I<br />
think I indicated yesterday, be rel. ieved in June. When the mem~ bers<br />
of the proposed Task Force have completed their period of service,<br />
then they too will be replaced,-: You could conceivably have a<br />
situation if it became necessary to take some precautionary action,<br />
say in New Guinea, you would turn to some of those who had been on<br />
a tour of duty in South Viet Nam, some time after they had returned<br />
to Australia, but it would be, in all probability, a very different<br />
kind of situation that they would have to cope with up there.<br />
Anyhow, this follows the recommendation of our own Service advisers.<br />
It is their considered judgment that this was the most effective<br />
military contribution that Australia could make and that it was<br />
within our capacity to make it.<br />
Q. Have you selected the commander of the new force yet?<br />
MR. HOLT Just before I leave that point, the 4,500 is the overall<br />
total and includes all services, not merely the iiitary service.<br />
The command? Well, others will have to give you that answer...<br />
Either Fraser or Alan Fairhall.<br />
Q. Has he been selected yet?<br />
MR. HOLT Wdell, he is not known to me anyhow.<br />
Q. Sir, the 4,500 seems a bit high when you consider that only two<br />
infantry battalions are going.<br />
MR. HOLT : Well, there are all these others. Apart from the R. 11. A. F.<br />
elements, there are the advisers who were formerly there, thaerree the<br />
specialist services, signallers and people of that sort, artillery<br />
elements. They are not just infantrymen. And this specialist<br />
squadron. But this is what it totals up to. I am not, of course, a<br />
military expert. Our Minister for Defence and our Service Ministers<br />
can give you more detail, but I was, of course, a party to all the<br />
discussions at which the Service Chiefs were present and concerned<br />
with the strategic aspects and the relativity of the effort here to<br />
what we were doing in other theatres. Remember that we are building<br />
up our own forces all the time. One reason why our contribution<br />
was on the limited scale which occurred at the outset was derived<br />
from the need to use some of our trained Service personnel to give<br />
a hand in the training of those coming into the army, but as we go<br />
along, so we are building up our numbers and our strength. so 9 -/ 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Q. Bearing an the point that you have made, Sir, that this will<br />
be a self-contained force, Mr. Fraser in the House last night said<br />
that you might make an arrangement with the Americans for the<br />
detention of Australian offenders. Would it be desirable to turn<br />
Australians over to some other<br />
MR. HOLT Well, I don't think we are in a position to give a final<br />
reply on that episode. I would hope that we don't over-sensationalise<br />
this thing. It is not an episode I confess to having<br />
been very much concerned by my first reading of it and I think one<br />
does have to take into consideration not only the seriousness of<br />
the offence which in that kind of war in that type of area does<br />
assume a major seriousness, but also the circumstances in which the<br />
troops are operating there. The Commanding Officer has acknowledged<br />
that he was in error in his understanding of the manner in which<br />
punishment should be applied but my mind is easier on this matter<br />
because I know that it is under the personal consideratio4 not<br />
merely of the Minister, but of a very experienced and capable<br />
Army leader in the person of Lieutenant-General Wihlton and I<br />
hav-: sufficient confidence in his experience and judgment to<br />
feel that this matter will be dealt with in the most appropriate<br />
way from now on. I think that it is greatly to be regretted that<br />
the episode should not only have occurred but the publicity whiich<br />
understably attached to it could, I think, give a misleading picture<br />
or a distorted picture to the Australian public of what has been<br />
a magnificent force whili has brought great credit to Australia<br />
and has been generally recognised as the most effective and<br />
highly disciplined fighting unit to be found in South Viet Narn;<br />
Q. Mr. Holt, you said that the Service Ministers can give us the<br />
details after. Is there going to be some form reversal and they<br />
will give them to us?<br />
MR. HOLT I will advise my colleague, Mr. Fairhall . It is not my<br />
purpose to take over the functions of the Minister for Defence.<br />
I wanted to supply some additional informration if that were<br />
necessary but if you do want to into the more technical aspeats<br />
on the defence or service side, I think it would be appropriate<br />
for Mr. Fairhall to have that discussion with you,<br />
Q. Mr. Holt, with this increased force, will Australia have a<br />
greater say in strategy, in general policy?<br />
MR. HOLT I wouldn't ask really for a stronger Australian voice<br />
than we possess at the present time. The United States and South<br />
Vietnamese governments have been highly considerate of us in the<br />
weight they have attached tq Australian opinions not only in<br />
Service matters but in relation to the policies to be followed<br />
generally. 1 </p>
<p>Q. Sir, can you reconcile for us the apparent inconsistencies<br />
betweenjthis decision and what you said before Mr. Healey's<br />
arrival about Australia not being able to incur additional Defeno3--<br />
commitments?<br />
MR. HOLT I regard what we are now incurring as being manageable<br />
within the balanced programme for the nation that I envisaged<br />
at that time. Before we had our talks with Mr. Healey, it was not<br />
clear what was to be proposed by him. There had been in quite<br />
influential quarters in the United Kingdom proposals for a complete<br />
withdrawal of the United Kingdom East of Suez and if this had<br />
occurred, then I could foresee burdens resting on Australia which<br />
we wou~ Ld have found difficult to meet while at the same time<br />
pursuing a considerable programme of development. What I have<br />
been putting publicly and to the representatives of other countries<br />
is that, taking a not so very long view, it is in their own interests<br />
that Australia sinuld continue to expand, to build its strength, its<br />
capacity to supply a greater military contribution, a greater aid<br />
contribution in the period ahead. However, I believe that what has<br />
now been decided is in no sense inconsistent with the general view<br />
I was holding. I am confident that we can sustain a defence effort<br />
an the scale contemplated and at the same time press forward<br />
vigorously with our development programme. The cloud over us, of<br />
course, is this drought aspect, and it is a characteristic of<br />
drought that nobody can tell how long it wivl l last or how widely<br />
its influence will be spread. The remark-able thing, I think, for<br />
most of us who are old enough to have remembered earlier periods of<br />
drought is how well we have come through the circumstances of this<br />
one with relatively little dislocation to the economy as a whole.<br />
We may not yet have experienced the worst of it by any means, but<br />
it does demonstrate how much more highly diversified the Australian<br />
economy is and how much better able we are to contend with the<br />
unfavourable conditions in one area of Australia because we have<br />
strengthened our situation in anwther. Last year, ,, for example,<br />
while we were getting a poor return from wheat crops in New South<br />
Wales, they had a record wheat production in Australia. But I<br />
was rather surprised at the tone taken by one or two of the<br />
financial commentators. I thought if you studied the text closely<br />
enough of what I said on the economic s'ide that we wi re giving<br />
quite a number of indications of directions in whih the economy<br />
required that assistanoe, then further assistance would be<br />
forthcoming, housing being a case in point. Then there were the<br />
references to export incentives, proposals for research and<br />
development, other matters of that sort which were not unimportant. veso~ so / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
Q. Mr. Halt, any development in your plans to go to Viet<br />
Nam?<br />
MR. HOLT: Nw, Harold, I am keeping in my mind a particular period<br />
as the best possibility, but I would prefer not to discuss that<br />
at the present time. On the one hand, there is a quite crowded<br />
programme leading up to Easter. The week of Easter we have the<br />
Queen Mother here. The following week we have a gathering of the<br />
Inter-Parliamentary Union.<br />
Q. How long will you go after Easter, Sir?<br />
MR. HOLIT The Session? I should think a run of about four weeks,<br />
but it may need to be longer. I am hoping to avoid having to<br />
leave it until the Session ends, It may be I have got to take up<br />
portion of the Parliamentary time to do this, but I would see a<br />
visit of something just under a fortnight as probably being about<br />
necessary.<br />
Q. You wouldn't fly in with the troops, would y~ u?<br />
MR. HOLT Well my problem will be to get to a number of different<br />
points because I certainly want to get to Borneo, and we have<br />
troops stationed in various areas and I think it would be useful<br />
to get to as many of these as I can. Then you find when it once<br />
becomes known that you are liable to be in that general area, you<br />
have requests then f rem governments wanting you to come and confer<br />
with them on matters of interest. to them.<br />
Q. This is mainly to see the troops, Sir?<br />
MR. HOLT : Well, partly to inform my own mind better on the nature<br />
of the terrain, the country and the general atmosphere. A<br />
fairly experienced political observer or Ministerial observer<br />
can pick up in a couple of days a good deal of information and<br />
atmosphere. He gets a concentrated treatment; just as we have<br />
people dropping in here for a couple of days and able to confer<br />
directly with either heads of government or heads of services,<br />
armed services. You do absorb a good deal of the local<br />
atmosphere, the information that can be made available to you<br />
on the spot which I think becomes more educative than anything<br />
that you can get at a distance or secondhand.<br />
Q. Sir, this 650M for the Farm Lean Fund. Is the Government<br />
providing that?<br />
MR. HOLT The general idea is that this would come from the SED<br />
accounts but we have yet to discuss in all its detail with the<br />
representatives of the tradin, banks. There have been some<br />
preliminary talks; thereforgBA~ re is something indefinite at<br />
this point of time about the way the machinery will operate,<br />
we have our own view of what we would like to see happen. &amp; 0*/ 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
MR. HOILT ( Contd.) This is therefore subject to hearing the views the<br />
banks may wish to put to us on details, but broadly what we are<br />
looking to do is to have available, for borrowing purposes in the<br />
long term and at reasonable rates of interest, funds which in the<br />
first instance would be avai] Eble for meeting the problems arising<br />
from drought, but this is not seen as merely a way of dealing<br />
with drought. We are conscious that there is a need in the rural<br />
community for finance of a long-term nature, the people knowing<br />
the sort of commitment they have undertaken and the rates they have<br />
to pay for their money. Over an amazing proportion of the<br />
farming community, the overdraft system has operated indefinitely<br />
in some cases. There have been outstanding loans on well-established<br />
properties, probably running back through generation<br />
it is theoretically callable " overdraft" and yet that particul1ar<br />
hank has satisfied the particular needs of that family or that<br />
establishment perhaps over fifty, sixty or more years. WNell, the<br />
farmer likes to foel he knows just what his liabilities are, and<br />
what is the leng-th and availability of his financial resources and<br />
then he can plan more confidently for his future. This doesn't<br />
mean that you seek to replace overnight the overdraft system which<br />
has operated in this practical way for so long, but there will be<br />
situations where a man would need the encouragement of an assured<br />
long-term loan at a rate which he felt represented an economic one<br />
having regard to all he might have to undertake before perhaps<br />
he would subject himself to the anxieties and heartbreaks that some<br />
of them have experienced over recent times.<br />
Q. On a Viuqefsland note, are you intending to ' hold on to your<br />
Bin~ gi Bay home and holiday there when you can?<br />
MR. HOLT Holiday. Thanks for the thought. I am hanging on to<br />
it for my retirement, untimely or otherwise.<br />
Mr. Fitchett Sir Robert went twenty years without a holiday, Sir.<br />
MR. HOLJT : I am not emulating his endurance feats, I assure yriu.<br />
Q. I have a very ingenuous question, Mr. Prime Minister.<br />
Could you tell us when you are going to debate the bill now<br />
before Parliament to extend aid to private schools in Canberra?<br />
MR. HOLT : I haven't consulted my colleague, the Leader of the House<br />
on the conduct of the programme. I don't know that it will be<br />
introduced at an early point of time. I have no wish to add to<br />
or complicate the problems of the Opposition, but it is there on<br />
the Notice Paper. Is it in the form of a bill or a statement?<br />
Q. A statement. The Leader of the Opposition secured the<br />
adjournment. S </p>
<p>8-<br />
MR. BOLT Well this is where you had me foxed for a moment.<br />
I am not saying " foxed" in any sinister sense. YLou had me<br />
groping around as to just what legislation it was. I knew there<br />
was a statement, and I gather that the Opposition if wie are<br />
proposing to bring it on wishes to have some prior notice so<br />
that there would be an opportunity for Caucus discussions.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, on immigration. Last night, I think<br />
you mentioned only Asiatics.<br />
MR. BOLT Oh, no. There is no significance What I think I was<br />
stressing was that these devel~ pments around the Asian area had<br />
been amongst the factors which had influenced us to make a review<br />
at this time but the rules and arrangements don't exclude other<br />
non-Europeans than Asians. But in our experience, it is the<br />
people fr'nm Asia who come here for one purpose or another who seem<br />
to give rise to the problems with which we have to deal.<br />
Q. Ihat I have particularly in mind, Sir, is that about a<br />
year ago, Mr. Wilson told Dr. Viilliams of the letIndies that he<br />
would try and get Sir Robert to give some thought to taking some<br />
excess West Indian population.<br />
MR. BOLT: Yes, well he hasn't put any such proposal to me, nor<br />
am I aware of it having been put to Sir Robert. But we, of course,<br />
have these arrangements which apply mainly in Asia for students<br />
coming in here. I mentioned a figure, a total figure of more<br />
than 12,000 as representing the number in Australia at the present<br />
time, and not all of course, not more than a relatively small<br />
proportion of those here are on Commonwealth or Colombo Plan<br />
scholarships. A lot of them come here to do their primary and<br />
secondary education.<br />
Q. It would be true to say, then, that this wouldn't<br />
include any members of the British Commonwealth as such....<br />
MR. BOLT Oh, they are not excluded. If they come here under any<br />
of the categories of eligibility, then the same rules would apply<br />
in relation to them. But I said we were proposing to give rather<br />
more flexibility in their administration to the Department of<br />
Immigration. We want them to feel that if they run up against<br />
what we would all regard as the more difficult cases, then they<br />
dqn't have to regard themselves as being too tightly bound by the<br />
rules. Could you give us a little more backgroun. to your speech<br />
on Northern Development? Did it derive from a comprehensive<br />
Government review of Northern Development policies or was it just<br />
a continuation 0* 0 9* / 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
MR. HOLT Well, we feel we have-been-te. Ling-yo.-a-grea t deal<br />
on northerrv eev~ pinnt--but we are belted all the time by critics<br />
who haven't bothered to put together the total of what we have<br />
been doing or what we have encouraged to occur. I quoted a<br />
figure last night which is an official figure. It comes from<br />
the Department of National Development. If ybu look at the<br />
various projects currently in train or fir early implementation,<br />
you get a total expenditure on northern development from<br />
governmental and private sources of the order of 32,600M. That's,<br />
a lot of money for capital investment in a relatively under-!<br />
populated area of Australia and must make a tremendous difference<br />
to the situation in thoseareas. Vie are going ahead steadily with,<br />
say, the beef roads programme and programmes such as the Brigalow<br />
Scheme, ports and harbour facilities, railway development of.<br />
this sort. We still make the approach from the Commonwealth,<br />
and if we can be shown projects with an export potential that<br />
have an economic viability about them, we are attracted to do<br />
something to help that along. But what I was really trying ta<br />
do was to get the rather more balanced and realistic view taken<br />
of a good deal me~ re than developmental activity. Some may argue<br />
it is not enough but it represents a very great increase on<br />
anything we have ever attempted before. In Western Australia<br />
at the moment, I would think you would find thdr resources<br />
there pretty much at full stretch an our analysis, anyhow, of<br />
the figures. I am not finding the Queensland Government in<br />
complaining mood about what we are doing up there. On the<br />
contrary.<br />
Q. Can we expect some news about Jim Fraser's voting<br />
rights today?<br />
MR. HOLT I don't know whether you noticed that this was~ in the<br />
concluding page of the speech which was roneoed off. It was<br />
my expectation that Doug Anthony would announce at question<br />
time that we had decided to give voting rights to the member<br />
for the Australian Capital Territory. Viell, he knowing that it<br />
would require a bill and the rule is that bills must first be<br />
explained in the party room, deferred until today his announcement.<br />
I came to it as I was reading thrwugh and baulked at the hurdle<br />
and without mentioning the topic, said, " This is a matter<br />
which my colleague will be raising tomorrow", subsequently<br />
realising that everybody who had had a copy of the roneoed<br />
speech would have this new break. ' Vhfether it was regarded as<br />
of insufficient importance to attract the dailies in other parts<br />
of the Commonwealth, I don't know, but it has been a big issue<br />
with Jim Fraser. It might prove his undoing.<br />
Mr. Alan Reid Thank you, Sir. </p>
