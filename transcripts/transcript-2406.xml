DEATH OF BRIGADIER SIR FREDERICK GALLEGHAN<br />
Tribute bj the Prime Minister, Mr William McMahon<br />
It was with regret that I learnt of the death of<br />
Brigadier Sir Frederick Galleghan.<br />
He had a long and distinguished career in both<br />
peace and war. The only Australian citizen soldier to have held a<br />
commission for more than fifty years, he will chiefly be remembered<br />
as the man who led Australia's first action in Malaya during World<br />
War II and later became Australian commander at Changi Prison.<br />
On behalf of the Government, I extend sincere<br />
sympathy to his widow.<br />
CANBERRA, April 1971 </p>
