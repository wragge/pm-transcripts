AUSTRAI A<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
iF MEDTA WED) NESDAY, 2 MARCH 1983<br />
HOJW MR. HIAWKE. SHTFTS GROUND<br />
Urd; kr PIreSSUrr to Mr. Ha~ wke revealod the sh. 21 lcana.~:<br />
dcc'', ption of! his campaign rhetric.<br />
Thi!; mornizy ho at temptcd. to wriggle ouL of his coi~ rii ILment tco<br />
his massive s perviing binge by claiming there r., ight hcave to<br />
Lc-rodif cction of his prograrune if he found bigger uceficiL~ s<br />
tharn expected.<br />
it. is know that the 1982/ 83 budget deficit will. b( 2 dround<br />
$ 4,000 million. For 1983/ 84 a figure of S6,000 million has beer<br />
spoken of. Mr. HaLwke well knows that his $ 4,000maddition to<br />
these figures would make the Hawke deficit. around $ 10,000<br />
million for 1983/ 84.<br />
When hie was confronted this morning on whether the outside limit<br />
of his deficit would be 8, 9, or 10,000 million he avoidcd<br />
the question, ever, though the figures implied in hi.' statement<br />
involved a $ 10,000 million decficit.<br />
But we know that throughout this campaign has not backed<br />
away one inch from his open cheque book.<br />
Mr. H-awke is running scared because he knows his sperndiny.( propoi) a'As<br />
are utterly irresponsible. lHe knows the money Irnist come rn<br />
Australian taxpayers.<br />
A few hours later, addressing ' Lhe National Press Club, Mr. flaw'kL<br />
even talked of the possibility of some " movement. in the tax<br />
area" as he quaintly described it.<br />
Again Mr. Hawke war, saying that if there were deficit-problemis<br />
he would have to consider increasing tax.<br />
These words come from the mouth of the man who h-as already<br />
promised tax cuts.<br />
Onl almost every major iissuQ of consequenco, Mr. Hawk(.,~ triec3<br />
to shift ground when a bit of pressure is put on him.<br />
He has tried valiantly to shift ground on capitLal gaixis tfLe--<br />
passionately espou~ sing how hc could sell it; he has s!-iftcd<br />
ground on the Sinai one cirea where one would have thought<br />
ho would have had a real coimiAnent. </p>
