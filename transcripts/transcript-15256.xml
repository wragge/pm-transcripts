<p>Thank you very much Sandy, Kevin Donnelly, Julie Bishop, my other parliamentary colleagues, ladies and gentlemen. I am delighted to accept the invitation to launch this book, both because I've greatly respected the author as an individual and I've greatly admired his persistent campaign for high basic standards in Australia's education system.

And this was the territory staked out and defended fiercely by education producer groups, by the state education bureaucracies, curriculum designers and the teacher unions. Now, as a government, we will yield to nobody in defending our record so far as the provision of resources to education is concerned.
