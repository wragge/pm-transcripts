PRIME MINISTER 17 OCTOBER 1979<br />
from the Press Office SUMMARY OF ABC'S 7.45 NEWS<br />
Arbitration commissioners are expected to meet today to<br />
discuss the proposed changes to industrial law. Most of<br />
the 25 commissioners and some deputy presidents are likely<br />
to attend the meeting, along with the President of the<br />
Commission, Sir John Moore. In Parliament yesterday,<br />
the Opposition claimed the amendments would create problems<br />
for commissioners in the handling of disputes and urged<br />
the Government to withdraw the legislation. The Bill<br />
goes into the Senate today where some Government backbenchers<br />
have reservations about the measures, as Ron Sinclair reports:<br />
The areas of primary concern to Senators with whom I spoke last<br />
night were both that giving the Government easier means by<br />
which to apply for union deregistration, and the fact that<br />
individual commissioners will no longer have the right<br />
to make award rulings without the approval of a commission<br />
deputy president. The Government in the form of the Prime Minister<br />
and Mr Street made it clear yesterday that it would not be<br />
swayed in drawing legislation by protest from commissioners.<br />
