The Government is today announcing new command arrangements for the Australian Defence Force.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Defence Minister Stephen Smith are pleased to announce the following appointments to be recommended to the Governor-General in Council.</p>
<p>All appointments are to be recommended for three years and to take effect from 4 July 2011.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence expressed the deep gratitude of the Government and the Defence Organisation to the retiring Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, AC, AFC.</p>
<p>Air Chief Marshal Houston joined the Royal Australian Air Force as a cadet pilot in 1970.  He has served his country with distinction, providing exemplary leadership of the Australian Defence Force and the ADF community for the past six years. Air Chief Marshal Houston's leadership of the ADF has spanned a period of high intensity for Australia's armed forces, including our contribution to the missions in Iraq and Afghanistan and peacekeeping roles in East Timor and Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>Air Chief Marshal Houston has won the respect of successive Governments, the men and women of the Australian Defence Force and the Australian Community.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence also thanked Vice Admiral Russ Crane for his service.  Vice Admiral Crane will retire as the Chief of Navy on 7 June 2011 after 40 years in the Royal Australian Navy.</p>
<p>Vice Admiral Crane has had a distinguished career and as the Chief has led Navy through a period of high operational activity, and implemented a program of wide-ranging and important cultural, leadership and structural changes to position Navy to meet future challenges.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence also expressed their gratitude to Lieutenant General Ken Gillespie who will retire as the Chief of Army in July after 43 years in the Australian Army.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Gillespie as Chief has led the Australian Army with distinction through an extended period of operations with peacekeeping roles in East Timor and the Solomon Islands and combat and training missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. </p>
<p>Lieutenant General David Hurley will bring a wealth of experience to the position of the Chief of the Defence Force.  He has held several senior command positions within the Australian Defence Force including as Land Commander Australia, Chief of Capability Development Group and Chief of Joint Operations.  Lieutenant General Hurley is currently the Vice Chief of Defence Force.</p>
<p>Air Marshal Mark Binskin has extensive operational command experience having served as Chief of Staff at Headquarters Australian Theatre in 2003 and then as Director of Combined Air and Space Operations Centre responsible for the conduct of coalition air operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.  He is a graduate of the Harvard Business School Advanced Management Program and the Australian Institute of Company Directors.  Air Marshal Mark Binskin is currently the Chief of Air Force.</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Griggs has broad sea going and operational experience and has helped drive Defence's biggest reform program.  He has commanded the ANZAC Class frigate HMAS ARUNTA on operations in the Middle East and the Australian Amphibious Task Group.  He also has extensive capability management and development experience, and held a senior position in the Defence Strategic Reform Program.  Rear Admiral Griggs is currently the Deputy Chief of Joint Operations.</p>
<p>Major General David Morrison has wide ranging command experience having served as the Head of Military Strategic Commitments and Deputy Chief of Army.  In that position he led the review into Army's command and control structure which resulted in reform initiatives to ensure Army is able to sustain its current and future operational tempo. Major General Morrison is currently serving as Army's first Forces Commander.</p>
<p>Air Vice-Marshal Geoff Brown has extensive flying experience on helicopters, F_111 and F/A-18 aircraft.
