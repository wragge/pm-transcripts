SUINTDAY, 13 JUNET, 1971. </p>
<p>GENTLEMEN: THIS IS MY SECOND VISIT TO QUEENSLAND SINCE<br />
I BECAME PRIME MINISTER. I AM GLAD TO BE HERE FOR<br />
TWO PARTICULAR REASONS.<br />
. ONE IS THAT I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS<br />
FOR THE LEADER OF THE FEDERAL PARLIAMENTARY<br />
LIBERALS TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE ORGANISATION AND<br />
ITS MEMBERS AT STATE LEVEL AS WELL AS FEDERAL<br />
LEVEL. THE OTHER IS THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE<br />
LIBERALS IN QUEENSLAND WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT BEARING<br />
ON THE OUTCOME OF THE NEXT FEDERAL ELECTION<br />
LET ME SAY I KNOW WE CAN WIN, BUT I WANT US<br />
TO WIN HANDSOMELY. TO DO THAT WE MUST BE BUSY IN<br />
THE RIGHT WAY AND WE MUST GET BUSY RIGHT AWAY.<br />
THERE IS NO DOUBT WE WILL BE JUDGED BY OUR PERFORMANCE<br />
AND OUR PERFORMANCE WILL DEPEND ON HOW STRONGLY<br />
WE PULL TOGETHER WITH OUR COALITION COLLEAGUES. / 2 </p>
<p>SPEAKING FOR THL PARLIAMENTARY PARTY, WANT<br />
TO HAVE A GOOD AND INTIMATE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITHTHE<br />
PARTY ORGANISATION. BOB SOUTH-EY STRESSED THE<br />
IMPORTANCE OF THIS AT OUR FEDERAL COUNCIL [ N CANBERRA<br />
THE OTHER DAY.<br />
I AGREE WITH-WHAT HE SAID. I DO NOT LOOK AT THE<br />
PARLIAMENTARY PARTY AS A LAW UNTO ITSELF. IT IS BOUND<br />
BY THE PRINCIPLES AND PLATFORM OF THE LIBE:( AL PARTY.<br />
THESE ARE BROAD ENOUGH AND FLEXIBLE ENOUGH FOR THE<br />
PARLIAMENTARY PARTY TO HAVE EL3DW ROOM IN HOW IT APP3LIES<br />
THEM TO SPECIFIC ISSUES.<br />
THE ORGANISATION WOULD NEVER WANT US TO BE<br />
" DUMB, DRIVEN CATTLE", LIKE OUR OPPOSITION, HAVING<br />
LITTLE LATITUDE AND VIRTUALLY NO FREEDOM FROM THE<br />
DICTATORSHIP OF A FEDERAL CONFERENCE. BY THE SAME TOKEN,<br />
1, FOR ONE, DO NOT EXPECT THE PARLIAME~ NTARY PARTY TO<br />
JUST RUN WILD ON THE RANGE.<br />
THEN IT REMAINS ESSENTIALLY A LIBERAL CONCEPT<br />
THAT THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY HAS SUBSTANTIAL DISCRETION<br />
IN WHAT IT DOES. BUT IT HAS TO USE THAT DISCRETION WISELY,<br />
AND IT ALSO HAS TO SUCCEED.<br />
LIKE BOB SOUTHEY, I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO<br />
LISTEN TO WHAT THE MEMBERS, THE BRANCHES AND THE<br />
COUNCILS HAVE TO SAY. THIS IS ONE AREA WHERE WE MUST<br />
LOOK FOR NEW IDEAS. THIS IS WH-ERE SO MANY OF OUR REFORMS </p>
<p>BEGIN. TIS [ S WHERE THE ROOTS OF OUR SUCCESS OR FAILURE<br />
GO DOWN. TI-EN IT IS UP TO TIHE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY TO<br />
INTERPRET PARTY POLICY IN ITS OWN WAY AND WITH A TIMING<br />
OF ITS OWN CHOOSING WHEN IT COMES TO LEGISLATIVE ACTION.<br />
I BELIEVJE THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY IS IN GOOD<br />
HEART AND IT WILL BE IN GOOD SHAPE FOR THE NEXT ELECTION.<br />
CO-OPERATION WITH THE STATES<br />
A GOOD DEAL HAS BEEN SAID LATELY ABOUT TI-E<br />
FEDERAL SYSTEM AND I ACKNOWLEIDGE H-ERE THE LEADING<br />
k~ 7 ROLE THE FEDERALS COUNCIL AND THE PARTY ORGANISATION<br />
I-AS PLAYED IN UNDERPINNING IT IN A MODERN CONTEXT.<br />
I BELIEVE IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM.<br />
I RESPECT AND UNDERSTAND THE POSITION AND<br />
RIGHTS OF THE STATES. I DO NOT BELIEVE IN CENTRALISATION<br />
OR IN A CONTRIVED FLOW OF POWER TO THE CENTRE THAT<br />
ERODES TI-E SOVEREIGNTY OF TI-E STATES.<br />
IN SOME MATTERS LIKE NATIONAL ECONOMIC<br />
MANAGEMENT, DEFENCE AND TRADE, THE COMMON WEALTHMUST<br />
HAV'E NATIONAL POWERS, BUT THESE CAN BE H-ELD WITH-OUT<br />
DAMAGE TO THE STATES, GIVEN CO-OPERATION AND GOODWILL<br />
ON BOTH SIDES. </p>
<p>OUR INTENTION TO ARRANGE A GROWTH TAX<br />
WITH THE STATES WHICh WE WILL BE DISCUSSING NEXT<br />
WEEK IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE EFFORT WE ARE MAKING<br />
TO MAKE THE FEDERAL SYSTEM WORK MORE EFFECTIVELY.<br />
CANBERRA AND BRISBANE CAN WORK TOGETHER<br />
EFFECTIVELY. THE QUEENSLAND AND COMMONWEALTH<br />
GOVERNMENTS HAVE COME SOME DISTANCE IN OUR RECENT<br />
TALKS ON ABORIGINES AND ON THE INQUIRIES WE AGREED ON<br />
TOGETHER, INTO OIL DRILLING ON THE BARRIER REEF, THE<br />
CROWN OF THORNS STARFISH AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE<br />
REEF AS A TOURIST DESTINATION.<br />
I QUOTE THESE ONLY AS EXAMPLES OF THE<br />
VALUE OF GETTING TOGETHER. THERE IS A HOST OF OTHER<br />
MATTERS AND MANY OF TH'EM WILL BE GIVEN AN AIRING AT<br />
THE PREMIERS' CONFERENCE IN CANBERRA IN THE NEXT<br />
FEW DAYS.<br />
THE RECORD AND THE FUTURE<br />
I THINK THE PROBLEMS WE ARE UP AGAINST AS A<br />
GOVERNMENT ARE THESE:<br />
THE CONTINUING INDUSTRIAL UNREST WHICH IS<br />
COMPOUNDING THE EFFECTS OF INFLATIONARY<br />
PRESSURES ON THE ECONOMY. </p>
<p>( II) THE NEED TO LIMIT SOME OF THE REFORMS WE<br />
WANT TO MAKE BECAUSE WE H4AVE TO WATCH<br />
PUBLIC SPENDING AS AN ANTI-INFLATONARY<br />
MEASURE.<br />
( 111) THERE IS A NEED FOR A POSITIVE DISPLAY OF VITALITY<br />
IN THE ORGANISATION. THE AUSTRALIAN LIKES<br />
TO THINK ABOUT HAVING A CHANGE EVEN WHEN<br />
THINGS ARE GOING RIGHT FOR HIM.<br />
NONE OF THESE PROBLEMS IS BEYOND US. I IKNOW<br />
WE CAN H-ANDLE THEM TO TH4E SATISFACTION OF THE<br />
ELECTORATE, BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE COMPLACENT ABOUT<br />
IT, AND THERE ARE SOME ASPECTS OF THESE PROBLEMS<br />
BEYOND THE AUTHORITY OF GOVERNMENTS.<br />
WE MUST TREAT EACH PROBLEM AS URGENT<br />
AND EACH DAY AS A DAY TO GET SOMETHING MORE DONE.<br />
THE RECORD OF THE LAST THREE MONTHS IS GOOD.<br />
SOME OF MY STAFF WENT THROUGH TH-E LIST<br />
OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES TH-E OTHER<br />
DAY AND CAME UP WITH THIRTY OR MORE WORTHWHILE<br />
ACHIEVEMENTS OF A NATIONAL CHARACTER WE HAVE DONE<br />
AS A GOVERNMENT SINCE TE-MIDDLE OF MARCH. </p>
<p>WON'T GO THROUGH TI-EM ALL HEAVEN FORBID<br />
BUT LET ME MENTION TIHREE OR FOUR OF THEM.<br />
FIRST, OUR MEETING WITH THE STATES WHEN WE<br />
AGREED ON SOME EMERGENCY FINANCE TO HELP THEIR<br />
DEFICITS WAS A GOOD BEGINNING. THE ATMOSPHERE WAS<br />
CORDIAL, THOUGH-I RETAIN A HEALTHY RESPECT FOR THE<br />
TOUGHNESS AND SKILLS OF THE PREMIERS.<br />
I HOPE OUR FORTHCOMING MEETING WILL TAKE<br />
PLACE IN THE SAME SPIRIT AND 1 SEE NO REASON WHY IT<br />
SHOULD NOT. THEN THERE WAS SPECIAL ASSISTANCE TO<br />
PENSIONERS TO MEET THE DRAIN ON THEIR RESOURCES<br />
FOLLOWING THE UNEXPECTED RISE IN THE NATIONAL WAGE.<br />
THERE WAS THE DEPARTMENTAL REORGANISATION<br />
IN CANBERRA TO SPEED-UP THE POLICY-MAKING FUNCTIONS<br />
OF GOVERNMENT AND THE CREATION OF A NEW MINISTRY<br />
TO GIVE SPECIAL ATTIN TION TO THE ENVIRONMENT,<br />
ABORIGINES AND THE ARTS.<br />
AND THEN, IN FOREIGN POLLCY, WE BROUGHT UP<br />
INTO OUR FOCUS OUR FUTURE RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA, WITH<br />
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND JAPAN. </p>
<p>WE ALSO JOINED TUE ORGANISAT ION FOR ECONOMIC<br />
CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT.<br />
OTHER ACTIVITIES COVERED NEW LEGISLATION<br />
ON LAW AND ORDER, A REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION SYSTEM,<br />
SPECIAL AID FOR OUR HARD-PRESSED RURAL INDUSTRIES AND<br />
PLANS FOR A NEW PROGRAMME FOR PAPUA-NEW GUINEA TO<br />
GIVE IT AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE ITS OWN CHOICE OF A DATE<br />
FOR INTERNAL SELF-GOVERNMENT.<br />
I WOULD LIKE TO ADD HERE A FEW WORDS ON THE<br />
AID WE ARE GIVING TO REFUGEES FROM EAST PAKISTAN IN INDIA.<br />
TI-IS IS THE SCENE OF A GREAT HUMAN TRAGEDY.<br />
OUR RESPONSE AS A GOVERNMENT WAS IMMEDIATE.<br />
THE FIRST COMMITMENT OF HALF A MILLION DOLLARS IN<br />
AID WAS CONSIDERED EVEN BEFORE THE ENORMITY OF THE<br />
DISASTER WAS FULLY KNOWN OR ANY APPEALS HAD BE EN MADE.<br />
WE DOUBLED THAT COMMITMENT AS THE DISASTER<br />
GREW IN SIZE. THE CRITICISM WE HAVE HAD IS UNFAIR AND<br />
BASED ON LI. TTLE KNOWLEDGE. </p>
<p>MY GOVERNMENT CONSIIDERED THAT TO BE EFFECTIVE<br />
WE HAD TO SEND THE AID THAT INDIA WANTED AND SEND<br />
IT WHERE THAT COUNTRY WANTED IT SENT. IT WOULD HAVE<br />
BEEN ABSURD TO HAVE SENT SUPPLIES OF VACCINE, FOOD AND<br />
SHELTER MATERIALS OFF INTO THE BLUE. THAT WOULD HAVE<br />
ONLY ADDED TO THE PROBLEMS OF THE LOCAL PEOPLE.<br />
IT IS DIFFICULT TO WAIT EVEN A SHORT WHILE<br />
WHEN EMOTIONS AND SYMPATHIES ARE RUNNING HIGH FOR<br />
SOMETHING TO BE DONE AT ONCE, BUT IN TERMS OF REAL<br />
HELP WE DID WHAT WAS RIGHT.<br />
I DON'T THINK ANY AUSTRALIANS NEED FEEL ASHAMED<br />
OF THEIR GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO THE CRY FOR HELP<br />
DFROM OUR FELLOW MEMBER OF THE COMMONWEALTH.<br />
BEFORE I CLOSE ONE COMMENT ABOUT THE<br />
FUTURE. IF WE CAN CONTAIN INFLATION AND THIS IS A<br />
REALLY SERIOUS PROBLEM THEN I AM CONFIDENT WE CAN<br />
KEEP UP A GROWTH RATE OF OVER FIVE PER CENT IN OUR<br />
GNP EACH YEAR, AND GIVEN MORE FREEDOM FROM THE PROBLEMS<br />
I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED WE COULD EVEN DO MUCH BETTER<br />
THAN THAT. </p>
<p>BUT LET US NOT TIINK ONLY IN TERMS OF<br />
STATISTICS. TH-EY ARE DULL AND INHUMAN THINGS. LET UIS<br />
THINK RATHER IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE WE WANT<br />
FOR OURSELVES AND OUR CH-ILDREN.<br />
EACH ONE OF US HAS HIS OWN DEFINITION. IT<br />
IS BOUND UP WITH-HOW WE LIVE, WHERE WE LIVE, WHAT WE<br />
DO AND WHAT IS THE MEASURE OF OUR SATISFACTION AND<br />
HAPPINESS AS INDIVIDUALS IN A DEMO0CRATIC SOCIETY.<br />
GOVERNMENTS CAN THINK OF TI-E PROBLEMS OF<br />
LIVING IN TERMS OF URBAN PLANNING, OF PROTECTING THE<br />
ENVIRONMENT, CONTR~ OLL~ ING POLLUTION, HELPINGTHl-OSE IN<br />
NEED, ENCOURAGING THE ARTS.<br />
BUT IN THE FINAL RESULT IT IS THE WAY THE INDIVIDUAL<br />
RESPONDL'S, THE PART HE PLAYS IN ALL I HIS TH-AT MAKES UP TH-l<br />
QUALITY OF AUSTRALIAN LIFE.<br />
AND I THINK( THE FREEDOMS THAT GO WITH LIBERALISM<br />
AND WITH A FREE ENTERPRISE SOCIETY ARE THE ONES THAT<br />
ALLOW US TO MAK( E OUR QUALITY OF LIFE GOOD, REAL AND LASTING.<br />
I AM SURE OF THIS THE FUTURE OF QUEENSLAND, NO<br />
LESS THAN THE FUTURE OF AUSTRALIA, LIES IN THE HANDS OF THE<br />
LIBERAL-MINDED, CONTROL-FREE PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY.<br />
TH-AT IS HOW IT HAS BEEN FOR TWENTY-ONE YEARS OR<br />
MORE. LET US KEEP~ IT THAT WAY. I TH-ANK( YOU. </p>
