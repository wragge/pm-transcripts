GREAT SYNAGOGUE LUNCHEON<br />
SYDNEY, N. S. W. JUNE 1969<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
It is pleasant to be here and to talk to you at this luncheon;<br />
to talk to you as Australians of the Jewish faith. I have long believed<br />
your actions in the past and the present show that your community is not<br />
an alien community any more than those who attend St. Andrew's Day<br />
Dinners, or those perhaps more closely akin to my own forbears on one<br />
side who wear green on St. Patrick Day. Mind you, I'm Church of<br />
England I just want to make that clear:<br />
But rather are we Australians a people who have, over the<br />
years, come together from all corners of the world with differing religions,<br />
with differing cultures, with differing customs, with different histories to<br />
which we can look back but which should not condition all our thinking.<br />
For while history is what is past, in one sense, it also beckons to us to<br />
make it in the future in another sense. And a nation made of those who<br />
come from so many different areas, from those who come with so many<br />
different cultures, from those who have so many different things to<br />
contribute, must be richer, must be more able to bend the course of<br />
future history to its requirements, not as fragmented peoples, but as a<br />
nation and a people embracing all. And because I believe this is your<br />
belief and because I think in this approach lies true greatness for Australia<br />
in the future, this is why I said it was such pleasure for me to talk to you<br />
today. I have been called a nationalist, sometimes by my opponents<br />
who tend to twist this in a way I think it should not be twisted, but I am<br />
proud to admit to being a nationalist. I think that the future of this country<br />
requires we should all have a national identity, national goals, national<br />
aims and national pride. This should not be something shutting out the<br />
rest of the world because of our nationalism, for that would be to wrap<br />
ourselves up in a small parcel indeed and wrap out all the rest of the world.<br />
But rather it should be something creating as a nation, having a national<br />
pride, having something we can contribute to the general community of<br />
nations in our own right and of our own identity for the good of all, much<br />
as those members of a family, each with different capacities, each with<br />
difference approaches, each with different personalities, can contribute<br />
from themselves to the general family, as we can contribute to the family<br />
of the world. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
But to do that there is a need to meet requirements inside<br />
this country competing requirements, all of which cannot be met, or at<br />
least all of which cannot be met at once. It is easy enough seeing the needs<br />
that lie before us in all the various fields, it is easy enough to promise<br />
that they will all be done and they will all be done at once, but it is impossible<br />
to deliver on that promise and all men of sense known that this must be<br />
true. Let me sketch out for you some of the problems lying before<br />
us, calling for manpower, calling for capital, calling for technological<br />
expertise and you will see what I mean by competing claims.<br />
First, I suppose because this is the rock on which<br />
development and indeed existence must evemrally depend first is the<br />
requirement for our own national security and our own national defence<br />
against possible attack. History shows that no matter what a period may<br />
indicate to people, those who neglect security, those who neglect defence,<br />
do so ultimately at their own peril. And so we must devote a proportion<br />
of our manpower, a proportion of our resources, a proportion of our<br />
thought to building up defence forces ( insofar as a nation of twelve million<br />
can), and to forming alliances with greater countries who, seeing that we<br />
are prepared to help ourselves, will be prepared to come and help us in<br />
time of need. And we must, I believe, become involved in the region in<br />
which we live so that to the north of us, countries will see that we care<br />
about them, that we will help them not only economically, n~ ot only with<br />
aid, not only with training, but also that we are prepared to help them<br />
should they be attacked themselves.<br />
But here I want to make some qualifications. Up until now,<br />
we have been in a situation where we contributed because the defence of<br />
these regions to our north was the responsibility of Britain as, at the<br />
moment and for some short time ahead, it still will be. The responsibility<br />
for the defence was Britain's. She accepted that responsibility and sought<br />
assistance from the local populations. We cannot do that. We cannot take<br />
over responsibility for the defence of these areas and look for assistance<br />
from the local population. Rather is it our task to expect the local<br />
populations to assist themselves and to be ready to contribute to that<br />
joint defence, and this is the great difference between what was and what<br />
will be. In doing that and we have decided to do that we are, I think,<br />
acting in Australia's interests.<br />
But we are not giving blank cheques for the use of Australian<br />
youth by others. Our forces must be under our control. We are not giving<br />
a blank cheque for the use of Australian youth and the killing of Australian<br />
youth unless we are sure that this is done to prevent aggression, to prevent<br />
attack, and not done merely as an involvement in racial conflicts in a<br />
particular area. And it is well, and necessary, that everybody should<br />
understand this, because then there can be no danger in the future of any<br />
breach of faith. This has been made clear. This is one call upon our<br />
resources. </p>
<p>3-<br />
We have another in a sense a corollary with the first; the<br />
need to develop. We need to see that our mines come into production, that<br />
our factories are stocked with the latest machinery with the latest<br />
technological expertise, and with the latest scientific approach. We need<br />
to see that our factories extend and that we become a nation of industrial<br />
muscle, of strength within ourselves. This cannot be done quickly unless<br />
we attract from abroad large sums of capital and large numbers of people<br />
so that the requirements that I have spelt out can be met. This is being<br />
done, it must continue, it must be another call or, our Government resources<br />
because these things require that governments should put in roads, should<br />
put in power plants, should put in water supplies, should put in the ancillary<br />
requirements for such development should even, sometimes, please God,<br />
put in sewerage: But here, too, it is necessary ( having said this and believing<br />
it completely) to seek to ensure that these new developments will in their<br />
beginning be required to offer to the Australian people some chance of<br />
participation, This offer of some ownership by Australians should be made<br />
at the start, so that as these enterprises grow, as Australia grows, then<br />
the value of that initial participation will remain with Australians unless<br />
they choose themselves to sell it to somebody else.<br />
I used the word " offer". We are not going to be able in<br />
Australia to provide from our own resources all the capital that is<br />
required for all the development we need. I doubt if we are going to be able<br />
to provide from within Australia all the capital that is required for half of<br />
the development we need in the space of time in which we need it. But we<br />
can supply varying proportions to varying industries and we wish, and have<br />
let it be known that we expect that offers will be made for Australian equity<br />
participation in new developments, or in expanded development, and if those<br />
offers are not taken up, then that is Australia's fault and must not be allowed<br />
to inhibit progress. This is another great call on our manpower and on our<br />
resources and on our capital.<br />
I haven't yet touched on many other areas because I do<br />
believe, and you will know that I have said this, that it is necessary for a<br />
great country not only to have industrial muscles, not only to be materially<br />
great but to take care of those within it. In particular, I am speaking of<br />
those who, their own race having been run, having reached a certain age,<br />
ought to be able to live with some peace and some human dignity at the<br />
hands of their fellow Australians. There ought to be provision so that if<br />
some woman loses her husband and has a young family to bring up, that<br />
family has the same chances of education, of clothing, and of food, as they<br />
would have had had that woman's husband not died. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
And there is too an increasingly evident requirement that<br />
if citizens contribute during their working life to their own security, their<br />
own living after they retire, then they should not find themselves in a<br />
situation where they may be no. better off, and possibly even worse off<br />
than citizens existing solely on a pension paid by the State. This, I hasten<br />
to say, is not to be assumed to be any suggestion of abolishing the means<br />
test, because it isn't. It is merely a suggestion that there is an area of<br />
unfairness, an area of injustice, and that area of unfairness and injustice<br />
is one to which we must direct our minds. But this, too, calls for a great<br />
deal of our resources, a great deal of the taxes which you pay.<br />
And so, too, do demands for better education which we all<br />
want at least so do the calls for more money for education, which is not<br />
necessarily the same thing. But more money for education and a<br />
requirement that is directed towards better education call upon our resources,<br />
as do calls for better hospital services, better roads, and for many things<br />
which you appreciate and with which I will not weary you by enumerating.<br />
Another factor is the calls, the heartfelt calls for no higher taxation to<br />
meet all these requirements indeed for lower taxes if it is at all possible.<br />
And there is some justice well not justice, I'm not going<br />
to u--e that word but there is some sense in this because taxes must not<br />
get to a stage where they inhibit initiative, where they prevent the rewards<br />
for extra effort; because in this case we could not meet the other<br />
requirements which I have already mentioned. Wellt these are all calls.<br />
And there is the requirement to see that inflation is not allowed, because<br />
if it is, then we are merely kidding ourselves that we are advancing without<br />
in fact advancing at all. In a nation where less than one per cent is<br />
unemployed, in a nation where our resources and goods are used to their<br />
fullest as they are now, Lhe answer is not just issuing more money but<br />
rather more capital, more people and more effort from all sections of this<br />
community. Well, there will be arguments as to the priorities amongst<br />
the things I have mentioned and the many others you can add. They are<br />
right and proper arguments, but there can be no argument as to what I<br />
said initially that should anybody promise all these things all at once<br />
he will not be able to deliver on that promise. And as it is necessary that<br />
there should be these arguments as to priorities, then clearly they should<br />
be stated and judged by the people of Australia. And this is the course<br />
which we will follow and which, indeed, we have endeavoured to follow.<br />
It may take time it will take time to attain the goals of<br />
full social justice, to attain the goals of proper educational facilities, of<br />
roads which suit everybody, of hospitals which can care properly and<br />
cheaply for all the population, and for all the other things I have mentioned.<br />
But surely the proper course for a nation to follow and this is the one<br />
that we will try to follow is to set the goals, advance towards each one </p>
<p>and of necessity, realising the constrictions I have spoken of, advance<br />
over a period of time towards each one. This is inevitable, but with the<br />
nation knowing what the ultimate goals are and the steps that are hoped to<br />
be taken to reach them. This is what I regard as a prudent and proper<br />
and honest approach to the Australian people and this is the one we have<br />
been following and will follow. And this is the one, I think, most men of<br />
good sense and judgment will accept as the proper course for an Australian<br />
Government. Indeed, to finish, Sir, where I began, and to add one other<br />
reason for my pleasure in speaking to you this afternoon, it is because I<br />
think there would be within this hall such men of good judgment, of good<br />
sense, of proper approach as would agree with and would support what we<br />
have done and what we propose to do. Sir, we will make mistakes in the<br />
years as we approach these problems. That is inevitable, for no man, no<br />
woman, no government is perfect. But should such mistakes be made, they<br />
will be honest mistakes. They will be admitted. They will be rectified.<br />
And that, I think, is what the nation of Australia wants. At any rate, I<br />
hope so, and I thank you for the chance of speaking to you. </p>
