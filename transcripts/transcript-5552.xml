PRIME MINISTER WEDNESDAY, 25 MARCH, 1981<br />
From the Press Office<br />
SUMMARY OF ABC'S 12: 30 pm NEW<br />
The latest spy story in the London Daily Mail serial on spying<br />
says a former British Labour Party-Chairman and MP, Mr Dr'. erg.(?)<br />
was a double agent, working for the KGB and MI 5. The report<br />
says he gave details . of the personal and political activities<br />
of his parliamentary colleagues to both the KGB and MI 5.<br />
He was apparently feeding information from the. time he entered<br />
Parliament in 1942 to his retirement in 1974, and afterwards<br />
when he became a member of the Houseof Lords. He died in 1976.<br />
The Daily Mail story-says Mr Driberg was a well known homosexual<br />
repeatedly caught either procurring or committing a homosexual<br />
act in public places. But it is claimed that British intelligence<br />
officials put a mantle of protection around him. The report<br />
also says that both the M15 and the KGB knew he was working<br />
for the other side and saught to use him for their own ends.<br />
The Prime Minister is to be briefed by officials on. the Daidy<br />
Mail report that a former head of MI 5, Sir Roger Hollis, may<br />
have been a Soviet spy.<br />
The Foreign Affairs Minister says the stand by the Opposition<br />
leader on the B52s agreement with the United States indicates<br />
a capitulation to the ALP's extreme left. He aiso says Mr Hayden's<br />
stand calls into question the Opposition leader's competence in<br />
foreign relations. Mr Hayden said yesterday that the B52 agreement<br />
did not contain adequate safeguards, aid that a Labor government<br />
would renegotiate it to rule out any possibility of the bombers<br />
carrying nuclear warheads over Australian soil. In a statement<br />
in Canberra this morning, Mr Street said Mr Hayden had made<br />
blatantly incorrect assertions about the agreement. The word<br />
of Australia's principle ally had been called into question.<br />
Mr Street said Mr Hayden had made careless assertions relating<br />
to the US undertaking that it would notify Australia of any<br />
change in the role of its B52s staging through Darwin, and<br />
to assert there was qo formal agreement was totally untrue.<br />
He said, Mr Hayden, through his statement, had rejected a<br />
bi-partisan approach to a matter fundamental to Australia's<br />
security.<br />
The Polish parliament is to hold a special-session on Monday<br />
to discuss the threat of a national strike. The session was<br />
announced after Solidarity said a four hour warning strike<br />
on Friday would be followed by an indefinite stoppage next<br />
Tuesday. The Communist Party secretary called the move an<br />
invitation to self destruction, and Polish television said<br />
parliament was being convened because of the gravity of the<br />
situation.<br />
Leaders of the 10 EEC countries have ended their summit meeting<br />
with a warni4' that the Polis. people must be allowed to deal<br />

visit to Poland and urged his partners to continue to help<br />
the Poles. / 2 </p>

significant drop in the. price of fresh fruit. The Bureau of<br />

Africa's senior sports administrator, Mr Ordia, in Canberra<br />
for talks with the Prime Minister this morning, has spoken<br />
with new optimism of the planned Springbok of New, Zealand..<br />
might be cancelled. Mr Ordia had separate discussions at<br />
Parliament House with Mr Fraser and Mr Street. As Barry<br />
Cassidy reports, they spoke of the threat of an African<br />
boycott of the Commonwealth Games in Brisbane if the<br />
rubgy tour of New Zealand went ahead.<br />
Barry Cassidy<br />
The Prime Minister and Mr Ordia agreed on one thing that ax4<br />
danger to the Commonwealth Games arose from events over<br />
which Australia had not direct control. In other words the<br />
Springbok tour of New Zealand. But today after the talks<br />
Mr Ordia refused to accept the tour as a fait accompli. So<br />
had he been given new information?<br />
Mr Ordia<br />
No, I am very optimistic.<br />
Question<br />
What do you base your message on sir?<br />
Mr Ordia<br />
Human conscience. Common sense.<br />
Barry Cassidy<br />
If Mr Ordia's optimism proves false would Australia consider<br />
banning New Zealand from the Commonwealth Games and save<br />
a black African boycott?<br />
Mr Fraser<br />
I think that that is jumping far too far down a tank. I think<br />
save the Games as though a boycott of the Games is imminent<br />
and that is not the position.<br />
The Reagan administration plans to double economic aid to El Salvador<br />
this -year to more than $ 126 million. The extra spending is<br />

aid and the economic package. would make it by far the biggest<br />
recipient of American aid in Latin America. / 3 </p>
