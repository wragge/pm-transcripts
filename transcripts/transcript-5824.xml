CONVENTrION OF THE TASMANIAN YOUNG LIBERAL MOVEMENT<br />
I am delighted to be with you in Tasmania today not<br />
only as this occasion marks the Young Liberal Movement's<br />
first quarter century, but also because this is the<br />
first time I have come to Tasmania since your<br />
magnificent election victory three weeks ago. That<br />
victory, under Robin Gray's leadership, represents a<br />
turning point in Tasmanian politics and in the<br />
development of this State. It is the first time a<br />
Liberal Government has been elected in its own right in<br />
Tasmania. Policies designed to restore confidence and growth to<br />
the Tasmanian economy can now be implemented. Efficient<br />
procedures for public administration can now come into<br />
operation. This State will undoubtedly benefit from<br />
having a Liberal Government, pursuing liberal<br />
objectives, and acting in the interests of all<br />
Tasmanians. The Young Li'b eral Movement has a role to play in<br />
this, and the standing enjoyed by the Young Liberal<br />
Movement wit~ hin the Liberal Party recognises the<br />
important contribution which young people have to make<br />
to the affairs of this nation. The constructive<br />
achievements of Liberalism grow out of a vision of what<br />
Australia can be. It is only through Liberal policies<br />
that this vision can be realised. And the greatest<br />
contribution of Liberalism to the building of modern<br />
Australia hais been its ability to define and keep to a<br />
role for government which permits the Australian people<br />
to express :' 6anc tion their values and their abilities.<br />
The Liberal Party has clearly defined ideals which have<br />
their effective expression in the policies we pursue and<br />
I want to outline the substance of these ideals, and the<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>direction in which they are leading Australia. The<br />
first ideal is a belief in Australia, in Australians and<br />
in what the Australian people can achieve when<br />
Government permits them to strive after the things they<br />
value, rat~ her than trying to impose some political<br />
ideology onto them.<br />
It is impossible to think of a field in which<br />
Australians have not recorded outstanding<br />
achievement but there is one field where achievement<br />
underpins opportunities in most others the field of<br />
economic life. In the last three years Australia has<br />
swum againist the tide of the world recession our economy<br />
has grown, real incomes have grown. This has taken<br />
place at a time when a tighter rein has been kept on<br />
Government spending in Australia than in probably any<br />
other industrial country.<br />
It is of the greatest importance for Australia that the<br />
gains we have made should be maintained and strengthened<br />
that we should redouble our determination to live within<br />
our means as a nation and reject the Labor fantasy that<br />
letting spending run out once more will stimulate the<br />
economy. Let there be no question about itI the whole<br />
thrust of the policies we have put in place have been<br />
directed towards putting more real dollars in people's<br />
pockets and through the growth that has been achieved.<br />
We have already been successful in that.<br />
There may always be a need for adjustments to the<br />
details of policy as circumstances vary and the<br />
Government takes account of that. As our housing package<br />
and other initiatives plainly illustrate for that<br />
package, which balances sound economic management with<br />
broader social objectives, provides help where help is<br />
most needed in support of the great Australian goal of<br />
home ownership.<br />
I Our overall policy approach has given the Australian<br />
economy great underlying strength a massive renovation<br />
has been achieved since we came to power in 1975 and the<br />
cracks in the foundations repaired. Sound Government<br />
has made it possible by unleashing the abilities and<br />
enterprise of the Australian people themselves. A<br />
second ideal which motivates Liberals is a belief in<br />
excellence. We believe it is in the interests of<br />
everyone if individuals are encouraged to achieve to<br />
their utmost according to their abilities. And we have<br />
given high priority to excellence in a number of areas.<br />
We have transferred resources to areas where excellence<br />
can be encouraged in the revival of Australian films, in<br />
establishing the Institute of Sport, in nearly doubling<br />
NHMRC medical research grants in the last two years and<br />
in recent. grants for centres of excellence in Australian / 3 </p>
<p>universities. In addition, we have encouraged people to<br />
develop a wide range of abilities to a high level,<br />
emphasising the expansion of opportunities for young<br />
Australians to acquire the technical and other skills<br />
they need to take full advantage of the resurgence of<br />
enterprise and development our policies have<br />
encouraged. Since 1975, Commonwealth spending on<br />
Technical And Further Education and on training schemes<br />
has increased by 83.2% in real terms.<br />
A third belief which underlies the policies of modern<br />
Liberalism is the belief that the cultural and ethnic<br />
diversity of Australia can be a source of great strength<br />
and creativity. The ideal of the multicultural society<br />
recognises diversity as one of the main supports of the<br />
Liberal belief in freedom, and it has been expressed in<br />
many ways in our policies through the Galbally programs,<br />
which were implemented following our acceptance of the<br />
Galbally report in 1978 and which are currently being<br />
reviewed to ensure their continuing effectiveness and<br />
relevance; through the Institute of Multicultural<br />
Affairs, which is helping people understand the value of<br />
cultural and ethnic diversity in Australian life; through<br />
multicultural television and through immigration from a<br />
wider range of countries, including Asian countries..<br />
I believe the scope of our policies in this area is<br />
without parallel in the world and Australia is<br />
undoubtedly deriving great strength from the rich<br />
cultural resources now to be found among the Australian<br />
people. A fourth ideal which has motivated this Government is a<br />
strong and safe Australia. Strength and safety are to a<br />
significant extent, of course, functions of defence and<br />
foreign policy. Our commitment to the Western Alliance,<br />
and to the modernisation and build-up of our independent<br />
military forces is well known. We are now in the middle<br />
of a defence re-equipment program costing more than<br />
billion and we now have, in the words of the recently<br />
retired Chief of the Defence Force Staff, the best<br />
equipped and best-trained force we have ever had in<br />
peacetime. Our commitment to a safe and secure Australia is linked<br />
to a fifth. ideal which has motivated the policies of<br />
this Government the ideal of an Australia which can do<br />
something positive to help in relieving the terrible<br />
conditions. of poverty, disease and oppression which<br />
exist for hundreds of millions of the world's people.<br />
In recent years Australia has been a leader among<br />
industrialised countries in getting a fairer deal for<br />
developing~ countries in world markets. We'have been a<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>4.<br />
leading source of initiatives through the Commonwealth,<br />
and our proposals for consideration in the context of<br />
the Versailles Summit can be seen as a significant step<br />
towards breaking the current global negotiations impasse<br />
because of their benefits to developing nations.<br />
In addition to these initiatives, our constant attempts<br />
to strengthen human rights and to combat racism has had<br />
a great effect in improving and enhancing the view which<br />
other nations take of Australia as a concerned and<br />
outward-lcoking nation. Our capacity to help people in<br />
other countries as well as at home is very much related<br />
to our economic strength. The solution to poverty is<br />
not higher taxes and bigger bureaucracy, it is economic<br />
growth and. a proper concentration of help on those in<br />
need.<br />
This brincs me to a sixth ideal reflected in the<br />
priorities; of modern liberalism the ideal of an<br />
Australia where economic strength enables ever improving<br />
provision for the disadvantaged and those in need. We<br />
are committed to a strong and effective system of social<br />
security. It should never be forgotten that Liberalism<br />
establishEd the system of federal old age and invalid<br />
pensions and in fact social security and welfare<br />
spending is the largest single item in our budget,<br />
amounting to over $ 11 billion.<br />
Despite economic conditions and despite the great<br />
increase in social security and welfare spending in the<br />
early seventies, we have actually increased the total<br />
real leve. of spending in this area while concentrating<br />
assistance more on those in need. Our health scheme<br />
provides for free health care for some three million<br />
Australians, while giving incentives for those on higher<br />
incomes to insure themselves and effective social<br />
security and welfare arrangements will always remain one<br />
of the top priorities of modern liberalism.<br />
Liberal programs have expressed another ideal which is<br />
now added to the list : the ideal of an Australia which<br />
is governed in the interests of all, in the public<br />
interest, and not on behalf of special interests. The<br />
pressure on Government by special interests for<br />
privileges is unceasing. Most interests argue, and<br />
believe, -that they are acting in the public interest but<br />
the truth is that they are often acting in their own.<br />
Resisting such pressures, which has been closely linked<br />
with our success in holding spending in check, has been<br />
one of the real achievements of this government and it<br />
has also helped to spread a greater sense of realism in<br />
the commun~ ity about what is possible and desirable.<br />
Labor is of course particularly vulnerable here, not<br />
only becaase demands for more money and restrictive </p>
<p>regulation~ are music to its ears but because it is<br />
actually the political agent for s~ fll' of the most<br />
extreme trade unioni interests in the country,<br />
a relationship highlighted here in Tasmania in<br />
the last twelve months.<br />
This brings me to another of the ideals we have sought<br />
to realise. in Government the ideal of a society in<br />
which there is a balance in the power of the large<br />
private institutions of business and trade unions in<br />
which neither is strong enough to dominate, and in which<br />
both are checked by the power of Government, the rights<br />
and freedo'ms of individuals, and their own good sense<br />
and co-operative attitudes. Under Labor, government<br />
becomes a partisan on behalf of extremists in the trade union<br />
movement, supporting massive wage increases and the<br />
obstruction of business profits, and granting new legal<br />
privileges, to the union movement.<br />
The Govern~ ment believes that the excessive power of left-wing<br />
unions relative to other interest groups in Australia<br />
was one of' the deep-seated sources of cost push<br />
inflation in Australia during the 1970' s. It is, of<br />
course, entirely predictable that Labor as a special<br />
interest party has undertaken to repeal much of our<br />
industrial legislation, and remove the checks and<br />
balances we are building into the system in the public<br />
interest. In the Liberal view it is only under conditions of<br />
balance that we will see conflict more often replaced<br />
with a spirit of compromise and conciliation. Such a<br />
willingness to compromise and co-operate is necessary<br />
if, for example, there are to be realistic prospects of<br />
extending collective bargaining in Australia.<br />
Strengthening the rights of individuals against large<br />
organisations whether business, union or Government<br />
has long been a Liberal ideal and one which has<br />
received the enthusiastic endorsement of Young Liberals.<br />
We have taken a number of historic steps to protect<br />
individual rights, including most recently the Human<br />
Rights Comrmission and our Freedom of Information<br />
legislation. Our belief in ensuring that rights and<br />
freedom are protected, and power is decentralised, has<br />
particular bearing on our ideals in relation to the<br />
structure of Government itself. Our ideal is Government<br />
which is strong, efficient, economical and effective,<br />
but not centralised in Canberra; not bureaucratic or<br />
domineering. I mention two of the major ways in which we have given<br />
practical expression to this ideal for Government in the<br />
last six years. </p>
<p>One is by returning to the States significant<br />
independent powers in financial matters, and in the<br />
control of offshore lands. Between 1975-76 and 1981-82<br />
the proportion of untied Commonwealth payments to the<br />
States has risen from 51% to over 65% and the proportion<br />
of total Commonwealth Budget outlays accounted for by<br />
untied payments to the States has also risen. The<br />
financial interests of all States, including Tasmania,<br />
have been protected through these policies.<br />
The other has been through the most extensive<br />
ministerial review of the functions of the Commonwealth<br />
Government in the history of Australia the Review of<br />
Commonwealth Functions.<br />
The historic commitment of Liberalism to moderate and<br />
evolutionary reform has been an essential element in our<br />
record of constructive achievement. Liberals build on<br />
the achievement of the past, while striving towards<br />
ideals yet unrealised. Our approach to constitutional<br />
reform is evidence of this and people should not forget<br />
that while 7 of the 17 constitutional amendments put<br />
before the people by Liberal Governments since<br />
Federation have been successful, only one of the 19<br />
amendments put forward by Labor has been accepted by the<br />
people. There is a reason for this contrast. Successful<br />
constitutional reform requires that the proposed<br />
amendments express or are not obnoxious to, the values<br />
of the Australian people. The Australian people value<br />
the regime of decentralised Federal Government in our<br />
constitution and have rejected again and again<br />
Labor's proposals to concentrate more power in Canberra.<br />
The present Government has introduced more successful<br />
constitutional amendments than any other Government in<br />
Australia and we have recently suggested to the States a<br />
further session of the Constitutional Convention for it<br />
is proper that our Constitution should continue to<br />
evolve through mechanisms such as this.<br />
This brings me to the last of ideals we have sought to<br />
put into practice in the last six years the ideal of<br />
an Australia which has the foresight to conserve its<br />
heritage and to hand on what is of value to future<br />
generations. Our record in conserving Australia's<br />
magnificent natural heritage takes second place to no<br />
Australian Government, Federal or State at any time.<br />
Fraser Island, Kakadu National Park, the Great Barrier<br />
Reef Marine Park, Anti-Whaling legislation and many<br />
other initiatives all stand as symbols of a practical<br />
ideal realised and we remain committed to that<br />
objective. / 7 </p>
<p>But there is more to our historic heritage than our<br />
natural environment, or historic artifacts and<br />
buildings. Our most valuable inheritance from the past,<br />
and the most valuable bequest we can make to the future<br />
is the heritage of humane values and ideals. Those<br />
values are our real treasure.<br />
We who practise our politics in the Liberal tradition<br />
believe that it is Liberalism whose ideals and<br />
understandings can best realise those values. We must<br />
never lose sight of these ideals, and in pursuing them<br />
we have a duty to be responsive to changing<br />
circumstances and seize the opportunities to create a<br />
more secure and prosperous society.<br />
As Young Liberals, you have an active and important role<br />
to play in the process of policy formation in our Party<br />
and a vital role in carrying the Liberal message to the<br />
whole community. I am confident that the enthusiasm<br />
and dedication of Tasmania's Young Liberals over the<br />
last twenty-five years will continue to serve the<br />
Liberal Party and the ideals of Liberalism in the<br />
interests of all Tasmanians and all Australians.<br />
