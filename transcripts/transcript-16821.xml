    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon and ACT Minister for Health, Katy Gallagher today officially opened two new operating theatres at the Canberra Hospital.</p>
<p>$4.68 million was provided by the Rudd Government to build the two new operating theatres, two anaesthetic rooms, a pump room, a sterile room and a scrub area.</p>
<p>The funding is part of Stage 2 of the Rudd Government's Elective Surgery Waiting List Reduction Plan, investing $600 million to improve hospital services and reduce surgery waiting times.</p>
<p>This Enhanced Operating Theatre Complex will complement the ten existing theatres to reduce elective surgery waiting times.</p>
<p>One theatre will accommodate general surgeries such as vascular and orthopaedic procedures, whilst the other will support cardiac-thoracic surgeries such as thoracic cancer surgery, coronary artery grafts, chest trauma and valve replacements.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government is taking concrete steps to improve Australia's health and hospital system after twelve years of neglect by the previous Liberal Government.</p>
<p>These investments highlight the Government's strategy of targeting key pressure points in our health system, such as elective surgery and emergency care. These investments will continue to flow while further consultations are conducted on long term reform options.</p>
<p>The announcement was made at the latest consultation in the Rudd Government's round of meetings to discuss improving the health care system.</p>
<p>The Canberra Hospital consultation is the second ACT consultation and the 24th across the country to road-test the National Health and Hospital Reform Commission's proposed reforms.</p>
<p>The National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission report made recommendations for system-wide changes to Australian health care. </p>
<p>At today's Canberra Hospital consultation the Prime Minister and Minister Roxon outlined the Commission's recommendations and met with medical deans, the AMA and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners - discussing their priorities to improve health services around the country. </p>
<p>All Australians are also able to contribute to the national debate on our health system via the yourHealth.gov.au website - and full copies of the reports can be found there. </p>
