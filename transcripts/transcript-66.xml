FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 14/ 1959<br />
STATEMENT BY THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER. RT. HON. J, McEWEN.<br />
The Federal Cabinet has not, as reported, approved a<br />
five-year plan for the development of Canberra at a cost of<br />
million from ist July next.<br />
No decision in these terms has been made and the<br />
programme for governmental works and housing in Canberra will<br />
continue to be subject to the normal annual budget procedures.<br />
Cabinet has given consideration to plans for the<br />
development of Canberra and has decided that, in addition to<br />
providing, at broadly the present level of expenditure, for<br />
the essential requirements such as engineering services and<br />
housing arising out of the planned transfer of Departments to<br />
Canberra and the normal growth of Canberra, it should be the<br />
objective to provide for the introduction of some features to<br />
develop the national character of the capital.<br />
A programme of the order of Å“ 3 million, spread over<br />
the next five years, was envisaged for these special features.<br />
A specific decision by Cabinet would still be necessary before<br />
any particular project was coir~ nenced. Cabinet had authorised<br />
work on the Lakes Scheme to begin without delay.<br />
CANBERRA, A. C. T.<br />
1st May, 1959. </p>
