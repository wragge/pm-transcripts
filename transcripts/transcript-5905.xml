FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 12 SEPTEMBER 1982<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
It was my Government, with the previous Liberal Government<br />
in Victoria, which set up the Costigan Royal Commission, and<br />
the Commission's findings have validated that decision<br />
a thousand fold. We set the Commission up because we were<br />
determined to get to the bottom of the stories about evil and<br />
crime associated with the notorious Painters and Dockers' Union,<br />
and my Government is now totally determined to eradicate the<br />
criminality and fraud that is exposed.<br />
Australians everywhere are disturbed that corruption and<br />
organised crime on such a scale exists in our community.<br />
Eradicating it will in many cases call for new techniques,<br />
drawing upon the computer applications Mr Costigan has pioneered,<br />
and matching the sophistication of modern cheats and criminals.<br />
The critics of this Royal Commmission and there were some have<br />
been silenced. Mr Cain, for example, can no longer label the<br />
Commission a " political stunt" as he did earlier this year,<br />
and I only hope his new-found enthusiasm for the Commission's<br />
work will be matched by effective practical action under state<br />
law, and in relation to the Painters and Dockers' affiliation<br />
with the Labor Party.<br />
My Government is taking immediate action on several fronts, legislation<br />
enablinq the appointment of a special prosecutor for bottom of the harbour<br />
tax evasion schemes was passed through the House of Representatives<br />
last week. and a task force of police, taxation officers and<br />
lawfyers to assist the special prosecutor is already established.<br />
Further task forces will be established as required for specific<br />
areas of criminal activity. The inaction within the Deputy<br />
Crown Solicitor's Perth Of fice on prosecutions has led to the<br />
suspension and charging of three officers. Mr Tony Smith has<br />
been nominated by the President of the Law Council of Australia<br />
to conduct an examination of the Perth Office and ' the staffing<br />
needs of the Crown Solicitor's Division are being investigated.<br />
At the Government's request, Mr Costigan consented to the<br />
publication of an important chapter of the confidential part of<br />
the Report. That chapter was immediately made public last<br />
week, and it shows the extent of organised crime in Australia.<br />
Mr Costigan has asked that the rest of the Report should not<br />
be made public at this stage, partly because doing so could damage<br />
the Commission's current investigations, and partly because<br />
publication now would make it impossible for people who will<br />
be charged with of fences to get a fair trial. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
My Government accepts Mr Costigan's requests unreservedly.<br />
Anyone who believes in fairness, and in the importance of<br />
Mr Costigan's work, would obviously accept the need for<br />
confidentiality at this stage. This is why I have condemned<br />
absolutely the deliberate way Mr Hayden has been dropping hints<br />
about who is named in the reports, and smearing groups within<br />
the Australian community. Because of Mr Hayden's tactic, the<br />
entire Australian community has a right to know that Mr Costigan<br />
wrote to me about the speculation on the confidential parts<br />
of his reports and said: " It would be quite inaccurate to draw<br />
any specific inference as to what names might appear in those<br />
volumes, . or whether they come from any particular state or<br />
territory or country or have associations with any political<br />
organisation or group".<br />
I also want to say something about the recovery of unpaid<br />
taxation, because Mr Costigan's findings have highlighted this<br />
issue, although the Government had already announced action before the<br />
budget, and before the Report was published.-The tax avoiCdani industry has been<br />
effectively attacked by earlier legislation, we will continue to<br />
be vigilant and act against new schemes, and the main question<br />
now is to recoup taxes avoided by those who have used the<br />
bottom of the harbour schemes. The Government will legislate<br />
to recover taxes that were unpaid as a result of bottom of the<br />
harbour schemes. It is important for people to know how<br />
bottom of the harbour schemes worked, because I do not believe<br />
anyone could have taken part without knowing they were wrong.<br />
Let me try and explain it in these terms. If there is a company<br />
with say $ 100 worth of assets, plus $ 10 tax due to be paid<br />
to the Commonwealth, and somebody comed along and says, look,<br />
" I can buy that company off you, all you will have to do is<br />
give me the company papers, and then you will be able to keep<br />
for yourselves the $ 100 for the assets and the $ 10 of tax,<br />
you won't have to pay the tax, all you will have to do is<br />
pay me a commission of $ 2 for the deal." The promotor, having<br />
got his commission, then dumped the papers inthe bottom of the<br />
har~ bour. But how could the seller have failed t~ o know he<br />
was doing something wrong by getting out of the tax liability<br />
in this way? The Government had decided to legislate to recover<br />
this unpaid tax because of our determination that people should<br />
not escape or avoid their fAir share of taxes.<br />
I know some people have concerns about retrospectivity, no<br />
Liberal likes retrospectivity. But I believe it is even more<br />
important to demonstrate our total commitment to a tax system<br />
which operates in a fair way, because any loss of confidence<br />
by average Australians in the fairness of the system would<br />
undermine the way of life we believe in.<br />
The principle of fairness is absolutely fundamental for<br />
Liberals, it is more fundamental than any other principle,<br />
certainly more fundamental than any element of retrospectivity<br />
in the proposed legislation. The Liberal Party<br />
was founded to govern fairly in the interests of all<br />
Australians, and fairness is a principle basic to Liberals<br />
and support for this principle is absolutely fundamental to<br />
Liberal thinking, and I would not want to lead or be part of<br />
any party which failed to stand by that principle. </p>
<p>3<br />
There is another issue Mr Costigan raised, the need to " have<br />
available a prosecuting arm charaed with the responsibility<br />
of immediately attending to any prosecutions that may arise<br />
in the course of the Commission" ( 10.59). The Government<br />
has already established a special prosecutor and this goes<br />
a long way to satisfying Mr Costigan's aims. However, in the<br />
long term, it is fundamental that there be established a body<br />
which both has an investigative and prosecuting role and it<br />
is with this objective that my Government has proposed the<br />
establishment of a National Crimes Commission. Only a<br />
body invested with such powers will have the capacity to deal<br />
effectively with modern crime.<br />
Mr Costigan's findings clearly emphasise that traditional<br />
law enforcement methods have failed.. This is most evident<br />
in New South Wales as reports of Royal Commissions and task<br />
forces over recent years have demonstrated.... I believe that<br />
the seriousness of Mr Costigan's findings, the apparent depth<br />
and strength of organised crime in Australia, demonstrates the<br />
need for a properly structured National Crimes Commission,<br />
and I very much hope that the states will be willing to join<br />
with the Commonwealth in this. Australia needs law enforcement<br />
agencies which are adequate to understand and root out modern<br />
crime, and my Government is determined to do everything in<br />
its power to achieve these objectives. The positive action<br />
we are taking and proposing all leads in this direction, and it<br />
is all totally consistent with Mr Costigan's proposals.<br />
My Government's record on the Costigan findings is one of<br />
positive action and resolve. It stands in stark contrast<br />
with the barren and baseless politicking of our opponents.<br />
Mr Hayden is to be congratulated on his move to disaffiliate<br />
the Painters and Dockers' Union from the ALP. But Parliament<br />
will be degraded if Mr Hayden continues to heap blame on<br />
categories of people who are not even named in the Report.<br />
I will condemn that tactic whether it is practised by Mr Hayden,<br />
or by any member of any party, including my own.<br />
So far as my Government is concerned, we will be getting on<br />
with the job, taking positive action in the light of the<br />
Commission's findings, and along the lines it soundly proposes. </p>
