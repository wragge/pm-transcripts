    <content><![CDATA[<p>11 DECEMBER 1988</p>
<p>I join the Foreign Affairs Minister, Gareth Evans, in expressing my deep sorrow'and regret at the death yesterday of the Australian High Commissioner to New Zealand, Mr Bill McKinnon, CBE.</p>
<p>Mr McKinnon contributed very significantly to the Australian Public Service through his long and distinguished career.</p>
<p>He held a series of senior positions in Australian policy departments prior to his appointment as High Commissioner to New Zealand in 1987. As General Manager, later Director of  the Australian Industry Development Corporation  between 1972-1976 he played a very major part in the establishment and development of the Corporation. He served with distinction as Chairman of the Industries Assistance Commission and as Secretary of the then Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.</p>
<p>I extend my deepest sympathy to Mr McKinnon's wife and family. </p>
