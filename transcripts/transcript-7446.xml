    <content><![CDATA[<p>11 DECEMBER 1988</p>
<p>I join the Foreign Affairs Minister, Gareth Evans, inÂ expressing my deep sorrow'and regret at the death yesterdayÂ of the Australian High Commissioner to New Zealand, Mr BillÂ McKinnon, CBE.</p>
<p>Mr McKinnon contributed very significantly to the AustralianÂ Public Service through his long and distinguished career.</p>
<p>He held a series of senior positions in Australian policyÂ departments prior to his appointment as High Commissioner toÂ New Zealand in 1987. As General Manager, later Director of Â the Australian Industry Development Corporation Â betweenÂ 1972-1976 he played a very major part in the establishmentÂ and development of the Corporation. He served withÂ distinction as Chairman of the Industries AssistanceÂ Commission and as Secretary of the then Department ofÂ Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.</p>
<p>I extend my deepest sympathy to Mr McKinnon's wife andÂ family.Â </p>
