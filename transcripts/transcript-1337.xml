STATEMENT BY TI T. HON, 1. J. MCEWEN,<br />
ACTING PRIME MINISTER AND MINISTER FOR TRADE A. ND INDUYh<br />
ON HIS RETURN TO AUSTRALIA FROM OVERSEAS, 28th JUNLE 1966<br />
The Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Trade<br />
and Industry, Mr. John McEwen, returned to Australia today,<br />
following trade discussions and negotiations in the United Kingdom<br />
and Europe. Mr. McEwen said that the primary purpose of his visit<br />
was to attend the Commonwealth Trade Ministers' Meeting in London,<br />
from 13th to 16th June.<br />
" The range of items raised at this meeting," said<br />
Mr. McEwen, " included several that were of major importance to<br />
Australia. The Meeting also afforded the opportunity for<br />
bilateral talks before and during the Conference with Ministers<br />
from other Commonwealth countries on matters of significant<br />
interest to Australia and these individual members of the Commonwealth."<br />
U~ iITED KINGDOM AND EUROPE.<br />
Mr. McEwen said the Meeting of Commonwealth Trade<br />
Ministers was given added emphasis and importance by the recent<br />
statement of the United Kingdom Government that they would be<br />
ready to enter the European Economic Community, provided essential<br />
British and Commonwealth interests were safeguarded.<br />
The Meeting received the assurance of the British<br />
Government that there would be made available to Commonwealth<br />
Governments the maximum information possible on the progress of<br />
exploratory discussions with the and that at all stages<br />
of any negotiations there would be close consultation with other<br />
Commonwealth Governments. The Minister said the attitude of the Australian<br />
Government towards British entry to the E. E. C. was the same as it<br />
had always been since the possibility of British entry had arisen;<br />
namely, that the decision as to whether or not Britain should enter<br />
Europe was one for the British Govtrinient alone. </p>
<p>" But if sach entry viere being actively canvassed,"<br />
said Mr. McEwen, " then the time for consultations with Australia<br />
cn matters which vitally affected our trading interests was<br />
' earlier rather than later'. As had been the case during Britain's<br />
negotiations with the Community in 1961 and 1962, we wanted to be<br />
sure that both Britain and the Six clearly understood the extent<br />
of the dependence of certain Australian industries on their right<br />
to sell on the British market. Following the London discussions,<br />
I have no doubt that opportunities for the necessary consultations<br />
will be afforded Australia."<br />
COMMODITIES. Mr. McEwen said that one of the major items discussed<br />
at the Commonwealth Trade Ministers' Meeting was the disturbing<br />
trend of prices for a number of primary commodities which were of<br />
crucial importance to many Commonwealth countries.<br />
The ruinously low price of sugar on the so-called<br />
" free" market is the most serious and immediate commodity price<br />
problem facing Australia and the many other Commonwealth countries<br />
which are important sugar exporters.<br />
Mr. McEwen said that, of the total world consumption<br />
of sugar of around 60 million tons, about three-quarters was<br />
consumed in the countries in which it was produced. Producers<br />
obtained the benefits of protected local markets for this share of<br />
the total markct. The remaining one-quarter of total consumption<br />
represented sugar traded internationally. About half of this amount<br />
was bought and sold in accordance with inter-Governmental agreements<br />
or special arrangements, under which sugar exporters obtained fair<br />
and reasonable prices. Th. re. a: ini. ng seven or eight million tons,<br />
however, was sold on the ' free'" mark-t, and the prices received<br />
for " free" market sales the so-called " world price" of sugar<br />
drastically affected the position of sugar producers in countries<br />
which sold large quantities of sugar on the " free" market. </p>
<p>3.<br />
In the case of Australia, almost three-quarters of<br />
our exports from the 1966 crop will be sold at prices based on<br />
the " free" market quotations. A variation of Å E5 stg. per ton in<br />
the " free" market price could mean about 016 million to the<br />
Australian sugar industry and, of course, also to the Australian<br />
balance of payments. At the time of the London meeting, the so-called<br />
world price of sugar had fallen to less than Å-17 stg. per ton for<br />
raw sugar, the lowest level since the 1930' s. It had since<br />
fallen to Å-16 stg. per ton, less than half the price required to<br />
provide a remunerative return to even the most efficient sugar<br />
industries in the world.<br />
Mr. McEwen said this was an intolerable situation.<br />
" The present ' world' price," he said, " means a return of less<br />
than 2 cents a lb. to exporters of sugar, whereas the average<br />
price paid by consumers is about 8 cents per lb. in terms of raw<br />
sugar. International action to raise substantially the twrd<br />
price of sugar is an urgent necessity."<br />
Mr. McEwen said that, unfortunately, negotiations<br />
aimed at securing a new and satisfactory International Sugar<br />
Agreement were not making the progress which had been hoped for.<br />
The unanimous declaration by Commonwealth countries at the London<br />
meeting of Trade Ministers that they would join in supporting<br />
effective arrangements to get a better sugar price was a most<br />
helpful step forward. In his opinion, the Meeting of Commonwealth Trade<br />
Ministers had been most worthwhile if for no other reason than<br />
that Ministers from all countries had declared themselves,<br />
unanimously and unambiguously, as being determined to achieve an<br />
improvement in the sugar price situation.<br />
Mr. MoEwen said that he had referred particularly<br />
to zugar because this is a commodity of paramount importance to<br />
Australia and to the development of the North, and to many other<br />
Commonwealth countries. Dit tlip Mpeting hadl also ounsidered the </p>
<p>problems of other bulk cormmodities and the action needed to<br />
improve the conditions of trade in regard to them. Wheat, meat<br />
and dairy products are examples of bulk commodities of particular<br />
interest to Australia, while tin, rubber, cocoa and coffee are<br />
among commodities of great concern to a number of other Commonwealth<br />
countries and to Papua and New Guinea.<br />
The Meeting had agreed on the objectives to be<br />
sought in present and future international commodity negotiations<br />
on these commodities. Mr. McEwen said he was sure this would<br />
result in Commonwealth countries better concerting their efforts<br />
in working for improved trading arrangements for the major<br />
commodities.<br />
KENNEDY ROUND. Another major item was discussion of the GATT<br />
Kennedy Round of trade negotiations. This, too, was a matter of'<br />
urgency, since progress in the negotiations had been very slow.<br />
The authority given by the United States Congress for United<br />
States participation lasts for barely another year.<br />
Commonealth Trade Ministers were all agreed that<br />
the potential benefits of the Kennedy Round were such that the<br />
Commonwealth should, as a group, do everything possible to bring<br />
a sense of urgency to the negotiations.<br />
Mr. McEwen said that, if the Kennedy Round failed<br />
to produce worthwhile results, there could well be a widespread<br />
sense of disillusionment against the ideals of multilateralism<br />
in world trade. This might then lead to a tendency towards groups<br />
of countries combining to form highly protective trading blocs.<br />
The European Economic Co:-eunit;' possibly enlarged could be<br />
one such bloc; the countries of the North and South American<br />
continents another; and the Communist countries a third.<br />
Australia, and gthGr countries not easily falling within such<br />
groupings, could find themselves isolated and confronted with new<br />
restrictions on their trade opportunities. </p>
<p>At a time when the growth and prosperity of Australia, and indeed<br />
of every country, depends so much on maintaining a continued<br />
expansion of exports, such a development would be deplorable.<br />
It is, indeed, a major reason why a successful outcome of the<br />
Kennedy Round is of fundamental importance.<br />
Mr. McEwen added that, if the Kennedy Round failed,<br />
and there followed the emergence of a series of powerful trading<br />
blocs, the many new and developing nations of the world would,<br />
no doubt, be forced to seek attachment to one or another of the<br />
blocs. This, he said, could provide a fertile field for political<br />
competition in which he could see nothing but danger and tension<br />
the very reverse of the objective of maximum freedom in trade and<br />
other matters which we believe in, and towards which the United<br />
States Government, in launching the Kennedy Round, had taken a<br />
leadership initiative.<br />
OTHER SUBJECTS. Mr. McEwen said that a numiber of other subjects were<br />
discussed at the Trade MinistersT Meeting, ranging from trade in<br />
manufactured exports from the lesser developed members, to the<br />
trade promotion efforts of developing countries and means of<br />
stimulating tourism. " In all cases," said Mr. McEwen, " Commonwealth<br />
Ministers were able to reach agreement on the most useful<br />
means of co-ordinating Commonwealth efforts in these fields."<br />
The Minister said he was particularly heartened by<br />
the support expressed by developing Commonwealth countries for<br />
the Australian initiative in legislating for a system of<br />
preferences to apply to a range of products of interest to<br />
developing countries. " These new nations," said Mr. McEwen,<br />
" 1need more than grand declarations if they are to grapple<br />
successfully with the vast economic difficulties facing them, and<br />
avoid the political trouble that so often accompanies such<br />
difficulties. The Australian initiative was widely acknowledged<br />
to be one of the few positive steps that have yet been taken by<br />
any country specifically to help the trade problems of the<br />
developing cou ntries.'' 6/.. </p>
<p>TRADE PUBLICITY. Whilst in London, Mr. McEwen said, he had also taken<br />
the opportunity to assess the progress being made in the campaign<br />
to promote Australian meat, dairy products, fresh, canned and<br />
dried fruits, eggs, other processed foodstuffs and wine.<br />
Total expenditure in Britain on the promotion of<br />
Australian products amounts to several million dollars a year.<br />
The Commonwealth Govcrnment and Australian primary producers and<br />
exporters, through the Marketing Boards, subscribe directly<br />
01.1 million. This co-operative effort attracts associated<br />
expenditure by cxporters and British importers of Australian<br />
products of very substantial additional funds.<br />
" I am sure," Mr. McEwen commented, " that this trade<br />
publicity programme has done much to create and encourage the<br />
demand for these Australian products in the United Kingdom<br />
market. Without it, the returns to a wide range of Australian<br />
producers would have been considerably lower."<br />
Mr. McEwen added that, in recent years, a much<br />
greater emphasis had been given to the promotion of Australian<br />
products in markets other than Britain. He said: " We are<br />
producing more~ our development needs require ever-increasing<br />
earnings of foreign exchange; and there are uncertainties abo-. c<br />
Britain's ultimate action in regard to the Common Market. All<br />
these considerations make it necessary that we exploit every<br />
possible marketing opportunity."<br />
TRADE AGREEME.' TS -A BULTRIA APD POLARD.<br />
Mr. McEwen sa: i tt 5follow. ing the London meeting,<br />
he had visited Poland a and had concluded trade<br />
agreements with these counri. s.<br />
Mr. McEwon said that Australia had given most-favourednation<br />
tariff treatment to Poland and Bulgaria for many years.<br />
However, exporting to countries which controlled their imports by<br />
measures other th?. tariffs had no predictable basis. </p>
<p>As a general rule, such countries prefer to buy from countries<br />
with whom they have trade agreements. In recent years, many<br />
Western countries have negotiated trade agreements with nations<br />
of Eastern Europe. The Minister said that, last year, Australia<br />
concluded a reciprocal, most-favoured-nation Trade Agreem-ent with<br />
the Soviet Union. Following this, Poland and Bulgaria had sought<br />
trade talks with the object of concluding similar agreements.<br />
His visit and the Trade Agreements which had been signed were<br />
the outcome of these requests.<br />
Mr. McEwen said the now Agreements accorded to<br />
Poland and Bulgaria, as of right, the most-favoured-nation tariff<br />
treatment they had hitherto enjoyed. From the point of view of<br />
Australia's interests, we now also have assured entry to these<br />
markets on the equivalent most-favoured-nation basis.<br />
Mr. McEwen added that Australia enjoyed a favourable<br />
trade balance with both Poland and Bulgaria a substantial<br />
balanco in the case of Poland, which was a valuable buyer of<br />
Australian wool. R'oth countries were undertaking industrialisation<br />
programmes, with heavy investment in a wide range of manufacturing<br />
industries. This offered the prospect of increasing opportunities<br />
for the sale of Australian raw materials and possibly also beef,<br />
mutton and other foodstuffs. At the same time, it could be<br />
expected that the products of the new manufacturing industries<br />
in Poland and Bulgaria, which are already significant exporters<br />
of certain specialised types of machinery, would be of increasing<br />
interest to Australian industries. The new Trade Agreements would<br />
provide a very useful framework for the development and expansion<br />
of Australian trade with Poland and Bulgaria.<br />
