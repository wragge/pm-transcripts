    <content><![CDATA[<p>Right around the world, Australia is seen as a beacon of hope and opportunity.</p>
<p>To be an Australian is to win the lottery of life and this is the foundation of our optimism as we enter 2015.</p>
<p>We should feel confident about our country and its prospects and while 2014 had its challenges, much was achieved.</p>
<p>The Government will build on these foundations in 2015.</p>
<p>In the coming year, we will build on the 165,000 new jobs that were created last year.</p>
<p>This coming year, Australian families and businesses will benefit from the scrapping of bad taxes, the cutting of red tape and the free trade agreements that have been finalised.</p>
<p>Our future will be stronger because of the difficult but necessary decisions taken last year.</p>
<p>And we will be safer because of the extra resources and the stronger laws to protect our national security.</p>
<p>Yes, right now, there are some economic crosswinds because of lower commodity prices and lower tax revenue.</p>
<p>But, our Economic Action Strategy is laying the foundation for a stronger and more prosperous Australia.</p>
<p>So the Government’s priorities for 2015 will be to create more jobs, to reduce costs for families, to build roads, to strengthen national security and to create opportunity for all.</p>
<p>We can expect 2015 to bring its share of challenges and when they arise we will do what we have always done: we will turn to each other, we will work together and we will make whatever decisions are needed to strengthen our country and its people.</p>
<p>My commitment to you is to keep our country safe and secure – that’s why the coming months will see updated counter terrorism legislation in the parliament.</p>
<p>And then in April, we will commemorate the centenary of the Gallipoli campaign.  It will be the most significant commemoration in a generation and I hope that everyone will participate in some way.</p>
<p>In remembering the ANZAC’s sacrifice, we will draw on our own strength and confidence for the future.</p>
<p>So this New Year’s Day, let us re-dedicate ourselves to building a better Australia – with more opportunity for everyone.</p>
<p>Happy New Year Australia!</p>
<p>1 January 2015</p>
