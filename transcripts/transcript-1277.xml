COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH<br />
The Rt. Hon. HAROLD HOLT, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
GOVERNMENT POLICY<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the Parliamentary Debates," 24th March 1966]<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT ( Higgins-Prime<br />
Minister Speaker, the Leader<br />
of the Opposition ( Mr. Caiwell) has proposed<br />
an amendment to the motion that the<br />
paper -that I presented to the House on 8th<br />
March be printed, that motion providing<br />
an opportunity for honorable members to<br />
debate my statement. It is one of the major<br />
ironies of Australian politics that the<br />
amendment, which is claimed to be virtually<br />
a motion of no confidence, has been submitted<br />
by a leader who is unsure of his<br />
leadership of his party and, indeed, unsure<br />
of the deputy leadership of his party, to<br />
say nothing of his party's policies. He is<br />
* certain of only one thing-that each member<br />
of his party must toe the line of dictation<br />
from its. outside organisation or face<br />
expulsion from the party. This, Sir, is the<br />
alternative government that the Australian<br />
Labour Party offers to the Australian<br />
people. However, I do not intend tonight to<br />
engage in a lengthy political argument with<br />
honorable gentlemen opposite. I have more<br />
important business to attend to in the<br />
limited time available to me and there will<br />
be other opportunities for these issues to<br />
be thrashed out between us.<br />
The amendment proporsed by the Leader<br />
of the Opposition challenges a major aspect<br />
of the Government's financial policy and<br />
3 672/ 66 military strategy. He has attacked a vital<br />
aspect of the measures designed to maintain<br />
our military forces at the desired level<br />
and at their highest degree of effectiveness.<br />
The gulf that lies between the Government<br />
and the Opposition in these matters has<br />
been clearly revealed and the Parliament<br />
has very properly been concentrating its<br />
attention on this division over what becomes<br />
for governments and parliaments the most<br />
important subject that they have to discuss<br />
-the security of the nation. There is a<br />
clear choice between what the Government<br />
has decided and what the Opposition proposes.<br />
These matters have been vigorously<br />
debated. The Government and its supporters<br />
hold firmly to their view of the necessities<br />
of the situation. Indeed, as recently as<br />
yesterday Government supporters in both<br />
Government parties and in both Houses of<br />
the Parliament requested me to say publicly<br />
on their behalf that they unanimously support<br />
the Government in its policies in relation<br />
to both South Vietnam and the use of<br />
national servicemen. The Opposition persists<br />
with its resistance to the point at which<br />
it describes these issues as being appropriate<br />
for determination at a general election. Sir,<br />
the Government accepts full and final responsibility<br />
for its decisions and will be<br />
answerable for them. It is confident that as </p>
<p>the public becomes fully informed about<br />
what is involved in these issues the people<br />
will give strong backing to it.<br />
One thing that should be noted is that<br />
the Government, while it has final responsibility,<br />
has acted after seeking the best<br />
advice available to it from its own defence<br />
advisers and on information that it has obtained<br />
from allied and other friendly governments.<br />
This Government takes its decisions<br />
on defence against the background<br />
of advice from competent and experienced<br />
officers, both Service and civil. I should<br />
like to make it clear that the Government<br />
does -not act in a vacuum or on impulse<br />
or for some political purpose. The first concern<br />
of any Australian government must be<br />
the security of this country, and procedures<br />
have been established to assist the<br />
Government in arriving at sound decisions<br />
in this vital area of policy. The Government<br />
works on the basis of long range<br />
strategic appreciations submitted to it by<br />
its professional advisers in the fields of external<br />
affairs and strategic, military and economic<br />
matters. This advice is channelled<br />
to the Government through two principal<br />
bodies. There is the Defence Committee<br />
under the chairmanship of the Secretary of<br />
the Department of Defence. It is composed<br />
of the Chiefs of Staff and the Permanent<br />
Heads of the Departments of Defence and<br />
External Affairs, -the Prime Minister's Department<br />
and the Treasury. This Committee<br />
deals with questions involving the widest<br />
issues of defence policy. For professional<br />
military advice, the Government looks to<br />
the Chiefs of Staff Committee, which is<br />
composed of the Chairman of the Chiefs<br />
of Staff and the heads of the three Services.<br />
The strateg'ic appreciations placed before<br />
the Government take into account future<br />
trends in the international situa-tion, the<br />
assessment of possible threats to our security,<br />
and contingency plans developed in<br />
consultation with our allies. A great range of<br />
information is available to the Government<br />
from our own and allied sources, though<br />
naturally this cannot all be made public.<br />
There is an analysis of this as it bears on<br />
the problems of Australia's security, and<br />
conclusions are placed before the Government<br />
by men of experience and judgment.<br />
This is something which proceeds on a continuing<br />
basis, for we do not get our advice from a Federal executive outside this<br />
Parliament. We get ours from the Government's<br />
official advisers. By a systematic<br />
process of discerning the fundamental issues<br />
that determine our security, we project our<br />
thinking forward as far as is reasonably<br />
possible. The decisions on defence, I repeat,<br />
are decisions of the Government. But in<br />
arriving at those decisions, the Government<br />
takes into account the* considered conclusions<br />
of its professional advisers in all<br />
the relevant fields.<br />
The fundamental difference between the<br />
attitude of the Government and its supporters<br />
and the attitude of Opposition members<br />
is that we see the events in South Vietnam<br />
against the historical background of postwar<br />
Communist aggression. It seems to us<br />
utterly lacking in realism to ignore the part<br />
that Russian and Chinese Communism has<br />
played in the encouragement of aggression<br />
in South Vietnam and the material assistance<br />
given by the Russian and Chinese Governments<br />
to the Communist Government of<br />
North Vietnam. The members of the Vietcoyng<br />
have taken their direction from Hanoi.<br />
It is only by ignoring the role of Communism<br />
in the postwar ideological contest<br />
that the Leader of the Opposition and his<br />
supporters can have come to the hopelessly<br />
unrealistic conclusion that this is merely a<br />
civil war and that we should let the Vietnamese,<br />
North and South, sort out the<br />
situation for themselves. It should be noted<br />
that of the four political parties represented<br />
in, the National Parliament, three-the<br />
Liberal Party of Australia, the Australian<br />
Country Party and the Australian Democratic<br />
Labour Party-L-take the same view<br />
of events in South-' Vietnam and of their<br />
significance. The view of the Commonwealth<br />
Government is in accord with that<br />
held by three successive Presidents of the<br />
United States of America-first, President<br />
Eisenhower and President Kennedy and<br />
now President Johnson. On the benches<br />
opposite we have representatives of the one<br />
party that challenges the judgment of the<br />
country's expert advisers and of these three<br />
friendly Presidents of our great ally, the<br />
United States.<br />
South Korea, which was itself so recently<br />
threatened by Chinese Communist aggression,<br />
is supplying in South Vietnam forces<br />
which, proportionate to its population, represent<br />
the same scale of assistance as is </p>
<p>being given by those of the United States.<br />
Australia is helping the free Government<br />
and people of the Republic of South Vietnam<br />
to defend their freedom and independence<br />
against an attack directed and in<br />
large part supplied from North Vietnam.<br />
We are helping to prevent the success of<br />
Communist aggression. If honorable members<br />
opposite want any further proof that<br />
this aggre ' ssion is Communist directed, Sir,<br />
let them examine the findings of the Legal<br />
Committee of the International Commission<br />
for Supervision and Control which was<br />
established to supervise the observance of<br />
the Vietnam ceasefire of 1954. The Commission<br />
is composed of Indian, Polish and<br />
Canadian members. The Legal Committee,<br />
with Pnland objecting, reported in 1962-<br />
There is evidence to show that arms, munitions<br />
and other supplies have been sent from the zone<br />
in the north to the zone in the south with the<br />
objective of supporting, organising and carrying<br />
out hostile activities, including armed attacks,<br />
against the armed forces and administration of<br />
the zone in the south.<br />
One could quote at length the findings<br />
of this Committee firmly establishing intervention<br />
from the North. In the three year<br />
period from 1959 to 1961, the North Vietnam<br />
regime infiltrated 10,000 men into the<br />
South. In 1962, 13,000 additional personnel<br />
were infiltrated and by the end of 1964,<br />
North Vietnam may well have moved over<br />
40,000 armed and unarmed guerrillas into<br />
South Vietnam. Most recently, Hanoi has<br />
begun to infiltrate elements of the North<br />
Vietnamese Army in increasingly large<br />
numbers. Up to the end of January 1966,<br />
t there was evidence that nine regiments of<br />
regular North Vietnamese forces were fighting<br />
in organised -units in the South. This is<br />
the civil war that -honorable gentlemen opposite<br />
persist in proclaiming it to be.<br />
In the long run, the threat to South Vietnam<br />
is a direct threat to Australia. That is<br />
the view of this Government. We are much<br />
more dangerously placed than is the United<br />
States of America. The previous Prime<br />
Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, announcing<br />
in Parliament on 29th April 1965 the decision<br />
to send the 1st Battalion to Vietnam<br />
said-The takeover of South Vietnam would be a<br />
direct military threat to Australia and to the<br />
countries of South and South East Asia. It must<br />
be seen as a part of a thrust by Communist China<br />
between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Yet honorable gentlemen opposite continue<br />
to deny that this is the situation in<br />
that part of the world.<br />
Mr. Calwell.-We do.<br />
Mr. SPEAKER.-Order! A number of<br />
honorable members persist in loudly interjecting.<br />
I remind the House that the Prime<br />
Minister is limited to 20 minutes. The<br />
challenger was unlimited. I ask honorable<br />
members to observe the Standing Orders. If<br />
they do not do so, I shall have to deal with<br />
them. Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-We cannot leave<br />
the containment of aggressive Communism<br />
in Asia to our allies and their national<br />
servicemen. The United States has made a<br />
sustained, firm and large commitment to<br />
the South Vietnamese Government and<br />
people. As leaders of our own Government<br />
have said previously our stake in preserving<br />
the security of South East Asia is at least as<br />
great as that of the United States. It would<br />
be outside the character of the Australian<br />
people to leave the fighting to the Americans<br />
in what we know are also our interests and<br />
our causes.<br />
It is within our capacity to make the<br />
enlarged contribution which we have<br />
offered. The Army forces to be deployed to<br />
South Vietnam will constitute approximately<br />
10 per cent., in terms of personnel<br />
numbers, of the strength of 40,000, to which<br />
it has been approved the Army is to rise<br />
by 1967. The Government's enlarged<br />
contribution to South Vietnam has been<br />
measured against all our other commitments<br />
including those to Malaysia and Singapore.<br />
It has been of great value and reassurance<br />
to us to know of the United Kingdom's<br />
declared intention to maintain a strong<br />
military presence in this area. The deployments<br />
to South Vietnam are also, of course,<br />
fully consistent with our obligations and<br />
requirements to retain adequate forces for<br />
the defence of Australia and its Territories,<br />
including Papua and New Guinea.<br />
Now, Sir, I turn to the question of the<br />
introduction of national service. The<br />
Menzies Government conducted a review of<br />
Australia's defence position in 1964 against<br />
a background of an accelerated deterioration<br />
in the strategic situation in South East Asia.<br />
China had committed open aggression </p>
<p>against India. North Vietnam, with the<br />
encouragement of China, had increased its<br />
terrorist and insurgency campaign against<br />
South Vietnam. Communist armed activity<br />
continued in Laos. There was a resurgence<br />
of Communist terrorism in northern Malaya,<br />
and Indonesia had stepped up its armed<br />
confrontation of Malaysia.<br />
In his report to the Parliament on 10th<br />
November 1964, the then Prime Minister,<br />
Sir Robert Menzies, pointed out that Indonesian<br />
attacks against Malaysia could create<br />
a real risk of war, and that Australia must<br />
prepare for all eventualities including the<br />
control and, if necessary, defence of the<br />
frontier between West New Guinea and the<br />
Territory of Papua and New Guinea. Our<br />
defence review showed clearly that the<br />
likely military situations Australia must be<br />
prepared to face had increased in number<br />
and complexity. Does anybody opposite<br />
deny that? It was apparent that the tasks<br />
already entered upon must be maintained<br />
and that ' a rapid buildup of ground forces<br />
would be required to enable this to be done<br />
and to prepare against further possible<br />
contingencies including an increase in cold<br />
war commitments; meeting agreed commitments<br />
under collective security agreements<br />
if called upon; providing bilateral assistance<br />
to our allies if required at short notice;<br />
increased provision for the defence of Australia<br />
and her Territories; and the development<br />
of forces against a further erosion of<br />
the strategic situation in South East Asia<br />
and as a basis for rapid expansion in the<br />
event of war.<br />
The Regular Army strength at the time<br />
was 22,750. The assessment by the Chiefs<br />
of Staff Committee of the actual, foreseeable<br />
and contingency tasks showed that an<br />
effective Army strength of 33,000 was required<br />
by the end of 1966. All practicable<br />
steps were taken -to attract an increase in<br />
volunteers for the Regular Army. Pay was<br />
increased, conditions of service were improved,<br />
quarters were modernised, the number<br />
of married quarters was increased,<br />
amenities were improved, the retirement<br />
benefits scheme was streamlined and an<br />
intensive recruiting campaign was undertaken.<br />
These measures produced some<br />
additional recruits. It became evident, however,<br />
that in a time of great prosperity with<br />
over full employment and intense competition for young men, it was not possible<br />
to obtain the necessary increase in effective<br />
strength within the time required. A survey<br />
of recruiting trends showed that some 3,000<br />
volunteers would be recruited each year for<br />
the Army. Allowing for wastage as members<br />
completed their engagements and return<br />
to civil life, the net increase in strength<br />
would be only of the order of 750 a year.<br />
To obtain an increase of some 10,000 in<br />
strength in two years, there was no alternative<br />
to the introduction of selective national<br />
service. No party in this place has a monopoly<br />
of concern for the young manhood of Australia<br />
and it is an unwarranted presumption<br />
on the part of any member of Parliament<br />
to claim it. But this Government has concern<br />
for the national security of Australia<br />
and when our security, on the advice of expert<br />
advisers, had to be supported in the<br />
way we have been told as tor the numbers<br />
required, we faced quite realistically and<br />
firmly in the national interest the harsh<br />
decision which then lay ahead of us. We<br />
have an illustration of how the Opposition<br />
would have met that kind of challenge. Our<br />
national security produced the need for a<br />
national service scheme and, accepting that<br />
need, what fairer or more democratic<br />
method of selection could be devised?<br />
Mr. Calwell.-The lottery of death.<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-That is the way<br />
the Leader of the Opposition distorts the<br />
sitbation. He is running true to form<br />
because when his own former leader introduced<br />
in a time of national peril a scheme<br />
to call up young men in th-is country for<br />
national service, he opposed it. The honorable<br />
gentleman resisted it and he is running<br />
true to form again. The honorable gentleman<br />
cannot get his mind on economic<br />
matters away from the depression years of<br />
the 1930' s. On the defence matters, he cannot<br />
get his mind outside the conscription<br />
issues of 1916 and 1917. What Australia<br />
needs is a government which faces * up to<br />
the reality that here we have a country<br />
which is expected to shoulder its own share<br />
of obligations. With maturing nationhood, it<br />
is proud to take its share of that responsibility.<br />
I say -that, sure as I1a m that the young<br />
manhood of Australia will accept its obl-igations<br />
with pride and will serve Australia<br />
with credit. </p>
<p>I am glad to be able to tell the House<br />
that in the course of the next month, as I<br />
indicated in my statement, I shall be visiting<br />
our troops in a number of their stations<br />
abroad. I am quite certain that when I<br />
come back to this Parliament it will be<br />
with a heartening recognition that this young<br />
Australian battalion which has served us<br />
with such distinction in Vietnam, and our<br />
troops in Thailand, in Malaysia and in<br />
Borneo, are helping to discharge the<br />
national obligations of a country which can stand before the rest of the world proudly,<br />
knowing that it has faced up to the need<br />
to maintain the eternal vigilance that is<br />
necessary for the preservation of freedom<br />
throughout this troubled world.<br />
We shall not be deterred from that course<br />
by the threats of the Opposition. We are<br />
confident that once the Australian people<br />
know the realities of the situation they have<br />
to face they will support this Government<br />
and they will support Australia's young<br />
manhood in the testing time that lies ahead.<br />
