PRIME MISNISLEA<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, APRIL 29, 1980<br />
SPEECH AT PARLIAMENTARY LUNCHEON FOR<br />
GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF FIJI<br />
Your Excellency, it gives me V'ery great pleasure to welcome<br />
you here today.<br />
Your presence adds to the growing history of a continuing and<br />
significant relationship between Fiji and Australia.<br />
of course, in the wider history of the South Pacific the name<br />
Cakabou has a distinguished place.<br />
It was one of your predecessors who invited Queen Victoria to take<br />
possession of the Fijian Islands, to protect them from marauding<br />
outsiders. It must confess that at the time, some of these marauders were<br />
operating from the Australian colonies.<br />
Your Excellency, I can assure you, we have improved a little,<br />
since then.<br />
But this improvement has been necessary for both of us.<br />
For too long, there had been. a tendency for xiany countries<br />
like yours and ours in the South Pacific, to fail to recognise<br />
the common traditions that we share from our geography and our<br />
British connections.<br />
These common traditions lead to common interests and facilitate<br />
common solutions to regional problems.<br />
Your presence here today symbolises the commonality in our<br />
relationship but, Sir, you come to us as a distinguished visitor<br />
in your own right.<br />
As.. the first Fijian National to occupy the office of Governor-General,<br />
you must reflect with pride on the fact that, during your period of<br />
office, you have witnessed the beginning of a new relationship<br />
between the people and the government of Fiji and AustLralia. ./ 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
Our contacts with the people of Fiji go back a long time<br />
but until more recently the. empha-sis had been on contact through<br />
Australian companieSt operating in Fiji..<br />
They failed to produce personal contacts on a scale comparable,<br />
for example, to those which existed between Australian and Papua<br />
New Guinea.<br />
This made for shortcomings in understanding, and for failures<br />
in our appreciation of one another which we have only recently<br />
begun to correct.<br />
But I think that, in the past few years, especially since your<br />
independence in 1970, we have done much to bridge the gaps which<br />
existed previously both with Fiji and with your neighbouring states<br />
in the South Pacific.<br />
We have, of course, accepted that with the ending of colonial<br />
arrangements, we in Australia must accept special responsibilities<br />
as the most advanced and most developed nation in the region.<br />
Your government, and those of your neighbours, have made it clear<br />
that they accept Australia as a member of the South Pacific community.<br />
We have responded by taking up. your invitation to participate<br />
in a wide range of regional activities.<br />
In particular, I have attended several meetings of the South Pacific<br />
Forum,' and my Ministers have attended meetings of the South Pacific<br />
Conference and Regional Meetings on shipping, civil aviation,<br />
health, labour, education and trade.<br />
At the forum, we have been prepared to discuss political issues<br />
quite freely, and to demonstrate our commitment to the Pacific<br />
neighbourhood. even when this has meant a partial derogation of our<br />
relations with more powerful states further afield.<br />
We have been prepared to support this commitment with aid programmes<br />
and trade concessions.<br />
In the aid area alone, we have recently lifted our forward pledge<br />
for the Island states from $ 84 million to $ 120 million over the next<br />
3 years.<br />
of this, $ 30 million in grants has been earmarked for direct<br />
assistance to Fiji.<br />
In the trade area, we have offered duty-free or preferred access<br />
to our market for a wide range of products without any<br />
reciprocation, and I am optimistic that an accord can be settled<br />
in the next.-few weeks.<br />
I would expect Fiji to be the major beneficiary of the concessions<br />
we have offered.<br />
We have promised increased cultural exchanges. </p>
<p>3<br />
We are also examining the needs of the Island states for maritime<br />
surveillance and enforcement systems.<br />
Earlier this year, our soldiers worked together in Zimbabwe, closely<br />
and effectively.<br />
In times which call for increased defence preparedness, we are<br />
expanding our, albeit modestprogramme of defence co-operation<br />
in the region, most specifically with the Royal Fiji military<br />
forces. Other relationships and special arrangements are possible in the<br />
years ahead, and these, and the programmes on which we are currently<br />
embarking, are certain to effect even closer ties between our<br />
countries. But, importantly, we are consulting each other more closely and<br />
from the frequency and frankness of our contacts we are beginning<br />
to develop an empathy for, and appreciation of one another.<br />
Your government Ministers and ours are more active in government<br />
to government discussions, and our officials are increasing their<br />
exchanges of views. / 4 </p>
<p>In international conferences, the Pacific group is beginning<br />
to take on as much relevance as other groups to which Australia<br />
belongs, and the group of 77 to which Fiji and the Island States<br />
have felt allegiance.<br />
Indeed, in international gatherings such as UNCTAD and the<br />
Commonwealth, Australia has promoted discussion of the. problems<br />
and interests of small island states, especially those of the<br />
South Pacific.<br />
In this I think we can claim some measure of-success.<br />
I am confident this success will extend to an enhanced<br />
appreciation at the people to people level.<br />
I know you are proud of your Rugby footballers and they are<br />
always welcome and entertaining guests in AustraliF.<br />
In fact our Rugby team leaves next month on a tour of Fiji and<br />
it is rumoured, Sir, that your visit has been timed so that<br />
you can take home intelligence on the Australian team.<br />
But new ties are also being added at the people to people level<br />
to the traditional contacts between our countries.<br />
Already some 50 Fijinationals a year are coming to Australia<br />
under sponsorship of Australian employers for paid in-service<br />
training.<br />
An increasing number of your nationals are entering our institutions<br />
and colleges for courses of study.<br />
And, more Australians are working as technical advisers and<br />
experts in your governmental ranks.<br />
One of the more symbolic examples of these new links was your<br />
commissioning of Sir Arthur Tange to reviewsyour entire Public<br />
Service systems.<br />
Just over 40 years ago, Sir Arthur worked in Fiji in the Bank<br />
of New South Wales and now, after a distinguished career in<br />
The Australian Public Service, he has been asked to return to<br />
pass on his knowledge and wisdom.<br />
Your Excellency, most of the South Pacific, in which we have<br />
come to regard Fiji as the pivot, has recently undergone a<br />
transition from a colonial status to independence.<br />
The Island States have rightly asserted their new status and<br />
ought to forge new links with other nations.<br />
But with independence has come a need to stand on one's own<br />
feet, to meet challenges from those who would try to assert<br />
their will against the democratic choice of peoples and without<br />
respect for traditions and basic freedoms. </p>
<p>No-one could be more exposed than small island states standing<br />
alone. Fortunately, it has been reassuring to find in our neighbourhood<br />
a collective will to reject any legitimacy in such advances<br />
and to eschew overtures for footholds from the Soviet union.<br />
This will is -strengthened by a common intent in our region to<br />
preserve democratic rights and to protect national and<br />
regional interests.<br />
when we, in Australia, suspended negotiations for Soviet Union<br />
fishing rights and terminated cruising rights for Soviet ships,<br />
each of the island states took its own form of appropriate<br />
action.<br />
When the Australian Government called for a boycott of the<br />
Olympic Games in Moscow, we found island governments doing the<br />
same.<br />
We don't expect there always will be the same identity of view,<br />
but there is obviously a close similarity in will and action<br />
which we welcome.<br />
Your Excellency, we, in Australia, do have an interest in the<br />
political stability and economic development of our neighbouring<br />
South Pacific region where Island Governments are dedicated to<br />
serving their own peoples.<br />
Fiji is a large part of the South Pacific community, and without<br />
your example others in the area might weaken in their will to<br />
persevere with liberal approaches.<br />
We stand ready to give close attention to the needs of your<br />
nation in achieving economic and social justice for the people<br />
of Fiji.<br />
We want Fiji to prosper.<br />
Your Excellency, I am confident about your nation's future and<br />
can assure you that Fiji can have confidence in our support for<br />
your endeavours.<br />
You are an honoured and welcome guest amongst us today.<br />
