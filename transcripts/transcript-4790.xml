PRIME MINISTER' S INTERVIEW WITH DUNCAN FAIRWTEATHER, ABC,<br />
21 AUGUST 1978<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I didn't issue it last week because I had regarded the substance<br />
of The Bulletin article allegations as being answered by the<br />
statements of Eric Robinson and myself in the Parliament.<br />
The matter referred to things that have been discussed<br />
between Ministers and at one point, in part at least, in a<br />
Ministerial meeting. I place a great deal of importance on<br />
confidentiality in discussions between Ministers within the Cabinetwithin<br />
the Ministry that is important to good government.<br />
As the matter continued to obviously as public interest, as<br />
there were others that did not regard those denials as<br />
completely categoric denials as I had, and as Eric Robinson, the<br />
matter was reassessed over the weekend. Therefore, in discussions<br />
with the Deputy Prime Minister and Eric Robinson and other Ministers<br />
I camne to the view that the statement that has been issued should<br />
be issued, together with the draft of the letter which was<br />
never sent, never signed and which I didn't see until today.<br />
QUESTION Do you intend it to be your last word on this subject or<br />
will you make an explanation to Parliament as well?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I have got no doubt that the Opposition will ask one or two<br />
questions on the subject, because they seem to be incapable<br />
of asking questions on mainstream matters that are of prime<br />
concern to Australians. Throughout this whole year they have<br />
been interesting themselves in peripheral issues, not devoting<br />
themselves to Australia's main problems, main concerns, not<br />
contributing to debates in that arena in any useful way.<br />
QUESTION Prime Minister a central point of these allegations has been<br />
that you asked M4r Robinson for a letter. Now you say you did<br />
ask him for a note if he was sure of his recollection. Why should<br />
he reexamine the evidence that he gave on oath before a<br />
Royal Commission?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Let me explain that in plain terms. I had always been puzzled<br />
w'yEric Robinson had such a clear recollection of a conversation<br />
which he believed took place in my office on 17th January, when<br />
I had none and had no awareness of that particular matter until<br />
Senator Durack told me about it in April, he was concerned because<br />
he was concerned, I was concerned. I was puzzled about this<br />
difference in recollection. If it was merely the fact of a<br />
phone call, that would not be remarkable. The phone call from </p>
<p>Senator Withers to Mr Pearson became remarkable when you knew<br />
its purpose, its motive and its content. Part of that did not<br />
come out, I think, until we read the Royal Commission Report<br />
when it was not only the fact of the call, the content of<br />
the call, but the purpose of the call in the terms of<br />
Mr Justice McGregor. That was certainly remarkable.<br />
When Mr Robinson said to a group of Ministers it was the fact<br />
of the phone call, not the substance or contents of the phone<br />
call that was related in my office on the 17th, when that was<br />
said I said, well, maybe that is an explanation why he<br />
remembers it, and why I don't. I asked him if your recollection,<br />
meaning his recollection at the time, a couple of weeks ago<br />
on the 7th and 8th of August that recollection then could<br />
he give me a note about it. That might have lead to one or<br />
two additional sentences in my statement to the Parliament<br />
giving a possible explanation for the difference in recollection<br />
but it didn'It turn out that way as you know.<br />
QUESTION It was construed that you had tried to influence Mr Robinson.<br />
Asking him to reconsider the evidence he gave to the Royal<br />
Commission, you say if he was sure of his recollection.<br />
What would have happened if he had not been sure?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I wasn't asking him to reconsider his evidence. What I did was<br />
to if you are sure of your recollection, of what he had<br />
just told Ministers on the 7th and 8th August, it was the<br />
8th of August and the point he just made then was it was the<br />
fact of the phone call that was related in my office, not the<br />
substance. But it was said that he shouldn't do anything until<br />
he had checked with his evidence, and I certainly concurred in<br />
that, and the letter was never sent there never was a letter,<br />
it was never signed, there was a draft but nothing else.<br />
LAST QUESTION REPEATED:<br />
QUESTION Prime Minister, could you relate how it was that you did ask<br />
Mr Robinson for that note?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Mr Robinson was telling Ministers of what had happened, relating<br />
events, and in the Ministry meeting the records show that he<br />
raised this particular point in relation to the 17th January<br />
that he himself made the point that it was the fact of the<br />
conversation and not the substance that was bought to my attention.<br />
In addition to that, the same point had been made in discussions<br />
with other Ministers. When I heard it I was interested in it<br />
for a very obvious reason.-I had always been puzzled about why<br />
he had clear recollection of these events while I had none.<br />
It was only the fact of the phone call, as opposed to the substance,<br />
and that in itself is not remarkable. It is remarkable if Senator </p>
<p>Withers had said he had not spoken to Mr Pearson for three months,<br />
being in a sense his permanent head that would be remarkable.<br />
This phone call could only become remarkable when its substance,<br />
its purpose, its contents and the motive behind it were known.<br />
QUESTION Didn't Mr Robinson give evidence to the Royal Commission that the<br />
question of a change in name of an electorate was mentioned<br />
in that phone call and repeated after it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I think you have got to read the whole of Mr Robinson's evidence,<br />
and when you read that I think you will then get to a full understandir<br />
of the position. In parts of that evidence he makes it perfectly<br />
plain he didn't understand the full nature of the phone call until<br />
Mr Pearson gave evidence before the Royal Commission that was<br />
in May. I hadn't understood the totality of what was alleged<br />
to have been said or not said, and in that sense, when you again<br />
made the simple comment: it was the fact of the phone call and<br />
not the substance that was related in my office. I was obviously<br />
interested, because that was not the impression I had got from<br />
earlier events and from the evidence as a whole. That has led<br />
me to say, well, if your recollection meaning your recollection<br />
here and now-is correct, can you give me a note in relation to it.<br />
I again make the point, that the most that could have led to<br />
would have been one or two sentences perhaps in my statement to the<br />
Parliament giving a possible reason why he had a recollection of<br />
those events and while I had none well, those one or two<br />
sentences weren't there.<br />
