FOR PRESS (~ OT16 P. M. NO. 83/ 1968<br />
AMENDMENT TO A. C. T. COMPANIES ORDINANCE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
There are market repoirts of unusually large purchases of<br />
shares in an Australian life insurance company M. L. C. Ltd. Shares so<br />
bought have been registered in the names of nominee companies. They now<br />
represent approximately 36 per cen~ t of the total issued capital of the<br />
Company and the rate of purchasing has recently risen so dramatically as<br />
to suggest the possibility of a " raid" designed to take over the Company.<br />
Because the real buyers of the shares are cloaking their identity, and are<br />
believed to be foreign buyers, this has caused concern to the Government.<br />
The Australian insurance company concerned controls<br />
$ 750 million worth of Australian and New Zealand savirV3 accumula-re-d over<br />
the years and its invested funds are increasing at the rate of $ 75 million<br />
a year as a result of savings by Australians a nd New Zealanders.<br />
The Government does not believe that this accumulated<br />
Australian capital should be allowed to fall under the control of anonymous<br />
and probably foreign interests.<br />
We therefore intend to amend the A. C. T. Companies Ordinance<br />
in relation to life insurance companies to require that nominee shareholders<br />
must reveal to the Insurance Commissioner the identity of the beneficial<br />
owners of the shares, and to rostrict persons who are not residents of<br />
Australia, or companies which are not controlled by residents of Australia,<br />
from holding more than a certain percentage of shares in the Australian<br />
Company. The amending ordinance will operate so as to redress the<br />
effect of any transactions taking place after tochy and will provide a<br />
transitional period within which existing shareholdings are to be adjusted.<br />
The Government believes this action will protect the interests<br />
of the policy holders. We also believe that Australians will share our<br />
determination that control over their Australian savings, and decisions on<br />
the investment of their Australian savings, shall remain in the control of<br />
an Australian company and will not be allowed to fall under the control of<br />
overseas interests.<br />
CANBERRA, 22 September 1968 </p>
