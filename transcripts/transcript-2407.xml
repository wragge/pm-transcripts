ASSOCIATED CHAMIBERS OF MANUFACTURES OF AUSTRALIA<br />
PRESIDENTS' LUNCHEON<br />
PARKROYAL MOTOR INN, CANBERRA 21 APRIL 1971<br />
Ãµ pieech by the-Prime Minister, Mr. William McMahon<br />
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen<br />
Now, I am not one of those who believe that we should take too unhappy a<br />
view of our future. But I do want to emphasise, and I keep on emphasising it as<br />
often as I can, that the major difficulty that we face today is inflation, and that we<br />
have to keep the forces of inflation whether they are the cost-push type<br />
or demand type we must keep both of them, not only under constant review, but<br />
I think we also have to keep them under constant control.<br />
Well, what then about the economy?<br />
As I see it, we have some difficult areas. It is not the consumption area, it<br />
is not our balance of payments. It isn't in terms of liquidity because in the last few<br />
days, as we forecast in a recent " No Confidence" motion we forecast then that we<br />
would Improve the liquidity position of the banks, not so that they could expand<br />
activities but so that the activities of industry would not be reduced.<br />
In other words, we have a feeling that while we have inflation, we don't want<br />
to strangle the economy in the process of trying to find a cure, but we want to<br />
gradually try and bring inflation under control. While at the same time to permit<br />
expansion of the kind that we want round about 5-1% per annum to keep on going<br />
and to permit us the increased production out of which better standards of living<br />
can be sustained. So we are not worried about every section of the economy. We can identify<br />
three or four problems. The first one is, of course, in capital investment in plant<br />
and equipment and we have taken what we regard, at least for the time being,:. the<br />
necessary precautions here.<br />
The second one and it doesn't really affect you people to a great ext ent<br />
is in commercial and industrial buildings. And here even in the last few days, I have<br />
been advised by the constructing people that they will be able to come to grips with<br />
their own problem because they are probabl,. over-built, particularly in office<br />
capacity which is now too great the rents are falling and there is an automatic<br />
reaction and consequently Government Intervention isn't justified. / 2 </p>
<p>But the real problems that we face, and these are two that I want to emphasise<br />
to you are Government expenditure Commonwealth and States. What we are doing<br />
is preparing the way now for the next Budget, and second what we have to look at' is<br />
the wage increase or the increases in average incomes or average earnings. Because<br />
we believe, and I am sure that this is true, that if it had not been for the 6 per. cent<br />
increase in the national wage case, we wouldn't have had any serious problems to<br />
face at all. In otherwords, we could have looked somewhat benignly at the<br />
development of the economy and we wouldn't have been looking to the next Budget to<br />
ask ourselves the question " How do we keep back demand inflation and how do we<br />
ensure, not only in terms of our international trade in commodities and in processed<br />
materials, but also so far as our primary industries, how do we stop them getting<br />
involved any more heavily in the cost and price squeeze?"<br />
So these are the real difficulties. I want to emphasise to you that we must,<br />
and you must, keep inflationary pressures under control. And I hope that you don't<br />
think that because of some chaniges that we have made in the last few weeks there<br />
can be any lessening of the activities of the businessman to see that his costs keep<br />
within acceptable limits and that where you have the capacity and I know that in<br />
all cases you haven't got the capacity but where you have the capacity, you do keep<br />
your costs from rising.<br />
Wages, particularly arbitration and over-award wages, are, I believe somethings<br />
that are extremely difficult to handle, and we and you must be active before<br />
the Arbitration Commission and in other sources to see that wages are kept within<br />
reasonable limits.<br />
Now, I suppose it can be argued that because there was a fall in the consumer<br />
index from 1. 9 per cent in the last quarter, the quarter before last, of 1. 1 per cent,<br />
there might be some easing. And you could be fortified in this opinion, too, if<br />
you felt that there was some almost imperceptible easing in the labour situation in<br />
the past few months. But I want to assure you that whilst there was this almost<br />
imperceptible change, it is so small, and against the context of very heavy pressures,<br />
that we don't think we can ease up in our control of inflationary forces at all.<br />
I think some people might perhaps say, " Well you eased up. You gave the<br />
pensioners, in the case of the married couple a $ 1 increase; in the case of the<br />
single person, 50 cents.<br />
I have to answer that by saying I could never see for one moment that the<br />
pensioner, the people on the maximum rate pension, ought to pay the penalty because<br />
wages are rising somewhere else. Consequently, I would have regarded as the<br />
strongest of strong moral obligations that these people should receive help.<br />
Equally, too, with the States, I am a little baffled by the opinion that is being<br />
expressed that it could be inflationary. We don't think it can be and the highest<br />
technical authorities that advise me don't think it has got any substantial influence<br />
at all, because what we have done is to reduce our surplus in our internal accounts<br />
and to reduce the deficit that exists due to the funding operations of the States in<br />
their accounts. </p>
<p>And if it might be that the banks do-get an increase in liquidity, we offset<br />
that because as I said a few moments ago, when we were discussing the " No<br />
Confidence" motion on the Budget, we anticipated that there would be an increase<br />
in liquidity in the June quarter and we have only increased the liquidity by half the<br />
amount we intended prior to the time when we gave the States the extra $ 48 million,<br />
$ 43 of which was to reduce their own funded deficits.<br />
So similarly you find that the technical experts who are advising me are<br />
giving me the kind of advice that I believe is not only in one. case morally right;<br />
in the other I believe creates a position so tha' the States themselves will be able<br />
to face their 71/ 72 Budget on a much more sensible basis than before.<br />
What we are doing is to help those that need help not to slow down the economy<br />
because economic growth is of critical importance to us and then to see that<br />
whatever remedial measures that we take outside the wages system are spread over<br />
as wide an area as is possible.<br />
I know that I have given you this information and I have done so very very<br />
quickly, but in a speech like this you honestly don't get the opportunity to set out<br />
in detail what you are thinking or what the path ahead might lead to.<br />
The second point that I want to mention to you, and I think it proper that I<br />
should do this, is to say something to you about tariffs. I want to emphasise to you<br />
as one who has been on the relevant Tariff Committee of the Cabinet for more years<br />
than anyone else, and as one who has read, I believe, very nearly every tariff<br />
report that has been presented to us over the course of the last fifteen years, that<br />
I am not one who speaks to you I can't speak to you as a technical expert but I<br />
do speak to you as one who is fairly well informed about the tariff mechanism of his<br />
country. Not like Alan Westerman, who was one of the great members they had on<br />
the Tariff Board, but at least I can speak with a considerable degree of Ministerial<br />
authority. What I want to emphasise to you is this. First, we ourselves as a Government<br />
no matter what might have been said in critical quarters in the last year or so, will<br />
maintain control of the' tariff mechanism itself. -And we will maintain control of the<br />
final decisions that-v-e muade because whilst the Tariff Board itself can make<br />
recom mend ations', it is we alone who can make the actual decisions themselves.<br />
Andi I say that we -will give it special attention.<br />
I have established a tariff committee . of the Government. Now it is a pretty<br />
high-powered one, with people who will be able to read the reports, and who go into<br />
the Cabinet Committee with the advice of their own Departmental officials. And<br />
what I can assure you about is not only will we take into consideration the social<br />
consequences of action, but we know that if we are to grow and particularly ensure<br />
that productivity has to improve, then it is up to us to ensure that manufacturing / 4 </p>
<p>~ 4.<br />
industries not only remain competitivebu -he ideals of being economic and efficient<br />
will be one of the bases on which we will make up our.. minds-on-what should be done.<br />
The point I want to make to you is this :-of course tn the interests of this<br />
c ountry we have to regard the manufacturing industry as a tremendously important<br />
section of the community and the one where we have got to get productivity increases<br />
if we are to be able to sustain increasing wages and increasing standards of living.<br />
Our Chairman a few moments ago, did ask me a question relating to meetings<br />
with manufacturing industry and other groups of industry as well. The opportunities<br />
will be there for you to present your views to us. We will change the procl-2Iure<br />
considerably on this occasion.<br />
After discussion with the various authorities the manufacturers, the<br />
primary producers, the construction experts, the Manufacturing Industries Advisory<br />
Council, the Export Development Council and others I am fairly certain that you<br />
will find that on the n ext occasion before the Budget discussions commence, we will<br />
arrange, on a much more individual basis say with the manufacturers alone or<br />
with their associated industries we will arrange for discussions vi th them.<br />
Secondly, we will give you much more time. It won't be a question of coming<br />
there and reading out a document with us scratching our heads and wondering what it<br />
is all about and seeing a bewildered look on Harold Herford's face.<br />
We will give you plenty of opportunity to present your views. Ard what is<br />
much more important, I hope that we will be able to cross-examine you and find out<br />
what the manufacturing industries are thinking, and what they think can be don~ e in<br />
the best interests of their own industries and through supporting their own industries,<br />
the best interests of the Australian community.<br />
So you have the chance. I think we will only meet once a year from now on, but<br />
at least the time available will, I hope, be at least as good as you would have-on the.<br />
two meetings that you would have throughout the year.<br />
This I think will bring us together. You know our problems. We will know<br />
yours, but above all, I believe we will be working in the interests of the Australian<br />
community and we will be working in the interests of trying to push up productivity.<br />
And could I point out this to you about.... because I had mentioned the<br />
industrial position and I have now brought in this question of tariffs and of your<br />
own industries. Within the course of the last few days I have been looking at the<br />
wage rises that have occurred in Japan and of the productivity increases that have<br />
occurred. What has surprised me because I have so frequently put the argument<br />
that whenever increases in wages grow faster than increases in productivity,<br />
then of necessity you get an inbuilt inflationary pressure.<br />
And I have said over and over again that I think according to that single<br />
factor alone, we have got an inbuilt inflationary pressure of something of the<br />
order of 5 per cent. I don't mention the exact figure because I believe it possibly is<br />
a little stronger than that. But of all the indexes that we take, particularly what<br />
is called the Paasche index, it is obvious that on discounted gross national production<br />
figures, that there is an inbuilt rate of inflation of at least 5 per cent. 0. </p>
<p>But nonetheless the argument that I want to put to you is this can be conquered<br />
if we get productivity high.<br />
The Japanese wage increases are about 10 per cent per annum much bigger<br />
than ours but because they have a productivity increase in excess of 11 probably<br />
in some years a little higher than that, they are able to absorb them and that is<br />
why in international company, they are able to better than compete with other<br />
countries in the world.<br />
We are not in that position because in the case of our primary industriet,<br />
our rural industries they can't have productivity increases of that kind, but ever.<br />
if they did, the international level of commodities prices spread over a wide area<br />
isn't sufficiently great to permit them to take the increase in costs.<br />
Now the only other point that I would like to make to you is this. I haven't<br />
had the opportunity to come and talk to you as much as I did in other years, and to<br />
get the benefit of the advice that you were able to give.<br />
I can assure you that in the days when I did have the opportunity to talk to<br />
the manufacturers, I was probably as well versed and as well informed on<br />
manufacturing problems, and consequently of the problems of the w~ iole economy<br />
as any other person in Cabinet.<br />
I want to assure you, and particularly you Mrl. Chairman and those of my<br />
friends that I have just spoken to, that my door is usually open.<br />
I welcome opportunities to talk to you. I don't welcome them to talk to you<br />
as I mentioned a few moments ago on a personal basis. But I do welcome them<br />
because I know that if we can co-operate, you and I I representing the Government<br />
and my colleagues and you representing great industries that are increa singly<br />
making this country powerful and great. Permitting us, too, to compete in<br />
international trade and to do so successfully, permitting us to grow at a rate of<br />
gross national production in real terms of 5-f per cent. Believe you me, if we can<br />
co-operate together with the mining and the other industries we can make<br />
our contribution to greater productivity, then I won't be so worried about inflation.<br />
The day hasn't come yet, but if we can co-operate, we can make a lasting<br />
contribution to the increasing greatness of this greatest of all countries. </p>
