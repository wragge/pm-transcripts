Prime Minister Julia Gillard today paid tribute to the enormous contribution made by the late Bill Hunter who passed away in Melbourne last night after a long battle with cancer.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said Mr Hunter was an Australian icon who will be missed. Mr Hunter played a key role as an acclaimed actor in helping to define Australian culture over five decades on screen and on stage.</p>
<p>He told us Australian stories in an Australian voice at a time when we were debating and developing our sense of national identity.</p>
<p>Bill Hunter brought Australian characters to life using his great talent in roles from Newsfront in 1978 to Strictly Ballroom and most recently in the film Red Dog.</p>
<p>On behalf of all Australians, the Prime Minister extends condolences to Mr Hunter's family and friends. </p>
