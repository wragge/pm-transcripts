<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> Mr Howard, good morning. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Good morning Neil. </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> Open Family plans to open a safe using house in Melbourne for</p>
<p>   heroin addicts and is also looking at Cabramatta in Sydney. Do you</p>
<p>   support that? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> No, I don't. Although I have to say I know nothing of it</p>
<p>   other than what I have read in the newspaper and seen briefly on</p>
<p>   television. I notice that the Victorian Police Commissioner has</p>
<p>   expressed some concern about it. It is ultimately a matter for the</p>
<p>   State authorities to decide, that involves totally the operation</p>
<p>   of State law. I think this whole debate will, I mean, if you spend</p>
<p>   your whole time getting my reaction and Mr Kennett's reaction</p>
<p>   and Mr Carr's reaction to each particular proposal without</p>
<p>   giving all of us an opportunity over a period of time to develop,</p>
<p>   or go on developing a considered response to the problem I think</p>
<p>   we are in danger of trivialising the debate. Because too much public</p>
<p>   focus in the last few weeks has been on whether you are for or against</p>
<p>   a heroin trial. Now, I am against it. Mr Kennett and others are</p>
<p>   for it but I think most people agree that whether you are for or</p>
<p>   against it it is not the biggest argument in town about the drug</p>
<p>   problem and I think it would be a great pity if because there are</p>
<p>   differences between key political figures on some of these issues</p>
<p>   they consumed most of the airplay on the debate rather than some</p>
<p>   of the longer term issues. Now, I am not seeking to play down those</p>
<p>   differences and.... </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> But it has turned a bit political hasn't it? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well, I think you would not find in anything I have said anything</p>
<p>   that is party political. I have not attacked Mr Carr. </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> No, but your Health Minister's belted Mr Kennett around the</p>
<p>   ears. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well, I think, well, I think Jeff is a bit rough on Michael. Michael</p>
<p>   is an excellent Health Minister and to say that Michael is bashing</p>
<p>   the interests of Victoria is a bit rich. I mean, he has got national</p>
<p>   responsibility as the Health Minister and he is doing a first class</p>
<p>   job. But look, I am really not interested in this side of the debate,</p>
<p>   it's too important for that. </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> But there are all these issues coming up aren't there? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Of course. </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> Safe using houses is one. And if it was to work and it would have</p>
<p>   to be, it'd probably have to be national, you couldn't</p>
<p>   just do it one or two suburbs, it'd have to be done properly.</p>
<p>   Is it worth looking at? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well, I am not attracted to it. You have asked me that, I've</p>
<p>   given you that answer. I mean, we could spend the next 20 minutes</p>
<p>   talking about it but I am not. </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> Well, there are other ideas coming up, NSW DPP is talking about</p>
<p>   treating addicts like diabetics..... </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well, I have indicated a reluctance, to put it mildly in relation</p>
<p>   to that. We have a view that you treat this at three levels. You</p>
<p>   do put more resources into law enforcement and I don't make</p>
<p>   any apology for that. No government can walk away from that responsibility</p>
<p>   difficult though it is. You don't stop putting money into police</p>
<p>   because burglary goes on. </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> Are you talking about Federal Police? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> I am talking about customs. I mean, our Tough on Drugs strategy</p>
<p>   has $290 million invested in it and of that $290 million $165 million</p>
<p>   goes towards Federal Police and customs and $125 million goes towards</p>
<p>   education and rehabilitation. When you bear in mind that we have</p>
<p>   the total customs responsibility and we have an international responsibility</p>
<p>   in relation to the location of Federal Police in places like Thailand</p>
<p>   that is an appropriate balance and people who say that I am only</p>
<p>   worried about law enforcement are ignoring the fact that we are</p>
<p>   putting what 40 per cent of all of the money we dedicate towards</p>
<p>   this problem, we are putting that into education and rehabilitation.</p>
<p>   I have never taken the view that you only respond to this problem</p>
<p>   with law enforcement measures but I have always taken the view that</p>
<p>   that is a very strong part of it. And all governments have to maintain</p>
<p>   their surveillance, maintain their vigilance on that front but at</p>
<p>   the same time you also have to put money into rehabilitation and</p>
<p>   into education. </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> Are you putting enough in there.....I've been getting</p>
<p>   a lot of calls that you can't get rehabilitation when they</p>
<p>   need it. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well, I guess the answer is that there is never enough. I mean,</p>
<p>   we have put more money into this at a national level than any other</p>
<p>   government. Now, that is not meant to be a political strike against</p>
<p>   the former Federal Labor Government, it's just a statement</p>
<p>   of fact. And I am happy to talk to the States and others about other</p>
<p>   areas where we can help. We have obviously got to be satisfied that</p>
<p>   the money goes to the right people. I am trying to involve all of</p>
<p>   the volunteer agencies as much as possible. </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> So there could be more money if needed could there? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well, in something like this the answer to that has to be yes</p>
<p>   but it has to be more money from the States as well. I mean, if</p>
<p>   there's an idea on the part of the States that because this</p>
<p>   is a big national issue then the Commonwealth will pick up all of</p>
<p>   the responsibility without asking the States to put more resources</p>
<p>   into it well we'll expect them to play their part. Now equally,</p>
<p>   I am not offering an open cheque but I am very concerned about this</p>
<p>   issue. I don't pretend to have all of the answers, I do not</p>
<p>   want to politicise it. I don't think there's anything</p>
<p>   unhealthy in the fact that Mr Kennett and I might have a different</p>
<p>   view on certain things. These are issues that defy the normal political</p>
<p>   categorisation. We are all creatures of our own values, our attitudes</p>
<p>   and our own experience and we all try to do our best to reach the</p>
<p>   right conclusion. I don't think Mr Kennett's views on</p>
<p>   this broad issue are very different from mine. We both hate it,</p>
<p>   we are both trying to respond as best we can.... </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> And I think everybody is frustrated, aren't they? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well, of course they are..... </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> And I guess that's the point, I mean, the Premiers'</p>
<p>   conference that you have got coming up, you suggested there'd</p>
<p>   be new ideas put on the table. Can you give us any indication of</p>
<p>   what ideas..... </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well, we're still working on, we're developing some</p>
<p>   further approaches and they are still in their formative stages</p>
<p>   and we hope they will help. You have got to keep doing this. No</p>
<p>   government on earth is going to solve this problem but you can make</p>
<p>   a difference. But it's very important we don't trivialise</p>
<p>   it. </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> I think the welfare groups and some of the other people are trying</p>
<p>   to push the envelope and that's for the same reason.....</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> I do understand that. </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> But is it time do you think to look at some of the envelope pushing</p>
<p>   if you like? It seems a more dramatic propositions being put up</p>
<p>   simply because of a sense of frustration? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well I understand why people are putting them up and I can only</p>
<p>   respond honestly to you that I'm not attracted to things like</p>
<p>   heroin trials. You and I discussed this before and I've said</p>
<p>   well you may disagree with me, some of your listeners may disagree</p>
<p>   with me, some will agree with me. I haven't made a political</p>
<p>   calculation on it. I'm just responding as best I can on the</p>
<p>   merits of the debate. And based on having a bit of a look at what</p>
<p>   has occurred overseas I don't know of one unambiguously successful</p>
<p>   example overseas of a heroin trial. There's not one. </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> That's interesting you say you haven't made a political</p>
<p>   calculation, it's been claimed by particularly people in Victoria</p>
<p>   that you have... </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well that is just wrong. </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> ....based on campaigns from sort of the New South Wales rednecks</p>
<p>   that it is a bad thing. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> New South Wales rednecks? That's a new political category!</p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> ... Alan Jones or the Sydney Telegraph ... </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> But hang on. I mean have you thought that on some issues some</p>
<p>   of the views expressed through both of those organs may be right,</p>
<p>   on other issues they are wrong. </p>
<p>  MITCHELL: </p>
<p> Of course, ... you respond to them because of political pressure....</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Look I am not making....I don't think anybody could accuse</p>
<p>   me of responding to political pressure on a lot of things. I mean</p>
<p>   most people told me I ought to have met Gerry Adams and I didn't.</p>
<p>   Most of the newspaper columnists said that I should meet him. I</p>
<p>   think there's only been one editorial in the country supporting</p>
<p>   me on that. So if you do a sort of calculation of political pressure....</p>
<p>   but I just made up my mind on what was my evaluation of the situation.</p>
<p>   I'm not....but look, drugs is a different issue than any</p>
<p>   other and I'm not making a political calculation. I am trying</p>
<p>   to arrive at conclusions in a conscientious way. I do not want to</p>
<p>   have diversionary arguments with Mr Kennett or indeed any other</p>
<p>   State Premier Â not for reasons of sort of political protection.</p>
<p>   Look if Jeff Kennett and I had a blazing row on this it is not going</p>
<p>   to make any great difference to either his political position or</p>
<p>   mine. The important thing is our differences on this on one or two</p>
<p>   issues are minor compared with our common commitment to work together</p>
<p>   as closely as possible to try and solve the problem. And I say thing</p>
<p>   to Mr Carr. I have not tried to make political capital out of this</p>
<p>   issue in the context of the New South Wales election. I'll</p>
<p>   attack Mr Carr on privatisation, and economic management and other</p>
<p>   things where I don't think he's doing a good job. That's</p>
<p>   a difference issue. This drugs issue is above and beyond that and</p>
<p>   I want to try and keep playing it that way. </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> Is it true that there's some division within the drugs council,</p>
<p>   council on drugs....that Brian Watters has been told to pull</p>
<p>   his head in.... </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well I'm not saying that he's had to pull he's</p>
<p>   had to pull his head in, but of course there... </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> I think he will. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well, of course he won't and I hope he doesn't. When</p>
<p>   it comes to an understanding of the human misery of drugs there</p>
<p>   are none better in the country at giving voice to that understanding</p>
<p>   than the people like Salvation Army officers. And the many other</p>
<p>   people who work at the coal face, or sharp end to use the clichs.</p>
<p>   Look Neil, I'm sure there are differences of opinion within</p>
<p>   that council. Because that council reflects not only Commonwealth</p>
<p>   appointments but also State appointments. It represents a range</p>
<p>   of views and I would be quite astonished if that council didn't</p>
<p>   reflect the range of views on this very difficult issue throughout</p>
<p>   the whole community. </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> You're meeting with the FBI director today. Well it has to</p>
<p>   be done obviously to see what ideas he's got but do you think</p>
<p>   there is any direct relationships that can be tied between Australia</p>
<p>   and the United States on this? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well I think our societies have a lot in common. We have a lot</p>
<p>   of dissimilarities as well. And I've never been somebody who</p>
<p>   thinks you can transfer directly from the American experience to</p>
<p>   Australia. But I can't see any harm in seeking his views, getting</p>
<p>   a run down on their experience. I was going to meet him anyway.</p>
<p>   We're going to talk about things other than drugs. And when</p>
<p>   I said I wanted to talk him about the zero tolerance policing, anybody</p>
<p>   who's interested in any kind of law and order or police issue</p>
<p>   would naturally want to know a bit more about what's happened</p>
<p>   in New York. Now whether you believe in zero tolerance or not, the</p>
<p>   fact is that New York ten years ago had an horrific reputation,</p>
<p>   an horrific reputation around the world, and everybody says that</p>
<p>   it's a much safer and more congenial place. Now... </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> And the problems have moved elsewhere. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well some people say that, others say they haven't. Now surely</p>
<p>   we should at least be interested in that. And I'm not going</p>
<p>   to suddenly say what applies in New York is relevant to Melbourne</p>
<p>   or Sydney but if you are broadly interested in the subject you ought</p>
<p>   to at least view what they've got to say. </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> Well that's true but they also do arrest people who....</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Yeah, I'm not arguing, I've never argued for that. I</p>
<p>   mean I certainly have no tolerance for drugs in schools. I have</p>
<p>   no tolerance for drug pushers. And I think most Australians, whatever</p>
<p>   their views are on other things would agree with that. And I don't</p>
<p>   think there's really any argument about that across the political</p>
<p>   divide. But you've got to be interested in an approach to law</p>
<p>   enforcement that has cut crime by the rates that it has been cut</p>
<p>   in a city like New York. </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> Do you think the courts are tough enough here? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Look I don't think you can give a broad brush response to</p>
<p>   that. I mean as an individual I'm surprised sometimes at the</p>
<p>   leniency of some sentences. On other occasions I'm not. It's</p>
<p>   very, very difficult, very, very difficult issue - sentencing and</p>
<p>   it is easy to get emotional about it and it's very issue to</p>
<p>   take pot shots at the judiciary and I don't think from my position</p>
<p>   I should do that. </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> Fair enough. If it's okay we'll take a couple of calls</p>
<p>   on this issue and then we'll move on to other matters. Hello</p>
<p>   Norm, go ahead please. </p>
<p> CALLER: </p>
<p> Yeah Mr Prime Minister, I'm a barrister who practices in</p>
<p>   criminal law. Look I've got bills to pay and mortgages to meet</p>
<p>   and stuff. And I mean if you legalise heroin how am I going to pay</p>
<p>   my bills? I mean if I can't do burglary trials or drug importation</p>
<p>   trials. If people don't commit crimes because of drugs....</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> I'd be interested to know your surname so I can look it up</p>
<p>   in the law almanac to see whether you are a barrister of the law.</p>
<p> CALLER: </p>
<p> I'm happy to tell you off the air. I'm not going to</p>
<p>   tell you on air. I just think it would be terrible if you legalise</p>
<p>   it because I wouldn't be able to pay my bills. </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> I think we'd call that sarcasm. We'll take the name</p>
<p>   off air and pass it on if you like. Hello Anne, go ahead. </p>
<p> CALLER: </p>
<p> Hello. Look I'm at the moment, I'm very tired, I have</p>
<p>   my daughter at home. She's been using heroin for over 12 years.</p>
<p>   I can't get her into a medical detox to then Â for her</p>
<p>   to move on into another detox, she needs to go to a therapeutic</p>
<p>   community. I think that everybody is missing the point with all</p>
<p>   of this. With the heroin addict and the polydrug user which my daughter</p>
<p>   has been. If they can't shoot up heroin they'll shoot</p>
<p>   up valium, alcohol, any drugs that they can get their hands on when</p>
<p>   they are desperate and as ill as my daughter is. Using recreation</p>
<p>   drugs leads to this dreadful dreadful illness. What I think needs</p>
<p>   to happen, my daughter came home and I had very strict rules. Now</p>
<p>   she can't enter my home if she is stoned or intoxicated because</p>
<p>   that is the only way I can survive and deal with this. </p>
<p> MITCHELL:  </p>
<p> What do you think needs to happen Anne? </p>
<p> CALLER: </p>
<p> Well what I think needs to happen is the minute they need help</p>
<p>   I think that the government has to Â because this has been</p>
<p>   an ongoing problem. We need an immediate medical detox, we need</p>
<p>   beds. My daughter has Hepatitis C, I'm wearing disposable gloves,</p>
<p>   I haven't slept for two days, I'm emptying buckets of</p>
<p>   vomit. And I'm also you know endangering myself to becoming</p>
<p>   a health risk. I don't know if I am making any sense. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Yes you are making a lot of sense. I sympathise with your position</p>
<p>   Â I've talked to a lot of parents in similar positions.</p>
<p>   And you're arguing as I understand it that there should be</p>
<p>   more detoxification, more rehabilitation facilities so that those</p>
<p>   who want to try and break the habit in medically appropriate and</p>
<p>   medically supported circumstances can do so. I think you're</p>
<p>   right. I think that's utterly...I can't argue with</p>
<p>   argue with anything you've said. I don't think any human</p>
<p>   being could. I feel very sorry for you. </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> Hello Michelle. </p>
<p> CALLER: </p>
<p> Yes good morning Neil. Good morning Mr Howard. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Good morning. </p>
<p> CALLER: </p>
<p> Mr Howard, I'm a former narcotics agent with the disbanded</p>
<p>   narcotics bureau which was disbanded 20 years ago. It was actually</p>
<p>   formed in 1969 and disbanded 10 years later. But now we're</p>
<p>   20 years past that down the track and we've just had a very</p>
<p>   bad news week down here. The drug enforcement situation has deteriorated</p>
<p>   under both Coalition and Labor governments. The functions of the</p>
<p>   drug enforcement went in 1979 across to the Australian Federal Police</p>
<p>   rather than being an autonomous - set up as it was... </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> Okay, Michelle, are you saying there should be a dedicated agency?</p>
<p> CALLER: </p>
<p> Absolutely. </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> Mr Howard? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Michelle, I'm familiar with that argument because I think</p>
<p>   as a former Minister responsible for the narcotics bureau through</p>
<p>   being Business and Consumer Affairs Minister I remember the arguments</p>
<p>   for and against. I think it's one of those arguments that will</p>
<p>   go on forever. You can't separate drug seizures from customs</p>
<p>   but you equally can't separate drug seizures from ordinary</p>
<p>   police activity. And the big seizures that we've had in recent</p>
<p>   months have been as a result of co-operation between the Federal</p>
<p>   Police the customs and the State police. And there's really</p>
<p>   no alternative in a federation such as Australia than to have co-operation</p>
<p>   between State and Federal authorities and within federal agencies.</p>
<p>   You will never get the States surrendering their police responsibility</p>
<p>   in this area. </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> Are resources an issue here, though? We're talking about</p>
<p>   resources...have the Federal Police got enough money? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p> Well, we've certainly put an enormous additional amount of</p>
<p>   money into them over the last 12, 18 months. And some of that money's</p>
<p>   only just now beginning to flow through. Now, you can argue that</p>
<p>   there wasn't enough in the past and I'm not going to argue</p>
<p>   the toss about that and once again, I'm not going to try and</p>
<p>   apportion blame but the past is the past. We have put a lot more</p>
<p>   resources into it and if there's a need for further resources,</p>
<p>   well they'll be made available. But you've got to be sensible</p>
<p>   about this and there is some evidence already emerging that those</p>
<p>   additional resources are starting to make a difference. </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> We'll take another quick call. Peter, go ahead please. </p>
<p> CALLER: </p>
<p> Hello, Mr Howard. Hello, Neil Mitchell. </p>
<p> MITCHELL: </p>
<p> Hi Peter. </p>
<p> CALLER: </p>
<p> I used to be a former [inaudible] in law enforcement police involved</p>
<p>   in drug law enforcement. I just want to point in a direction Â</p>
<p>   you're going to speak to the FBI because they police America.</p>
<p>   It's a bit different to our country. Canada has the same problem</p>
<p>   when the heroin floated in....specifically picked out by the</p>
<p>   drug laws. And it's very similar to our society with a large</p>
<p>   coast line and a population concentration in vast areas of wilderness.</p>
<p>   And they were flooded, as we have been, in 1991 and it might be</p>
<p>   an idea to have a look at how they've coped with things. We've</p>
<p>   had it</p>
