STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE BON P J KEATING MP<br />
MEETING WITH THE REPUBLIC ADVISORY COMMITEE<br />
In Canberra today I attended a meeting with the members of the Republic Advisory<br />
Committee.<br />
We discussed the progress of their work, and the Committee informed me of the<br />
activities they had undertaken to meet their terms of reference. Close to 20,000 copies<br />
of the Issues Paper and of the Australian Constitution have been distributed by the<br />
Secretariat. Since the Committee was established in April this year, it has held three formal<br />
meetings. The members have also had numerous discussions with interested parties,<br />
and consulted widely around Australia.<br />
The Committee will shortly complete its schedule of public meetings in the capital<br />
cities and selected regional centres of all States and Territonies.<br />
To date the Committee has received around 400 submissions, considerably more than<br />
originally expected.<br />
As a result, the Committee became concerned that its reporting deadline of I<br />
September 1993 would not allow sufficient time to consider fully all the public<br />
submissions, and to take account of them in developing options for their paper. They<br />
therefore requested an extension of their reporting date.<br />
I have agreed to the requested extension and the Committee will now provide its<br />
report to me by 30 September 1993.<br />
This one month extension will allow a corresponding extension of the cut-off date for<br />
public submissions to Monday 16 August 1993.<br />
For those wishing to take advantage of the extended deadline for submissions, free<br />
copies of the Committee's Issues Paper and the Australian Constitution will continue to<br />
be available by dialling 008-620186.<br />
