Prime Minister Julia Gillard today opened a new campus at the Western Autistic School in Laverton to help autistic students build social networks and help them transition to mainstream schools and programs.</p>
<p>She was joined by Member for Maribyrnong, Bill Shorten, whose electorate houses the Niddrie campus of the Western Autistic School.</p>
<p>The new facilities were built as part of the Gillard Government's Building the Education Revolution, with over $2 million provided for the work. </p>
<p>The purpose built campus includes a swimming pool that will be used to help teach children swimming skills and water safety as well as giving them an opportunity to participate in structured physical activity.</p>
<p>Speaking at the school, the Prime Minister said the project was a fantastic example of how the Government's Building the Education program could deliver real benefits, not only to students but also to their families and wider community.</p>
<p>Across Australia through BER we have invested $16.2 billion to upgrade more than 9,000 schools and support jobs in local communities.</p>
<p>In the Western Melbourne electorates of Lalor, Maribyrnong, Gorton and Gellibrand we have invested almost $423 million in new and upgraded facilities for local schools.</p>
<p>Through our More Support for Students with Disabilities initiative, announced in this year's budget, the Gillard Government is also providing $200 million to provide greater support for teachers and schools working with students with disabilities or learning difficulties.</p>
<p>In Victoria this amounts to $48 million over the 2012 and 2013 school years.  </p>
<p>This funding will help teachers invest in new tools and technologies including:</p>
<p> * 	new services such as speech and occupational therapy<br />
 * 	special equipment in classrooms such as audio and visual technology so that students can more easily<br />
 * 	more hours of in-class support from staff<br />
 * 	more training for teachers so they can learn the latest skills and strategies to improve the education of students with disabilities. </p>
