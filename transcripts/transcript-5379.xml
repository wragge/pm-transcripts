AFGHANISTAN: THE CHALLENGE<br />
AND THE LESSONS </p>
<p>AFGHANISTAN : THE CHALLENGE AND THE LESSONS<br />
The following is the edited text of an address<br />
by the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. Malcolm Fraser,<br />
to the Queensland State Council of the Liberal Party of Australia<br />
in Brisbane on 15 June 1980.<br />
We meet at a vital time for Australia. The hazards<br />
confronting the freedom of people and nations have<br />
increased since the year began. The historically<br />
invaluable influence of countries in the West to the<br />
cause of human liberty is yet again under challenge. It<br />
is a challenge which, if not faced now and successfully<br />
surmounted, has the potential to deny us at some time<br />
in the future, the victories in values and freedom that<br />
we seek for all future generations of Australians. It is<br />
about the nature and extent of that challenge and the<br />
dimension of our response that I want to speak to you<br />
today. As the world knows, on Christmas Eve last year,<br />
Soviet troop carrier aircraft started landing at Kabul<br />
airport. Two days later, 5000 Soviet troops had taken<br />
over Kabul. President Amin of Afghanistan was<br />
killed the next day. By New Year's Eve, 40 000<br />
troops were fanning out across Afghanistan to seize<br />
control of major towns. The new Soviet-installed<br />
president of Afghanistan, Mr Babrak Karmal, made<br />
his first appearance on Kabul television screens on<br />
New Year's Day.<br />
Today, five and a half months later, 85 000 Soviet<br />
troops are locked in conflict against a valiant national<br />
resistance campaign that seems to have united significant<br />
elements of Afghan society. To say that the<br />
Soviet Union has acted, and is acting, brutally is not<br />
to engage in rhetoric. It is merely to describe the facts.<br />
When, in the Second World War, the Nazis wiped out<br />
the whole male population of a Czechoslovakian<br />
village-some 400 to 500 men-the whole civilised<br />
world recoiled in horror. Yet now, it is reported on<br />
evidence provided by the womcn and children who<br />
survived, that well over twice that number were murdered<br />
in cold-blood, and under Russian supervision,<br />
in the Afghan village of Kerala.<br />
There are already over half a million refugees in<br />
Pakistan, people who have found conditions intolerable<br />
in their own country. It is feared that the number<br />
could quickly rise to one million.<br />
Reassessment These dramatic events demand a fundamental<br />
reassessment of widely accepted Western and Third<br />
World perceptions and assumptions concerning security<br />
and detente; perceptions and assessments which have been comforting and lulling in their effect,<br />
but to some extent have reflected wishful thinking<br />
rather than hard analysis.<br />
In a recent address to the American Society of<br />
Newspaper Editors in Washington, the former<br />
American Secretary of State, Dr Henry Kissinger,<br />
when warning that a danger ignored is a debacle<br />
invited, argued that: ' I happen to agree with President<br />
Carter, that the danger to America is the gravest<br />
of the modern period'.<br />
Events in Afghanistan have given us a new<br />
example of the Soviet Union's commitment to achieving<br />
great military power in pursuit of its ambitions.<br />
History since 1945 confirms that, where the Soviet<br />
Union perceives the opportunity for an advance, the<br />
concern for peace is instantly put aside. Remember<br />
the invasion of Hungary in 1956; the Berlin wall in<br />
196 1; the Cuban missile crisis in 1962; the invasion of<br />
Czechoslovakia in 1968.<br />
It was the invasion of Czechoslovakia that<br />
President Brezhnev sought to justify through what is<br />
now accepted as the Brezhnev doctrine. What is pernicious<br />
about the Brezhnev doctrine is the imposition<br />
of Soviet dominance, in the guise of rendering assistance.<br />
The fact is that it is the Soviet itself which decides<br />
when ' assistance ' is to be given.<br />
Indeed, the Brezhnev doctrine virtually asserts that,<br />
once a country has become socialist, assistance will be<br />
given to make sure that it remains so. But the invitations<br />
to intervene, allegedly to ptovide assistance,<br />
are issued by puppet leaders. Notwithstanding the instability<br />
and tension created by Soviet behaviour,<br />
attempts at detente were made throughout the 1970s.<br />
But it soon became apparent that the view of detente<br />
by the West was not shared by the Soviet Union.<br />
It is important to unpack the parcel of items<br />
labelled ' detente' in the last decade, and to distinguish<br />
what was beneficial and sound from what<br />
was illusory. What many people failed to realise was<br />
that the Soviet Union did not accept that detente<br />
precluded them from any action that would advantage<br />
them in the Third World, or in the world at large.<br />
It was, to them, little more than a relationship with<br />
Europe and the United States, in which the threat of<br />
direct confrontation between superpowers was<br />
reduced. As a result, since detente, we have seen the </p>
<p>Soviet Union pursue a policy of unbridled competition<br />
and opportunism; actively and openly seeking<br />
to further international influence by subversion, by<br />
the provision of arms, and by the use of surrogates in<br />
Angola, Ethiopia, South Yemen and Vietnam.<br />
Of course, the most recent and most brazen<br />
example has been in Afghanistan, where the Soviet<br />
army-the largest and most powerful land army in the<br />
world-has been used to invade a defenceless Third<br />
World country. This indicates most clearly how longheld<br />
Soviet ambitions can be suddenly realised when<br />
an opportunity presents itself.<br />
For, in 1940, when Hitler made overtures to Stalin,<br />
one of the prices set by Stalin for Russian friendship,<br />
was a recognition by the Germans that Soviet<br />
national aspirations centre south of the national territory<br />
of the Soviet Union in the direction of the Indian<br />
Ocean'. In the light of such a statement, the Singapore<br />
Foreign Minister was perhaps very much on target<br />
when he argued recently that there was nothing<br />
surprising about the Soviet foray into Afghanistan.<br />
Rather, he said, what was surprising was the ' gullibility<br />
of non-com munists'.<br />
The recognition of the true nature ot the strategic<br />
situation brought about by the invasion of Afghanistan<br />
does not, any longer, permit gullibility. As a result<br />
of this invasion, the Soviet Union has succeeded in<br />
achieving: the creation of a client state<br />
a closer proximity to the Indian Ocean and Persian<br />
Gulf access to alternative bases for strategic aircraft<br />
should the U. S. S. R. desire it<br />
an ability to deploy troops across the Pakistani<br />
border an inherent ability, depending upon the type of aircraft<br />
that may be deployed, to provide tactical air<br />
support over the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea,<br />
and the Eastern half of Saudi Arabia<br />
the inherent ability to provide a limited air support<br />
to the Soviet Indian Ocean squadron.<br />
Stability undermined<br />
Stability, not only in South-West Asia, but also in the<br />
world generally, has been undermined. It is now up to<br />
all nations, and all people dedicated to freedom, to do<br />
what they can, singly or collectively, to deny the<br />
Soviet Union any further opportunity, whether in the<br />
Third World or in the world at large.<br />
Regrettably, the world is no longer as many<br />
thought it to be; or, as many wanted to see it. The<br />
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan has shocked the West<br />
and moved it to reassess its assumptions about security<br />
and detente. As a result of this, in the court of<br />
world opinion, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan<br />
stands decisively condemned by Western countries<br />
and by the Third World countries. The fact that the invasion of Afghanistan is of crucial<br />
significance is evidenced by a British White Paper<br />
on Defence on 2 April this year. It warned that the<br />
Soviet Union will continue to watch for opportunities<br />
to build up its influence in further countries and will<br />
be ready again to use its force.<br />
It argued that the object of this drive for Soviet<br />
influence is to limit and reduce first the influence and<br />
then the security of the West. The likelihood of this is<br />
greater as a result of the fact that, while attempts were<br />
being made at detente with the Soviet Union, the balance<br />
of strategic military capability shifted steadily to<br />
their ultimate advantage.<br />
Through the 1970s, Soviet military spending<br />
averaged between I I and 13 per cent of GNP, while<br />
the comparable figure in the U. S. A. has been 5 per<br />
cent. As a result, trained military manpower, available<br />
to the Soviet Union, exceeds that available to the<br />
United States by over 6 million. Soviet ground forces<br />
outnumber those of the U. S. A. by nine to one; these<br />
divisions are supported by tanks, missiles and artillery<br />
which collectively outnumber the U. S. A. by a factor<br />
of two to one.<br />
Taking this comparison on to the NATO-Warsaw<br />
Pact military balance, we find that the Warsaw Pact<br />
has a marked superiority over the NATO allies. It has<br />
over 200 divisions that could be promptly deployed,<br />
NATO has about 100. The Warsaw Pact armament<br />
includes 30 000 tanks compared with NATO with a<br />
little over 12 000. The Warsaw Pact forces have 5000<br />
combat planes at their disposal, NATO just over<br />
3000. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has over<br />
the years repeatedly warned of the dangers of the unceasing<br />
expansion and improvement of Soviet military<br />
capabilities and urged the West to enhance its<br />
own defence efforts in response. In 1976 the NATO<br />
Ministerial Council expressed concern at the high<br />
level of military expenditure by the Soviet Union and<br />
the continued disquieting expansion of the military<br />
power of the Warsaw Pact on land, air and sea, which<br />
the Council noted, were difficult to reconcile with the<br />
avowed desire of the Soviet Union to improve East-<br />
West relations. These sentiments were expressed<br />
again at the London NATO summit in 1977 and at<br />
the 1978, 1979 and 1980 Council meetings.<br />
NATO ministers have clearly foreseen the prospect<br />
of Soviet military might threatening the stability of<br />
the military balance at all levels-conventional, nuclear,<br />
land, sea and air. Of course, gross comparisons<br />
of this kind do not take into consideration military<br />
factors and qualitative differences between forces on<br />
both sides.<br />
For example, because of deep antipathy between<br />
the U. S. S. R. and China, Soviet planning must take<br />
into consideration two sets of contingencies; one in<br />
Europe and the other on the Chinese border. Nevertheless,<br />
these large disparities in military capability </p>
<p>are disturbing. In the coming decade, the Soviet<br />
Union will be seen by others, and will perceive itself,<br />
as having for the first time, a politically significant<br />
margin of nuclear superiority over the United States<br />
and its allies; together with its undoubted conventional<br />
weapon superiority.<br />
Weapon superiority<br />
This conventional weapon superiority was not as significant<br />
when the United States possessed greater nuclear<br />
strength than the U. S. S. R. But now that the<br />
Soviet Union has achieved its new strength, it will<br />
perceive, as will other states, that its margin of strategic<br />
advantage accords it greater freedom to pursue<br />
challenging and aggressive policies in the Third<br />
World and elsewhere.<br />
This superiority will open up a window of opportunity<br />
for the Soviet Union in the I1980s. The window<br />
will be all the wider unless we understand clearly how<br />
the Soviet Union views concepts such as detente. It is<br />
no use us persisting with one view of detente and<br />
ignoring the quite different views of it held by the<br />
Soviet Union.<br />
The Soviet Union, taking detente in a different<br />
light, may be tempted to use their increased capability.<br />
In fact, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan<br />
could be the first exercise of a new-found Soviet confidence<br />
in the decade of the 1980s-' the dangerous<br />
1980s'-as Henry Kissinger has described them.<br />
Our task is to make sure that, while it is the first<br />
such exercise, it will also be the last. Undeniably,<br />
Afghanistan is important to Australia, not only as a<br />
test case for Soviet behaviour in the 1 980s; but also<br />
because of its geographical location in a region of<br />
major strategic significance to the Western Worldthe<br />
oil producing countries of the Persian Gulf and<br />
Arabian Peninsula.<br />
At the other end of Asia, in Indochina, the Soviet<br />
Union continues to support actively Vietnam's military<br />
domination. As the price for its support, the<br />
Soviet Union has secured its access to air and naval<br />
facilities in Vietnam, which potentially threaten<br />
China, United States deployment capability based in<br />
the Philippines, and the independent countries of the<br />
region. Because of the extent of the Soviet arms build-up;<br />
because of the strength of Soviet military superiority;<br />
because of Soviet moves in defiance of detente,<br />
Afghanistan has underlined most emphatically the reality<br />
of the world in which we live. In this world,<br />
Australia cannot afford to be complacent. How freedom<br />
loving nations together respond to the challenge<br />
of the Afghanistan crisis will be a crucial determinant<br />
of our security for decades to come. Six lessons<br />
Afghanistan is of crucial significance, and it is vital<br />
that its lessons be learnt and applied. I suggest there<br />
are six basic lessons:<br />
first, greater unity and cohesion among the allies of<br />
the United States is essential; and a much greater<br />
degree of consensus needs to be developed among<br />
all those who value national independence<br />
second, we must maintain absolute clarity and certainty<br />
in our signals to the Soviet Union, in order<br />
that our interests and the limits of our tolerance are<br />
not misread by Moscow<br />
third, new levels of defence preparedness must be<br />
achieved and maintained in order to demonstrate<br />
that major Western countries do not see their<br />
interests as being confined to Europe and its immediate<br />
environment<br />
fourth, channels of communication must be kept<br />
open to Moscow<br />
fifth, Western countries must continue to stnive for<br />
arms control agreements with the Soviet Union, but<br />
they must do so recognising that they can only succeed<br />
if the necessary political preconditions are<br />
met. They cannot succeed as long as the Soviet<br />
Union persists with a concept of detente which<br />
allows for the relentless accumulation of weapons<br />
and their uninhibited deployment in Third World<br />
disputes sixth, Western countries must attend to strengthening<br />
their links with like-minded countries in their<br />
parts of the world, while recognising the particular<br />
problems and needs of such countries.<br />
Such an approach must be pursued with resolution<br />
and steadfastness, over what may be quite a long<br />
period of time. But this approach offers the best<br />
prospect of a realistic accommodation with Moscow.<br />
It offers the best opportunity of continuing peace. The<br />
Australian Government holds firmly to the view that,<br />
at this time, it is vital to stand with our friends and<br />
allies. The Government faced in January a challenge that<br />
involved difficult decisions for Australia:<br />
in our bilateral relations with the Soviet Union<br />
in the area of our relations with our major friends<br />
and allies<br />
in the area of our own defence spending and defence<br />
priorities.<br />
With respect to our bilateral relations, on 9 January<br />
the Government announced a number of decisions<br />
intended to bring home to the Soviet Union and its<br />
people an expression of the strongest possible opposition<br />
to the Soviet action in Afghanistan.<br />
In the area of trade, Australia has acted in concert<br />
with other grain exporting nations in support of the<br />
U. S. action to limit grain sales to the Soviet Union.<br />
We are also supporting the list of high technology<br />
items which North America, Japan and Western </p>
<p>Europe agree should be subject to export control. We<br />
have curtailed scientific, cultural and high level<br />
official exchanges with the Soviet Union. We have<br />
curtailed the operation of Soviet fishing projects, and<br />
cruise ships in Australian waters.<br />
Inr seeking to act in concert with our major allies,<br />
the Government had hoped to secure Australia's support<br />
for an Olympic Games boycott. It is a matter of<br />
great regret that the Executive of the Australan Olympic<br />
Federation saw differently. With over sixty<br />
nations staying away from the Games, representing<br />
more than half the world's population, the world's rejection<br />
of Soviet behaviour has been formally registered<br />
with the Soviet leadership.<br />
This brings me to a very serious point. Australia is<br />
now isolated in our region. China, Japan, South<br />
Korea, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Thailand,<br />
Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea,<br />
Fiji and de facto New Zealand will not be attending.<br />
In deciding to attend the Moscow Games, Australia<br />
is virtually alone in the region in company with only<br />
communist Laos, communist Vietnam and communist<br />
North Korea. I have to say that I find that a<br />
shameful and repugnant position to be in.<br />
Defence of liberty<br />
Australia, as an independent nation, with an unqualified<br />
record in defence of liberty and the right to<br />
be free, has a need and bounden duty to support other<br />
free and independent nations. To fail to do so is to<br />
deny our history. Moreover, as an ally of the U. S. A.,<br />
Australia has a specific and urgent need to support the<br />
world's greatest free power. Each of these grounds<br />
standing alone is sufficient for a boycott. Both<br />
together represent an overwhelming argument to<br />
which it is not too late for the AOF to respond.<br />
It is hard to understand, then, how the Executive of<br />
the AOF, exercising their independent right to make a<br />
decision, have decided to place their perceived duty<br />
to the international Olympic movement above their<br />
duty to Australia, and to all Australians.<br />
The Government has always accepted the high priority<br />
that must be given in our national life to young<br />
people and their pursuit of excellence in all things, including<br />
sport. We will continue to act upon this priority.<br />
Our advocacy of a boycott represents our support<br />
of a higher priority. For, as the Soviet human<br />
rights activist and Nobel Prizewinner, Andrei<br />
Sakharov, has said:<br />
The broadest possible boycott of the Moscow<br />
Olympics is necessary. Every spectator or athlete<br />
who comes to the Olympics will be giving indirect<br />
support to Soviet military policies.<br />
Such a prospect is untenable. Whatever hold the<br />
world now has on peace will be made measurably<br />
more secure by Australian support of an Olympic<br />
boycott. I do not want to exaggerate the importance<br />
of what a country like Australia can do. But I do not minimise it either. I reject those who want to write<br />
Australia down as having no influence in the world.<br />
The fact is that we have a voice and we can make a<br />
contribution towards the evolution of a common<br />
strategy. Over the past five months, my Ministers and I have<br />
sought to do what we could to contribute towards a<br />
stronger Western alliance, under the leadership of the<br />
United States; and we have discussed with countries<br />
in our region, and in Europe, the consequences of<br />
Afghanistan. We have argued the, need for closer cooperation<br />
and consultation. Our common objectives<br />
require that countries which -value their national<br />
independence speak with strenigth supported by adequate<br />
defence capabilities.<br />
In this respect, NATO's determination-already<br />
evidenced before the invasion of Afghanistan-to<br />
modernise and strengthen its theatre nuclear weapon<br />
system and conventional forces, is important. For its<br />
part, the United States is proposing real increases in<br />
defence spending over the next five years, taking it<br />
cumulatively to more than 20 per cent above the current<br />
level.<br />
Defence decisions<br />
The third aspect of our own response concerns the defence<br />
decisions announced in detail by Mr Killen on<br />
c25 March. These involve the raising of our own level<br />
of national defence preparedness; increased efforts in<br />
defence co-operation with friendly nations in our region;<br />
and practical measures in support of the United<br />
States, particularly in the Indian Ocean area.<br />
Under the five year defence program announced<br />
by the Government, there will be an average increase<br />
in defence expenditure of 7 per cent per annum in real<br />
terms. Total defence expenditure in 1984-85 is<br />
expected to reach about 3 per cent of gross domestic<br />
product; and defence expenditure in 1980-8 1 is<br />
expected to show a real increase of 5 per cent above<br />
the 1979-80 level.<br />
The program calls for an increase in expenditure on<br />
capital items. Since we came to government, expenditure<br />
on capital items has risen from 8.3 per cent of<br />
total defence expenditure in 1975-76 to almost 16 per<br />
cent in 1979-80; and it will rise to over 25 per cent by<br />
1984-85.<br />
For an island continent such as Australia, looking<br />
at two oceans, maritime surveillance is of great<br />
importance. In order to strengthen our capabilities in<br />
the air:<br />
we will double the Orion surveillance hours flown,<br />
and increase the number of crews available for this<br />
purpose we will modernise the ten older PB3 Orion surveillance<br />
aircraft so that, like the newer PC3s, these<br />
aircraft will be equipped with harpoon antishipping<br />
missiles. When launched from beyond the<br />
horizon range of ships, the harpoon missile has </p>
<p>devastating accuracy against surface vessels within<br />
a range of 100 kmn<br />
we will acquire seventy-five new tactical fighters<br />
we will upgrade our F Ill aircraft to enable them to<br />
carry precision guided weapons.<br />
For the Navy:<br />
we have decided to acquire a fourth FFG guided<br />
missile frigate from the and negotiations<br />
have already been completed for this, and orders<br />
placed we have already ordered one underway replenishment<br />
ship to be built at Vickers Dockyard in Sydney,<br />
and plan to order-a second, also to be built in<br />
an Australian shipyard. Both these will provide<br />
fuel, oil, stores and weapons for ships at sea<br />
we plan to order a further ten Fremantle class patrol<br />
boats, in addition to fifteen already on order<br />
which are being built in Cairns.<br />
In order to strengthen our capabilities on land:<br />
we have constituted the Third Army Task Force in<br />
Townsville as a ready reaction force, capable of<br />
offering support on short notice<br />
we are going to upgrade the Army's firepower by<br />
acquiring medium 155 mmn calibre long range<br />
weapons and more mobile and lighter 105 mmn<br />
weapons. In performance, range and rate of fire,<br />
these are the very latest in technology<br />
we plan to acquire some 2000 4 and 8 tonne trucks;<br />
with this order, we are seeking a high proportion of<br />
local production.<br />
In my statement to the Parliament in February, one of<br />
the measures foreshadowed during the period of the<br />
five year defence program, was an expansion from<br />
22 000 to 30 000 in the strength of the Army Reserve.<br />
We are now looking to bring this forward more<br />
rapidly, by bringing the reserve units up to full<br />
strength by the middle of 198 1. Our judgment is that<br />
we must enlarge the number of Australians trained<br />
for military service so that there is a bigger nucleus,<br />
and a younger nucleus ( and I wish to stress younger),<br />
around which further expansion could take place<br />
more quickly in the event of strategic prospects<br />
worsening in the future. Expansion of the target figure<br />
of 30 000 would restore the reserve to the levels at<br />
which they stood at the early 1970s, before they were<br />
wound down by our political opponents.<br />
Face implications<br />
The reasons for embarking on this expansion can be<br />
distilled into one simple fact; which is that, at a time<br />
when international uncertainties are greater than for<br />
many years, the proportion of young Australians<br />
trained for military service is at its smallest for thirty<br />
years. The nation must face the implications of this<br />
situation squarely.<br />
It reflects a trend, which if allowed to continue,<br />
would weaken our security. Indeed, if we did not halt such a trend, we would rightly stand condemned by<br />
generations in the future.<br />
Part of this program is already underway, in planning<br />
to organise reception, training, equipment, stores<br />
and support, capable of accommodating an increase<br />
in the reserve strength. The Government has stressed<br />
that reserve training requires not only dedicated<br />
officers and men and women who must give of their<br />
own time; but also, it requires an appropriate commitment<br />
by the permanent forces themselves along with<br />
adequate equipment and support.<br />
The Government is determined that these provisions<br />
shall be made. In order to gain the young recruits,<br />
a major advertising campaign will be undertaken.<br />
Recent indications suggest that many young<br />
people are willing to come forward to serve the<br />
country by undertaking training in the Army Reserve.<br />
A heartening example of this is the revival of interest<br />
in university regiments which reflects growing credit<br />
on, and an increased sense of responsibility in,<br />
Australia's young people. It represents an encouraging<br />
perception and a welcome sense of awareness of<br />
the dangers in the present international order. The<br />
Government is determined to support its new defence<br />
preparedness with proper infrastructure facilities:<br />
Cockburn Sound naval base facilities will be<br />
improved in order to support deployments and<br />
base porting, and later home porting, of ships<br />
operating in the Indian Ocean<br />
the Learmonth Air Base will undergo improvement<br />
to ground facilities, fuel storage and weapon<br />
replenishment a modern air field will be built at Derby to fill the<br />
gap between Learmonth and Darwin<br />
patrol boat facilities at Darwin and Cairns are<br />
being upgraded<br />
the Garden Island dockyard in Sydney is being<br />
modernised, in order to support our fleet and allow<br />
re-fit work to be carried out on major vessels<br />
the Williamstown dockyard, where new destroyers<br />
will be built later in the decade, will be upgraded<br />
and modernised<br />
a new, widened and more secure defence<br />
communications system is being installed.<br />
Of course, all of this is but part of the Government's<br />
program of initiatives for upgrading Australian defence<br />
capabilities. As the program unfolds, additional<br />
decisions will obviously be made.<br />
Ours is a total package. It is supported by the<br />
Government's determination to develop a stronger<br />
industrial and economic capacity in the decade<br />
ahead; and our economic achievements of the last<br />
four and a half years have moved us significantly in<br />
that direction. At a time of increasing international<br />
economic pressures, Australia compares more than<br />
favourably with many of her major trading partners.<br />
This augurs well for Australia's future. </p>
<p>Understanding the challenge<br />
Inevitably, it is a future of great significance for our<br />
young people, the quality of whose lives in the years<br />
ahead depends so much on the response that we<br />
make, as a nation, to the challenge confronting us.<br />
Part of our successful response involves understanding<br />
the challenge; identifying the dangers and the<br />
threats. We need a clear eye for our own objectives; a<br />
firm hand in reaching our goals. Let us proclaim the<br />
principles that guide the values we defend.<br />
When decisions appear hard and complex, let us<br />
look to our principles and our objectives in order to<br />
clear the course that we must pursue. But in pursuing<br />
our principles and values, we must remember that the<br />
Soviet Union is also of this world; that, ultimately,<br />
they and we must find a means of living together if<br />
peace is to endure.<br />
It must be understood that our determination is not<br />
directed against the Russian people but against the policies of expansion and domination pursued by the<br />
Soviet leadership. These policies have come together<br />
in Afghanistan. That is why world leaders and individuals,<br />
concerned for human values; concerned for<br />
the cause of mankind, have determined to send a<br />
clear signal to Moscow. A signal, whose strength<br />
demonstrates to the Soviet Union that the judgments<br />
of the world cann6t be ignored.<br />
Each of us has a role to play in sending that signal.<br />
Each of us has a commitment to our own future.<br />
Without that commitment, our freedom and, perhaps,<br />
in the end, its existence will not be sustained.<br />
That is why each generation must be prepared to defend<br />
for itself the right to liberty, if liberty and the<br />
pursuit of happiness are to be guaranteed and<br />
secured. What we defend is an inheritance which<br />
extends beyond the span of a lifetime. Today's responsibility<br />
is ours; let us fulfil it well.<br />
