    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I've spoken to Peter Debnam. I've congratulated him on being elected as the new Leader of the New South Wales Parliamentary Liberal Party. I will give him all the support I possibly can in the task ahead. The people of New South Wales desperately want a strong alternative to the present Labor Government and I know that Mr Debnam and Barry O'Farrell and their colleagues will now immediately set about providing that alternative.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How great a task is it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's a big task but the public in New South Wales has lost patience with Labor. Labor has an appalling track record on financial management, on hospitals on public transport and there is great opportunity for a strong alternative and it's now Mr Debnam's responsibility with the support of his party to provide exactly that. Thank you.</p>
