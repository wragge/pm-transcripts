STh follow-ing is the text of the final communique:-<br />
The meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers was con llded<br />
' today. Pais-tan,, Ghana and Cyprus were represented by their<br />
Prs-iderO74/ 4 The other Commonwealth countries were represented<br />
by tbheJ-r Prime Ministers.<br />
2. It had been agreed that on this occasion the Prime<br />
Ministers would concentrate the-itjainoattention on a limited<br />
number of specific problems which are'currently-of-fcommon concern<br />
to them all namely, disarmament, the structure of the United<br />
Nations and certain-onstitutional Problems affecting the Commonweal-<br />
thr-t-tclf.-At the outset of the meeting, however, the<br />
Prime Ministers held a general review of the international<br />
~-situation as a whole, in order to sot these particular problems<br />
in the perspective of current world events. They also considered,<br />
in the course of their meeting, recent.. dovelopments in the Congo<br />
aand in South East Asia.<br />
3. The Prime Ministers re-affirmed the support of their<br />
Governments for the efforts of the United Nations to restore<br />
order in the Congo and to secure the independonce and integrity<br />
of the Republic. They deplored outside intervontion in the<br />
Congo and recognisod that many of the problems which had arisen<br />
were due to such inturvention. They considered that the<br />
United Nations forces in the Congo should be strengthened and<br />
that the Security Council resolution of the 21st February<br />
should be fully implernonted.<br />
The Prime Ministers noted with concern the situation<br />
which had developed in Laos. They-ox. pressed the hope that the<br />
part us would be able to reconcile their differunces, that intcrvent<br />
on from outsid would cease, and that Laos would be , nablcd.<br />
to etjoy an independent, noutral and peaceful oxistonc,.<br />
The Prime Ministers held a full discussion on the<br />
problem of disarmament. They recognisod that this was the most<br />
important question facing the world today and considered that<br />
a favourable opportunity was now at hand for a fresh initiative<br />
towards a settloment Df it. They agroed that the aim should be<br />
to achieve general and complet disarmament, subject to effective<br />
inspection and control, on the general lines indicated in the<br />
statement in Annex 1 of this communique. They rocall. jd the<br />
resolution on gonoral and c:) mplote disarmament, which was adopted<br />
unanimously at the 14th session of the General Assombly. They<br />
agreed that every offort should be made to implement this<br />
resoluti-n. by agroeement betwooeen the major powers, and that<br />
further nogotiati. ons fo-r this purpose were necessary. Certain<br />
pr posals d6signd to promot such negotiations have booeen put<br />
by various c-untrios before the United Nations.<br />
6, The Prime Ministors expressed their h'pe that the<br />
negotiations on the cessation of nuclear weapons tests which<br />
were due to re-opon atGav.-on--21st March, would lead to the<br />
early conclusi-n _ f an agreoment-n . this subject. Such an<br />
agreement apart fr': m its imrortance in itself would providc i<br />
powerful impetus towards agreement on disarmament generally.<br />
7. The Prime Ministers c-nsiderod the various proposals<br />
which have recently booeen put forward for changes in the structure<br />
of its Councils, the position the Sacr ; tary-G. noral and the<br />
ganisati. n -f the Secretariat. They recognised that such<br />
changes could Dnly be made with general consent. They agroo </p>
<p>-2-<br />
that whatever adjustments night be made it remained vitally<br />
important t) uphild thc purp) scs and principles f the United<br />
Nti-ns Charter and to prcsrve the internatienal and independet<br />
character -f the Secretariat. They furthcr agreed that members<br />
-f the C. r-mmnw-alth sharOd with all nati-ns a fundamental<br />
coL -M interest in naintaining the integrity ) f the United Natiens<br />
as a fcrco fer -? rderly p:-litical ecn-ic and secial -pr-grcss<br />
thr-ughut the werld.<br />

<p>ANNEX I DISARM4ENT<br />
Aim<br />
1. The air must be t-aciivc ttal wrid-wido disarmaiont-,<br />
subject to effective ins,, ction and contr.) l.<br />
2, In viOw of the slaughter anc! dcstructi-n experinccd<br />
in so-called " convcntion~ al" wars and f the difficulty of<br />
preventing a conventi-nal war, once strtd,--rm.. ovcJ~ Opin<br />
into) a nuclear war, * ur ain must be " t-hing less than the<br />
complete aholiti-' n the means of waginig war Df any kind.<br />
Princiolcs<br />
3. An agreement for this purpose should bc ncgotiated as<br />
soon as possible, on the basis _ f the fDllowing principles:-<br />
All national arrmed forces an, 1, anrmovamnts must be reduced<br />
to the levels agreed to nocess-ry f-, r internal security.<br />
Once started, the lprcess of c'isar' : a;, oent should be continued<br />
without intorruDtion until it is comipleted,<br />
subject to verification at each stage that all parties<br />
are duly carrying -ut their undertakings.<br />
The clininati-n of nulcar anc conventi-nal arma: ments<br />
must be so phasoed that at no stage will any country<br />
or grup of countries obtain a significant military<br />
advantage. In respect of each phasc, there should bu established,<br />
by agreement, off ctive nmac', inery inspection, which<br />
shuld coe int-opc rati-n simuiltaneously with the<br />
phase of di. sarmamnt to which it relates.<br />
Disarm-i-ament sh-, uld', b. carrkd ut a s rapidly as Possible<br />
in progressive staces, within s-ccifiod peri-ds -f timc.<br />
At the a" ppropriat stage, a substantial and alequately<br />
ar-ed military force should be establishod, to keep<br />
the peace and enforce observance-f the 2isarmnal~ ent<br />
agreement, and an international autW'rity sho. ulcl be<br />
created, in associaticn with the United Natins, tcontrl<br />
this f-, rce and to 3nsure that it is not used<br />
for any purose inconsistunt with the charter.<br />
4. On the basis -f the above princi: ples, it shulc be<br />
pssiblc, given goo: dwill on both sides, to reconcile the prcsent<br />
differences approach betweeOn the dl-ifforcnt . plans jut--forward.<br />
Nc7otiati ns<br />
The Drincipal ilitary p-Dwers should resume direct<br />
neo tiati--) ns with-ut delay in cl-se-c-ontact with the Unitec!<br />
Ncati-ns, which is respor nsible fcr disp7rmamint under the Chaarter.<br />
Since -' eace is the concern of the whov-le wo: rld, o. t her natio'. ns<br />
shuld. also be associated with the disnrmament ne-: tiati-ns<br />
either directly -r through sme social macaincry to be set u-)<br />
by the United Nati-. ns, : r by both means.<br />

an agrieeme'lnt is urgent, since -t[-irwisc further c-mintrics may<br />
