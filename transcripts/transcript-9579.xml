TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
POST-BUDGET ADDRESS TO THE COLLINGWOOD FOOTBALL CLUB,<br />
MELBOURNE, 12 MAY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
It's great to be back with Collingwood again good ci' Collingwood forever.<br />
They know how to play the game, and they do, and there's a thing about<br />
Collingwood two things: commitment and loyalty. That's what I always<br />
think when I think of Collingwood, I always think of commitment and<br />
loyalty, and it is the great underdog club. And I always say, in the political<br />
context, what's the best position in the race to be well, this is racing<br />
parlance, not football parlance but one out and one back. One out and<br />
one back not quite in front, but one out and one back, and make a rails<br />
run at the death. And that's what you are doing at the moment Alan, I know<br />
that. He's a cunning fellow, that Alan he's got a strategy here, and that's<br />
the pendulum it's the same in politics when that pendulum swings up,<br />
you get all that tear back, and then of course, we will see a great round of<br />
Collingwood victories in the latter part of the season. Anyway, I hope I'm<br />
there to see a couple of them And let's, at least, mark today as perhaps<br />
one of those days. I think it's been a good week for the country, and if it's a<br />
good week for the country, then it's a good week for Collingwood. And, so<br />
let's mark this day as a day where maybe the pendulum has reached the<br />
top of the swing.<br />
Well, I'm here to talk about the Budget, and I know people think Budgets<br />
are pretty dry things I suppose they are, but they do get your blood racing<br />
on occasions. And this one has got John Howard's blood racing. Poor little<br />
Johnny was in there last night doing his best, gesticulating and carrying on,<br />
but they were a very glum little side behind him when they left. It was very<br />
interesting, the House of Representatives: it has this it's a bit like a<br />
football match the mood moves up and down the field. And always in the<br />
high professionalism of politics the same as football you know when you<br />
doing well, you know when you have been hurt I mean, you might walk<br />
straight, but you know it's hurting like hell and you know when you have IN </p>
<p>hurt the other guy. And they were a little hurt, little bunch this week, I can<br />
tell you. And ours were a little happy little bunch. So, there's a bit of<br />
something going on there in Australian politics.<br />
But let me tell you some things about the Budget, because it is important to<br />
all of us, as it is important to where we are in our economic history, and the<br />
cycle, because Australia is really in a great position we are well-placed<br />
today. We're now an open, externally oriented competitive country. We<br />
are living near the fastest rowing markets in the world for the first time in<br />
our history I mean, the markets for us, traditionally, were in Europe and<br />
North America. They are now right on our doorstep here in Asia. We are<br />
so competitive today we are 40% more competitive than in 1983. And<br />
when you hear a number like that, you think " that's 4% or 14%" but it is<br />
That's 40% more competitive that's the exchange rate, wages and<br />
inflation. 40% more competitive since 1983, and that is what is driving the<br />
exports they have grown by 50% in the last 6 or 7 years and it's what is<br />
producing that competitiveness is producing the natural productivity<br />
coming out of the pores of the economy, because we now have a<br />
contestable market. In the days of high tariffs, when we had business<br />
which didn't need to operate competitively to make a quid, but rather just<br />
live behind the tariff wall as that went down, the natural productivity of a<br />
business of a management of a business the tone improved. And we<br />
have now got enterprise bargaining. And as a consequence, we are now<br />
getting productivity related wage bargains in 60-odd% of the Federal Award<br />
area. And so we have produced in Australia through import competition,<br />
and by competition among import competers and non-import competers<br />
we have now produced a contestable economy, or a contested economy.<br />
And that is what is now naturally producing the low inflation.<br />
In other words, if you get the structure right tariffs, competition policy<br />
which we are doing with Hilmer, a completely open financial market, a much<br />
more flexible labour market all of these things produce a natural<br />
contestability which gives you natural increments to productivity and low<br />
inflation. So that's the sort of economy we have got today. We could have<br />
only dreamt about that sort of economy 10 years ago. So, here we are we<br />
are in this great island continent, we are at the foot of the greatest markets<br />
in the world, and we are so competitive, you could almost sell anything from<br />
Australia these days. So, the aim was in this Budget to keep that going.<br />
To keep the growth going. Now, you know in this country it has been the<br />
Government's policy to run a pro-growth strategy. And you might say ' Well,<br />
all Governments run a pro-growth strategy, don't they?". But, the answer<br />
is, they don't. If you go through Western Europe, or most of North America,<br />
the growth number drops out of the system it's not an objective, it's a<br />
residual. In other words, all the bits and pieces go into the machine, and<br />
get thrown around, and maybe 2% GDP drops out the back, or 1 if we<br />
were living in Europe, it would be 1 if you were living in Japan, it would<br />
be but if you lived in Australia last year, it was And the year<br />
before that, and the year before that 4.25%. And the year to<br />
September, that growth became 6.5% but 6.5% was just a bit too strong </p>
<p>for us. So the Government moved interest rates up on 3 occasions late last<br />
year to try and shave it off and slow if back to a sustainable rate. And in<br />
the Budget forecast, we have got that sustainable rate of 3.75% for this<br />
year. So what we needed to do then, was to look at the medium-term,<br />
because we have now, basically, broken the back of inflation we have got<br />
high rates of growth, we have had phenomenal rates of employment<br />
growth, we have had 640,000 new jobs since the election. It's the fastest<br />
decline in unemployment since we have been keeping records about the<br />
labour market. So we have got employment we had 90,000 job growth for<br />
the month announced yesterday. Our problem remains the current<br />
account deficit. The one constraint on us really growing the place faster is<br />
the current account deficit, and our reliance on overseas savings and<br />
overseas debt.<br />
Let me say a few things about this, because this is what the Budget is<br />
principally aimed at it's not really aimed at slowing demands this year,<br />
because the interest rate adjustments of last year have effectively done<br />
that. So, the Budget is aimed at that medium-term, late 90s 2000 period<br />
of pulling the current account deficit back so we can go on with faster rates<br />
of growth, but the demand not spilling into imports. More of it being<br />
satisfied by a bigger investment program here.<br />
Now, let me just give you a little picture about the current account. In the<br />
1 960s and 1970s, we always ran a current account deficit of about 2.5% of<br />
GOP, so we had no debt. And the reason for that is we always had capital<br />
inflow, private financial investment from abroad, equal to about 2.5% of<br />
GOP per year. So, we are running a current account deficit of 2 and a half<br />
percent and we picked up 2.5% capital inflow, so we end up with no debt.<br />
What happened in the 1970' s and the 1980' s our savings went down quite<br />
sharply, that's household savings and they went down sharply because of<br />
over a decade of high inflation. See, once you put 10% inflation on the<br />
people for over a decade, you can't kid them that there's any value in<br />
sticking money away for savings because if there's 10% inflation and 4%<br />
real rate of interest they're picking up 14% there being taxed on the 14 so<br />
in reality they are being taxed on inflation and their real interest rate was<br />
completely gone. So, we inculcated in a whole generation of Australians:<br />
buy a flat, buy an apartment, buy a house, buy a beachhouse, buy anything<br />
but don't basically save and then of course we had access to debt, to<br />
housing very high level of home ownership, cars, software, whitegoods<br />
etc and as a consequence our household savings declined. It's a very hard<br />
thing to change the savings propensity that is the willingness or wish of a<br />
nation to save. You can change it but low inflation we have got now will<br />
change it, but how long we have had low inflation for three years, how<br />
many more years before people get the message that savings are basically<br />
worthwhile again and many years probably and the thing is we can't wait<br />
that long so one of the ways we get that adjustment is through the budget<br />
and the other ways government sought to get the adjustment is through<br />
superannuation, let me just explain what's happened with the current<br />
account. As I said to you in the 60' s and 70' s it ran at about 2% of GOP, it </p>
<p>now runs on average around 4 and a half percent of GOP so we have<br />
picked up 2 and a half percent of GDP on the current account that we<br />
basically can't afford and we have been doing that that's been adding to<br />
our national debt. We have got to then tailor it back to under three percent<br />
to allow us to be sustainable and consistently on a very long term and<br />
consistent basis.<br />
So, we have to find essentially our problems is 2 percentage points of<br />
GOP. Now this year GOP is about 500 billion, that's the total economy, five<br />
hundred billion gross domestic product. Two percent of it is about ten<br />
billion, ten thousand million, so our problem is ten thousand million paucity<br />
of savings. What we did in the budget was take the budget on Tuesday<br />
night to take last years deficit of 2.9 percent of GDP to a surplus of .7 so<br />
you can say we are three-point six, in round figures call it four percent we<br />
have made a four percentage point of GOP change to the budget balance.<br />
The other thing we did in the budget on Tuesday night is we extended the<br />
Government's award superannuation scheme from the six percentage<br />
points that it is now under the superannuation guarantee charge which will<br />
then rise to nine by the Year 2002 and what we have introduced on<br />
Tuesday night were two elements: we have asked employees to put away<br />
three percent of their wages and if they put three percent away we will<br />
match it with three percent from the One Nation tax cuts and tip them both<br />
into their personal superannuation account. On Tuesday night we added<br />
another six percentage points of wages and savings to the system so<br />
that's six on top of nine so as a consequence when the system gets to<br />
maturity which will be now 2002 which is not far away seven years away<br />
every Australian person will have superannuation contributions of<br />
which is enormous change, it is the largest most comprehensive private<br />
savings plan the country has every had. This is what it'll do to saving.<br />
At the moment we have got 186 billion in super funds, by the year 2020 we<br />
will have 2000 billion in super fund or two trillion. And you might have<br />
noticed on the front page of The Financial Review this week " A 2tr<br />
Bonanza" that's the first time I've seen this expression ' TR' enter the<br />
Australian lexicon. Two trillion, two thousand billion, and our national debt<br />
is one hundred and sixty billion at the moment so were we to get there we<br />
would have thirty times the size of our national debt sitting in<br />
superannuation funds assets. But let me put it in terms of GOP because<br />
that's how I put the rest in so we are comparing apples with apples the<br />
superannuation change is worth 4 percentage points of GOP, it will add<br />
four percentage points of GOP as a proportion of GDP. That's by 2020 but<br />
2020 if still twenty five years away, if we look at it by 2000, we're adding 2<br />
percent so on the budget we've done four and we have done two on super.<br />
So on Tuesday night we put in a six percentage point of GOP savings fix to<br />
meet a two percentage point problem on the current account. Now you say<br />
" that's going to do the trick isn't Well, it will but what we want is more<br />
investment so to keep that growth up and to keep the jobs up and to keep<br />
the strength up we need even more capital stock and more investment then<br />
we have now. So, that two percentage point will get added to maybe by </p>
<p>one, might even be one and a half, so we won't just have a two percentage<br />
point problem we will have a sort of three percentage point problem but we<br />
have still got a six percentage point fix, and even if our economists say oh<br />
well in the budget change some of its cyclical in better times the budget<br />
rolls back into surplus and bad times it drops out, all right, we will give them<br />
the benefit of the doubt, we'll knock two of the four out, and say two of it's<br />
long term and two of its cyclical so we have a solid two on the budget and a<br />
solid two on superannuation in other words we've got an undeniable four<br />
percentage points change on savings on Tuesday night to meet,<br />
essentially, a two to three percentage point problem. So that's how central<br />
and important last Tuesday night's budget was.<br />
And what it will do is give us growth through the balance of the 90' s with<br />
low inflation to get to the Government's target of five percent unemployment<br />
by the year 2000. Now normally we could'nt get to five percent because as<br />
much as we tried in the 80' s we couldn't get below six because we couldn't<br />
get the people trained the long term unemployed trained to get back into<br />
work so even if we had all the job growth in the world we couldn't get<br />
below six because we couldn't find the people to take the jobs. We put that<br />
fix in last year with Working Nation. With Working Nation, we're now casemanaging<br />
the long term unemployed and the happy news is that this year<br />
in the last twelve months 102 thousand of the long term unemployed went<br />
back into jobs, unemployed longer than twelve months or more, so as the<br />
economy grows and we take up all the school leavers, the natural entrants<br />
to the workforce, migrants and we get down to that core pool of long term<br />
unemployment where we have, even with our best endeavours, six to seven<br />
percent unemployment couldn't do any better, this time we are going to<br />
reach right into that number through Working Nation and we will a five<br />
percent unemployment target is well within our range, now in OECD terms<br />
there will be no country in the world get within cooee of us. Not within<br />
cooee of us.<br />
I was in Germany recently and I went to the Province of the state of Lower<br />
Saxony for the CeBIT Fair where we had the largest international<br />
electronics fair in the world and we were the guest country the partner<br />
country and we had two hundred Australian companies exhibiting there<br />
and one had to be very proud of seeing it there but I had the pleasure<br />
while I was there of meeting the Premier of Lower Saxony. Lower Saxony<br />
is the home of Volkswagen that's where the Wolfsburg is the capital of the<br />
Volkswagon empire, and the whole of the state of Lower Saxony runs<br />
around Volkswagons and the Premier said to me, " Mr Keating you know,<br />
there is a great community spirit here in Lower Saxony" and I said " well,<br />
that's wonderful to have that, you know, to get that sort of sense of<br />
commitment". He said " Yes we've all agreed, we're working a four day<br />
week. Very serious, they are working a four day week", he said " because<br />
we've got to put people off at Wolfsburg to get the productivity up to keep<br />
the cars competitive with the Japanese and everybody else". </p>
<p>Yet in this country, in the last year, we've had 4 per cent of employment<br />
growth. We basically got about one for one, for every 1 percentage point of<br />
GDP, we get about 1 percentage point of employment growth so if we are<br />
growing at about 4 per cent in GDP, we generally pick up about 4 per cent of<br />
employment growth. He said, look, if we were growing at 4 per cent here,<br />
we'd be lucky to pick up 1.5 per cent of employment growth. But if the labour<br />
market program is not there, the training isn't there, and they also carry<br />
enormous, enormous levies on employment which we don't have here. So,<br />
when you look at us compared to Germany, say, and look at our experience,<br />
we're growing around 4 per cent a year and we've got employment growth<br />
running between 3 and 4 per cent, and it means that this country can get<br />
within cooee of a target of 5 per cent unemployment. But the one<br />
constraining element is the current account deficit and our debt. And that's<br />
what the Government had to address the other night. Now, let me say apart<br />
from the quality of the savings change, just let me tell you how it's going to<br />
affect things beneficially. Last year, we had a bond selling program that's<br />
covering the Budget deficit and maturing debt that's old bonds being<br />
replaced and the Budget deficit being added on. Last year's bond selling<br />
program was $ 21 billion. This year's bond selling program is $ 6 billion. So,<br />
Tuesday night we took a $ 15 billion load off interest rates, and if there's going<br />
to be fewer bonds, what happens? The price of bonds goes up. And if the<br />
price goes up, the yield comes down. That's why the long term bond rate fell<br />
by 1 per cent over the last ten days because of that great change in the bond<br />
selling program. So, the Budget was a really important change that came<br />
right when the country needed it. But let me tell you a couple of other things<br />
about superannuation and we've done this through the Accord with the trade<br />
unions Bill Kelty and I started on this long road back in 1985-86 when we<br />
put the first 3 per cent scheme in. Then, the ACTU and the Government<br />
moved it up to 5 per cent in the latter part of 1980s. In 1991 we put in the<br />
Superannuation Guarantee Charge we put it up then to 9 per cent by the<br />
year 2002, employer contributions 9 per cent paid in lieu of cash. We're now<br />
at 6 per cent on 1 July, that's 7 per cent in two years' time, then 5, then 9 per<br />
cent. But 9 per cent was not a mature contribution, you couldn't really get the<br />
kind of living standard at the time that we really wanted people to have.<br />
Remembering that when my generation, the baby-boomers, are 65 there'll be<br />
half as many again retired aged people then as there are today and when our<br />
children retire, twice as many retired aged people as there are today, and it<br />
would put enormous pressure on the Budget and those that work. In other<br />
words, we'd be asking those in work to carry this massive population of<br />
people who have retired. So, we saw this coming ten years ago and started<br />
the plan for it. As a consequence, on Tuesday night, under the Accord, we've<br />
agreed that employees will put in 3 per cent and the Government will match it<br />
with the tax cuts, paid as superannuation to take it to 6 per cent, and then<br />
added on to the 9 per cent. It chops out at twice average weekly earnings, it<br />
chops out at about $ 60,000 odd and then falls away.<br />
But, anybody who is already making a 3 per cent contribution will get the<br />
three per cent tax cut whether they are above these figures or they are not.<br />
That is, between one and two times average weekly earnings anybody who is </p>
<p>now contributing will get the value of the tax cut. They won't get it over twice<br />
average weekly earnings.<br />
But, let me tell you now, I'll give you the punch line, what it all means. It<br />
means this, that a person on average weekly earnings that is $ 33,000 will<br />
end up at the end of their working lives with a lump sum of $ 470,000 in<br />
today's dollars. And they will have an annual annuity of $ 30,000. If we take<br />
somebody on twice average weekly earnings, they will end up with a lump<br />
sum of $ 670,000 and they will have a pension of $ 42,000. In other words, if<br />
you take the person on average weekly earnings, they will have a pension, an<br />
annuity of twice the value of the current pension. You might say well, look,<br />
that is good, that is at the end of their working life and that is 30 years from<br />
now, but let's take perhaps an even more relevant example, someone who is<br />
in their 30s now, a couple in their 30s. By the time they retire, they will be<br />
getting three quarters more than they were getting under the pension and<br />
when their children retire they will be getting 100 per cent than under the<br />
pension. So, this is a great change and as I said it puts away by 2020 $ 2000 billion in<br />
national savings. Now, you see, you can understand why I get black about<br />
John Howard. I mean, as if that team would have the imagination or the wit or<br />
the common sense or the foresight or the courage to do anything like this.<br />
They won't even talk to unions much less get you can imagine them<br />
wandering up to the union movement saying we want you to put 15 per cent<br />
of your income away as savings. They say ' oh yeah, sure, sure. Don't take it<br />
as cash, take it as savings, oh sure'. Because you don't get respect and<br />
regard and you can't build a relationship from people that you don't want to<br />
speak to. They don't want to speak to the work force. It is a slight defect in<br />
their economic policy they don't want to talk to the workforce and they said<br />
' oh yes, you got inflation down to 2 per cent because you had a recession'.<br />
John Howard had a deeper recession, do you know what inflation was the<br />
year after the recession? 10.5 per cent. We had a recession and we came<br />
out of it with inflation actually at 1 per cent, on average over the last three<br />
years it has been 2 per cent and that was because of the tax cuts of the<br />
1980s. As people went through that wage restraint in the boom of the late<br />
1980s we said take 6.5 per cent for wages and not 15 or 16 per cent, like you<br />
did when Howard was around, and we will give you tax cuts. And, those tax<br />
cuts of 1988/ 89 saved Australia's inflation rate and we were able to go into<br />
the recession at about 4 per cent inflation and come out at 2 per cent.<br />
In other words that wage trade off, bringing down fiscal policy in the I1980s<br />
has made all that possible. Now, John Howard let the cat out of the bag last<br />
night in a speech which was free of policy. He had a great opportunity to say<br />
within a year of an election and a Budget reply where he stood, and what he<br />
was about, but John is going to run on Liberal party advertising gumph on<br />
basically poll driven stuff and he thinks that the rest of you are silly enough to<br />
take that gullible rubbish until polling day and see him take the job he thinks<br />
was also due to him. But, what he did say was this, he said ' a Coalition<br />
government would put a lid on the increases on superannuation contributions </p>
<p>and rely on tax incentives for savings'. Well, we had him rely on tax<br />
incentives for superannuation all the way through the 1 960s and 1 970s and<br />
by 1983 only 40 per cent of people had superannuation and today it is 90 per<br />
cent. So, here we are, here is the Labor party setting up the scheme these<br />
characters couldn't even dream about, much less establish and he said ' no,<br />
no, I know you are going to put away $ 2000 billion, I know people are going<br />
to retire on $ 30,000 a year or $ 45,000 a year, I know the average person is<br />
going to pick up a lump sum of half a million, but we are not having it. Not<br />
having it'. Not having it because it is not ideologically right. If it is not done<br />
by tax incentives, in other words if it is not done to the top end, you see John<br />
wanted a scheme where in the last three years, the executives, remember the<br />
thing called superannuation before we put on the reasonable benefits limits<br />
were paid as a multiple of your final average salary over three years. So, the<br />
executives would end up with $ 3 million, $ 3 million, $ 3 million and so you<br />
would get seven times three and by the time you got your tax, you walked out<br />
with your $ 15 million.<br />
That is what they thought the superannuation scheme was about and that is<br />
how it worked, it basically worked for people in the top end of business and in<br />
some parts of the public sector. But, the great bulk of the Australian people<br />
were not in it. Now, everybody will be in it and this is most particularly<br />
skewed to the low paid and particularly to women in part time work. Because<br />
part time people get a great benefit here. We pay them the $ 1000 tax cut<br />
even if, let's take someone on $ 10,000 a year working part time. A woman<br />
working in retail or clothing part time or something like that. Three per cent of<br />
$ 10,000 is $ 300. They put away $ 300 and we put away $ 300. But we will<br />
actually give them $ 1000, so if they want to save another $ 700 we will<br />
actually give them $ 1000. So, that person could put not just their 3 per cent<br />
away, but put another $ 700 away a year and make it a $ 1000, we will make it<br />
$ 2000 $ 2000 a year over 30 years, $ 60,000, compounding let's say<br />
$ 150,000 so, that person on $ 10,000 just as a result of Tuesday night's<br />
policies could put a nest egg of $ 150,000 together. And they would have no<br />
chance. These are people at the bottom end of the wage market.<br />
So, these are the sort of policies that you get from a sensible, real<br />
government. A government that actually has a touch with the community and<br />
does the things that need to be done. Now, as a consequence of all of this I<br />
think, I can say to you confidently that we are going to see growth continue<br />
over the next three years, we have taken enormous pressure off interest<br />
rates, we have successfully slowed the economy and we now want to see it<br />
just come back to a nice sustainable level. But, importantly, we have got that<br />
medium term current account fix in there by the budget deficit swinging back<br />
into surplus on the one hand and superannuation on the other. And, that is<br />
why our friends in the Liberal party were flat footed on Tuesday night. That is<br />
why John Howard had a silly giggle at the table and that smile glued on. That<br />
is why last night they were sitting up there trying to urge him on despite the<br />
fact he had no framework to address the government's policies and it is why<br />
the government won the 1993 election and why we will win the next one. </p>
<p>So, I am glad you came today so I could tell you these things, so you could<br />
get on us early. We were long odds, but we are shortening, a bit like<br />
Collingwood long odds, but shortening get on to us now and get a tip right<br />
from the horse's mouth. But, more particularly, I am pleased you have come<br />
along to understand what, in fact, we are doing. It is not just a jumble of<br />
numbers or an exercise in numerology or accounting, but there is a strategy<br />
lying behind it because if we can lift our savings, we can lift our investment. If<br />
we lift our investment, we lift our employment and if we end up with 5 per cent<br />
unemployment or less, this will be one of the most united, cohesive and much<br />
happier societies than most around the world and that is the Australia we all<br />
know. The egalitarian Australia where the right to a fair go and a fair go<br />
starts with a job and being in the society and not in an underclass. That is<br />
what is going to keep Australia together. That's what is going to mean that<br />
we are not going to have great extremes between the rich and the poor and it<br />
will mean that you can live in this country without a barbed wire fence around<br />
your house or a set of alarms or all the other things that people have got to<br />
do in most other countries. And why this will remain a nicer country than, I<br />
think, a lot of similar countries because government policy for over decade<br />
has been about inclusion. Putting everybody in and looking after it from the<br />
longest term unemployed to the people running the great public companies,<br />
we in a sense, have tried to govern for all in a progrowth economy with low<br />
inflation and now with higher savings.<br />
Thank you.<br />
