    <content><![CDATA[<p>The world mourns the passing of Nelson Mandela.</p>
<p>Nelson Mandela will forever be remembered as more than a political leader, he was a moral leader.</p>
<p>He spent much of his life standing against the injustice of apartheid.</p>
<p>When that fight was won, he inspired us again by his capacity to forgive and reconcile his country.</p>
<p>While the world may never see another Nelson Mandela, he has inspired countless men and women throughout the world to live more courageous and honest lives.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Australian Government and the Australian community, I extend my condolences to Mr Mandelaâ€™s family and to the people of South Africa.</p>
<p>6 December 2013</p>
