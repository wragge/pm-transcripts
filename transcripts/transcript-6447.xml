PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL 10.30 A. M. CHE: CK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINJtSTER<br />
ALP VICTORIAN COUNTRY CONFERENCE<br />
WARRAGUL, VICTORIA -25 AUGUST 1984<br />
I want to make three preliminary points.<br />
First, I am very pleased to be here even if I am 12 months<br />
late. I regret that last year Budget deliberations<br />
prevented me from coming at the last moment. I hope that<br />
when I've finished speaking not too many of you will wish<br />
the same thing had happened this year.<br />
Second,* I am very pleased to be in Barry Cunningham's<br />
territory. Barry is a very good friend and, more<br />
importantly, an outstanding Federal Labor member.<br />
Third, I want to pay tribute to Fred van Buren. This is the<br />
ninth Victorian Country Conference that Fred has organised.<br />
It is also his last. Fred will shortly be taking a seat in<br />
the Legislative Council. On your behalf I want to thank<br />
Fred for his work over these years as Secretary of t he Rural<br />
Policy Committee and, in particular, in organising th6se<br />
Conferences. Today I want to re-affirm in the clearest terms the<br />
commitment of this Federal Labor Government to country<br />
people a commitment I submit which should be by now beyond<br />
doubt. But I want to speak first about economic policy and, in<br />
particular, the Budget we brought down on Tuesday.<br />
I remind you briefly of the economic crisis we inherited a<br />
mere 18 months ago:<br />
double digit inflation at levels more than twice<br />
our trading partners;<br />
record interest rates; </p>
<p>a disastrous wages explosion in 1981 and 1982;<br />
a cessation of economic growth altogether;<br />
a prospective Budget deficit of $ 9.6 billion; and<br />
an explosion of unemployment in the last year of<br />
the previous Government of a quarter of a million<br />
people.<br />
That was the economic crisis we inherited. Now compare that<br />
with the situation today and the economic outlook set out in<br />
last Tuesday's Budget papers.<br />
First, inflation. In the Budget papers consumer prices are<br />
forecast to rise by a little over 5 per cent this financial<br />
year. That is half the inflation rate we inherited.<br />
Interest rates have fallen significantly during our period<br />
in government. The restraint we have exercised in this<br />
year's Budget should make possible further reductions.<br />
The momentum of economic growth is now very healthy<br />
according to the Budget forecasts, about 4 per cent this<br />
financial year for the economy as a whole.<br />
Wage moderation is now the order of the day. The Prices and<br />
Incomes Accord is ensuring that.<br />
Finally, jobs are growing and unemployment is coming down.<br />
Indeed, the Budget forecasts suggest that by June next year<br />
we will have created over 400,000 new jobs since the<br />
Economic Summit in April last year.<br />
The economic policies of the Federal Labor Government have<br />
been an outstanding success. All Australians, whether<br />
living in the city or in the country, will benefit.<br />
Last Tuesday's Budget will build on the excellent progress<br />
we have already made. The strategy of the Budget will<br />
ensure that economic recovery continues, inflation is<br />
further reduced and job prospects are further improved.<br />
The cuts in personal income tax that we announced are a<br />
crucial part of the Budget strategy. The tax cuts will play<br />
a very important role in stimulating consumer demand over<br />
the next 12 months. Retail sales have been one of the few<br />
weak spots in the economy and the tax cuts will stimulate<br />
this area of activity.<br />
In addition the tax cuts will make even more certain<br />
continued income restraint and to that extent underpin the<br />
Prices and Incomes Accord. For the majority of workers, the<br />
tax cut will increase take home pay by roughly the same<br />
amount as an $ 11 per week pay increase. C </p>
<p>Our tax cuts are good for the economy and we make no<br />
apology for them.<br />
The Federal Opposition's position on tax cuts is crystal<br />
clear. If the Opposition had remained in power there would<br />
have been no tax cuts at all this year.<br />
Mr Howard has made that abundantly clear on several<br />
occasions. On 19 March this year he put it this way:<br />
" I think if the Government is faced with a choice<br />
between giving a tax cut of say $ 1 billion and having a<br />
deficit that is a billion lower than it might otherwise<br />
be, I think it ought to choose the latter."<br />
Mr Howard has repeated those sentiments several times,<br />
including at the launching of the Coalition's economic<br />
policy on 12 April.<br />
Mr Peacock has made great play of the fact that the tax<br />
scales have not been indexed.<br />
The Opposition, of course, themselves abandoned tax<br />
indexation when in government. ( As well, their notorious tax<br />
cuts of 1977 lasted a mere 5 months.)<br />
In fact the tax cuts in the Budget are very much more<br />
generous than would have occurred through tax indexation.<br />
The full year cost of the tax cuts is $ 2.1 billion, compared<br />
with $ 1.2 billion as the full year cost of tax indexation.<br />
The Budget has not only set the scene for continued strong<br />
economic recovery. It has also done a great deal directly<br />
to improve the position of the unemployed and other<br />
disadvantaged groups.<br />
The package of social security increases contained in the<br />
Budget will cost $ 430 million this year and $ 683 million in<br />
a full year. It will make a significant contribution to<br />
easing the plight of those in need.<br />
The standard rate of pensions and benefits, for example,<br />
will be increased by $ 2.50 a week above indexation and the<br />
married rate by $ 2.10 for each partner. In contrast there<br />
were no general increases in pensions along these lines in<br />
the seven long years of our predecessors' rule.<br />
During those seven years the single unemployment benefit<br />
fell by 19 per cent in real terms. With the measures<br />
announced in the Budget it will have increased by 13 per<br />
cent between March 1983 and 3une 1985.<br />

<p>The Budget also contains increased payments for child<br />
support and education allowances available to low income<br />
families and additional rent assistance for needy<br />
pensioners. In the past two years we have substantially<br />
increased our support for public housing.<br />
With this Budget we have made a substantial further step<br />
towards providing adequately for Australians in need.<br />
With this Budget we have also laid the basis for further<br />
progress in creating new jobs and in reducing unemploymentwhich<br />
is the greatest single cause of poverty in this<br />
country. It is a Budget for growth, for recovery and for a better<br />
future for all Australians.<br />
Against that background I turn now to the situation of<br />
country people. When we speak of country people we are<br />
talking, of course, not only of farmers and others directly<br />
engaged in our rural industries. We are talking of all the<br />
people who live in country Australia.<br />
I mention now just a few of the measures taken by this<br />
Government to assist country people.<br />
Spending on road programs of particular importance to<br />
country people will be a total of $ 1,245 million this<br />
financial year. This takes the increase in road funding to<br />
46 per cent over the past two years.<br />
Since coming to office the Government has allocated a total<br />
of $ 20 million to the Country Town Water Supply component of<br />
the Community Employment Program. The Community Employment<br />
Program as a whole is also benefitting country people. For<br />
example, the country regions of Victoria have already<br />
attracted $ 29 million in CEP funding, involving over 2,000<br />
new jobs.<br />
The Government has committed a total of $ 218 million to<br />
Commonwealth office construction of which $ 155 million is<br />
committed specifically for regional areas.<br />
The Government has removed the annual borrowing limits on<br />
smaller local government authorities.<br />
The introduction of the domestic satellite for Australia<br />
will mean improved communications for many people in the<br />
remote areas of the country.<br />
Appreciating the need to keep transport costs down in<br />
country areas, we are maintaining the fuel subsidy on<br />
freight at 1.2 c/ litre. </p>
<p>In the Budget we increased by 25 per cent the basic zone<br />
rebates for taxpayers in remote areas of Australia.<br />
And I could go on. This Government's commitment to country<br />
people has been demonstrated in the clearest terms.<br />
Many country people, of course, have a vital stake in our<br />
rural industries. Last Tuesday's Budget again demonstrated<br />
the Federal Labor Government's support for these<br />
industries. For example:<br />
$ 26 million for wool promotion this financial year;<br />
an increase in the allocation to the National Soil<br />
Conservation Program from $ 1 mil~ lion to $ 4 million;<br />
$ 27 million to fund rural research, an increase of<br />
million; and<br />
the decision to index the rebate on diesel fuel<br />
A used off road.<br />
This Government regards the money we are putting into our<br />
rural industries as an investment in their future and the<br />
future of all Australians. A strong and vigorous rural<br />
sector means more growth, more exports and more jobs for all<br />
Australians.<br />
Rural industries are Australia's largest single export<br />
earner 47 per cent of total exports last financial year.<br />
So the strength of the rural sector affects the living<br />
standards of all Australians.<br />
We all have a vested interest in the prosperity of our rural<br />
industries. Government backing for those industries makes<br />
good economic sense.<br />
I believe both the rural community and the Government are<br />
very fortunate in having John Kerin as Minister for Primary<br />
Industry. Mr Kerin is a respected member of the Cabinet, a<br />
tireless Minister and an outstandinig advocate for the rural<br />
community. There is one thing that is more important than anything else<br />
to our primary producers sound, effective, competent<br />
economic management. Without that, all the specific<br />
assistance measures to rural industry will come to nought.<br />
They won't work.<br />
As I have shown, on this score effective economic<br />
management the Federal Labor Government has an outstanding<br />
record. Country people, of course, will continue -to benefit just as<br />
much as city people. </p>
<p>The Labor Party's credentials as far as country people a're<br />
concerned are excellent. All of you delegates here know<br />
this to be the case. I ask only that You spread the message<br />
far and wide.<br />
We can go into the next Federal election and the next<br />
Victorian election confidently putting our case to country<br />
people. We have the policies and the programs to meet their needs.<br />
Our record is an outstanding one.<br />
I believe that whenever those two elections are held, Labor<br />
will receive the strong support of country people throughout<br />
Victoria and throughout Australia. </p>
