STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEA'IINGj MP<br />
RECOGNITION OF FORMER CZECHOSLOVAKIAN REPUBLICS<br />
Australia has decided to rccognise as independent states the two former Czechoslovakian<br />
republics, the Czech Republic and thc Slovak Repujjc.~<br />
This follows today's dissolution of the Czechoslovakian federation, which was authorised<br />
by a vote of Czechoslovakia's federal parliament on 25 November last year.<br />
I conmmend the leaders and people of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic for the<br />
amicable way in which they have resolved their differences and congratulate them on thc<br />
peaceful transition from federation to independent republics.. They have shown what can<br />
be achieved by parties tackling change in a spirit of civilised discourse.<br />
I wish the leaders and people of both nations well.<br />
The Australian Government is pleased to enter into diplomatic relations and welcomes the<br />
advice that both republics will be represented at embassy level in Canberra.<br />
Thc Australian ambassador in Warsaw will be accredited to both republics.<br />
