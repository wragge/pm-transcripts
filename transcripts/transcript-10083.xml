27 August, 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD, MP<br />
DOORSTOP INTERVIEW, BOWRAL<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
JOURNALIST: Indust" groups say that the Government can't guarantee that elderly people won't have to sell<br />
their homes to get admittance to a nursing home, how do you respond to that?<br />
PRIMYE MINIISTER:<br />
Well I'll tell you what ITl guarantee and that is that this proposal will be just as fair and as<br />
reasonably implemented as the proposal for hostels which it copied.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Are you wiling to make any compromise at all Mr Howard?<br />
PRIME MINISTER;<br />
Oh no, no. There's no need to make any basic changes to what's being proposed, none at all and<br />
any suggestion that there's going to be any change as I saw in one of the papers this morning is<br />
just not right. Look, this is a very fair proposal and can I say again it is exactly the same proposal<br />
that the Labor Party implemented almost ten years ago with our support. The difference is that<br />
we didn't nit-pick and try and politically point score and try and scare elderly people which is<br />
what the Labor Party is doing in relation to our proposal. If they were honest, if they weren't<br />
hypocritical they'd put their hand up and say ' Costello is doing what Keating did nine years ago.<br />
We supported what Keating did nine year-s ago, we ought to support what he's doing now'.<br />

JOU. RNALIST:<br />
But Prime Minister, since the system was introduced there's been elderly people who have<br />
been forced to sell their homes to get into hostels.<br />
PREME MINISTER:<br />
Well I can only repeat what I said earlier. Okay.<br />
JOURNALIST: the opinion polls seem to indicate that although people think the Budget was tough and may<br />
not necessarily help them they do believe it was good for the country..<br />
PRIME MIMSTER:<br />
Well I don't normally get euphoric about any opinion polls but I am sure that most Australians see<br />
it as a fair but strong Budget and that is what they really wanted. Australians understand an<br />
argument when it is put to them fairly and reasonably, They knew we had to take some difficult<br />
decisions, but they see the decisions as having been fairly spread across all sections of the<br />
Australian community. I'm very proud of the egalitarian character of the first Coalition Budget.<br />
It's a Budget for middle Australia, it's a Budget that spreads the pain around. It's a Budget that<br />
has protected the really vulnerable. But most importantly, it's a Budget for fuiture generations<br />
and that's what we ought to be about.<br />
JOURNALIST: What message does it deliver to the Senate Parties?<br />
PREME MINISTER:<br />
Well that's something that I don't want to get into windy rhetoric about. What I'm going to do<br />
with the Senate is to talk and encourage my Ministerial colleagues to talk in a sensible, calm way<br />
with the Democrats and with the Independents and wvith the Greens. We need two more votes in<br />
order to get certain measures through, I understand that. You can have a majority of 42 in the<br />
House of Representatives but you need two more to get things through in the Senate. I want to<br />
talk and explain this to the minor parties in the Senate and I hope at the end of the day they will<br />
pass it because it is a fair Budget and we were elected with a big majority in the lower House and<br />
I would hope at the end of the day whatever reservations they may have about some of the<br />
particular measures that they will say, well they have a big majority, the Budget seems to have<br />
been well received. In those circumstances the good thing, the smart thing, is to let it go through<br />
and get stuck into them on something else.<br />
Thank you. </p>
