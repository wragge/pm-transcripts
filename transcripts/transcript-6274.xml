PRIME MINISTER<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH NOTES INTERNATIONAL SECURITY<br />
AND DISARMAMENT<br />
CHOGM, NEW DELHI, 23 NOVEMBER 1983<br />
THE ARMS RACE HAS REACHED ALARMING PROPORTIONS<br />
$ 700 BILLION PER YEAR,<br />
IT IS GRAVELY THREATENING EVERYBODY ' S SECURITY,<br />
ARMED CONFLICT CONTINUES IN MANY PARTS OF THE<br />
WORLD, THERE ARE 10 MILLION REFUGEES AS A RESULT<br />
OF SUCH CONFLICT.<br />
IT IS A SCANDALOUS WASTE OF HUMAN RESOURCES AND<br />
INGENUITY. ECONOMIC GROWTH, JOBS, AND ECONOMIC<br />
DEVELOPMENT ARE BEING MATERIALLY SET BACK BY<br />
EXPENDITURE ON ARMS.<br />
THE SECRETARY-GENERAL HAS SPOKEN OF THE $ 1 MILLION<br />
SPENT EACH MINUTE ON ARMS. MY CALCULATION IS THAT<br />
THE EXPENDITURE IS NEARER TO $ 1.3M, BUT NONE OF US<br />
NEED TO BE TOLD HOW MUCH $ 1 MILLION PER MINUTE COULD<br />
PRODUCE IN TERMS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF, FOR EXAMPLE, THE<br />
LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES,<br />
EAST/ WEST TENSION IS ALARMINGLY HIGH.<br />
ARMS CONTROL NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE SUPER POWERS<br />
ARE IN DIFFICULTY,<br />
THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS PERMEATED WITH SUSPICION,<br />
THE RHETORIC IS VERY DANGEROUS.<br />
BUT WE SHOULD NOT BE OVERWHELMED BY A SENSE OF<br />
GLOBAL PESSIMISM OR OF IMMINENT DISASTER, </p>
<p>IT WOULD BE STERILE TO SEEK TO APPORTION BLAME, BUT<br />
AUSTRALIA DOES NOT SUBSCRIBE TO THE VIEW THAT THE<br />
UNITED STATES BEARS THE GREATEST RESPONSIBILITY<br />
FOR THE PRESENT DIFFICULTIES BETWEEN THE SUPER POWERS.<br />
WESTERN SOCIETIES ARE OPEN. DEBATE TAKES PLACE<br />
AND THIS EXPOSES THEIR CONCERNS FAR MORE THAN IS<br />
THE CASE IN THE SOVIET UNION.<br />
IT MUST ALSO BE RECOGNISED THAT THE SOVIET UNION<br />
IS PURSUING AN ARMAMENTS PROGRAM OF UNPRECEDENTED<br />
PROPORTIONS. MY OWN CONTACTS AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE UNITED<br />
STATES ADMINISTRATION HAVE LEFT ME IN NO DOUBT THAT THAT<br />
ADMINISTRATION IS UTTERLY SINCERE IN WANTING TO STOP<br />
THE ARMS RACE.<br />
AUSTRALIA DOES NOT ACCEPT THAT THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS STATES<br />
ALONE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO DETERMINE THESE ISSUES.<br />
THEIR CALCULATIONS THEIR MISCALCULATIONS COULD<br />
AFFECT US ALL OR ELIMINATE US ALL.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT CONSIDER THAT<br />
UNILATERAL DISARMAMENT WOULD BE AN EFFECTIVE WAY IN<br />
BRINGING ABOUT AN END TO THE ARMS RACE.<br />
WHAT IS REQUIRED ARE REALISTIC, CONCRETE AND BALANCED<br />
PROPOSALS WHICH HAVE AT THEIR HEART A RECOGNITION OF<br />
THE NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS INVOLVED, </p>
<p>AUSTRALIA'S SECURITY INTERESTS REQUIRE COLLECTIVE<br />
ARRANGEMENTS FOR OUR DEFENCE.<br />
WE HAVE SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT IN THE ANZUS ALLIANCE,<br />
COLLECTIVE SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS ARE SANCTIONED<br />
BY THE CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS.<br />
MY GOVERNMENT HAS CLARIFIED THE NATURE OF THE ANZUS<br />
ALLIANCE AND THIS HAS BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE THREE TREATY<br />
PARTNERS. A CONSEQUENCE OF OUR SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS UNDER ANZUS<br />
IS THE PRESENCE ON AUSTRALIAN SOIL OF JOINT FACILITIES.<br />
THESE PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE IN MAINTAINING WESTERN<br />
SECURITY. THEY ARE ALSO ABLE TO VERIFY ARMS CONTROL AND<br />
DISARMAMENT AGREEMENTS.<br />
WE ALREADY HAVE AND ARE DEVELOPING FURTHER A SEISMIC<br />
MONITORING CAPACITY WITH REGARD TO NUCLEAR TESTING.<br />
WE HAVE GREATLY ELEVATED ARMS CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT<br />
GOALS WITHIN OUR FOREIGN POLICY<br />
WE ARE A MEMBER OF EVERY MULTILATERAL DISARMAMENT<br />
NEGOTIATING BODY.<br />
IN THOSE BODIES WE ARE PROMOTING THE NEGOTIATION OF<br />
TREATIES TO END NUCLEAR TESTING, TO BAN CHEMICAL<br />
WEAPONS, AND TO PREVENT AN ARMS RACE IN OUTER SPACE, </p>
<p>IN THE WIDER POLITICAL ARENA WE ARE URGING BOTH SUPER<br />
POWERS TO MODERATE THEIR ANTAGONISM, TO IMPROVE<br />
UNDERSTANDING AND TO SEEK AN END TO AND A REDUCTION OF<br />
THEIR NUCLEAR ARMS RACE.<br />
AUSTRALIA'S DISARMAMENT OBJECTIVES ARE GUIDED BY THE<br />
FOLLOWING GENERAL PRINCIPLES<br />
SECURITY FOR ALL STATES AT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE<br />
LEVEL OF ARMAMENT<br />
STABILITY IN THE NUCLEAR BALANCE<br />
ADEQUATE VERIFICATION OF DISARMAMENT AGREEMENTS.<br />
IN LINE WITH THESE OBJECTIVES WE ARE ATTACHING A PARTICULAR<br />
PRIORITY TO EFFORTS AIMED AT SECURING NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT<br />
THROUGH REDUCTIONS IN THE NUCLEAR ARSENALS ( AS FOR EXAMPLE<br />
THROUGH THE START AND INF NEGOTIATIONS), UPHOLDING OF THE<br />
INTERNATIONAL NON-PROLIFERATION REGIME, AND CONCLUSION OF<br />
COMPLETE BAN ON NUCLEAR TESTING.<br />
IN ADDITION AUSTRALIA HAS PROPOSED TO ITS SOUTH PACIFIC<br />
PARTNERS THE POSSIBILITY OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A<br />
NUCLEAR FREE ZONE IN THE SOUTH WEST PACIFIC<br />
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN ONLY BE DEVELOPED ON THE<br />
BASIS OF AGREEMENT AMONGST THOSE PARTNERS<br />
WE HOPE IT WOULD PROVIDE FOR THE BANNING OF ALL<br />
NUCLEAR TESTING AND DUMPING OF RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS<br />
IN THE REGION, AND INVOLVE A REGION-WIDE COMMITMENT<br />
TO THE NON-PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. </p>
<p>THE STARTING POINT IS TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF BOTH NUCLEAR<br />
AND CONVENTIONAL ARSENALS AND BRINGING THEM UNDER THE<br />
CONTROL OF VERIFIABLE AND EFFECTIVE AGREEMENTS.<br />
ADEQUATE AND EFFECTIVE PROVISION FOR VERIFICATION IS<br />
THE CRUCIAL PRECONDITION OF PROGRESS IN THIS AREA<br />
IF ANY AGREEMENT IS TO COMMAND CONFIDENCE, GROUNDS<br />
OF SUSPICION OF NON-COMPLIANCE MUST BE ELIMINATED.<br />
AUSTRALIA WOULD WISH TO ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT ACTION<br />
IN THIS FIELD<br />
FOR EXAMPLE, IN CONSIDERING AUSTRALIA'S OWN CAPABILITIES<br />
WE ARE ACTIVELY EXAMINING THE POSSIBILITY OF IMPROVING<br />
AUSTRALIA'S CAPACITY TO MONITOR NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS BY<br />
FURTHER, DEVELOPING OUR SEISMIC MONITORING CAPABILITY.<br />
THE PROBLEM OF PROLIFERATION IS MORE DIFFICULT,<br />
THERE IS NO FOOL-PROOF MEANS OF PREVENTING THE<br />
PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR EXPLOSIVES BUT AUSTRALIA IS AMONG<br />
THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT THE PROCESS CAN AND SHOULD BE SLOWED<br />
AND THE COSTS TO THE PROLIFERATOR INCREASED.<br />
IT IS PERHAPS ENCOURAGING THAT IN MOST NON-NUCLEAR<br />
WEAPONS STATES, PARTICULARLY DEVELOPED ONES, THE PERCEIVED<br />
MILITARY, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC UTILITY OF NUCLEAR<br />
EXPLOSIVES HAS BEEN IN DECLINE SINCE THE 1960s,<br />
AS AGAINST THIS, CIVIL NUCLEAR PROGRAMS ARE<br />
INCREASINGLY INVOLVED WITH TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE<br />
IMPORTANT FOR THE PRODUCTION OF NUCLEAR EXPLOSIVES. </p>
<p>IN THE CONTEXT OF THE NON-PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR<br />
WEAPONS AN ISSUE OF PARTICULAR CONCERN TO AUSTRALIA IS THE<br />
POSITION OF SOUTH AFRICA.<br />
THE APARTHEID SYSTEM IS TOTALLY UNJUST<br />
IT WOULD BE UTTERLY UNACCEPTABLE IF APARTHEID WERE<br />
TO BECOME NUCLEAR ARMED<br />
WE MUST ALL ENSURE THAT THIS DOES NOT OCCUR.<br />
THE NPT MUST REMAIN A CORNER-STONE OF INTERNATIONAL<br />
EFFORT TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS<br />
AUSTRALIA IS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THIS VITAL TREATY<br />
AND ITS ASSOCIATED SYSTEMS OF VERIFICATION,<br />
BUT AUSTRALIA GOES FURTHER.<br />
WE RECOGNISE OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER NPT ARTICLE IV AS<br />
A PRODUCER AND EXPORTER OF URANIUM TO FACILITATE AND<br />
PARTICIPATE IN THE EXCHANGE OF EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS<br />
AND INFORMATION FOR THE PEACEFUL. USES OF ATOMIC ENERGY,<br />
WITH DUE CONSIDERATION FOR THE NEEDS OF THE DEVELOPING<br />
AREAS OF THE WORLD.<br />
AUSTRALIA ALSO, AND AS PART OF THIS RECOGNITION, ACCEPTS<br />
THAT IT HAS A PARTICULAR RESPONSIBILITY TO SECURE IMPROVED<br />
INTERNATIONAL SAFEGUARDS AGAINST DIVERSION OF NUCLEAR<br />
MATERIAL FROM PEACEFUL USES. </p>
<p>AUSTRALIA NEVERTHELESS DOES NOT CONSIDER IT ENOUGH TO<br />
PUT IN PLACE A MORE STRINGENT SAFEGUARDS SYSTEM,<br />
WE SHOULD ALSO LIKE TO BRING ABOUT AN END TO ALL FORMS<br />
OF NUCLEAR TESTING THROUGH A COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY,<br />
THIS IS ALSO AN NPT OBLIGATION ( ARTICLE VI),<br />
CONTINUED NUCLEAR WEAPONS TESTING IS A SYMBOL OF<br />
AN INCENTIVE TO THE ARMS RACE<br />
THE GREAT MAJORITY OF NUCLEAR TESTS ARE CONDUCTED<br />
BY THE SOVIET UNION AND THE UNITED STATES, BUT FRANCE<br />
ALSO CONDUCTS TESTS EACH YEAR IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC<br />
REGION,<br />
BRITAIN AND CHINA CONTINUE TO CONDUCT OCCASIONAL<br />
TESTS, CHINA MOST REGRETTABLY IN THE ATMOSPHERE<br />
WE ARE ONE OF THE MAIN PROMOTERS IN THE UNITED NATIONS<br />
OFTHE NEGOTIATION OF A TREATY TO BAN NUCLEAR TESTING<br />
BY ALL STATES IN ALL ENVIRONMENTS FOR ALL TIME,<br />
THIS IS A POINT ON WHICH COLLECTIVE. INTERNATIONAL ACTION<br />
IS OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE,<br />
CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS ARE SECOND ONLY TO<br />
NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THEIR CAPACITY TO INFLICT DEATH AND<br />
HUMAN SUFFERING ON A LARGE SCALE, </p>
<p>AUSTRALIA BELIEVES THAT IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT<br />
THAT THE RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS BE<br />
STRENGTHENED AND WOULD DRAW ATTENTION TO THE<br />
DISAPPOINTING FACT THAT ONLY 2/ 3 OF THE COMMONWEALTH<br />
MEMBERS ARE PARTIES TO THE 1925 PROTOCOL, AND LESS THAN<br />
2/ 3 HAVE AGREED TO THE 1972 BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION.<br />
WE ALSO STRONGLY SUPPORT EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT THE ARMS<br />
RACE DOES NOT EXTEND OFF THIS PLANET AND INTO OUTER SPACE<br />
THE PROSPECT OF EXTENSION OF THE NUCLEAR ARMS RACE<br />
INTO THAT ARENA IS FRIGHTENING IN ITS POSSIBILITIES<br />
IT SHOULD BE HEADED OFF BEFORE THE INEXORABLE LOGIC<br />
OF A NEW ROUND OF COMPETITIVE BIDDING IMPOSES ITSELF<br />
AND PROVIDES US WITH YET A FURTHER DANGEROUS ARENA<br />
OF INTRACTABLE DIFFICULTY.<br />
HE COMMONWEALTH. CAN-PLAY A CONSTCIVROEN<br />
DISARMAMENT AND IN REDUCING TENSIONS<br />
THESE ISSUES ARE CHARACTERISED BY DISPUTE BETWEEN<br />
THE EASTERN AND WESTERN BLOCS<br />
THE-' COMMONWEALTH DOES NOT REPRESENT BLOCSj IT IS A<br />
HETEROGENEOUS ORGANISATION<br />
ITS VOICE CAN COMMAND THE ATTENTION OF THE SUPER POWERS.<br />
IT CLEARLY IS AN ILLUSION TO BELIEVE THAT SECURITY CAN<br />
BY OBTAINED ON THE BASIS OF AN ARMS RACE OF THE PROPORTIONS<br />
WE FACE TODAY. </p>
<p>9,<br />
NO-ONE SHOULD DOUBT THAT THE RESOURCES INVOLVED IN<br />
THAT ARMS RACE COULD BE VASTLY MORE PRODUCTIVELY<br />
EMPLOYED IN THE WORLD ECONOMY, IN CREATING JOBS,<br />
AND IN MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.<br />
ACTION IN THIS FIELD IS URGENTLY REQUIRED. </p>
