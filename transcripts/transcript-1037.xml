FOR PRESS PM 4/ 65<br />
SOUTH-EAST ASIA<br />
STATEMENT BY THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER<br />
The Acting Prime Minister, Mr. John McEwen, announced in<br />
Canberra tonight that the Cabinet had made a wide-ranging review of<br />
current developments in Malaysia and South Vietnam with particular<br />
reference to Australian obligations in the South-East Asian area.<br />
Mr. McEwen said that Ministers had over recent weeks been<br />
giving constant attention to information flowing to them on South<br />
Vietnam and on both the military and diplomatic aspects of Indonesia's~<br />
confrontation with Malaysia, including the latest information on the<br />
views of the Malaysian and British Governments about the continuing<br />
threats from Indonesia and the steps being taken to meet them.<br />
The Minister for Defence, Senator Paltridge, during his<br />
visit to South-East Asia and the United States, would personally<br />
assess the position at first hand and would report back to the<br />
Australian Government. The Minister's report would cover possible<br />
future courses of action having regard to Australia's over-all<br />
commitments to the security of the area.<br />
" The recent Indonesian decision to withdraw from the United<br />
Nations and new Indonesian military activities in support of their<br />
policy of ' confrontation' have heightened tension between Indonesia<br />
and Malaysia," Mr. McEwen said. " The latest Indonesian military<br />
activities included noticeable building-up of Indonesian forces on<br />
the Borneo border. These developments had led to the recent deployment<br />
of additional British and Malaysian forces."<br />
Mr. McEwen expressed disappointment that Indonesia is<br />
persisting in this policy of military ' confrontation'. The<br />
Australian Government continued to hope for changes in Indonesian<br />
policy which would allow peace, security and prosperity to be<br />
established in the area. " However, the Government is quite clear<br />
as to its obligations to Malaysia, a free and independent nation<br />
and a fellow member of the Commonwealth, and is firm in respect ef<br />
its responsibilities," the Ac11ting Prime Minister said.<br />
On Vietnam, Cabinet had before it reports from its<br />
diplomatic representatives and the views of the American Government.<br />
" The Australian Government is concerned that the South Vietnamese<br />
leaders resolve their domestic differences in the overriding<br />
interests of the security of South Vietnam and indeed South-East<br />
Aisia," Mr. McEwen said. </p>
