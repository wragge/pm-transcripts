    <content><![CDATA[<p>Good morning. Well ladies and gentlemen, the ALP Conference has</p>
<p>   done nothing to address the huge policy vacuum that is now represented</p>
<p>   by the Labor Party. Rather than be a serious political conference</p>
<p>   it has become something like an episode from a soap opera. It is</p>
<p>   Cheryl Kernot's conference rather than the Labor Party's</p>
<p>   conference.</p>
<p>The conference has not developed any new policies. It is the role</p>
<p>   of an Opposition to develop policy alternatives. The Labor Party</p>
<p>   has nothing to say to the mainstream of Australia about their economic</p>
<p>   future. The Labor Party offered no apology to the Australian people</p>
<p>   for leaving the new Government with a deficit of $10.5 billion.</p>
<p>   The Labor Party offered no alternative to the approach the Government</p>
<p>   is taking, other than that of mindless opposition and commitments</p>
<p>   to reverse sensible policies.</p>
<p>They have had nothing to say at the Conference about their plans</p>
<p>   for taxation. They have had nothing to say about sensible industrial</p>
<p>   relations, only to turn the clock back to the 1950s. They have had</p>
<p>   nothing to say about globalisation. They have failed to realise</p>
<p>   that in the modern world the process of reform must go on. And it</p>
<p>   is a naive policy vacuum which suggests that in the world in which</p>
<p>   we live we can turn our back on necessary economic reform. What</p>
<p>   the Labor Party has sought to do is substitute serious policy making</p>
<p>   with a lot of froth and bubble. And in the process there has been</p>
<p>   more focus on a person who is not even a Member of Parliament, than</p>
<p>   on the Leader of the Australian Labor Party. And that plainly wasn't</p>
<p>   in the script and that demonstrates the folly of political parties</p>
<p>   who imagine that they can get through without confronting serious</p>
<p>   policy issues.</p>
<p>The Australian public now knows that there is no alternative on</p>
<p>   offer to that of the present Government, that the Labor Party does</p>
<p>   not have an alternative approach for governing Australia, and instead</p>
<p>   of producing at this conference a road map for how Labor would like</p>
<p>   to take the Australian nation into the 21st Century we have been</p>
<p>   left with an empty Conference of froth and bubble.</p>
<p>And we have also seen the Leader of the Opposition be the ultimate</p>
<p>   in political weather-vanes with his approach to the question of</p>
<p>   an Australian republic. He has put his finger up in the air, he</p>
<p>   has read an opinion poll that says that 75 per cent of Australians</p>
<p>   want to vote for the President if there is a President, and he said</p>
<p>   let us go for that. Now that kind of unprincipled bobbing and weaving</p>
<p>   is not leadership. That sort of unprincipled poll pursuit does not</p>
<p>   demonstrate that he represents a clear alternative to the present</p>
<p>   Government.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, are you worried about a potential earthquake now</p>
<p>   that Cheryl Kernot said there is a fault line ...[inaudible]?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think the person who should be concerned is Mr Beazley. I mean,</p>
<p>   if you sort of measure the column inches she is a country mile in</p>
<p>   front.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What do you think of her ego, I guess you could call it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think I will leave it to you to make judgements on that. Far</p>
<p>   be it for me to presume to run a ruler over the personal performances</p>
<p>   of all of my opponents. But I think as Senator Alston said yesterday,</p>
<p>   there is a degree of preciousness in some of the responses. But</p>
<p>   I don't want to dwell over much on that.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Do you fear she poses a serious electoral threat</p>
<p>   to the Government.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> No. Less so after the last few days.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Prime Minister. Mr Beazley has promised to get</p>
<p>   all the sides in the Wik debate together and find a solution. What</p>
<p>   is your response to his approach to that policy?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Paul Keating did that in 1993 and in the process he betrayed the</p>
<p>   farmers of Australia and in the process he produced the native title</p>
<p>   mess which we are now endeavouring to clean up and he is trying</p>
<p>   to frustrate. That is a remedy for further talk, further delay,</p>
<p>   further cost, further litigation, endless putting off a difficult</p>
<p>   decision.</p>
<p>The Australian people elected my Government to clean up the native</p>
<p>   title mess. </p>
<p>We've put forward a fair and decent compromise. We ask the</p>
<p>   Senate to pass that compromise. We have already recognised the concerns</p>
<p>   of all stake holders in developing that compromise. We won't</p>
<p>   be changing our position. It's up to the Parliament to do its</p>
<p>   job and to pass the legislation.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, aren't your comments on policy details somewhat</p>
<p>   hypocritical when the Coalition didn't really provide any details</p>
<p>   at all until just before the election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's completely wrong. I mean I spent quite a lot of the</p>
<p>   time when I was in Opposition not only developing an alternative</p>
<p>   policy framework for the Coalition but also in the process of developing</p>
<p>   an alternative policy framework for the then Government. </p>
<p>We had a very well developed alternative in relation to issues</p>
<p>   such as industrial relations, privatisation, fiscal consolidation,</p>
<p>   significant differences in the area of health policy. If I remember</p>
<p>   correctly the theme from the Labor Party in the lead up to the last</p>
<p>   election was not that we were a policy free zone rather that we</p>
<p>   were a dangerous alternative. I mean they can't have it both</p>
<p>   ways. They can't say that you shouldn't elect them because</p>
<p>   they are a dangerous alternative and then in the next breath say</p>
<p>   they're a policy free zone.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you have accused the Labor Party of doing some</p>
<p>   of the things you have been accused of, lack of vision, turning</p>
<p>   the clock back to the fifties, reacting to opinion polls. Is this</p>
<p>   becoming a tit-for-tat in which you're trying to use their</p>
<p>   arguments against them?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am just dealing with reality. Everybody knows that the overwhelming</p>
<p>   bulk of people in the Labor Party do not support an elected Presidency</p>
<p>   and what Kim Beazley has simply done is to pick up the papers, look</p>
<p>   at the polls and say Â‘well, I will go for an elected President</p>
<p>   because that might be more popular'. On that particular issue</p>
<p>   he's the person who's being overwhelmingly poll driven.</p>
<p>   I just deal with issues. </p>
<p>My position in relation to Australia's Constitution is well</p>
<p>   known it is not dictated by polls it is dictated by my belief that</p>
<p>   the present system has served this country well. I understand that</p>
<p>   many Australians are uncomfortable with the symbolism of the present</p>
<p>   system and I believe that if we are to change we should not change</p>
<p>   to a system that has an elected President because that will fundamentally</p>
<p>   alter the nature of our current system.</p>
<p>Now Mr Beazley knows that, Mr Keating knows that, many people in</p>
<p>   the Labor Party know that but in order to get a vote and to court</p>
<p>   popularity he's put his finger up, sniffed the breeze and decided</p>
<p>   to go for an elected Presidency. And I think that is being a weather-vane,</p>
<p>   that is being a poll driven politician, that is displaying weak</p>
<p>   leadership and it is not demonstrating the sort of commitment to</p>
<p>   the principle that he really believes in.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, would you campaign in a referendum or plebiscite against</p>
<p>   an elected President?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Michelle let's have the Convention and then let's</p>
<p>   have all those questions.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Just turning to the Asian crisis, when the Treasurer released the</p>
<p>   mid-year budget review he said it was the greatest financial melt-down</p>
<p>   of our life time. Government has since received assessments from</p>
<p>   its experts in the bureaucracy, yet when we ask you about it you</p>
<p>   just say everything is all right, we have got the fundamentals right</p>
<p>   and we have closed Beazley's black-hole.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There is nothing inconsistent.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will you release some of those assessments so Australian businesses,</p>
<p>   Australian exporters can get a better idea of what is actually happening?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well this Government has released more material on the state of</p>
<p>   the books and the state of the economy than any previous Government.</p>
<p>   There is nothing inconsistent with describing what has occurred</p>
<p>   in Asia as a major melt-down and at the same time saying that the</p>
<p>   domestic fundamentals of the Australian economy are so strong that</p>
<p>   we are able to provide strong protection against the impact of that</p>
<p>   melt-down. </p>
<p>You have got to remember that the greatest contributor to economic</p>
<p>   activity and economic behaviour in Australia is still the strength</p>
<p>   of the domestic economy. You have also got to bear in mind that</p>
<p>   some of the countries that have experienced the biggest downturns</p>
<p>   in Asia are not countries to which we export a great deal - although</p>
<p>   in some cases they are - and it is just a question of preserving</p>
<p>   a sensible response and to recognise that when you do have an economic</p>
<p>   down-turn in other parts of the world that if your domestic economic</p>
<p>   fundamentals are strong and you are not vulnerable then the flow</p>
<p>   on effects will be a lot less. Equally, if they were weaker and</p>
<p>   more vulnerable the flow on effects would be much greater.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You criticised Labor for not releasing a tax policy, when are we</p>
<p>   going to see your tax policy and will we see it well before the</p>
<p>   next election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How much before the election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>In what? Number of weeks, days, months?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Weeks, days, yes what ever amount you would like.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It will be released as promised before the election so that the</p>
<p>   Australian people will have an opportunity of knowing what kind</p>
<p>   of tax system will take them into the 21st century under a Coalition</p>
<p>   Government.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will you give some details at the Liberal Council?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh Michelle, I am not going to start telling you precisely when</p>
<p>   or what is going to be in a speech. I have got a few very important</p>
<p>   speeches coming up soon including one tomorrow in Melbourne about</p>
<p>   the Constitution. I am not going to talk about tax tomorrow, Michelle.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard can I ask, Jocelyn Newman...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Then I must go, I have got the Young Australian of the Year Award.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Jocelyn Newman put out a release last night talking about the increased</p>
<p>   number of fraud claims under social welfare. ACOSS have come back</p>
<p>   saying there is an undue emphasis on those abusers, what is your</p>
<p>   response to that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look I haven't read the ACOSS response. I am not going</p>
<p>   to get into that. All I can say is that I think there is a genuine</p>
<p>   public interest in preventing any kind of rorting of the system</p>
<p>   no matter what end of the income scale it occ</p>
<p>  no matter what end of the income scale it occurs.</p>
