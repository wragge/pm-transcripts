PRIME MINISTER 7/ 94<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME,: MINISTER, LION P. J. KEATINGsMP<br />
MITSUBISHI MOTORS AUSTRALIA LTD<br />
The announcement by Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd that it will continue to<br />
manufacture In Adelaide beyond its current program is welcome news for Australia and<br />
for South Australia in particular.<br />
Mitsubishi's activity in making the Magna and Verada range in Adelaide has been a<br />
significant positive clement in the states economy.<br />
It has been a substantial source of employment in the State, and has provided valuable<br />
export income for the nation.<br />
The Government recognises that the vehicle building industry generally is still going<br />
through a lengthy process of adjustment in Australia, and is facing international<br />
pressures caused largely by economic growth slower than Australia's own. This<br />
announcement ffrm one of the major manufacturers, however, is very encouraging.<br />
