QLJES11ON: Mr Mrme Minister think you very much for coming here today,<br />
( inaudible) yo~ u have been emphoolsln; that th6-futur. of AuxtTaUIIN<br />
lies In Asia and specifically spakin$ what Is y'ourvision of future<br />
Australla In Asia?<br />
PM: Woll Australia's alretAy subsarntally locked into As[&amp; by way of<br />
trade, 604 of our expiorts So to the region. And invemna between<br />
Australia, Japan for instance is the second largest investor only by a<br />
fraodon could be the lagest investor. In Japan, Australian<br />
companies are invesino more ri~ ht throughout the AsluIMuclfic area,<br />
South Bast Asia in particular as well un some places In North Asia<br />
go by way of Its tradc substantially you know focussed upou tho<br />
Auia/ Pa, ific arep and with to~ irtSM flowl AgaiII mkini that binding<br />
even tighter, Australia Is olie of the principal destinations for<br />
laPAntle touuist$ iad again being more, Austrsliaft tea travel to the<br />
Pie( and the other principal faetors of course we live In the region.<br />
Anitralla has dramatically ( inaudible) border protec~ tion. It's sn open<br />
trading country and its mostly opn to trade with the resion.<br />
QU~ mN<br />
So that's why you Ame visiting bere to Japan and have you gained<br />
much by it?<br />
PM: Well lapans our laxrpat tradinS partner a great source of investmnt<br />
and we Ãµ ' ve developed now a tons term reladoanahip from the early<br />
Wot was years ouwards.<br />
We wera the principal supplius of raw~ materials to Japan w~ lf<br />
Japan war. building It's economy in the G0&amp; and 70s. we as. " h third<br />
SO/ TO'd 800* DN 6V: OT Z6' d@ S~ 2 :--1w31 </p>
<p>largest source of Imports to hapr this very year so we have a 1l1ng<br />
standitg relatlonship and that relationship Is diversifying and now<br />
hus of eourse many Personulties in It, many people that are<br />
participating in it so there Are great Isdalities of people who<br />
belong to Au~ tru1WaJapad BUsinSt Cooperation CoUnciT s and it hav<br />
now Its own i1ndmnftum.<br />
As well as that we aze joining with Japan~ In such things as P6110<br />
kcepil Forces in Camnbodlg.,. so the relationship is deeply broadening<br />
.11 the time and-It is appropriato for Prime Ministers to meW<br />
accasinnally to discuss issues particularly at time of change.<br />
Now I would like to ask about your views: How do you Set the<br />
activities in Cambodia for which Japan Is going to sezid self doficnca<br />
forces* iooos to Cambodia this coming ftill What do you IO ahout<br />
this'? PA: Wall this is under the hospices of the United Nationx and iho Post<br />
Cold War Rra of the United Nations hu it anything concentrated Its<br />
Imfportance In tome od the reglonal trouble spots whore the overlay<br />
of the suparpowe?% has diminished. And I think this Is in entirely<br />
tespectable posiflon for the VArious COUNrie to tAke particulary SAY<br />
ins the Cambodian context wher we Are Seeking to restore pmae to<br />
that country,<br />
Now. I understand the sensitivbies within Japan of 6mPloymnent Of<br />
Japancie Self Defenc Forces in Any role beyond lapanis shores but<br />
71is ts a cirtumscribo role, It's a definod role. it'. a role imi sare<br />
with other countries Including Aostralia and can I say that we'r<br />
delighted to have the Australian Detence Fores serve jointly,<br />
together, side by side with the Porvis of Japan and I atn qntto SU'.<br />
" ht with tUs exercise which happes to be under the commnand of<br />
an Australian that the task Sivan to AI of us by the Uaited Nations<br />
will be fulfilled and this Ix to leus true of Japa. I = i sure Japan his<br />
doe entily the right thing In beIng thene.<br />
QMI&amp; V1 4<br />
Do you we thon any prospects for hope ur for -peace to be realisod In<br />
that region?<br />
PM, I think that Substantial prospets, I mcan we Wae seen a big change<br />
In the strategic enonm01ent In the region.. but with the atrategic<br />
environinent being now mora benign than It was before the decline<br />
of the old Soviet Empirt but It's also none the less more complex.<br />
benig but more complex 80 countries are deciding their own<br />
postture now that ( sought) of bipolvity of the super powers hasa<br />
diminished somewhat, But I think with the Cambodians Itis.<br />
huportan: jlast for the Cambodin people If not for the region In<br />
gene11ral tft Peace is restated thert, and this could only have a<br />
settliot influenee em the whole ame. go, It's a worthy thing to be<br />
theme and let's hope that both Australia and ] spa as active players<br />
there are doing it well.<br />
SO/ ZOd 800' ON 6V~: 01 Z6" daS'* 2 :-11331 </p>
<p>QL'EMfON<br />
Now you have been proposingi that A PVC meetings hould be changbd<br />
from a meatiftg on the miniserial level to political leaders or prime<br />
miniter/ prime ministte' level. Is the group a small group<br />
proposing the qhange?<br />
Well unliko the North Atlantic area there is nn one foram where the<br />
leadors of the Asia/ Pauffic, North Asia, South East Asia. the Witer<br />
Pacific, Eastern Pacific, there Is no on@ forum where leaders am Meat<br />
and talk about issues of subttance. Now one of thosc subjects and of<br />
couras ff140 and economic policie, and Australia first propnoed APEC<br />
a discusiioni point for trade and economic Issues, They have sine.<br />
been adopted and Ito attended at mlalsiorlal 1. vel,., Zt now becoming<br />
insttutinnalixed, the headquafters have been decided to be In<br />
Singapore and it's starting to go at its ingtitjtlonal Pace@ and<br />
strength but I think that Australia's strength&amp; and pae a going to<br />
be Very greatly sthaned by the attendance of the Hea of<br />
GQov. Ument of the constituent countries. So It has Incredible<br />
authority and weight atid mass of weight to be able to not simply<br />
debate things but decide things.<br />
So I think in' the first instance we se a, fair bit of trade libetultaing<br />
force, And the other thin$ I think it dnes. it Iiducees a more ativist<br />
role by thai Ui~ ted Stutni in the Asian Pacific ame because whle@ the<br />
proponderanca of US trade Is in the Pacific abc bulk of its<br />
itietituIdonal armngemexns are in the Atltic and I thinlk i very<br />
Much in the Intuerests of 111 of us in the Pucifi, Japan aspMislly, to<br />
Wae a basis of dilogue where Issues xnd trad&amp; betwwo the Unitzed<br />
States and Japan be discussed and worked out and worked out to the<br />
mutual satisfaction of the rest at us in the are&amp; So it would serve<br />
that Purpose nd the otber thins Is havieS the Influence in a libefil<br />
democracy lie the United Stateg actively Involved ini ths would be a<br />
good thins as Wall.<br />
So I thinik APIC has come of ale at te Forum aiid ta reaka It even<br />
more effective . representstI94 of the constituent countries and Ilsad<br />
of Glovemment periodically will I tinuk do a great daal to enhance Its<br />
society. As Our largest trading partner, we would like to atk about the<br />
JapwA~ nldsai* relationships. Japan his boen undergoing deep<br />
recession lately lad Japan is not investing as miuch us it used to In<br />
your country so what will you exput of Japana?<br />
PM: This may lentrally be true about Investment but we ine seeing now<br />
a couple of very &amp; Sgnificsat Investmnnis inith e minufaetuting<br />
industry. 7u Toyota Motor Company Is now JUst Investing. in the<br />
COurse of Investing nearly $ 750 Million In a state of the art Motor<br />
plant In Auatralia And Mltshishi Corpoadi is considering now<br />
spenading another $ 600 million which by Intarnatioual stazdards is a<br />
large Investment.<br />
800* ON 6V7: 01 Z6daS2 : 3 </p>
<p>So the character of the investment It ch. mglng where In the late 801<br />
It was in roil estate and tourist talatod vtnturos an~ d consmtruton,<br />
ml. s is Isis true today but we are teeing now a shift to someo<br />
substantial Investment in manufactwiog which we regard It as a<br />
good thing.<br />
Given the facE that soms of the products will feed the Intentational<br />
distribution system fat those particular companies. Japan's growth Is<br />
slow at the m1onlont, but I took tho opporwdty to congratulate 1ho<br />
gOvernment Of JaPan On Its physical pakage. Which is I think both<br />
tImely aond courageous, over 2* 6 of GDP is a very large package by<br />
your Govermeint. and It om~ es I think at the right time$ for the<br />
Japanese and the world economy to r am hoping It w', I1 do as your<br />
Government thinks It will dO.. thal'i lift nativity In Japan and At Cho<br />
SAMn time lift activity In the world because Japan is now such a large<br />
player In the world economy.<br />
QUEMfON:<br />
Excuse me when you say million dollar# YOU mean Australian<br />
dollars? PM: Sorry,. no for all Intents and purposes just say dollars because while<br />
A$ 700 million aout UjSSoo mille.<br />
Thank you.<br />
Now with regard to~ the now Movement of Japan in Asia, there w*<br />
Some voices that call for Japan, some people. are saying JSp* 1<br />
should be noutin~ tod as a Permanent mfmber of te UN Secuiity<br />
Council.. What do you think about thiS?<br />
PM: Well. we Agree with that.. We're umotng Japan and ii IsObvious to<br />
the Security Council. We think that JaPan can Play and Should play I<br />
larger lnternatlonsl role, and a Security Council place Is In koepial<br />
with the size of J&amp; pui in the world cconomy and Its Influaence on<br />
World AttafS, SO we think the Governumnt of Japan Is ovwing the<br />
cornot policy In lifting gradually, but clearly lifting Japa'.<br />
iternational involvemniot In world affairs and given that the Vnit,*<br />
Nations arm now applying an even greater role then it wu befor the<br />
end of the cold war. 1111is a ntniely Sensible thin$ for JAPan t6 be<br />
doing to secure a Seat at the Security Council and In that it will have<br />
Australia's support,<br />
SO/ VOd 800* 0N 6P: OT Z6* d@ S'~ i13-131 </p>
<p>Now tho last question is abnpt the Urzrn~ a, round OArr. Do you<br />
think Itisi possible for the roucnyi to be co mpletely<br />
. WZccafui by the end of this 3Y1r<br />
PM; Well I think It has lead to time at the moment, because It to<br />
Somewhat comnplicated by elections around the world. It's important<br />
for It to be co~ ncluded successfully.<br />
I think Itis very Importsnt. Because I think the psychological value<br />
of the &amp; ucceqifN1 c0clusion of the round will do many great thing$<br />
for the tpads slivironment and a lot of the., what we so* is apparent<br />
movemnt towards bilaterallamn may diminish when people<br />
understand there are, very nice International overlay or backdrop t0<br />
world trade<br />
So It Is linportan to too it completed. toe stallitig point has bcen on<br />
alriculture in which Australia has a keen intefest, but the basis of<br />
the Argument is one between. iurgeiy the E! uropemns and the United<br />
States about agricultural subsfdka. T! hore'i an Issua for Japan In<br />
here u. wall and its the tarrifficatloo Issue In respect of rice.<br />
That'll be a difficul; issuo for you but the benefits of the round will<br />
so outweigh any concessioo lsau may provide in this area to to<br />
make a Succssuful completion to the round very much in All of our<br />
Interolls amt particularly Japan which has a very large spac in an<br />
open free muldisaeral home envlrontnent.<br />
