    <content><![CDATA[<p>  Following my successful meeting with indigenous leaders and experts on 23 July 2003, I am pleased to announce a commitment of $20 million to address the tragic consequences of violence and child abuse in indigenous communities.</p>
<p>These funds will help indigenous communities to:  develop local solutions to critical issues that contribute to violence, such as alcohol and drug abuse;  treat alcohol and drug abuse in their communities;  and  increase awareness amongst young indigenous people on sexual assault.</p>
<p> This $20 million commitment is a âdown payment'; showing the Government';s good faith in tackling violence, child abuse and alcohol abuse in indigenous communities.  In addition to this initiative, ongoing commitment by all governments and indigenous communities is needed.</p>
<p>I am attaching a paper provided to the states and territories, developed in consultation with a small working group of indigenous leaders and experts from the 23 July 2003 meeting, that addresses violence and child abuse in indigenous communities.  I will be asking the states and territories at the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) meeting tomorrow to commit to the approach set out in this paper.</p>
<p>I am determined that governments together should work to change the unacceptable circumstances which blight the lives of so many indigenous people.</p>

<p>   ATTACHMENT</p>
<p>AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES</p>
<p>  Support for Non Government Organisations</p>
<p>$6.1 million under the Non Government Organisation Treatment Grants Programme of the Tough on Drugs Strategy for projects across Australia targeting alcohol and drug abuse in indigenous communities.  Details on individual projects will be announced shortly.</p>
<p>Diversion Programme for Alcohol and Drugs</p>
<p>$10.5 million over four years from the Tough on Drugs Diversion Initiative towards a new community grants scheme called the Tough on Drugs Indigenous Community Initiative to help divert Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from alcohol and drug abuse. Projects funded under this initiative will address key areas for action identified in the National Drug Strategy Complementary Action Plan recently endorsed by Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy.</p>
<p>Communities in Crisis</p>
<p>Complementing the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission';s Family Violence Action Plan, $3 million over two years will be available for immediate funding to respond to local plans of action for communities that are in major crisis.  The Australian Government, in consultation with states and territories, will identify with ATSIC those communities that are in crisis and agree to collaborate in support of those communities. This will be targeted to stabilising communities that are suffering from an intolerable incidence of alcohol abuse and violence. The Australian Government will provide greater flexibility to ATSIC and ATSIS to enable the use of Community Partnerships Agreement funding for such priorities.</p>
<p>Community Initiatives in Sexual Assault</p>
<p>$400,000 to develop an indigenous focussed programme under the National Initiative to Combat Sexual Assault, to encourage discussion about this sensitive issue among young indigenous people.</p>
