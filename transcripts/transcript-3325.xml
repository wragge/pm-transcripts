EMBARGO: 8.30PM FRIDAY 12 JULY 1974<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P,,<br />
TO THE AUSTRALASIAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGYI<br />
HOMESTEAD HOTEL, BRISBANE, 12 JULY 1974<br />
THE OBJECTS OF YOUR INSTITUTE WERE DEFINED<br />
IN THESE TERMS 81 YEARS AGO:<br />
" TO PROMOTE THE ARTS AND SCIENCES<br />
CONNECTED WITH THE ECONOMICAL PRODUCTION<br />
OF THE USEFUL MINERALS AND METALS, AND<br />
THE WELFARE OF THOSE IN THESE INDUSTRIES,<br />
BY MEANS OF MEETINGS FOR SOCIAL INTERCOURSE,<br />
AND THE READING AND DISCUSSION OF<br />
PROFESSIONAL PAPERS, AND TO CIRCULATE BY<br />
MEANS OF PUBLICATIONS AMONGST ITS MEMBERS<br />
AND ASSOCIATES, THE INFORMATION THUS<br />
OBTAINED." </p>
<p>-2-<br />
IT IS TO THAT SPIRIT OF PROFESSIONAL<br />
DETACHMENT, OF SCHOLARLY CONCERN, THAT I HOPE TO<br />
APPEAL IN ADDRESSING YOU TONIGHT, I TRUST THAT<br />
YOUR PROFESSIONAL TRAINING AND GOOD JUDGEMENT<br />
WILL LEAD YOU TO THE SAME CONCLUSIONS, THE SAME<br />
CONSIDERATIONS OF NATIONAL INTEREST, THAT HAVE<br />
GUIDED THE GOVERNMENT IN FRAMING ITS POLICIES<br />
TOWARDS OUR GREAT MINING INDUSTRIES, I KNOW<br />
THAT MEN SUCH AS YOU, MEN WHOSE SKILLS AND LEARNING<br />
AND DEDICATION HAVE HELPED CREATE THESE INDUSTRIES<br />
AND LEAD THEM TO PROSPERITY, WILL WANT TO SEE<br />
THEM PRESERVED AND STRENGTHENED AND KEPT AS FAR<br />
AS POSSIBLE IN AUSTRALIAN HANDS, I BELIEVE YOU<br />
HAVE AS GREAT AN INTEREST AS I DO IN FOSTERING<br />
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE INDUSTRIES, I BELIEVE<br />
YOU WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THE URGENT ENVIRONMENTAL<br />
PROBLEMS CREATED BY MINING IN A WORLD WHOSE<br />
RESOURCES ARE FINITE, I BELIEVE YOU WILL RECOGNISE<br />
THAT THE CLAIMS OF OUR ABORIGINAL PEOPLE FOR LAND<br />
RIGHTS AFFECT ALL AUSTRALIANS, BUT HAVE A SPECIAL<br />
RELEVANCE TO THE MINING INDUSTRY, I BELIEVE, TOO,<br />
THAT AS CONCERNED PROFESSIONAL MEN, YOU WILL<br />
ACKNOWLEDGE THE DUTY OF MODERN GOVERNMENTS TO<br />
HUSBAND NATIONAL RESOURCES AND ENSURE THAT OUR<br />
MINERALS ARE SOLD AT FAIR PRICES ON WORLD MARKETS, </p>
<p>-3-<br />
SOON AFTER WE CAME TO OFFICE LAST YEAR,<br />
THE GOVERNMENT RESOLVED TO EXERCISE ITS<br />
CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE EXPORT<br />
OF OUR RAW AND SEMI-PROCESSED MINERALS.<br />
WE DID THIS TO ACHIEVE A REASONABLE LEVEL<br />
OF EXPORT PRICES AND A BALANCED DEVELOPMENT<br />
OF AUSTRALIAN MINERAL RESOURCES. OUR POLICIES<br />
ASSERT THE AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY OF THE<br />
NATIONAL GOVERNMENT IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND<br />
MARKETING OF AUSTRALIA'S MINERALS. WE ARE<br />
TAKING THIS COURSE, NOT IN ANY DOCTRINAIRE<br />
SPIRIT, BUT FROM A RECOGNITION OF THE PRACTICAL<br />
AND INESCAPABLE REALITIES OF WORLD TRADE.<br />
THE EXPLOITATION AND MARKETING OF MINERAL<br />
RESOURCES IS NOT MERELY A NATIONAL CONCERN, BUT AN<br />
INTERNATIONAL CONCERN. IT IS CERTAINLY MORE THAN A<br />
STATE CONCERN. MANY OF THE CORPORATIONS WITH WHICH<br />
WE ALL HAVE TO DEAL HAVE BUDGETS SEVERAL TIMES THAT<br />
OF THE STATE OF QUEENSLAND. THE ONLY GOVERNMENT IN<br />
AUSTRALIA THAT CAN DEAL WITH THESE LARGE CORPORATIONS<br />
IS THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT. THE ONLY GOVERNMENT IN<br />
AUSTRALIA WITH INTERNATIONAL STANDING AND RECOGNITION<br />
IS THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
THERE IS NOTHING NOVEL OR SURPRISING ABOUT<br />
THIS, THE AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTION PROVIDES, AS THE<br />
VERY FIRST OF THE POWERS GRANTED TO THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
PARLIAMENT UNDER SECTION 51, THE POWER TO MAKE<br />
LAWS ON " TRADE AND COMMERCE WITH OTHER COUNTRIES."<br />
IN VIEW OF THAT, IT IS AN ODD ARGUMENT INDEED TO<br />
SAY THAT WE ARE INTERFERING IN THE RIGHTS OF THE<br />
STATES IN ASSERTING OUR RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS WAY,<br />
IT IS TRUE THAT OUR PREDECESSORS IN GENERAL KEPT<br />
OUT OF THIS FIELD, No DOUBT THEY FELT THEY HAD<br />
GOOD REASONS FOR DOING SO, I SIMPLY ASK YOU TO<br />
ACCEPT THAT OUR ASSERTION OF THE NATIONAL<br />
GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY IN WHAT WE BELIEVE<br />
IS THE NATIONAL INTEREST IS FULLY IN ACCORDANCE<br />
WITH THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF THE CONSTITUTION.<br />
IF IT WERE NOT, I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT OUR APPROACH<br />
WOULD BE CHALLENGED IN THE HIGH COURT, IT HAS NOT<br />
BEEN CHALLENGED: AND I REJECT THE SUGGESTION THAT<br />
BECAUSE WE HAVE ASSERTED THE NATION'S CONCERN AND<br />
RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT AREA,<br />
WE ARE INTRUDING IN STATE AFFAIRS, nNE MAY ASK:<br />
ARE WE " INTRUDING" IN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION,<br />
IN THE CARE OF THE NATIONAL ESTATE, IN* THE ARTS,<br />
IN NATIONAL COMPENSATION, IN EDUCATION, IN CHILD<br />
CARE, MERELY BECAUSE WE ARE DOING WHAT OUR<br />
PREDECESSORS NEGLECTED TO DO? </p>
<p>DESPITE MUCH FOREBODING WHEN OUR POLICIES<br />
WERE INTRODUCED, THEIR ADVANTAGES HAVE BEEN AMPLY<br />
DEMONSTRATED, THE INTRODUCTION OF CONTROLS HAS<br />
GIVEN THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT A MUCH BETTER<br />
KNOWLEDGE OF THE MINERAL INDUSTRY, ITS OVERSEAS<br />
TRADE AND THE TERMS OF ITS CONTRACTS, WHILST<br />
CONFIDENTIALITY HAS BEEN SCRUPULOUSLY OBSERVED,<br />
IT HAS NEVERTHELESS BEEN POSSIBLE FOR THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT OF<br />
MINERALS AND ENERGY TO GIVE MATERIAL ASSISTANCE<br />
AND ADVICE ON WORLD PRICING TRENDS AND TO<br />
CO-ORDINATE THE EXPORT ACTIVITIES OF AUSTRALIANMINING<br />
COMPANIES ON A NATIONAL BASIS, THUS WE HAVE<br />
STRENGTHENED THE NEGOTIATING AND BARGAINING POWER OF<br />
OUR EXPORTERS, WE ARE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT OUR<br />
RESOURCES ARE SOLD OVERSEAS AT WORLD MARKET PARITY<br />
PRICES, No LONGER CAN OUR CUSTOMERS PLAY THE GAME<br />
OF DIVIDE AND RULE TO EXTRACT LOWER PRICES FROM OUR<br />
COMPANIES AND CONCESSIONS FROM STATE GOVERNMENTS,<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH HAS BEEN<br />
ONE OF FIRM BUT FAIR DEALING IN THE INTERESTS OF BOTH<br />
AUSTRALIA AND OUR TRADING PARTNERS, AND I BELIEVE<br />
OUR ACTIONS HAVE ALREADY HELPED YOU TO OBTAIN SIGNIFICANT<br />
INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF OUR IRON ORE AND COAL EXPORTS<br />
AN EXTRA $ 67 MILLION A YEAR TO DATE IN INCOME FROM IRON ORE<br />
AND AN EXTRA $ 210 MILLION OVfR TWELVE MONTHS IN EXPORT INCOME<br />
FROM COAL, IN THIS WAY ALL AUSTRALIANS ARE BENEFITING<br />
FROM THE CONCENTRATION OF OUR BARGAINING POWER, </p>
<p>-6-<br />
MY COLLEAGUE, THE MINISTER FOR MINERALS<br />
AND ENERGY, HAS ALREADY SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />
EXPORT CONTROL POWERS WILL NOT BE EMPLOYED<br />
CAPRICIOUSLY OR VEXATIOUSLY. THIS IS A UNANIMOUS<br />
ATTITUDE AMONG MEMBERS OF THE CABINET, WE HAVE<br />
ASSURED OUR TRADING PARTNERS, ESPECIALLY JAPAN,<br />
THAT WE ARE SEEKING NO MORE THAN A FAIR PRICE<br />
IN OUR MINERAL CONTRACTS WITH THEM, IT WOULD<br />
BE UNREAL TO SEEK PRICES HIGHER THAN THE MARKET<br />
WILL BEAR WHEN ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF SUPPLY<br />
ARE USUALLY AVAILABLE, WE HAVE TAKEN EVERY<br />
OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN OUR POLICIES TO OUR<br />
TRADING PARTNERS IN BILATERAL CONSULTATIONS AND<br />
IN INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS CONCERNED WITH<br />
MINERALS TRADE, CLEARLY, AGAIN, THIS IS A TASK<br />
ONLY A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT CAN PERFORM, </p>
<p>-7-<br />
I HAVE EMPHASISED THE NEED FOR FAIR RETURNS<br />
FROM THE SALE OF OUR MINERALS. ONE STATE THAT HAS<br />
NOT HAD FAIR RETURNS IS QUEENSLAND A STATE WHERE<br />
MINING HAS A LONG AND PROUD HISTORY GOING BACK TO<br />
THE DISCOVERY OF COAL AT IPSWICH IN 1827. I AM<br />
PLEASED TO LEARN THAT THE OUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT<br />
HAS AT LAST TAKEN STEPS TO INCREASE THE SCALE OF<br />
ITS ROYALTY RECEIPTS. I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE<br />
ACTIONS OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT OVER THE LAST<br />
18 MONTHS HAVE CREATED A SITUATION WHERE IT HAS NOT<br />
ONLY BEEN POSSIBLE BUT CONSPICIOUSLY IMPERATIVE FOR<br />
THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT TO DO SO.<br />
EVEN BEFORE THE PRESENT AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
CAME TO OFFICE, nUEENSLAND'S SCALE OF ROYALTY RECEIPTS<br />
WAS, IN RELATION TO THE VALUE OF ITS MINING OUTPUT,<br />
THE LOWEST AMONG ALL THE IMPORTANT MINERAL-PRODUCING<br />
STATES. AT THE SAME TIME, THE OUEENSLAND MINERALS<br />
INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE HAS AN EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH DEGREE<br />
OF FOREIGN OWNERSHIP, PARTICULARLY IN THE DEPOSITS OF<br />
WEIPA BAUXITE AND CENTRAL QUEENSLAND COAL, AND THE<br />
EXPORT PRICES OBTAINED FOR QUEENSLAND COAL WERE<br />
GENERALLY MUCH LOWER THAN THE RULING INTERNATIONAL<br />
LEVELS FOR SHIPMENTS OF COKING COAL OF SUCH QUALITY.<br />
IF I MAY SAY SO WITHOUT BOASTING, IT IS IN PART DUE<br />
TO MY GOVERNMENT'S POLICIES THAT YOUR RETURNS ARE<br />
BEING RAISED. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
SOON AFTER TAKING OFFICE, THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
SOUGHT NEGOTIATIONS WHICH HAVE ENABLED YOUR COAL<br />
PRODUCERS TO OBTAIN VERY MARKED INCREASES IN THEIR<br />
EXPORT SELLING PRICES, IN TURN, THE WIDENING<br />
DISPARITY BETWEEN THE VALUES OF YOUR MINERAL<br />
PRODUCTION AND THE FLAT-RATE ROYALTY RETURNS TO<br />
THE OUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT HAS PROMPTED SIR GORDON CHALK<br />
TO BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS WHICH WOULD INCREASE THE<br />
ROYALTY RECEIPTS. SIR GORDON HAS A VERY STRONG CASE,<br />
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE EFFECTIVE PURSUIT<br />
OF NATIONAL POLICIES BY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT<br />
CAN BRING DIRECT BENEFITS TO THE REVENUES OF A STATE,<br />
I HOPE THIS CO-OPERATIVE PROCESS CAN BE CONTINUED,<br />
YOU WILL PERCEIVE TWO CONSTANT THEMES IN<br />
OUR MINERAL AND MINING POLICIES THE PRESERVATION<br />
OF AUSTRALIAN OWNERSHIP AND THE MAXIMISING OF<br />
BENEFITS TO THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE FROM THE SALE OF<br />
OUR NATURAL RESOURCES, THE SECOND OF THESE WAS THE<br />
MAIN THEME OF MR. T. M. FITZGERALD'S CELEBRATED PAPER<br />
ON THE MINING INDUSTRY, HE POINTED OUT THAT LACK OF<br />
CO-OPERATION BETWEEN STATE GOVERNMENTS AND THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IN POLICIES FOR MINERAL<br />
DEVELOPMENT HAD DEPRIVED THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE OF<br />
BENEFITS THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO DEMAND, </p>
<p>CONTRARY TO THE OPINION GENERALLY HELD UNTIL RECENTLY,<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN PROVIDING VERY<br />
LARGE TAXATION CONCESSIONS FOR MINERAL ENTERPRISES,<br />
NOT ONLY FOR THEIR INITIAL ESTABLISHMENT BUT ALSO<br />
FOR THEIR LATER EXPANSION, CONTRARY TO ANOTHER<br />
IMPRESSION, THE MAJOR PART OF THE TAX CONCESSIONS<br />
CANNOT BE REGARDED MERELY AS TEMPORARY CREDITS,<br />
I DO NOT WANT TO RECOUNT IN DETAIL THE<br />
SUBSTANCE OF THE FITZGERALD REPORT, YOU WILL ALL<br />
BE FAMILIAR WITH IT, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ITS<br />
PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS HAVE BEEN REBUTTED, LET ME<br />
JUST EMPHASISE THAT THE REPORT DOES NOT CONDEMN<br />
TAX CONCESSIONS IN THEMSELVES, WHAT IT DOES SHOW<br />
IS THAT THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE, THROUGH THE INCOME-TAX<br />
SYSTEM, ARE IN EFFECT SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTORS OF FUNDS<br />
TO THE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF EXPANDING MINERAL<br />
ENTERPRISES, WHEN YOU REMEMBER THAT THE ULTIMATE SOURCE<br />
OF THE MINING COMPANIES' PROFITS -OUR SUPERB NATURAL<br />
RESOURCES OF IRON ORE, COAL, BAUXITE, NICKEL AND OTHER<br />
MINERALS ARE PUBLIC ASSETS, AND EXHAUSTIBLE PUBLIC<br />
ASSETS, YOU MUST CONCLUDE THAT. THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE<br />
DESERVE TO RECEIVE A GOOD AND PROPER SHARE OF THE<br />
INCOME FROM THESE RESOURCES, </p>
<p>10<br />
I REMIND YOU THAT THE WHOLE QUESTION<br />
OF TAX CONCESSIONS AND ROYALTIES FOR YOUR<br />
INDUSTRY HAS BEEN REFERRED BY US TO THE<br />
INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE COMMISSION. WE HAVE<br />
ASKED THE COMMISSION " TO INQUIRE AND REPORT ON<br />
THE EFFECT OF TAXATION CONCESSIONS AND ROYALTIES<br />
ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND EFFICIENCY OF THE PETROLEUM<br />
AND MINING INDUSTRIES AND TO ADVISE WHETHER AND IN<br />
WHAT WAYS WE SHOULD OFFER ASSISTANCE TO OR IMPOSE<br />
ROYALTIES ON THESE INDUSTRIES." </p>
<p>11<br />
I STRESS THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
IS COMMITTED TO THE CONTINUATION OF SIGNIFICANT<br />
CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN MINING. THIS INVESTMENT<br />
SHOULD NOT INVOLVE LOSSES TO THE NATIONAL REVENUE,<br />
NOR SHOULD IT PRIMARILY PROMOTE FOREIGN. PROFITABILITY.<br />
I AM AWARE OF THE BENEFITS THAT THE MINING INDUSTRY<br />
HAS BROUGHT TO OUR NATION AND TO THIS STATE. THE<br />
WHOLE THRUST OF MY ARGUMENT IS THAT ALL AUSTRALIANS,<br />
INCLUDING QUEENSLANDERS, SHOULD HAVE BENEFITED<br />
MORE FROM THIS DEVELOPMENTD GOVERNMENTS HAVE NOT<br />
TAKEN FULL ADVANTAGE OF OUR RESOURCES IN TERMS OF<br />
PROMOTING THE WELFARE OF THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE,<br />
MY GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE.<br />
LET ME SAY A WORD ABOUT THE PROCESSING<br />
OF MINERALS. THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY IS TO<br />
ENCOURAGE THE TREATMENT AND FABRICATION OF MINERAL<br />
RESOURCES IN AUSTRALIA, AT EVERY STAGE OF PROCESSING<br />
THE VALUE OF THESE RESOURCES IS GREATLY INCREASED.<br />
WE WELCOME THE DECISION OF A GROUP OF INTERNATIONAL<br />
IRON AND STEEL PRODUCERS, HEADED BY BHP., TO<br />
STUDY THE FEASIBILITY OF PRODUCING SEMI-FINISHED<br />
STEEL PRODUCTS IN AUSTRALIA, WE ARE DEEPLY INTERESTED<br />
IN THE POSSIBLE ESTABLISHMENT OF STEELWORKS IN<br />
OUEENSLAND AND IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA SO THAT THE<br />
SHIPMENT OF QUEENSLAND COAL TO WESTERN AUSTRALIA<br />
CAN BE COMPLEMENTED BY THE BACK-LOADING OF WESTERN<br />
AUSTRALIAN IRON ORE TO QUEENSLAND, </p>
<p>12<br />
HERE AGAIN, A QUESTION OF NATIONAL INTEREST<br />
IS RAISED. IF COAL AND IRON ORE ARE TO BE BROUGHT<br />
TOGETHER FOR THIS ADMIRABLE PURPOSE, CLEARLY THIS<br />
CAN BEST BE DONE BY SHIPS OF THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL<br />
LINE. INTERSTATE TRADE IS AS MUCH THE PROPER ROLE<br />
AND RESPONSIBILITY OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT AS<br />
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL LINE IN OUR ECONOMIC LIFE IS<br />
WELL KNOWN. IT HAS BEEN RECOGNISED BY EVERY<br />
STATE GOVERNMENT EXCEPT QUEENSLAND. IT IS A<br />
MATTER OF REGRET THAT THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT<br />
HAS REFUSED TO ALLOW THE A. N. L. TO ENGAGE IN<br />
INTRASTATE TRAFFIC EXCEPT ON THE SINGLE ROUTE<br />
BETWEEN GLADSTONE AND WEIPA,<br />
I SHALL DEAL BRIEFLY WITH TWO ASPECTS OF<br />
MINING THAT CURRENTLY EXERCISE THE GOVERNMENT.<br />
HIGH AMONG THE GOVERNMENT'S AMBITIONS IS TO GIVE<br />
NATURAL RIGHTS TO OUR ABORIGINAL PEOPLE, WE ARE<br />
DETERMINED THAT THEIR INTERESTS WILL BE PRESERVED<br />
IN ANY MINING OPERATIONS. MR. JUSTICE E. A. WOODWARD'S<br />
REPORT ON LAND RIGHTS FOR ABORIGINES IN THE NORTHERN<br />
TERRITORY WILL FORM THE BASIS OF OUR APPROACH TO<br />
THIS QUESTION. WHILE THE INTERESTS OF MINING<br />
COMPANIES WILL BE RESPECTED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE,<br />
WE REGARD THIS AS AN ISSUE OF BASIC HUMAN JUSTICE<br />
TRANSCENDING COMMERCIAL CONSIDERATIONS. </p>
<p>13<br />
NEXT, THE ENVIRONMENT, I AM W SURE<br />
NOT<br />
YOU WILLADISPUTE THE VIEW THAT AUSTRALIA MUST<br />
ADOPT A BALANCED NATIONAL APPROACH TO THE<br />
CONSERVATION OF OUR NON-RENEWABLE MINERAL<br />
RESOURCES. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT CONSERVATIONISTS<br />
RECOGNISE THE CONTRIBUTION TO OUR EXPORT EARNINGS<br />
BY THE MINING INDUSTRY, OUR RELIANCE ON MINERALS TO<br />
PROVIDE THE COMFORTS AND CONVENIENCE OF MODERN LIFE,<br />
IT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE MINING INDUSTRY<br />
RECOGNISE THE WIDER COMMUNITY PRIORITIES OF SOME<br />
LAND USE DECISIONS AND PUBLIC CONCERN ABOUT THE<br />
REHABILITATION OR ALTERNATIVE USE OF LAND AFTER<br />
MINING HAS CEASED. IN RECOGNITION OF THIS, THE<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS ENDORSED THE USE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL<br />
IMPACT STATEMENT PROCEDURE, IT HAS BEEN OPERATING<br />
THIS PROCEDURE ON AN ADMINISTRATIVE BASIS FOR SOME<br />
TIME, LEGISLATION HAS BEEN DRAFTED TO PUT IT ON. A<br />
FIRMER BASIS AND ENSURE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS<br />
RECEIVE GREATER CONSIDERATION IN DECISION-MAKING<br />
-THAN HITHERTO. I BELIEVE THE ATTITUDE OF THE<br />
GOVERNMENT TO THE ALWEST BAUXITE MINING PROPOSAL<br />
IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA DEMONSTRATES THE STRENGTH<br />
OF OUR RESOLVE ON THIS ISSUE. </p>
<p>14<br />
I COME NOW TO OUR GREAT INSTRUMENT FOR<br />
EXPANDING AUSTRALIA'S ROLE AS A GREAT MINERAL<br />
PRODUCING NATION, THE PETROLEUM AND MINERALS<br />
AUTHORITY WILL BE ESTABLISHED TO EXPLORE<br />
AND DEVELOP OUR PETROLEUM AND MINERAL RESOURCES<br />
AND TO HELP IMPLEMENT THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY OF<br />
MAXIMUM AUSTRALIAN OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF OUR<br />
NATURAL RESOURCES, THE LEGISLATION IS NOW BEFORE<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT FOR THE THIRD TIME,<br />
No AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS EVER HAD A CLEARER<br />
MANDATE FOR ITS LEGISLATION,<br />
APART FROM EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT,<br />
THERE IS A DISTINCT NEED FOR THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT<br />
TO HELP SMALLER AUSTRALIAN MINING VENTURES DEVELOP<br />
THEIR DISCOVERIES WITHOUT SACRIFICING CONTROL OR.<br />
OWNERSHIP TO OVERSEAS INTERESTS, WE HAVE A FURTHER<br />
OBLIGATION TO EXAMINE AND DEVELOP ALL SOURCES OF<br />
ENERGYI INCLUDING SOLAR ENERGYI WHICH COULD CONTRIBUTE<br />
TO OUR NEEDS WHEN MORE CONVENTIONAL SOURCES ARE<br />
NO LONGER AVAILABLE, THE FUNDS OF THE NEW AUTHORITY<br />
WILL PROMOTE THE SEARCH FOR PETROLEUM AND HELP TO<br />
ENSURE THAT FUTURE ON-SHORE MINING DEVELOPMENT IS<br />
AT LEAST PREDOMINANTLY AUSTRALIAN-OWNED AND CONTROLLED,<br />
WE WILL CONSIDER ASSISTANCE TO THE MANY SMALL<br />
COMPANIES AND SYNDICATES WHICH HAVE USED UP THEIR<br />
CAPITAL ON EXPLORATION, AND WHOSE DISCOVERIES COULD<br />
FALL INTO THE HANDS OF FOREIGN COMPANIES BEFORE THEY<br />
CAN BE DEVELOPED AS AUSTRALIAN CONCERNS, </p>
<p>15<br />
I COME NOW TO OUR GREAT INSTRUMENT FOR EXPANDING<br />
AUSTRALIA'S ROLE AS A GREAT MINERAL PRODUCING NATION.<br />
THE PETROLEUM AND MINERALS AUTHORITY WILL BE ESTABLISHED<br />
TO EXPLORE AND DEVELOP OUR PETROLEUM AND MINERAL<br />
RESOURCES AND TO HELP IMPLEMENT THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY<br />
OF MAXIMUM AUSTRALIAN OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF OUR<br />
NATURAL RESOURCES,. THE LEGISLATION IS NOW BEFORE THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT FOR THE THIRD TIME, ! O AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS EVER HAD A CLEARER MANDATE FOR ITS<br />
LEGISLATION. APART FROM EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT, THERE IS<br />
A DISTINCT NEED FOR THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TO HELP<br />
SMALLER AUSTRALIAN MINING VENTURES DEVELOP THEIR<br />
DISCOVERIES WITHOUT SACRIFICING CONTROL OR OWNERSHIP<br />
TO OVERSEAS INTERESTS, WE HAVE A FURTHER OBLIGATION TO<br />
EXAMINE AND DEVELOP ALL SOURCES OF ENERGY, INCLUDING<br />
SOLAR ENERGY, WHICH COULD CONTRIBUTE TO OUR NEEDS WHEN<br />
MORE CONVENTIONAL SOURCES ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE,<br />
THE FUNDS OF THE NEW AUTHORITY WILL PROMOTE THE SEARCH<br />
FOR PETROLEUM AND HELP TO ENSURE THAT FUTURE ON-SHORE<br />
MINING DEVELOPMENT IS AT LEAST PREDOMINANTLY AUSTRALIAN-OWNED<br />
AND CONTROLLED, WE WILL CONSIDER ASSISTANCE TO THE MANY<br />
SMALL COMPANIES AND SYNDICATES WHICH HAVE USED UP THEIR<br />
CAPITAL ON EXPLORATION, AND WHOSE DISCOVERIES COULD ONLY<br />
BE DEVELOPED BY SELLING THEIR EQUITY. THE QUESTION IS<br />
NOT WHETHER WE PERMIT OVERSEAS CAPITAL TO DO LESS THE<br />
QUESTION IS WHETHER WE CAN ENSURE THAT AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL<br />
DOES MORE, OUR OBJECTIVE SHOULD BE TO MOBILISE THE<br />
RESOURCES OF OUR PEOPLE, HUMAN AND CAPITAL, AND THE<br />
POWERS OF OUR GOVERNMENTS, BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL, </p>
<p>16<br />
WE ARE THE FIRST AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO<br />
IDENTIFY THE REAL NATURE OF THE MINERALS AND ENEt* r'<br />
SITUATION IN THIS COUNTRY, VE ARE THE FIRST TO<br />
INSIST THAT OUR RESOURCES MUST BE KEPT IN AUSTRALIAN<br />
HANDS, WE ARE THE FIRST TO INSIST THAT THEIR SALES<br />
MUST BRING US FAIR RETURNS. WE ARE THE FIRST TO INSIST<br />
ON A NATIONAL PROGRAM OF EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT<br />
TO MEET OUR FUTURE NEEDS, WE ARE THE FIRST TO RECOGNISE<br />
THAT THIS IS A NATIONAL TASK, AND THEREFORE A TASK IN<br />
WHICH THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT MUST ACCEPT ITS FULL<br />
RESPONSIBILITY AND PLAY A LEADING PART IN CO-OPERATION<br />
WITH PRIVATE ENTERPRISE, NOT EVEN THE WORLD'S<br />
GREATEST MAJOR OIL COMPANY COULD ADEQUATELY EXPLORE,<br />
WITH THE REQUIRED INTENSITY OF DRILLING, THE VAST<br />
AREA OF THE NORTH WEST SHELF, WHAT CAN POSSIBLY BE<br />
THE OBJECTION TO AN AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT STAKE IN<br />
THE BUSINESS OF EXPLORATION AND EXPLOITATION OF<br />
AUSTRALIA'S OWN RESOURCES? THE UNITED KINGDOM<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS SUCH A STAKE, So DO THE GOVERNMENTS<br />
OF FRANCE, ITALY, NORWAY, CANADA, RAZIL, ARGENTINA,<br />
MEXICO, SOUTH AFRICA, IRAN, IRAQ, INDIA, JAPAN, INDONESIA,<br />
NEW ZEALAND AND THE PHILIPPINES, IT IS TIME TO END FUTILE<br />
BICKERING BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS AND-THE PETTY OBSTRUCTIONISM<br />
OF THE STATES, THE REALITIES OFTHE WORLD RESOURCES CRISIS<br />
AND THE IMPORTANCE OF AUSTRALIA AS A MINERAL PRODUCER<br />
ARE TOO URGENT TO IGNORE, </p>
<p>17<br />
I PUT IT TO YOU THAT THE NATIONAL POLICIES WE<br />
HAVE INTRODUCED ARE ESSENTIAL; MORE THAN THAT, THEY<br />
HAVE ALREADY BEEN PROVED SUCCESSFUL. THERE CAN BE<br />
NO TURNING BACK NOW TO THE FREE-WHEELING, HAPHAZARD<br />
POLICIES OF THE PAST, NO ONE DISPUTES THE FACT THAT IN<br />
A SHORT TIME THE INDUSTRY YOU REPRESENT HAS HELPED<br />
TRANSFORM OUR NATION, k IS DUE IN LARGE MEASURE TO<br />
THE VISION AND ENTERPRISE OF THE MEN IN THIS ROOM<br />
TONIGHT, WE SALUTE YOU FOR THAT; WITH YOUR HELP<br />
WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD TO GREATER PROGRESS AND<br />
ACHIEVEMENT. IN THAT AMBITION I LOOK CONFIDENTLY<br />
TO THE CO-OPERATION AND SUPPORT OF THIS GREAT<br />
INSTITUTE, WHOSE TOAST I NOW PROPOSE. </p>
