TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SPEECH AT " GENAREN", NARROMINE NSW<br />
LAUNCH OF THE NATIONAL LANDCARE PROGRAM GRANTS 1994-95<br />
24 AUGUST 1994<br />
Well thanks very much, Michael and Kylie. Don and Megan Sutherland, the<br />
Shire President, Robert Wilson. Robert, thank you for coming out today. The<br />
other 12 neighbours who have supported this project, and the volunteers, the<br />
LEAP volunteers and the Australian Trust for Conservation volunteers, and<br />
ladies and gentlemen.<br />
Well, it's a great pleasure to be involved with a project like this as the<br />
occasion for announcing the grants for 1994-95, that is the community grants<br />
component of the National Landcare. Progra m of $ 5 million to fund 711 new<br />
community environment projects around the country. And there needs, with<br />
any such announcement, some indication of what these funds are for, and<br />
how they are spent, to communicate what they mean and to enthuse the<br />
country and the community with the need to be doing these things. And I'm<br />
delighted to be at " Genaren" today to see the preservation of this remnant<br />
bush, which has been in some respects, preserved by the fact that the<br />
Sutherland family have farmed this area for so long, and where they have<br />
very low stocking levels, and the consequence of all this has meant that there<br />
is something here that we can draw from and build upon in seeing this project<br />
some to. fruition. And it's a great thing, I think, that Australians are so<br />
committed and to see volunteers as we are seeing them, help in erecting this<br />
fence which, already five kilometres of which is built, and it's going to be, I<br />
think, six, around 400 hectares, or if you still speak in acres as I do, 1000<br />
acres, which is a large lump of country. To see what can happen when we<br />
allow nature to prevail and the natural species to live in harmony with the<br />
property. I suppose it's a commentary on where we've come as a country in rural terms,<br />
that we are celebrating the preservation of 1000 acres of remnant bush. One<br />
would have thought that with a country so large as this that there would have<br />
been many areas so preserved. But this has not been so, with land clearing<br />
and with the practices over the last century, and particularly with the </p>
<p>introduced species the foxes and the rabbits and the feral cats which have<br />
done so much damage to the native species, and that effects of course the<br />
flora, and that changes the whole balance of the area. And I'm very<br />
interested in Michael saying that they intend now to introduce wallabies back<br />
into the area, which have an impact upon the flora which itself will then set up<br />
other balances in the area. It's such a large piece of land, it's going to be a<br />
very interesting experiment, I think, to see what exactly can be done and what<br />
can be achieved in something so representative as this.<br />
Now, in announcing these projects for 1994-95, it means that we'll be doing<br />
similar things across the country. The important thing, I think, is the<br />
awareness of the land and the respect for the land which the Landcare<br />
program is, in a sense, inducing. But of course the program is one thing it<br />
means nothing without the people. And leadership always matters it matters<br />
everywhere, and it matters in this as in everything else.<br />
And I think that the leadership which Michael and Kylie are showing here is<br />
going to be important to this district because there is a view that the city<br />
slickers have sort of got hold of this issue and we people on the land<br />
shouldn't really be, basically, pushed around by these sort of programs. But<br />
when you see people who have farmed areas for so long, as is the case of<br />
this family for a century or so, showing that leadership and also beyond<br />
simply the Landcare project itself into enhanced conservation of the property,<br />
of the sensible management of water, of care and protection against erosion,<br />
care about stocking levels, balancing that part of the property which is~ a6detJ<br />
pasture and that which is not, this is the sort of leadership that Australia<br />
needs in rural Australia. And that, I think, is going to make the difference<br />
across the country. The Commonwealth can help, with it's programs, but this<br />
is essentially a community thing.<br />
And it's where, I think, rural Australia and people in the countryside of this<br />
nation of ours are saying that the community alone can do this, we need<br />
some financial assistance from the government but it is not a claim or a call<br />
on the government to go and do something. It is, essentially, a call to an<br />
enhanced understanding and appreciation for the land which is ours. So, I<br />
am absolutely delighted with the level of commitment and the leadership<br />
particularly by young people such as Michael and Kylie and the interest in<br />
the species of flora and fauna which is so evident in Michael's remarks. This<br />
is the sort of, if you like, educated enthusiasm which is going to make this<br />
program and this sort of thing, work.<br />
I hope that as we grow and prosper, as we learn more, that we come to know<br />
that the indiscriminate clearing of land is a danger to us, that it threatens the<br />
ground, that we have developed ourselves now as a major producer of wool<br />
in the world, that the country has actually made the transition to hard hoofed<br />
animals, from the native soft ones. And yet, we can do that and survive the<br />
experience of that change if we are careful about how we do it. And, it is that,<br />
I think, engendering that sort of spirit that is going to make the difference.<br />
I </p>
<p>Now, I know that it is hard to engender spirit in difficult times. And,<br />
particularly with the drought. Drought coming and going in some areas, in<br />
one year, off the next, back the following year... It is very dispiriting,<br />
destroying farm incomes, creating a lot of rural poverty. And, the point I was<br />
trying to make a week or two ago is, I think, that we have to regard the<br />
drought as something that is around, in places, most of the time, coming and<br />
going. And, we need programs to deal with it as well as the funding which the<br />
Commonwealth announced my colleague, Bob Collins, announced a week<br />
or so ago $ 13.89 million for exceptional circumstances funding for the<br />
drought where it hits an area particularly hard. And, as you know, we are<br />
adjusting the Rural Adjustment Scheme -( RAS) seeing where you have viable<br />
farms but they take a knock in some particular year, that there is some<br />
financial assistance to be able to meet some of those costs to keep the bank<br />
happy and to keep the business on the road. That, I think, is the challenge.<br />
It is probably true, though I'm not the one to say, that weather patterns have<br />
changed, that we are in a cycle we may have been in at other times in this<br />
century where drought is around quite often. And, I think, we owe it to the<br />
rural community of this country, to those people who are in very viable<br />
country, particularly, and even those at the margins who can generally<br />
survive from one season to another, to help them through with assistance.<br />
That's why we're keeping the RAS scheme and its application under review,<br />
and why we are seeking to get some sort of uniformity in its application<br />
across the states so that in one state, and not another, people are being<br />
treated more generously than somewhere else.<br />
So, there are a few bright spots on the horizon. Wool prices have picked up<br />
and that is going to make a difference to rural incomes. We've been seeing<br />
prices around 700 cents for certain categories of wool which is a substantial<br />
improvement on what we've seen. We're still living, of course, and have<br />
been, with the overhang of the wool stockpile but that is being managed and<br />
we've got, after all, the premium fibre in the world. We produce it in this<br />
country and we're the best at it. So, that is a strong thing for us and, of<br />
course, the grain markets of the world are essentially insatiable and that<br />
depends, of course on good seasons and some innovation in the way we<br />
crop this country. At any rate, one has to be, despite the problems, an<br />
optimist about the future in terms of rural industry with an improvement in the<br />
general understanding of the marketing of our various major commodities.<br />
And, a willingness certainly on the part of the federal government and I am<br />
sure the state governments too to help farmers where help can be really<br />
valuable in getting them through a difficult period where drought has been<br />
about. So, today, I think, we have some things to celebrate and this project here at<br />
' Genaren', the preservation of this remnant vegetation of what it would have<br />
been like... We're seeing here what we might have seen right across this<br />
region of NSW, in various ways, the natural bushland, which has, because of<br />
enlightened management been preserved enough of it preserved to let it<br />
regenerate back. And, I certainly congratulate Michael and Kylie, all those </p>
<p>4<br />
owners nearby who are committed to this and to the volunteers who have<br />
their heart and their faith in Australia, in the value of the land and our respect<br />
for it and wanting to put something back. It is your leadership that is going to<br />
make the difference. And, congratulations to you, one and all.<br />
ends. </p>
