Cabinet Committees play an important role in the effectiveness of the Cabinet system, and this role will be enhanced in the Government';s third term by the creation of new committees for Policy and Priorities and for Sustainable Environment.<br />
These new committees will join those covering National Security, Employment and Infrastructure, Expenditure Review and Parliamentary Business.<br />
The Policy and Priorities Committee will assist Cabinet to provide strong strategic direction to the Government';s overall policy development process to ensure there continues to be a strong forward agenda that reflects our values and the long term needs of Australia.<br />
The Sustainable Environment Committee';s creation meets an election promise and reflects my commitment to make the area covered by the Committee one of our most important whole of government priorities. Matters that will be considered by the Committee include greenhouse policy, the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality, land clearing, bio-diversity and oceans policy.<br />
Attached is the new Cabinet committee membership list.<br />
