ADDRESS AT BRISBANE LIBERAL. PARTY LU1NCHROW<br />
it is not. often that 1. address a meeting held at a racetrack,<br />
but then, perhapB, this occasion is appropriate in view of the..<br />
number of people prepared to punt on the outcome of the niext<br />
election -whenever it may be held.<br />
Mluch of-the tenbion, however, has gpne out of the betting'.. it<br />
has become increasingly clear in recent weeks that In the Labor<br />
Party-we face not so much a bright new cups prospect, as the old.-<br />
grey mare itself, and an old stager which trained poorly-over the<br />
winter recess and is now badly off its feed.<br />
What a disastrous few months it has been for Labor. At-the Perth.-<br />
Conference in June, there was a carefully orchestrated attempt -to<br />
show that Labor had been converted to responsibility. Welt,-let~-~<br />
u~ s look at what happened.<br />
Within a month# the ALP disclosed a plan to spend an extra $ 800<br />

after the Budget amply showed. Mr. Hawke advocates one. uxanium<br />
policy as ALP President, and a quite contradictory policy as ACTU<br />
President a policy immediately disowned by Mr. Whitlam and<br />
Labor is divided, economically incompetent, and committed toa<br />
dogma that is incompatible with Australia's prosperity and well<br />
being. It was that way in government. It is that way now. Nothihd,<br />
else could be expec te&amp; from a political party that is dominated by<br />
the unions a party that expels people like Jack Rgerton. for.--<br />
accepting an Imperial honour; and yet has such double standards<br />
that in the very same year the Wran Labor Government can award.-<br />
Imperial honours. One of the best demonstrations of Labor Ia<br />
* weakness isa that they are putting forward Bil 1 ayden as the -ideal.,<br />
Treasurer. This ideal Treasurer budgeted for a deficit of $ 2.8.<br />
billion by the time we camne to power it had reached $ 4 billion-*<br />
and was going on $ 5 billion. Under this ideal Treasurer,<br />
Government spending increased by 23%. Be set the money supply<br />
rising by 201. </p>
<p>Tihe problem with the Labor Party is not one man -the leader of<br />
the ALP any leader just reflects all t6e Labor Party's probLems,<br />
its -union domination, its commitment to controlling Australians'<br />
lives, its waste and extravagance, its incompetence. While the<br />
woeulrecord of the Labor Government is notorious, the record o1!<br />
a-reform and achievement of the present Government: is not widely<br />
enough understood, and because of that lack of understanding, I.<br />
* want to concentrate bn that record today.<br />
-This Government wias elected because we promised a fresh start a<br />
-~'~ complete break from the dogma of the previous Government a<br />
Government that thought the only way to solve a problem was to<br />
throw money at it.-Your money. We profi~ sed to reduce inflation<br />
and restore economic growth. We have reduced inflation.<br />
When we came to office, the inflation rate measured by the CPI<br />
i1:~:&gt; adjusted for hospital and medical services, was running at 16.7%.<br />
SBy the end of June this year,, it was down to 10.2%. If we take<br />
a broader measure of price increase in the economy, namely the GDP<br />
S deflator, the rate of Inflation can be seen to have dropped by 7%.<br />
We have restored growth. In 1975, Labor's last year, there was<br />
negative growth In our economy. In the year just ended, we recorded<br />
-an annual growth rate of 3 We promised to end Labor's tax ripoff<br />
wttich stifled the energies and initiative of the Australian people.<br />
Uader Labor, personal income tax receipts almo~ st doubled in . three<br />
years. This huge tax rakeoff had to be brought to an end.<br />
-In ou= two Budgets, we have acted decisively to reform the<br />
* taxation system.. Las~ t year we introduced tax indexation, the<br />
-investment allowance, the trading stock valuation -adjuistment, and<br />
an ificreased retention allowance for private companies. All in<br />
all, last year's tax reforms will save Individuals and businesses<br />
over $ 1,800 million in tax In 1977/ 78. In this year's Budget, we<br />
laecomupletely reformed the personal income tax system. These<br />
-reforms have been possible because of the grea restraint exercised<br />
in Government spendiLug. As from 1 February,-there will be just<br />
three tax rates. By Increasing the minimum amount subject to tax..<br />
a further 225,000 low income earners Including many pensioners,<br />
students and part time workers will pay no tax. No one will pay<br />
tax on the first $ 3,750 of their Income, and only 90% of taxpayers<br />
will pay a standard rate tax of 32% on their income over that<br />
amount.<br />
All taxpayers whatever their level of Incomes will pay less<br />
tax as a result of these reforms. in 1978-79, the first full*<br />
year of operation, these tax reforms will save taxpayers $ 1,390<br />
I million. Adding to that half tax indexation, which will save a<br />
further $ 467 million, this comes te-a total of $ 1,857 million,--<br />
I.. n our first two Budgets, the total amount of tax already saved<br />
exceeds $ 3,000 million. These arehuge savings. LIor: uld, have<br />
us believe that in some mystical way there,-have been no-tax cuts<br />
at all. Last-week<br />
W" </p>
<p>We promised to end Canberra's centralisation of power, centralisation<br />
. that the Labor Party wanted. We have handed back to the States<br />
areas of responsibility which the Labor Party had taken. The newaxsharing<br />
arrangements have greatly increased untied grants to<br />
State and Local Government. We promised to give'Local Government<br />
anew deal, and this we have done.<br />
We have acted to provide job opportunities for the unemployed,<br />
and particularly the young unemployed. The Budget provides over<br />
$ 100 million for employmehit training progra ae designed<br />
particularly to alleviate youth unemployawent. These programmes<br />
have achieved an encouraging degree of success. More than 100,000<br />
people have benefited from them already. The special youth<br />
traiming scheme whiich subsidises employers to take on young<br />
people who have been out of work for some considerable length<br />
of time has been particularly successful. And the Treasurer<br />
announced in the Budget that the programme would be extended to<br />
include all people under<br />
We are prepared to increase spending on all these programmes<br />
duringq the year, and we-will assist every eligible applicant<br />
-who seeks support under any one of these schemes.<br />
We promised to reform Australials : industrial relations. Under<br />
-Labor,, the economy was dli'srupted by disastrous strikes. As we<br />
promised we woul. d do when elected, we have legislated to bring<br />
greater justice, common sense and consultation to industrial<br />
relations. We have established the Industrial. Relations Bureau<br />
and the National Labour Consultative Council.* At first the unions<br />
refused to co-operate in these initiatives# but reversed their<br />
stand earlier tis year. / We have<br />
Last week in Parliament, X suggested to those Labor M~ embers who<br />
took this line that they pay their supposedly non-existent taix<br />
cuts into consolidated revenue as a contribution to further<br />
lowering the deficit. Amazingly, not a single Member has yet<br />
come forward to take up my offer.<br />
We promised to give the business community which Labor had<br />
ground down a chance to expand and grow. We said we would<br />
give business the protection-it needs. We have given business<br />
that protection, and we are creating the circumstances in which<br />
*-business can look forward with confidence to the future. Prof its<br />
. are moving the right way not the wrong way, as they did in the<br />
disastrous Labor years.<br />
In the financial year just ended, profits went up by 23.5%.<br />
-We promised to halt the growth of big Government which under<br />
Labor was strangling. Australia. We have reined in the growth of<br />
' the Commonwealth bureaucracy. Last year, the Government's share<br />
of gross domestic product fell for the first time in years. The<br />
-number of Cormonwealth employees has been reduced by 12,000.<br />
Under Labor ' s '-policies, they would have risen by 19,000. </p>
<p>4<br />
* We have fulfilled a primary commitment when elected to require<br />
all elections of. officers of unions registered under the<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Act to be conducted by secret<br />
postal ballot. The term Of office of all such officials has<br />
been limited to four years. Many secondary boycotts by employees<br />
have been banned through an amendment to the Trade Practices Act;<br />
and we have legislated to enable the Commonwealth to stand down<br />
its own employees when strikes or work bans seriously disrupt<br />
the proper performance of their duties. Our firm but fair<br />
industrial policy has met with considerable success.<br />
Our reforms, particularly the new law on secret ballots, have<br />
had a significant impact. In the twelve months since the secret<br />
ballots legislation was introduced, 244 applications have been<br />
received for union elections to be conducted by the Commonwealth<br />
Electoral Office, and at least two major unions may be required<br />
to hold new elections for failing to comply with the legislation,<br />
depending on the outcome of official investigations being carried<br />
out by the Industrial Registrar.<br />
S So far this year, we have had by far the lowest level of<br />
industrial disputes this decade. But the position is still<br />
far from satisfactory. Disputes created by a few extremist<br />
elements in certain key industries, particularly the building,<br />
Smining and maritime industries, have caused grave disruption,<br />
and threaten to hold back national economic recovery. We will<br />
not stand idly by and allow this to continue unabated. These<br />
strikes and work bans are denying jobs to many unemployed.<br />
The seaman's union ban on Utah's coal shipments has already<br />
led to the suspension of the $ 250 million Norwich Park project,<br />
and could lead to an enormous loss of jobs in other Queensland<br />
coalfields. Work bans currently imposed in the construction<br />
industry are also preventing many projects proceeding with<br />
consequent loss of numerous jobs for construction workers.<br />
These disputes are denying Australians the right to work, at<br />
a time when there is a shortage of work. We * ill not allow a<br />
minority of the union movement to damage and confront their<br />
own workmates and the people of Australia.<br />
The time has passed when industrial law was the one area in<br />
which Commonwealth law was not enforced. We strongly believe<br />
in solving industrial disputes if possible by conciliation and<br />
S consultation; but we will not be deterred from using the powers<br />
available to the Government if such action is required in the<br />
national interest. And further industrial relations legislation<br />
will be brought down in the current session of Parliament.<br />
For the rural community we promised to take positive action to<br />
ensure that Australian rural industries continued to play a<br />
significant role in Australia's development. We said we would<br />
reform the tax averaging scheme and introduce income equalisation<br />
deposits to protect primary producers from paying unduly high<br />
rates of tax because of sharp fluctuations in their income.<br />
We have fulfilled both these promises.<br />
We said we would maintain the minimum reserve price for wool.<br />
In fact we have substantially increased it. We promised that<br />
we would reintroduce the superphosphate bounty, ease estate duty<br />
on assets passing between spouses, introduce a new rural / adjustment 4. </p>
<p>* adjustment scheme, reconstitUte the Australian Meat Board, and<br />
implement a campaign again! 3t brucellosis and tuberculosis in<br />
cattle. Xll of these we have done.<br />
-The Government has also moved quickly to introduce further<br />
measures to protect the beef industry which is undergoing a<br />
* critical period. L; ast week we announced a series of measures<br />
to provide beef producers with essential assistance to enabl~ e<br />
them to last through the present, very difficult period. WIe will<br />
contribute $ 6 million f-or a new carcase classification system.<br />
We are entering into urgent negotiations with the Queensland<br />
Goverramnt to ease repayments for settlers in the Brigalow Schem.<br />
We--are--askinq tha-PJT to see if there . Is a case for a full inquiry<br />
to be held into meat marketing and processing charges. We wJill<br />
subsidise beef producers $ 10 a head up to $ 2,000 maximum for<br />
the speying of heiffers and the undertaking of various disease<br />
Control measures, and we will re-examine the terms of carry-on<br />
loans.. household support, and Government charges in remote areas.<br />
: We are also discussing with industry. organisations and the States<br />
new long term measures such as the creation of a buffer fund.<br />
We have given strong support to the Queensland sugar industry<br />
An its dispute with Japanese refiners. No Government could<br />
have taken f irmer action. We stand four-square with Queensland.<br />
The Government is also taking strong action to increase access<br />
for our agricultural products to markets in Europe, the U~ nited<br />
States and Japan.<br />
* We have'reaffirmed o-ur commitment to establish a National Rural<br />
Bank, and legislation to establish it will be intxoduced this<br />
session. Turning to social welfare, we promised to provide effective<br />
and promnpt assistance to pensioners and those~ uwost in need.<br />
We have acted. The Family Allowance Scheme has placed a direct<br />
cash payment in the hands of every mother to spend as she thinks<br />
best for her family. Unlike the previous scheme of tax concessions<br />
for dependants, every mother and every family benefits. Social<br />
welfare pensions and benefits and the main repatriation pensions<br />
rise automatically twice a year to keep pace with inflation.<br />
We have abolished the property means test, and replaced it with<br />
a fairer and more equitable income test.. We promised to protect<br />
-individual rights. In a period in which the power of the<br />
Government: bureaucracy-has grown, and In which people often<br />
feel powerless against the complexity and size of the machinery<br />
of government, th-is. was an important promise. And we have acted.<br />
The first Commnwealth Ombudsman has been appointed. The<br />
Administrative Appeals Tribunal has commenced its work.<br />
Administrative decisions which affect'any individual's rights<br />
can be more readily reviewed in the courts, and legislation<br />
, has been introduced to reform the law on.-criminal investigation<br />
and to establish a Hfuman Rights Coimmisslon. j A<br />
.1 .1 A </p>
<p>Lad! es and gentlemen, after almiost two intensive years of.<br />
responsible Government, Australia has been changed for the<br />
better.:. We have done a great deal to redress the imbalances<br />
of the Labor years. A~ nd we intend to do a great deal more<br />
We always recognised,. we always said, that the damage done<br />
o~ retr h counotbeto xed eni ht. aduemlyet<br />
to the economy ol o efxdoengt But progress-<br />
-has been made In this area and we have also attended to other<br />
important issues in our society, and We will be doing more to<br />
improve industrial relations to foster business confidence,<br />
to aid the farming' commuity, to increase assistance to those<br />
who most require it, to protect further our basic civilI<br />
liberties, to bring about a more efficient Government, fully<br />
responsive to the needs of the people it is designed to serve.<br />
This is a great challenge one in which we need your wholehearted.:'*%.<br />
support. Let us make no mistake about it we can all be proud<br />
of the record of the-Government and the wide range of reforms<br />
which have been introduced. It is now up to all of us-to ensure-'--'..<br />
that the entire electorate is nade. fully aware of the<br />
significance of those reforms.<br />
I am sure I can count on your full support in this task. ITh~. I </p>
