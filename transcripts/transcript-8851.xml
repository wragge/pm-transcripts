PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
VISIT BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN<br />
I am pleased to announce that the first foreign head of government to visit<br />
Australia since the March election will be the Prime Minister of Japan,<br />
Mr Kiichl Miyazawa.<br />
Prime Minister Miyazawa will visit Canberra as guest of the Government fronm<br />
29 April to 1 May. His visit to Australia will be the first by a Japanese<br />
Prime Minister since that of Mr Noboru Takeshita In 1988.<br />
The visit will reaffirm the vitality and importance of the Australia-Japan<br />
partnership both bilaterally and in terms of our expanding consultation and<br />
cooperation in regional and international affairs. My discussions In Canberra<br />
with Prime Minister Miyazawa will build on the very productive dialogue we<br />
established during my visit to Japan last September.<br />
Australia and Japan share a range of important interests and perspectives as<br />
we each address an increasingly fluid strategic and trading environment In the<br />
Asia-Pacific region. With continuing delay In the conclusion of the<br />
Uruguay Round of negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and<br />
Trade, both countries have fundamental interests in maintaining an open and<br />
non-discriminatory multilateral trading system and In promoting open<br />
regionalism through the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC) process.<br />
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Miyazawa had Important discussions with<br />
President Clinton in Washington. In July the Japanese Government will host In<br />
Tokyo the annual G7 summit.<br />
My discussions with Prime Minister Mlyazawa will provide a valuable<br />
opportunity to exchange views on these important developments and to Identify<br />
areas where Australia and Japan should work towards shared objectives In the<br />
Asia-Pacific region.<br />
