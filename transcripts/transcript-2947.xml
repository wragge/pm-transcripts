Press Conference given by the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr<br />
E. G. Whitlan, at Vigyan Bhavan, New D-lhi, at 3.15 6 June<br />
1973 Prime Minister: Mr, D'Penha and ladies and sentleen: You alreatr<br />
have a copy of the conmunique that your Prime inister and I have<br />
issued, so I think I'll just invite you to ask questions of me forthwith.<br />
When I give my weekly press conference in Canberra, I start off with<br />
the decisions that the Cabinet has made that day. Then I have questions.<br />
Well, of course, I can't announce any Cabinet decisions, so we'll<br />
just have the questions.<br />
Mr. Virendra Mohan, Sir, you have been talkimn about creating<br />
a peace zone in the Indian Ocean and you want in play a leading part<br />
in that. Since Australia has so many militarj alliances with the<br />
Western countries, could you please explain how would the countries<br />
in this region establish the bona fides of Australia<br />
Prime Minister: The proposal for a zone of peace in the Indian<br />
Ocean came from Sri Lanka at the General Assembly of the United Nations<br />
in 1971. At that time, India supported the proposal. . IMy memory<br />
is that the then Australian Goverrment, our predecessors, did not.<br />
When the sane proposal cane up six months ago, ry Goverrment supported<br />
the proposal and, in particular, the new aspect-of it that there<br />
should be an ad hoc conmittee to examine and develop proposals for<br />
this zone of peace. And Australia, like India, was elected to<br />
that committee, that ad hoc conmittee. Accordingly, this was one<br />
of the things that your Prime Minister and Foreign Minister and I<br />
discussed because we not only belog to this ad hoc committee, but<br />
this year we both belong to the Security Council of the United<br />
Nations. Now, it's true that there are some military installations<br />
in Australia under agreements with the United States. There is<br />
one particular one at North West Cape in Australia, whose title<br />
describes where it is. Eut these at this stage are purely that<br />
the ad hoc committee is exanining, purely exploratory discussions<br />
and it wi? ; ake zome time, presumably, before a zone of peace can<br />
be achieved. But we want to play our part. I don't think I should<br />
accept your description we want to play a leading part. We want<br />
to play our part, full part, in seeing that any disarmament proposal<br />
which is available for support or ratification by the littoral<br />
and insular States in the Indian Ocean is supported or ratified. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
My Government has already ratified all such proposals and which<br />
are available up to this stage.<br />
Suresh, of Reuters: Are you comparing the situation why Australia<br />
would ask for the scrapping of installations in Australia<br />
Prime Mnister: The installation at North lVest Cape operates under<br />
an agreement which v,, as made 10 years ago for a space of 25 years<br />
if there is a treoat that extends until 1988. Our Minister for<br />
Defence is proposirg later this year to go to ; hc United States<br />
to seek modifications of that treaty, both as to the duration of<br />
it, and also as to the scope available to Australia under the treaty,<br />
to ascertain and ejprove the use of it.<br />
Chakravarty, from " The Iindustan Times": Would you, Sir, kindly<br />
explain really what this peace zone implies. Ebr one thing the<br />
assumption is that the big powers really are the naughty boys who<br />
come and create tension. As far as I know, none of the littoral<br />
States, including Australia, has really any naval force worth the<br />
task it will undertake, even for surveillance, much less to prevent<br />
the big powers from coming in. Now, how do you go about it<br />
Is it merely a wish depending upon the goodwill of the big powers,<br />
or just a self-satisfaction, or what is it really<br />
Prime Minister: Obviously, one can't have a zone of peace in<br />
the Indian Ocean unless the great powers, particularly those powers<br />
which have great raval forces, agree. Nevertheless, there can<br />
be quite a deal of suasion exercise on the great naval powers, none<br />
of which, of course, abut on the Indian Ocean. If all those nations<br />
who do abut on the Indian Ocean concert measures to dissuade them.<br />
This will take some time, but I am prepared to let bygones be bygones.<br />
Well, I don't think anybody should dispute the great power rivalry<br />
has been a cause of major tension and violence in the area between<br />
India and Australia, particularly in South-East Asia.<br />
Question: Mr. Sabarwal: Can there be a zone of peace in the<br />
Indian Ocean while the United States has military bases all over<br />
the region The seventh fleet is roaning about. It is being<br />
followed by the Soviet fleet. China is augmenting its naval<br />
power, so is Japan. So, it is just a wishful thinking<br />
don't you think so 3 </p>
<p>Prime Minister: There are fewer naval ships in the Indian Ocean<br />
thau in the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean, as I understand it. We<br />
certainly can agree not to promote naval rivalry in the Indian Ocean.<br />
I don't think one should exaggerate the size of the Soviet or the<br />
American fleets which roan the Indian Ocean.<br />
Swaninathan, " Deccan Herald": In the joint ccmmnaique it is stated<br />
that the Australian Prime Minister state d that ms Government<br />
not only intends to expand the present progranme of assistance<br />
engaged here, but has also given consideration to further changes<br />
in Australia's preferential trade with developing countries.<br />
Could you expand on this please<br />
PRIME MINISTE: I couldn't list any specific proposals at this<br />
stage. We were discussing many of these matters, the fields in which<br />
there can be co-operation between India and Australia. Iuich of<br />
the Australian interest in India, I gather, has been particularly<br />
effective and welcome because it is appropriate to the climate, to<br />
the pastoral, t) e agricultural situation of India. Australisns<br />
have developed, as you expect, skills in respect of dry land agriculture.<br />
They have participated in several stations with cattle and with<br />
sheep, I think to a certain extent with grains. We have also shared<br />
in the development of better varieties, more palatable, more nutritious<br />
varieties of bread and these are not inmense schemes they are not<br />
dramatic schemes, but they have gone on for quite some years and<br />
I have been gratified on this visit to hear the extent to which these<br />
schemes between Australia and India are appreciated by Indian inisters<br />
and officials. I have brought with me on this occasion Sir John<br />
Craford, who has had a long record in administrative and academic<br />
circles. He would, I suppose, have visited India more often than<br />
any top officialand he has had discussions with your Ministers and<br />
officials and I have also brought Mr McKay, who is the Permanent<br />
Head and Secretary of our Department of Overseas rade. So, while<br />
I would claim no great expertise in in these matters nmself, you<br />
will see that Sir John Crawford and Mr M( Kay's presence indicate<br />
that I want to involve the top experts available to my Government<br />
in arrangements ,' ith the Government of India. in these respects.<br />
NowasI can't list further schemes, I suppose that if you want to<br />
know more later, I can get some addresses or nases from the High<br />
Commissioner or his staff. But, nevertheless, the general scheme<br />
we want to develop is that Australians as individuals, coming </p>
<p>-4-<br />
from a country which has had may of these problems, a country<br />
which I think can be said is not so overbearirg economically, that<br />
it doesn't unders land the problems of India.<br />
Question: This momirg the Minister for Agriculture met you Sir.<br />
Did he discuss with you the food position in India and did he ask<br />
for anr assistance f= m your country<br />
Prime Minister: He discussed the food position in India, but he<br />
didn't ask for food assistance because as our : spresentatives in<br />
Delhi have made knovm, this last season has been a very bad one for<br />
Australia. We have no spare wheat, for instance, ourselves, nor<br />
I think ay spare rice. And we, in fact, wcre not able to fulfil<br />
some orders which were offered to us for wheat and rice. There are<br />
limitations in Australia on the number of acres, I think you call<br />
them hectates, which can be planted with such crops. But those<br />
limitations have been virtually lifted for this coming season.<br />
That means that we would expect, unless there is some weather reverse,<br />
to produce much more grain in the next season. That doesn't mean,<br />
however, that there can be ay wheat available before next Ibbruary,<br />
nor rice, I think, before next May.<br />
Bill Mann, Associated Press: You mentioned the possibility of<br />
renegotiatirg with the United States about the-communications station<br />
at North West Cape. Are these negotiations alreay in progress,<br />
or does your Goverment want to start such negotiations now<br />
Prime Minister: They have been initiated tmrough America's and<br />
Australia's diplomatr c representatives in their respective capitals,<br />
but there will be no negotiations until later in the year. I<br />
think I should say that the agreement which was made in 1963<br />
was one which America would not expect any coun-ry now to undertake<br />
and which, I an certain, no country now would undertake. But<br />
it is there until 1988. Its conditions are not satisfactory<br />
in the present clikate of international opinion. I don't want<br />
to pursue matters concernirg the United States and Australia when<br />
I an outside my own country. I don't want to go into any further<br />
detail on this subject. </p>
<p>Vinod Gupta. 3Samachar Bharati: Mr Prime inister, you had a<br />
discussion with our Lrime Minister on the situation in the sub-continent.<br />
What do you thil are the prospects of peace here and would you like<br />
to make an observation about the Pakistan move in the World Court<br />
or certain othor matters taken by Pakistan in the international<br />
conmunity to<br />
Prime Minister: I don't want to accept many invitations/ conment<br />
on relations betecen India and other countries because I've been at<br />
many places over the years where I know that relations between India<br />
and Pakistan have dominated discussions to the exclusion of most<br />
other matters. I an optimistic that the de facto situation of<br />
Bangla IDsh and Pakistan will now be accepted by Pakistan and by<br />
China. I would not only be naturally distressed, but I would be<br />
very much surprised if there was an outbreak of war again.<br />
Mukheree, The Times of India: Question not clear.<br />
Prime Minister: We have taken no steps to seek an invitation to<br />
attend the non-aligned conference at Algiers. If we are asked to<br />
attend, we shall accept that invitation. We would do so as an<br />
observer, because it can't be said that Australia is a non-aligned<br />
nation. To give you an exanple, however, of a cocntry which is<br />
very similar to Australia in most aspects which you like to contemplate,<br />
S Canada. Canada is not a non-aligned country, but it has, on occasion,<br />
accepted an invitation to attend the non-aligned conference as an<br />
observer. The idea about this cane two or three months ago when<br />
the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia after visiting India cane on to<br />
visit AusoTalia. Yugoslavia, India, Egypt, I think, were the<br />
original sponsors of the non-aligned conferences, the first beirg<br />
held in Belgrade back in the 1950s, and he mentioned this subject.<br />
We didn't seek an invitation, but we said tc him, as we have said<br />
when this matter has arisen since then, that if we receive an<br />
invitation, we shall accept it.<br />
Question: Sir, did you discuss this matter in your discussions<br />
here with Mrs Gmandhi<br />
Prime Minister: I forget whether it. I think that just about<br />
one sentence, I think it didn't occupy about as much time as I have </p>
<p>Uta1en<br />
in nsxerirg the question. Th . e fact is that wie are not a<br />
non-aligned country, but if we receive an invitationt to attend the<br />
conference as an observer, wie would accept it. But it cane up<br />
in the general context of the arrangemernts that each of our-countries<br />
has or is to have with other countries.<br />
Juestion: 0. idea of forming an -josociation of -Azian<br />
and Pacific countries &amp;, nd 1he general discussion here with the Prime<br />
Minister<br />
Prime Minister,. Not withttbe Prime Minister. ThLe Foreign Minister<br />
asked me wha L had iii mind in this regard and I told him that the<br />
matter proceeded no further than that. You will understand that<br />
while I was having direct discuissions with your 11inisters, and their<br />
advisers and my advisers were docidcd that we each sought the views<br />
of the other on matters which concerned either of us. It was an<br />
excellent opportunity to deal directly and, if niecessary, intensively<br />
with arW of thesq matters. Now you will appreciate that historically<br />
Australia has belonged to certain organisations they aren't correctly<br />
described as regional but, nevertheless, we have during the 1950s<br />
and 1960Is joined certain organisations. Perheps to heRlp you while<br />
we are all here tog, : tltlr, I were to go tln'ouglh-the. i The first was<br />
in 1951 when AustrnaJ a, New Zealand and the United Sitates formned<br />
the . ANZIJS treaty. Thbis was a week before there was the -peace treaty<br />
signed with Japan in-San P~ rancisco as part of the deal. And this<br />
* is a-treaty which a23-tl= Ie of us regard. as still relevant and<br />
valuable. After theP Gorzva Conference in 194 11cLanila. pact was<br />
drevim up and SEATOII vas formed as its instrument in aibout 1955.<br />
Eig6t nations belonged to i# not all of them, of courase, in th-e<br />
region. a-io df them have now withdrawn from the orgaisation<br />
Pdistan and Rc-ance.. Its objective was to contain China. That,<br />
of course, iu' d now 41&amp;' vto be a futile objective. I have said<br />
that the SEATO treaty is moribund. We haven't dom anything so<br />
dramatic as to withdraw frm it. But, io will rot tolerate anyw<br />
anti-Chinese aspe cts of it., It's already pulled its head<br />
The 1Manila. Pact may still1 have some residual virtues. . We are prepared<br />
to give it achano but not if it involves any -nti--Chinese containin~<br />

entirely negative. We just don't denounceO p ullbu of such<br />

military sense. There is at this stage only one regional<br />
organisation which has coherence and a fatare. That is ASI'AN,<br />
the Association of South East Asian Nations in-donesia. Singpore,<br />
Mlaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. "' PAN -wants to consolidate<br />
itself for exadn. It gives prort tonw mianbership by<br />
Bunna and the f'ou. r Indo-China States.<br />
Question: Question not clear.<br />
Prim Minister. I don' t subscribe to the idea.. The general<br />
principle is, of course, that the ships of any nation, whether they<br />
are merchant marine or Navy, can sail aihrwhere on the high seaw.<br />
Question: Rred iBridgeland, Reuters: Clearly as a result of your<br />
visit here, ti-ere has been intensification of finendship between<br />
India and Au. stralia. Bat what I a wondering at is has there<br />
F1or0 exmrple, India is vey keen on exporting its manzfactured<br />
prodd clts to other counries and I don't see in your commtunique<br />
that you speak of the desirabillity of secuxing greater diversifation<br />
of economic relat-ions. Have you made aTV ccxriutment to import,<br />
for example, Irhdian made engineerirg goods<br />
Prime Minister, I an not in a position to makce commitments in<br />
such particularitics. It is tnie, and I ' ielcome the op~ ortunity<br />
to say, that iThc-a is ixv a great industrial iation. India's<br />
ergineerirg is first class. I hope that othcr nations will realise<br />
how skilled and dependabl e India' s f actories .11, d wcikshops are in<br />
this regard. Aastral-ia, however, even more than. India has a mixed<br />
ecoom... There are a great number of activities in Australia<br />
industries wjhere the decisions to purcha~ se must be made by directors<br />
of companies. I would hope that this visit will alert people in<br />
Australia and in India to the fact that thore are more goods which<br />
we Can buy frm each other. Bat there is not a specific proposal<br />
in this regard. I think that somewhere else in the<br />
cormniqual~ h~ se about extending the axmE. anents which our<br />
predecesso~ rs initiated of giving, tariff preference for goods from<br />
developing countries. Yes, in paragraph 15 of t ' he conmunique you<br />
will see something that was deliberately put in ahd I thinkc it<br />
ywas an initiative by Australia and a tribute to our prededossors<br />
in office for havi t initiative..., and xv-, e would be happy to<br />
' I 0 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
extend it. We have discussed questions today th-ere was a reference<br />
in one of-L the earlier quest1-ions for extension of agricultural<br />
co-operation and th-1-en there were discussions between me aid-the<br />
ricultu-re and Coiicrce M. iister on., say, the wool industry and<br />
the iron ore industryw, particularly the exports. These are matters<br />
which ve di~ lnlt conclude today. I arn not t~ he relevant Minister<br />
in. these matters, -: a. ft1-ough it was verv us L or metU eryu<br />
Ministers on tlizse subjects. Rat mxy princip,, l public service<br />
advisers, as I : u, 7e ared, who axe here, w-id I thiik there is a<br />
chance of flo r t . esc thirgs up. I take the general view<br />
that any Govermen~ t, any enterprise should bear in ind that<br />
0India is not onlay the second lai-best nat~ i. on in the world in terms<br />
of population, but has, by comparative standards, a very stable and<br />
dia'ble set of inistitutions.<br />
Mrh. Suni: Mr Prime Minister, I'Im contin~ ing the smne question<br />
asked by ni -predoc -ssor. There has been a talkc of joint ventures<br />
between the two countries. -So far Australia's trade with India<br />
been of very small ard meagre...<br />
Cannot it be possible for us to get together also...<br />
Prime Minister. ' here is no plan at this stige, but I think you<br />
can be assured that there wjill be a consultation between India<br />
and Australia and some other inon ore cxportiJrg countries of these<br />
matters. Now, i don' t wiant to be tILI r ot suggesting<br />
for instaxme, the<br />
OPEC to the price and quantities at whi~ ch we will sell petrleun<br />
products to thirsty industrial counatries on either side of the<br />
North Atlantic. . qvn ot sugestirg that. 1hv-oi rrient is very<br />
mucL mare of * thce need to develop s~ mc resources policy. We<br />
rave a federali system in Australia as you do in India. . And,<br />
unifortunately, fCrLM the point of view of " w Govermnent, the<br />
arrargements which hazve been madc for the e~ c loitation, transportation<br />
and processing and sale of our minerals have beer. nmade<br />
by multi-national corporations under the anLspices of our State<br />
Goverrrents. The State Governments have f allon.<br />
My Govermnent ha,-been in just for six months and I would imagine<br />
.6 </p>
<p>10<br />
that in the sense o~ f resources, our greatest achievement has<br />
been to transform the practices with respect to these very valuable<br />
natural resources. We are now settin~ g up a Federal ' Pipeline<br />
Authority for the natural gas in Australia. W,' e have applied to<br />
all minerals what hidtherto had been applied to some minerals only<br />
mainliy an export -programe, sc that the contracts which are made<br />
from now on for the export of our minerals w,. 1 lbe<br />
a1pproved on a nati-onal basis. ile have renegotiated the agreements<br />
for the sale of Australian iron ore to Japan, wh ich had been made<br />
in U. S. dollar These required renegotiation since just befone<br />
Christmas we , z~ valucd the kust -ii an dollar aEgainst the U. S. dollar<br />
a-d then, four months ago, the U. S. dollIar was devalued by its<br />
Government. So, we have renegotiated those ogain and then, lastly,<br />
we have made arements to assert the national juuisdiction<br />
over the continental shelf and the seabed aTO he resources of<br />
them below and beyond the low-water mrk~. Our States have found<br />
this far too revolutionary an idea. They are going of f to London<br />
at the moment asking the British Govermnent to save them from the<br />
Australian national Goverrment.<br />
aiestion: Question not clear. WhyV is the comnunique shy<br />
o f nanixg<br />
Prime Minister: T-rmce is not the only country. which carrim* es out<br />
nuclear tests in -the atmospht-ere. China a-so ccarries them out.<br />
* Australia has tdcon proceedings againrst Rraico and not aigainst China<br />
in the International Curt of Justice becauSe Prance is China is<br />
not a party to the statute of t.. e Iternational Court of justice<br />
and because France is Chiina is not a p,-xty to the 1928<br />
for the peaceful settlement of internatiornal dis putes. Australia<br />
has, thereforep asked the Court to rule that this international<br />
dispute between. signatories to the 1928 Genox'al Act falls within.<br />
the jurisdiction of the World Court. We can't ta-ke those proceedings<br />
against China because it is not a party to . Act.<br />
Qaestion: Mr li'ine Minister, I'm told that your Govermient is<br />
reviewing your relations with U. K. Am-you adopting a more radical<br />
Spolicy. Had you any discussions with India haiving joint moves<br />
. in-the Conronwealth? </p>
<p>Prime linister: No, No, there have been no suggestions, no discussion<br />
on this aspect. I'm not quite sure that I get the intention behind<br />
your question, the drift of it. As for the Comornmealth, myr Goverrment<br />
lays great stress upon it because more than half the members of<br />
the Comonorelth are around or in the Indian Ocean and the South<br />
Pacific Ocean, the two Oceans which wash Australia's-shores. The<br />
Comnmormealth thus provides a natural forum witiin which Australia<br />
and all these oti,, er countries can discuss ary matters at all. You<br />
scarcely would find such a diverse set of natioris economically and<br />
politically as there are in the Ccmmoraealth, but the discussions<br />
which takce place between them in in that frnework are much moie<br />
tolerant, patient, than take place between such diverse nations in<br />
any other circumstances. Now that being between<br />
SAustralia and Britain. There are two particular matters where<br />
we want to make a change. We still have God Save the Queen as<br />
our National Anthem and, particularly, among younger people who are<br />
interested in sporting events and so on, they find this is a matter<br />
of shame or at least ridicule that if any of our people win an<br />
international event, the British National Anthem is played to<br />
conmmemorate the occasion. And we are holdirg a competition to<br />
devise a National Anthem of our own. Now this is scarcely a<br />
revolutionary idea. It should have happened ages ago. Australia<br />
really is one of the oldest States in the world. Now, we have<br />
had independence throughout this century. Ve still kept on this<br />
relic. There is another thirng that we want to charge. I told<br />
you that we are a federal system and it is still possible for litigants<br />
to take their disputes in appeal from the Supreme Courts of our<br />
States to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London.<br />
It is, of course, absurd that citizens of axy country can litigate<br />
their differences before a court sitting in another country,<br />
composed of Judges appointed by the Goverment of that other<br />
country and giving judgements in the for of advice to the head<br />
of State of that other country. The Judicial Committee of the<br />
Privy Council delivers judgements which are advice to the Queen<br />
of the United Kingdom, not to the Queen of Australia. ell, this<br />
is a matter which we are aiming to alter. I an embarrassed and also<br />
I an ashaned because it find it more ludicrous than anything else,<br />
but the Australian States are now asking the British Goverrment<br />
to keep thie Privy Council to save them from Australia's own courts. I have<br />
ro doubt Australia's Judges are not amused.. You must bear with<br />
it these colonial hangovers. Now, inidentally, the title<br />
.12 </p>
<p>of -the Queern in Australia has been for the last 20 years, Elizabeth<br />
II, by the grace of God, of the United Kingdom, Autralia and her<br />
ortehlem s nd errtories Queen, head ofO the Corrmomealth, Defender<br />
of the Faith. Now. over Easter it was arranged betwveen us that<br />
the title should now be and there is an Act before our Parliament<br />
to ratify this, Elizabeth II, by the Grace of God, Queen of Australia<br />
and other rea1xns a~ nd territories, head of -the Corrmomealth. The<br />
Queen positively vielcomes being described as 4. ieen of Australia,<br />
instead of Queen of the United Kingdom, Australia, Ctc. She<br />
positively welcomes t'hat and there is no Oisagrecnent about dropping<br />
the title Defender the Faith, which has no histrnica. or<br />
constitutional validity, in Australia. We are a separate country<br />
from Britain. ' We cire an entirely independent country. Vie have<br />
. the same head of State, but the head of State f-unctions are carried<br />
out by the Governor-Gcneral, who is nominated by the Queen on the<br />
advice of the Auntraliaxi Governuent and now it will aways be an<br />
Australian citizenw; ho is the Govenro-General.<br />
Q2estion: Ame you convinced that Britain is interested in the<br />
Conioiveth<br />
Prim Minister: Britain is no longer obsessed o~ ith the Cormon--<br />
wealh. tplrce much emphasis on it.. 4k<br />
but that doesn't moa , the other members: of the iCbnmealth shouldn't<br />
place emphasis on tvit. There would be relations betw4een Australia<br />
and Britain whether there was still a CoiMovelth or not, or whether<br />
Britain and Australia v-, ere both or either in the Commrorealth or<br />
mot. I value the Conhiomealth particularly because as I say it is<br />
verywid-) read and a tolert'nt oiiganisation to vh]~ i: 1ch so ma. V<br />
States within Austr-alia's general environnent belong. I believe<br />
there is value for us in this connection.<br />
Mr Raghavan, P. T. AMr Prime Mfiister, what is the position<br />
of the Asian-Pacific Association..... . Is it correct to assume that<br />
you am' not having in mind any security arrangements as such or wV<br />
security ideas and if it is an organisation that you are envisaging<br />
like the Organisation of Africani Unity or the Oiganisation of<br />
American States In the United Nations itself Australia is<br />
clubbed together with the West European countries, or you plan<br />
to have some changes in this direction<br />
( I 3 </p>
<p>Prime Minister: I certainly wouldn't envisage that any arrangements<br />
which are made in the Western Pacific or South-East Asia<br />
would have any military connotations. I wouldn't wish it. I<br />
would think it quite unrealistic to expect them even if I did wish<br />
thm. Australia; Canada and Iew Zealand, I thirk, are grouped<br />
with the Western XEropean nations for the purpose of filling the<br />
vacancies on the Security Council and on the verious organs of the<br />
United Nations. It's purely a voting pattern, purely for electoral<br />
purposes. There is no ideological.......<br />
It's just for electoral purposes. And<br />
in that group don't get together, as I understand it, to have<br />
political discussions cr to caucus on decisions they will take.<br />
I take this opportunity of saying that I have made it plain to our<br />
0 representatives in the United Nations that from now on they are not<br />
only to ascertain what the intentions on any resolution are by<br />
Britain and America. I also want to be inforned what compary we<br />
will be in in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. To give examples,<br />
I don't say that this is exhaustive. I want my officers to advise<br />
me always what they believe the coting intentions will be of<br />
Canada, Japan, Indonesia, India and some of the African countries,<br />
for example Tanzania. I find it quite objectionable that so often<br />
in the past Australia found herself voting on the other side to<br />
all her neighbours, including all the Commonvealth countries in the<br />
Indian Ocean. I thirk this is irrational. I , think it is counterproductive.<br />
It doesn't mean that one disregards on how Britain<br />
and America are going to vote, but they are not the only people to<br />
whose vote one will pay regard. There can be instances where<br />
the interests of 3ritain or America may diverge from those of<br />
Australia. And, of course, there can be instances where the<br />
interests of India and Australia can diverge. The main thing<br />
is, however, that we should at least understand what each of<br />
us has in mind, wihat wve regard as our interests.<br />
Question: Question not clear relates to the massive anns<br />
deal concluded with KLuwait, Saudi Arabia, Iran. oIn't you think<br />
redkless and irresponsible<br />
Prime Ministor: I have really only discussed these matters<br />
in any degree...... this week and I wouldn't like to express a<br />
view on the short and shallow opportunity I have so far had<br />
i 14 </p>
<p>14<br />
to discuss the matter. The Persian Gulf is very obviously now<br />
in every sense the Persian Gulf and these sJa 1 States around the<br />
Gulf with a total population of, I think, only 200,000, have very<br />
great oil reveues and they are able to establish very considerable<br />
air forces. I thirk they are only 1fighter crcraft, but I really<br />
should look in to this more before expressing a view upon it. Iran<br />
is a nation of considerable opulation and, in some respects, of<br />
very great resoirccU: s a. nd it also has as i ts head of State an experienced<br />
and determined man. WAe,/. one looks at any strategic<br />
situation, one obviously has to have regard to the cohesion of the<br />
nations concerned. But tire fact that Iran, one of the oldest nations<br />
in the world, is now developirg a degree of cohesion in international<br />
significance is a matter which doesn't worrj me. I would expect<br />
that a nation o: f that location, of that history, of that population,<br />
would develop significance.<br />
