FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 44/ 1969<br />
MILITARY EQUIPMENT FOR MALAYSIA<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Government has agreed to provide the additional<br />
military equipment recently asked for by the Malaysian Government.<br />
The supplies requested are of a type already being<br />
provided to Malaysia under the existing Defence Aid Programme,<br />
and include rifles, communication equipment, life jackets and<br />
small boats for patrolling inland waterways.<br />
Supply of the equipment accords with our policy of<br />
helping the Malaysian Government to build up its own armed forces<br />
and it will be charged against the funds already provided by<br />
Parliament for the Defence Aid Programme.<br />
